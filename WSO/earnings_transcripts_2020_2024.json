        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Watsco Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Albert Nahmad, CEO. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning everyone. Hope everyone is healthy and safe. And welcome to Watsco\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO and with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Executive Vice President; and Barry Logan, also Executive Vice President. Now as we normally do, before we start here\u2019s our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Now onto our financial report. Watsco produced another record year, with sales, net income and earnings per share reaching record levels. We generated record cash flow of $534 million during the year, well in excess of our goal of generating cash flow greater than net income. This further strengthened our balance sheet, which is now debt-free and provides us the capacity to make almost any size investment to grow our business. We also announced this morning a 10% increase in our annual dividend to $7.80 per share. That reflects our confidence in our business. 2020 results were driven by steady growth with market share gains in our U.S. residential HVAC equipment business, which grew 10% for the year and 17% during the fourth quarter. Homeowners continue to invest in their homes as replacement sales at higher efficiencies remain strong from early summer through today. Looking long term, we see opportunity to be a significant participant and contributor in efforts to address climate change. Sales of high-efficiency products have long been a component of our business and have grown steadily in our sales mix over the past decade. This is an interesting data point. there are over 110 million installed HVAC systems in the United States, many of which are operating under old efficiency standards that resulted for the user in higher energy use and cost to them. It's important to note, we will explore and evaluate impactful opportunities to make progress in our marketplace. We believe the combination of Watsco's technology platforms, industry leading scale, access to capital, customer relationships and unrivaled OEM relationships provide a strong foundation and long-term benefit for all stakeholders involved. We also continue to invest in our industry-leading technology platforms, leading to greater adoption, new customer acquisition and market share gains. User growth on Watsco's e-commerce platform, a good indicator of overall tech adoption, was up 20% during 2020. This is important as sales growth rates for customers that are active users outpace growth rates of non-users. Also, customer attrition among active users is a fraction of non-users, another good indicator of effectiveness. Now some more detailed examples of our progress. Weekly users of our mobile apps increased 27% in 2020, with over 120,000 downloads. The number of e-commerce transactions grew 20% this year to 1.2 million online orders. Our annualized e-commerce sales run rate is 33% versus 31% at the end of last year. In certain markets, it's over 50%. Our curbside or dockside pickup services expanded to more locations and now includes no-contact payment functionality. The technology has only been available since this summer, and already over 22,000 orders were fulfilled by more than 3,000 unique users. Two of our newer innovative platforms gained momentum in 2020. We call them, OnCall Air and Credit-For-Comfort. These platforms help digitize the relationship between contractors and homeowners when buying and financing replacement HVAC systems. OnCall Air is growing exponentially. Contract has provided digital proposals to over 109,000 hospitals using the tool during last year and generated nearly $350 million in gross merchandise value for our customers, an 89% increase over last year. And Credit-For-Comfort processed 40% more digital financing applications in 2020 versus 2019, resulting in more than 180% increase in third-party funded loans. This tool helps homeowners afford much needed HVAC systems. Investments in inventory management software have also benefited the company yielding lower inventory, improved returns and contributing to our record cash flow and operating efficiency. These examples are exciting, and we believe it's still early in terms of reaching the full potential of our technology investments. As always, feel free to schedule a Zoom call with us, and we can further explain our technology and its progress. Now one very important thought as we -- in these prepared remarks. Our 2020 results are a testament to the efforts of our valued employees across the Watsco network. We deeply appreciate their commitment. With that, A.J., Paul, Barry and I are happy to answer your questions. Elizabeth?\nOperator:\nA - Albert Nahmad: Good morning, Stephen.\nStephen Volkmann: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe just to kick off, I mean, obviously, 2020 was an extraordinary year in lots of ways, in terms of the stay-at-home spending and your market share gains and improvements in e-commerce, etcetera. But of course, that sets us up for what is potentially a difficult comparison in 2021, especially, as the year progresses. So I'm wondering, Al, maybe you can give us your thoughts about how you think the market will kind of be unveiled in 2021 relative to the opportunities for continued growth?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I'll start with an answer, and then I'll turn to Paul Johnston to talk about the industry. I'll talk about ourselves. I think that we will -- we are set up to continue to grow over a number of years. We've talked about technology adoption. We've talked about our financial strength, which allows us to continue our active M&A program. We have a lot of things we can do to continue our growth, regardless of what happens to the industry, and we feel very confident in that statement. Paul, you want to talk about the market, next...\nPaul Johnston: Yes. Yes, the market in 2021, it's tough to make a comparison, obviously, to 2020 because we had so many ups and downs and ebbs and flows and inventory issues and such. However, I think it's fair to say that the industry will remain strong during the year. New construction remains strong. Replacement demand, we're still seeing that following through with where we ended last year or beginning this year on the right footing. I think there's another phenomenon out there that's helping and changing the replacement dynamics. And that is, we're seeing homeowners stay in their homes for longer periods, and I don't mean because of the pandemic. I mean they're not flipping houses as they were in the early 2000s. We're seeing them stay in their homes 13, 14 years, which is a good indicator that when something does happen to your air conditioning system, you're probably going to replace it as opposed to repair it. You'd have more of a tendency to repair if you are planning to sell your home. So I'm bullish on that. Secondly, I'm also bullish on the idea that we have markets where we have very good market share, and we have markets where our market share isn't as high as we think it should be. So we still have market share gains that we're striving for and going for. And we have great partners working with us on the OEM side to help make that happen.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good, Paul.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay. And my house is -- we're going on year 20, actually. So I get your point. Quick follow-up, if I could. I was really surprised by the inventory levels. You guys just did a really good job of keeping that under wraps as we ended the year. And I'm curious whether that's just more the strong demand in the industry, and you might have even preferred to have them a little higher? Or is that actually kind of the new normal with all the information technology kind of benefits that you've added to your inventory management.\nAlbert Nahmad: That's a great question. Let me turn to A.J. for the answer.\nAaron Nahmad: Sure. It's a combination of all of the above. There were supply chain constraints in the industry. There was strong demand. And our technology enabled us to fill customer orders and take market share and show sales growth in that environment as well as it gave us new insight and tools to attack what we call non-performing inventory. Inventory that's probably been in our shelves for too long. So with more detail and more talent focused on it, we were able to move some of that old product out of the network as well. So it's a mix and a confluence of all three factors. And certainly, those efforts are going to continue going into 2021 and beyond.\nPaul Johnston: If I could add -- I have one more thing to that, and that is, A.J. did a great job of not only getting the technology that we needed with the system side of it. So we had a visibility all the way through to what the inventory should be. But also, we were able to, fortunately, for us, before the pandemic, add people from different walks of life in the purchasing in the inventory management systems. People from retail, from different commodities mixed in with our group of people that knew the HVAC industry. So I think it bode well once we got into the pandemic that our people had varied backgrounds and capabilities, and we're able to work hand in glove with our OEMs and our other suppliers to make sure that we had a proper cadence with inventory receives.\nAaron Nahmad: You're so right, Paul...\nBarry Logan: And I...\nAaron Nahmad: We -- sorry, Barry. You're so right, Paul. We use technology as really shorthand. It's really people, process and technology. Technology just enables great people to put in great processes and create change and increase profitability.\nBarry Logan: Yes. I'll just add a layer of numbers to it. The reduction year-over-year was around $120 million, which is pretty astounding number. And I think part of the question is, how much of that is temporary versus permanent, right?\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes.\nBarry Logan: We had to kind of cut through the conversations on and more than -- well more than half, I would say, it's permanent reduction from the point of view of technology and recalibrating how our stores actually operate and stock products and new order products with finished products. So certainly more than half and is, I would call it, a permanent reduction.\nStephen Volkmann: That's perfect. Thank you, guys.\nAlbert Nahmad: Sure.\nOperator: The next question is from David Manthey of Baird. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hi, David.\nDavid Manthey: Hey, good morning. Hi, guys.\nAlbert Nahmad: I hope it's not too cold where you are.\nDavid Manthey: No. In Tampa, Al\nAlbert Nahmad: For the Super Bowl.\nDavid Manthey: We're absolutely fine. Actually, a little warm yesterday in the 80. But as always, hoping you can disaggregate the organic equipment growth, units versus price/mix there? And then your outlook for 2021 as it relates to pricing?\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry, do you want to take a shot?\nBarryLogan: Sure. Well, Dave, first, if you look at the full year, which I think is a responsible way to look at it, the potential business up 10%, almost all unit growth, very little price, if any, a slight benefit on mix, mostly unit growth this year. And for the quarter again, I would say, a very similar circumstance, almost all unit growth, almost no price and a slight amount of mix benefit.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. And with copper and steel and everything being up, should we expect that 2021, we could actually see a positive impact there?\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: Well, there are two groups in that discussion. There's what the OEMs make products and what their cost inputs are, right? So almost all the OEMs already announced pricing actions, price increases for 2021. And that will flow through the inventory cycle and into the season this year. So I don't think we're ready to call it. It's a crystal ball, but there has been pricing announced, and we'll see how that fits through the market this year. We do sell non-equipment products that consist of metals, right? And there is inflation going on in that, and those prices have been increasing and accounts for some of the fourth quarter's benefit that you see in the nonequipment growth, while you're more encyclopedic than me about that, but I think it's some helpful price increases heading into 2021.\nAlbert Nahmad: Correct.\nDavid Manthey: Got it. Okay. And just to stay on that theme of the other HVAC products, assuming there was some volume there, I know you had a major initiative that you're working on and I'm assuming that some of that growth was early returns from that program. Could you just talk about the trends that you're seeing and the early returns from the initiative relative to other HVAC products?\nAlbert Nahmad: I guess we can take a shot at it, Paul -- with that picture.\nA - Paul Johnston: Yes. I don't think a lot of it was from the early parts of our initiative. I just think a lot of it was a little bit of pent-up demand with some of the equipment spotting that we had, that equipment wasn't available. So people had to repair their product. Had to repair a furnace. That's been probably the tightest market for everybody right now. As far as price increases, a lot of the steel and copper prices that Barry mentioned, did occur in the fourth quarter. They had a benefit, but really not material in the overall scheme of Watsco's revenues for the quarter. I think more of that is going to bleed into perhaps in the first and second quarter of this year. We'll have a better idea for what's going to happen price-wise with those commodities.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you, alright. Thanks for the update, guys.\nAlbert Nahmad: Sure.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeffrey Hammond: Just on the -- good color on the U.S. res HVAC. Can you just kind of update us on, whether it be the quarter or full year, what you saw from the businesses outside the U.S., which still seem to be a headwind? And then just commercial trends 4Q and into 2021?\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: Jeff, well first, the U.S. market, we speak to that pretty directly in the press release. Our other international -- we have international businesses really split into two other markets, Canada, which actually looked a lot like the United States at the end of the day. A good market, commercial market, underperforming residential, but on whole, Canada grew its sales and profits in 2020. And certainly is Latin America, that's where in our Latin American business, which we do publish in our 10-K, you can look -- glean some data from it. That's mostly a commercial business, and that's the business that went down in sales and profits this year, probably to the tune of about $0.20 a share, if I look at the full year. So when we speak about our results, again, put a placeholder for Latin America, which we expect a recovery this year and after costing us about $0.20 this year. Again, largely a commercial market. And like you're seeing in everyone's discussion, commercial market is improving, but still lagging. And 2021 could be a year of recovery that can have some benefit. We'll wait and see it and talk about it as it happens, but that give you a sense of 2020.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the SG&A line, can you just talk about maybe puts and takes as you think about that into 2021? Certainly good incrementals, very good incrementals in the back half. But it seems like a lot of companies tamped down costs in 2Q and then demand kind of came back quickly. So just how are you thinking some of those tamp down costs or temp costs start to come back and impact SG&A?\nAlbert Nahmad: Go ahead, Barry.\nBarry Logan: Yes. Again, three factors, I think, in the answer, Jeff to kind of unbundle it. So 2020, you're right, an early spring reaction to all the knives that were falling helping with cost reduction and provoking cost reduction for good reasons. Second was interesting, the need to deal with double-digit demand thereafter for the next eight months. So certainly, some costs needed to conduct clear equation as 2020 played out. And then third, technology. What did we do, can we do, can we continue to do relative to technology, which is kind of the whole, outcomes of technology is to improve cost. Especially we should see gain of all the technology that's intended in that. So that's nice in abstract answer. If I look at 2021, I would say this, half of our SG&A are people. And commission growth, growth in incentive pay, we want that to happen. We would expect that to happen next year. And so with the SG&A increases, for example, in that category. Rent, which is about 15% of SG&A is, I think, flat this year. That's an accomplishment. Our teams went to landlords and dealt with the realities of what was going on in the market and this year's rent is flat. Well, that was otherwise intended to are likely to increase. I think some of those savings will be kept and sustained into next year. So if I try to summarize it without another 10 minutes of explanation, we would see some SG&A growth next year, just in the realities of what happened in 2020. We are making investments in our distribution network in 2021 with people and locations. And we see the opportunity. We have really OEM partnership in many of those efforts, and we're going to go out and expand our network some next year, and there'll be some SG&A growth for that. Otherwise, technology will help pinch those increases. And again, I would expect not the same performance but a moderate increase next year.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. Thanks for the call, guys\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Dankert of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Chris.\nChristopher Dankert: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just kind of looking into 2021, I mean, great, great performance on the gross margin in the back half of 2020. Definitely got things stabilized. I guess, Latin America is a moving piece. I know there's some mix dynamics going on, but how do we think about gross margin into the new year? Just any puts and takes you'd call out anything to kind of bear in mind besides just the typical price/volume mix?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, it's something that we're focused on. And whatever improvements you saw this year or last year, I should say, we continue to believe this year will show improvement as well because of our focus and because of the ability to do something about it through our own internal systems and approach to the marketplace.\nChristopher Dankert: I do assume Latin America was a piece of kind of what the headwind was kind of late 2019, early 2020, though?\nAlbert Nahmad: 2019, 2020? Barry, if you understand that, go ahead and answer.\nBarry Logan: Yes. Go ahead. Ask your question again. So what's the -- what are you getting to?\nChristopher Dankert: Yes. Sorry. So I think gross margin is kind of on a year-over-year basis in the latter half of 2019, early half of 2020. We're facing some year-over-year headwinds. I'm just curious how much Latin America was playing a role in that gross margin decline earlier in 2020?\nBarry Logan: Oh no, not at all. The margins internationally look like the U.S. margins -- gross margin. So there's no algebra that affects the mix of -- in some sort. It's really the blocking and tackling of getting pricing in the market. It's technology. There's a big pricing initiative going on to improve how we price our products go to market. And we talked earlier about inflation. And there's a lack of inflation in 2020. The opportunity inflation might help. We'll see. We don't know, until we get into the season. But those are the larger moving pieces.\nChristopher Dankert: Got it. Got it. All right. And then I guess, something we haven't touched on lately. Just any update on Russell Sigler, either in terms of investments being made there, kind of what's required in terms of investments? The likelihood of kind of further consolidation of ownership? Just anything you can share there would be great.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, we can't share much. We're in a minority position, and we're very supportive of anything they want from us. And that's all I can say. We don't -- we have no idea what their intentions are in terms of divesting more ownership.\nChristopher Dankert: Yes. Even in terms of -- I mean, how are they pulling on some of the technology tools? Are they fully integrated in terms of how they can use OnCall Air, that type of thing?\nAlbert Nahmad: What we can tell you is that we're very pleased with their performance. All Across\nChristopher Dankert: Understood.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes.\nChristopher Dankert: Thanks so much, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprague: Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for the questions. I guess maybe somewhat following up on that last point. I just wonder if you could speak a little bit to what you are seeing in potential M&A landscape. And I imagine there's a little bit of tug of war. Business is good. So perhaps people aren't eager to sell, but by the same token, it does seem like the technology changes maybe are kind of increasing the pressure on some of the smaller guys. So just the state of play there? Should we expect other M&A to happen in 2021? Maybe some color on the activity in your pipeline?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I'll make a general statement and then Barry, who leads our M&A, can provide more information. Watsco is an acquirer. And as part of our overall strategy, we have a $5 billion revenue in the $40 billion industry. So our share has a lot of room to grow. And we use our balance sheet to support M&A. And we are active, and we do think there's no promise, but we do think we'll have M&A this year. And I do think that the reputation for our culture, we're a different kind of an acquirer. We're not disruptive, we're supportive. And all the other things that we add, the capital, the equity for the key people in the organization, our 401k, which is -- our donations are in Watsco shares. That sort of thing is culturally attractive, I believe. And as I said, lots of opportunities since we're only $5 billion out of the $40 billion. And now some of them are very small, but it doesn't matter to us. We just try to bring in people that want to continue working and continuing building what they have with our support. And Barry?\nBarry Logan: Yes, Jeff. Just first, Jeff, welcome back. Yes, two things I take to remind everyone of is, the focus of M&A is kind of the regional superpower businesses that are in this industry. We're not attempting to roll up a fragmented industry. We're focused on the largest of targets that will drive growth and share and then platforms to build on and invest in. The second, big picture fundamental is, we would rather invest in businesses when they're growing and reaching greater strength, we'll not turnaround experts, we're not looking for a dip in the market to buy. We're looking to invest in strengthening businesses. So I think this environment after everyone has been through a lot this year, net-net is stronger now than it was a year ago. So I would say that presents us opportunity and certainly gives us confidence in where the good businesses are. But having said that, for 2021 I'll never be able to predict a thing, other than to say some of the targets that were technology discussions were the reason for the discussion. Along with performance, I think that rekindling of that effort can happen now that we're through some of the weirdness and again, the foundations are stronger today than they were a year ago. So I would expect some great conversation. Whether there's great transactions or not, is still to be seen, but...\nAlbert Nahmad: There's got to be a great transaction, Barry. Good answer. We're very optimistic about that. No guarantees, but we're very optimistic.\nJeffrey Sprague: Very well. Thanks for that color and good to be back on the beep, Barry. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Go on, Steve.\nCharles Tusa: Hi, guys. How is it going?\nAlbert Nahmad: Doing good. Come visit.\nCharles Tusa: I'd love to. It's a little snowy up here. Question for you on Carrier said their backlog in residential was up three times year-over-year. Backlog is not typically the type of thing we talk about in residential, especially not in December. Did you guys get out in front of some of these price increases or availability concerns and order a bunch, that they'll deliver to you guys in the first half here?\nAlbert Nahmad: What a question. Who wants to volunteer for that answer?\nPaul Johnston: I will. It's -- no, we did not do huge pre-buys. We did several buys just to make sure that we were refilling the inventory that we lost though we still had a deficit in. Very selective. One thing that we did during the entire pandemic is, even when everybody else was canceling orders, we maintained the cadence of putting in orders and maintained our order board throughout the entire pandemic. And so we really didn't -- we had shortages, yes, but we didn't have these yoyo type inventory movements like a lot of people did. So we feel like, we finished the year in good shape on inventory. Yes, we have a concern going into 2021, that we'll be able to maintain that status. But we're working diligently with our OEMs on a daily and weekly basis to make sure that we're getting the fulfilment we need on what we have on order.\nCharles Tusa: Yes. I guess that wouldn't be an inventory, right? If there was backlog for them, that's something they would kind of shift to you guys in the first half or whatever? So I mean, are they -- it's kind of unusual that you'd be allowed to just kind of like place a paper order and get terms and they would essentially be holding whatever what they have or finished goods they have. So none of that activity?\nPaul Johnston: Like I said, we've got our orders -- we put our orders in the way we always have. We have a pre-buy, like we always do. We're not trying to be unusual here. Most of the manufacturers, I think, continued building product during the offseason, where they normally would have shutdowns. I think that was pretty much universal across the OEMs.\nCharles Tusa: Did you -- speaking of the OEMS, I think it's pretty clear that Goodman lost some share, whether it was their fault or not. Are you seeing any kind of -- do you expect any kind of swings? I mean you pretty much serve them all. So it's not like it's a negative or a positive for you guys either way. Do you see any kind of swings back this year between the guys that kind of won and lost in 2020?\nPaul Johnston: I guess that's an hundred dollar question that everybody has. Will the dealers go back to the brands that they first worked -- that they were loyal to, that they couldn't get availability or they lost and they went to other brands. And I guess that's what everybody's marketing plans are all about. It has been able to maintain share gains that they picked up in prior year.\nCharles Tusa: And then one -- just one last one. I've noticed Goodman's acquiring a few distributors recently. I think it's been selective and mostly around their Daikin brand. And we also understand Ferguson is kind of looking to be a bit more aggressive here. They put out some pretty publicly aggressive targets. Anything you've noticed on kind of around the block, if you will, about a little bit of an increase in competition?\nAlbert Nahmad: Competition is always strong. And the one you mentioned and others, it's a very fragmented industry that we think we have advantages that others don't have. And we've had that for a number of years as evidenced by the growth that we've had. I don't see any reason why that's not going to continue. I think we're actually getting stronger. I'm more optimistic about the future than anything we've done in the past. We're on a roll.\nCharles Tusa: Right. Clearly, the digital stuff has worked out for you guys. So congrats on that.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. It has. And it's just beginning.\nAaron Nahmad: This is A.J. Going back a question to the market share, which ties right into what the conversation was now is that, we saw huge new growth and new customers buying from the Watsco Company, which is exciting. And at the same time, we're seeing all-time low attrition rate of customers. So I think what that tells you is that customers are finding -- it's very good to buy product in the Watsco companies. We're good partners to these contractors as we try to make it easy for them to do business with us, we try to help them grow their businesses, and that's getting more and more valued and appreciated.\nCharles Tusa: Right. It sounds like A.J. is up for a raise, Al. So\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I agree with that.\nCharles Tusa: Thanks, guys, appreciate it.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good to talk to you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes -- is a follow-up from Chris Dankert of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Dankert: Hi, Chris. Just one more from me. I guess we talked about your inventory, OEM inventory, let's go down one level. I mean what are you seeing at the customer level? I mean are they still stocking a bit more than normal, still kind of skittish about being able to get product on time? Just what are you hearing back from customers and what their inventory position looks like?\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul, why don't you take that?\nPaul Johnston: Yes. It's -- most of the dealers and contractors we do business with, really don't maintain any inventory, just base inventory in parts and supplies. So that really isn't an issue. Some of the larger contractors do carry some inventory, but it's -- they really rely on the most part, the industry relies on the distributor's supply inventory. Do we think there are some contractors who may have been concerned about the shortages of last year and they're trying to put some inventory in place? Yes, I think there is some of that happening. To what extent? I really wouldn't have a read on that right now.\nAlbert Nahmad: And it also remains true. The vast majority of our customers rely on us for their inventory.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. That's right.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. I mean an example, we have 100 business units that we call Baker is probably pushing $1 billion in terms of revenue as part of Watsco. I would say 99.9% of what they sell today was ordered within the last six hours. None of their customers are out, talking, drawing from inventory and replenishing with us. If I said de minimis, that's overstating it. Some of them...\nPaul Johnston: That's 95% of the market. I mean dealers carry motors and ambassadors and some line set, some copper tubing, refrigerant, but generally not equipment.\nChristopher Dankert: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, thanks for listening, and I'll talk to A.J. about his raise. We appreciate your interest. I just want to give you the confidence level that I have, that we're really on a roll here. I think we're very strong and going to get stronger. I think business is solid at the start of the year. And I hope that continues. And take us up on our offer; call us about learning more about the technology initiative. It's a game changer. And other than that, I wish you all to stay safe and stay healthy, and we'll talk at the next quarter. Bye-bye now.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "And I... Yes. I'll just add a layer of numbers to it. The reduction year-over-year was around $120 million, which is pretty astounding number. And I think part of the question is, how much of that is temporary versus permanent, right? We had to kind of cut through the conversations on and more than -- well more than half, I would say, it's permanent reduction from the point of view of technology and recalibrating how our stores actually operate and stock products and new order products with finished products. So certainly more than half and is, I would call it, a permanent reduction. Sure. Well, Dave, first, if you look at the full year, which I think is a responsible way to look at it, the potential business up 10%, almost all unit growth, very little price, if any, a slight benefit on mix, mostly unit growth this year. And for the quarter again, I would say, a very similar circumstance, almost all unit growth, almost no price and a slight amount of mix benefit. Well, there are two groups in that discussion. There's what the OEMs make products and what their cost inputs are, right? So almost all the OEMs already announced pricing actions, price increases for 2021. And that will flow through the inventory cycle and into the season this year. So I don't think we're ready to call it. It's a crystal ball, but there has been pricing announced, and we'll see how that fits through the market this year. We do sell non-equipment products that consist of metals, right? And there is inflation going on in that, and those prices have been increasing and accounts for some of the fourth quarter's benefit that you see in the nonequipment growth, while you're more encyclopedic than me about that, but I think it's some helpful price increases heading into 2021. Jeff, well first, the U.S. market, we speak to that pretty directly in the press release. Our other international -- we have international businesses really split into two other markets, Canada, which actually looked a lot like the United States at the end of the day. A good market, commercial market, underperforming residential, but on whole, Canada grew its sales and profits in 2020. And certainly is Latin America, that's where in our Latin American business, which we do publish in our 10-K, you can look -- glean some data from it. That's mostly a commercial business, and that's the business that went down in sales and profits this year, probably to the tune of about $0.20 a share, if I look at the full year. So when we speak about our results, again, put a placeholder for Latin America, which we expect a recovery this year and after costing us about $0.20 this year. Again, largely a commercial market. And like you're seeing in everyone's discussion, commercial market is improving, but still lagging. And 2021 could be a year of recovery that can have some benefit. We'll wait and see it and talk about it as it happens, but that give you a sense of 2020. Yes. Again, three factors, I think, in the answer, Jeff to kind of unbundle it. So 2020, you're right, an early spring reaction to all the knives that were falling helping with cost reduction and provoking cost reduction for good reasons. Second was interesting, the need to deal with double-digit demand thereafter for the next eight months. So certainly, some costs needed to conduct clear equation as 2020 played out. And then third, technology. What did we do, can we do, can we continue to do relative to technology, which is kind of the whole, outcomes of technology is to improve cost. Especially we should see gain of all the technology that's intended in that. So that's nice in abstract answer. If I look at 2021, I would say this, half of our SG&A are people. And commission growth, growth in incentive pay, we want that to happen. We would expect that to happen next year. And so with the SG&A increases, for example, in that category. Rent, which is about 15% of SG&A is, I think, flat this year. That's an accomplishment. Our teams went to landlords and dealt with the realities of what was going on in the market and this year's rent is flat. Well, that was otherwise intended to are likely to increase. I think some of those savings will be kept and sustained into next year. So if I try to summarize it without another 10 minutes of explanation, we would see some SG&A growth next year, just in the realities of what happened in 2020. We are making investments in our distribution network in 2021 with people and locations. And we see the opportunity. We have really OEM partnership in many of those efforts, and we're going to go out and expand our network some next year, and there'll be some SG&A growth for that. Otherwise, technology will help pinch those increases. And again, I would expect not the same performance but a moderate increase next year. Yes. Go ahead. Ask your question again. So what's the -- what are you getting to? Oh no, not at all. The margins internationally look like the U.S. margins -- gross margin. So there's no algebra that affects the mix of -- in some sort. It's really the blocking and tackling of getting pricing in the market. It's technology. There's a big pricing initiative going on to improve how we price our products go to market. And we talked earlier about inflation. And there's a lack of inflation in 2020. The opportunity inflation might help. We'll see. We don't know, until we get into the season. But those are the larger moving pieces. Yes, Jeff. Just first, Jeff, welcome back. Yes, two things I take to remind everyone of is, the focus of M&A is kind of the regional superpower businesses that are in this industry. We're not attempting to roll up a fragmented industry. We're focused on the largest of targets that will drive growth and share and then platforms to build on and invest in. The second, big picture fundamental is, we would rather invest in businesses when they're growing and reaching greater strength, we'll not turnaround experts, we're not looking for a dip in the market to buy. We're looking to invest in strengthening businesses. So I think this environment after everyone has been through a lot this year, net-net is stronger now than it was a year ago. So I would say that presents us opportunity and certainly gives us confidence in where the good businesses are. But having said that, for 2021 I'll never be able to predict a thing, other than to say some of the targets that were technology discussions were the reason for the discussion. Along with performance, I think that rekindling of that effort can happen now that we're through some of the weirdness and again, the foundations are stronger today than they were a year ago. So I would expect some great conversation. Whether there's great transactions or not, is still to be seen, but..."

            "name": "Albert Nahmad",
            "content": "Good morning everyone. Hope everyone is healthy and safe. And welcome to Watsco's fourth quarter earnings call. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO and with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Executive Vice President; and Barry Logan, also Executive Vice President. Now as we normally do, before we start here's our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Now onto our financial report. Watsco produced another record year, with sales, net income and earnings per share reaching record levels. We generated record cash flow of $534 million during the year, well in excess of our goal of generating cash flow greater than net income. This further strengthened our balance sheet, which is now debt-free and provides us the capacity to make almost any size investment to grow our business. We also announced this morning a 10% increase in our annual dividend to $7.80 per share. That reflects our confidence in our business. 2020 results were driven by steady growth with market share gains in our U.S. residential HVAC equipment business, which grew 10% for the year and 17% during the fourth quarter. Homeowners continue to invest in their homes as replacement sales at higher efficiencies remain strong from early summer through today. Looking long term, we see opportunity to be a significant participant and contributor in efforts to address climate change. Sales of high-efficiency products have long been a component of our business and have grown steadily in our sales mix over the past decade. This is an interesting data point. there are over 110 million installed HVAC systems in the United States, many of which are operating under old efficiency standards that resulted for the user in higher energy use and cost to them. It's important to note, we will explore and evaluate impactful opportunities to make progress in our marketplace. We believe the combination of Watsco's technology platforms, industry leading scale, access to capital, customer relationships and unrivaled OEM relationships provide a strong foundation and long-term benefit for all stakeholders involved. We also continue to invest in our industry-leading technology platforms, leading to greater adoption, new customer acquisition and market share gains. User growth on Watsco's e-commerce platform, a good indicator of overall tech adoption, was up 20% during 2020. This is important as sales growth rates for customers that are active users outpace growth rates of non-users. Also, customer attrition among active users is a fraction of non-users, another good indicator of effectiveness. Now some more detailed examples of our progress. Weekly users of our mobile apps increased 27% in 2020, with over 120,000 downloads. The number of e-commerce transactions grew 20% this year to 1.2 million online orders. Our annualized e-commerce sales run rate is 33% versus 31% at the end of last year. In certain markets, it's over 50%. Our curbside or dockside pickup services expanded to more locations and now includes no-contact payment functionality. The technology has only been available since this summer, and already over 22,000 orders were fulfilled by more than 3,000 unique users. Two of our newer innovative platforms gained momentum in 2020. We call them, OnCall Air and Credit-For-Comfort. These platforms help digitize the relationship between contractors and homeowners when buying and financing replacement HVAC systems. OnCall Air is growing exponentially. Contract has provided digital proposals to over 109,000 hospitals using the tool during last year and generated nearly $350 million in gross merchandise value for our customers, an 89% increase over last year. And Credit-For-Comfort processed 40% more digital financing applications in 2020 versus 2019, resulting in more than 180% increase in third-party funded loans. This tool helps homeowners afford much needed HVAC systems. Investments in inventory management software have also benefited the company yielding lower inventory, improved returns and contributing to our record cash flow and operating efficiency. These examples are exciting, and we believe it's still early in terms of reaching the full potential of our technology investments. As always, feel free to schedule a Zoom call with us, and we can further explain our technology and its progress. Now one very important thought as we -- in these prepared remarks. Our 2020 results are a testament to the efforts of our valued employees across the Watsco network. We deeply appreciate their commitment. With that, A.J., Paul, Barry and I are happy to answer your questions. Elizabeth? Well, I'll start with an answer, and then I'll turn to Paul Johnston to talk about the industry. I'll talk about ourselves. I think that we will -- we are set up to continue to grow over a number of years. We've talked about technology adoption. We've talked about our financial strength, which allows us to continue our active M&A program. We have a lot of things we can do to continue our growth, regardless of what happens to the industry, and we feel very confident in that statement. Paul, you want to talk about the market, next... Good, Paul. That's a great question. Let me turn to A.J. for the answer. Yes. Sure. Hi, David. I hope it's not too cold where you are. For the Super Bowl. Barry, do you want to take a shot? Barry? Correct. I guess we can take a shot at it, Paul -- with that picture. Sure. Good morning, Jeff. Barry? Go ahead, Barry. Good morning, Chris. Well, it's something that we're focused on. And whatever improvements you saw this year or last year, I should say, we continue to believe this year will show improvement as well because of our focus and because of the ability to do something about it through our own internal systems and approach to the marketplace. 2019, 2020? Barry, if you understand that, go ahead and answer. Well, we can't share much. We're in a minority position, and we're very supportive of anything they want from us. And that's all I can say. We don't -- we have no idea what their intentions are in terms of divesting more ownership. What we can tell you is that we're very pleased with their performance. All Across Yes. Good morning, Jeff. Well, I'll make a general statement and then Barry, who leads our M&A, can provide more information. Watsco is an acquirer. And as part of our overall strategy, we have a $5 billion revenue in the $40 billion industry. So our share has a lot of room to grow. And we use our balance sheet to support M&A. And we are active, and we do think there's no promise, but we do think we'll have M&A this year. And I do think that the reputation for our culture, we're a different kind of an acquirer. We're not disruptive, we're supportive. And all the other things that we add, the capital, the equity for the key people in the organization, our 401k, which is -- our donations are in Watsco shares. That sort of thing is culturally attractive, I believe. And as I said, lots of opportunities since we're only $5 billion out of the $40 billion. And now some of them are very small, but it doesn't matter to us. We just try to bring in people that want to continue working and continuing building what they have with our support. And Barry? There's got to be a great transaction, Barry. Good answer. We're very optimistic about that. No guarantees, but we're very optimistic. Go on, Steve. Doing good. Come visit. What a question. Who wants to volunteer for that answer? Competition is always strong. And the one you mentioned and others, it's a very fragmented industry that we think we have advantages that others don't have. And we've had that for a number of years as evidenced by the growth that we've had. I don't see any reason why that's not going to continue. I think we're actually getting stronger. I'm more optimistic about the future than anything we've done in the past. We're on a roll. Yes. It has. And it's just beginning. Well, I agree with that. Good to talk to you. Paul, why don't you take that? And it also remains true. The vast majority of our customers rely on us for their inventory. Yes. I mean an example, we have 100 business units that we call Baker is probably pushing $1 billion in terms of revenue as part of Watsco. I would say 99.9% of what they sell today was ordered within the last six hours. None of their customers are out, talking, drawing from inventory and replenishing with us. If I said de minimis, that's overstating it. Some of them... Well, thanks for listening, and I'll talk to A.J. about his raise. We appreciate your interest. I just want to give you the confidence level that I have, that we're really on a roll here. I think we're very strong and going to get stronger. I think business is solid at the start of the year. And I hope that continues. And take us up on our offer; call us about learning more about the technology initiative. It's a game changer. And other than that, I wish you all to stay safe and stay healthy, and we'll talk at the next quarter. Bye-bye now."

            "name": "Aaron Nahmad",
            "content": "Sure. It's a combination of all of the above. There were supply chain constraints in the industry. There was strong demand. And our technology enabled us to fill customer orders and take market share and show sales growth in that environment as well as it gave us new insight and tools to attack what we call non-performing inventory. Inventory that's probably been in our shelves for too long. So with more detail and more talent focused on it, we were able to move some of that old product out of the network as well. So it's a mix and a confluence of all three factors. And certainly, those efforts are going to continue going into 2021 and beyond. You're so right, Paul... We -- sorry, Barry. You're so right, Paul. We use technology as really shorthand. It's really people, process and technology. Technology just enables great people to put in great processes and create change and increase profitability. This is A.J. Going back a question to the market share, which ties right into what the conversation was now is that, we saw huge new growth and new customers buying from the Watsco Company, which is exciting. And at the same time, we're seeing all-time low attrition rate of customers. So I think what that tells you is that customers are finding -- it's very good to buy product in the Watsco companies. We're good partners to these contractors as we try to make it easy for them to do business with us, we try to help them grow their businesses, and that's getting more and more valued and appreciated."

            "name": "A - Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Yes. I don't think a lot of it was from the early parts of our initiative. I just think a lot of it was a little bit of pent-up demand with some of the equipment spotting that we had, that equipment wasn't available. So people had to repair their product. Had to repair a furnace. That's been probably the tightest market for everybody right now. As far as price increases, a lot of the steel and copper prices that Barry mentioned, did occur in the fourth quarter. They had a benefit, but really not material in the overall scheme of Watsco's revenues for the quarter. I think more of that is going to bleed into perhaps in the first and second quarter of this year. We'll have a better idea for what's going to happen price-wise with those commodities."
        },
        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Yes. Yes, the market in 2021, it's tough to make a comparison, obviously, to 2020 because we had so many ups and downs and ebbs and flows and inventory issues and such. However, I think it's fair to say that the industry will remain strong during the year. New construction remains strong. Replacement demand, we're still seeing that following through with where we ended last year or beginning this year on the right footing. I think there's another phenomenon out there that's helping and changing the replacement dynamics. And that is, we're seeing homeowners stay in their homes for longer periods, and I don't mean because of the pandemic. I mean they're not flipping houses as they were in the early 2000s. We're seeing them stay in their homes 13, 14 years, which is a good indicator that when something does happen to your air conditioning system, you're probably going to replace it as opposed to repair it. You'd have more of a tendency to repair if you are planning to sell your home. So I'm bullish on that. Secondly, I'm also bullish on the idea that we have markets where we have very good market share, and we have markets where our market share isn't as high as we think it should be. So we still have market share gains that we're striving for and going for. And we have great partners working with us on the OEM side to help make that happen. If I could add -- I have one more thing to that, and that is, A.J. did a great job of not only getting the technology that we needed with the system side of it. So we had a visibility all the way through to what the inventory should be. But also, we were able to, fortunately, for us, before the pandemic, add people from different walks of life in the purchasing in the inventory management systems. People from retail, from different commodities mixed in with our group of people that knew the HVAC industry. So I think it bode well once we got into the pandemic that our people had varied backgrounds and capabilities, and we're able to work hand in glove with our OEMs and our other suppliers to make sure that we had a proper cadence with inventory receives. I will. It's -- no, we did not do huge pre-buys. We did several buys just to make sure that we were refilling the inventory that we lost though we still had a deficit in. Very selective. One thing that we did during the entire pandemic is, even when everybody else was canceling orders, we maintained the cadence of putting in orders and maintained our order board throughout the entire pandemic. And so we really didn't -- we had shortages, yes, but we didn't have these yoyo type inventory movements like a lot of people did. So we feel like, we finished the year in good shape on inventory. Yes, we have a concern going into 2021, that we'll be able to maintain that status. But we're working diligently with our OEMs on a daily and weekly basis to make sure that we're getting the fulfilment we need on what we have on order. Like I said, we've got our orders -- we put our orders in the way we always have. We have a pre-buy, like we always do. We're not trying to be unusual here. Most of the manufacturers, I think, continued building product during the offseason, where they normally would have shutdowns. I think that was pretty much universal across the OEMs. I guess that's an hundred dollar question that everybody has. Will the dealers go back to the brands that they first worked -- that they were loyal to, that they couldn't get availability or they lost and they went to other brands. And I guess that's what everybody's marketing plans are all about. It has been able to maintain share gains that they picked up in prior year. Yes. It's -- most of the dealers and contractors we do business with, really don't maintain any inventory, just base inventory in parts and supplies. So that really isn't an issue. Some of the larger contractors do carry some inventory, but it's -- they really rely on the most part, the industry relies on the distributor's supply inventory. Do we think there are some contractors who may have been concerned about the shortages of last year and they're trying to put some inventory in place? Yes, I think there is some of that happening. To what extent? I really wouldn't have a read on that right now. Yes. That's right. That's 95% of the market. I mean dealers carry motors and ambassadors and some line set, some copper tubing, refrigerant, but generally not equipment."

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Albert Nahmad, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Watsco\u2019s third quarter earnings call. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO; and with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Executive Vice President; and Barry Logan, Executive Vice President. Now before we start, our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Before I report, let me first wish that you and your family are healthy and safe. Now on to our report. Watsco just completed an outstanding third quarter. EPS grew 25% to a record $2.76. Records were set for sales, gross profit, operating profit, operating margins, and net income. These results were driven by strong growth in our U.S. residential HVAC equipment business, which grew 19% during the quarter, and from operating efficiencies achieved throughout our network, as evidenced by the nominal change in SG&A.  Homeowners clearly are investing in their homes as HVAC replacement sales have remained strong from early summer through today. We also believe that greater adoption of our Watsco technologies has contributed to our results and led to gains in market share. Our best indication of this impact are two simple metrics. First, customers that use Watsco technologies are growing at a much faster rate than non-users. Second, we are experiencing minimal attrition among active users on a year-over-year basis. Now keep this in mind, we continue to invest in our platforms and to drive for greater adoption by more customers. Here are some examples of our progress. Weekly users of our mobile apps have grown 31% since last year, with over 100,000 downloads. E-commerce transactions have grown by 19% this year to nearly 1 million online orders, which is about $1.5 billion dollars in annual rate at the moment. Our annualized e-commerce sales run rate is 32% versus 29% at the end of last year, and in certain markets, the use of e-commerce is over 50%. Our dockside pickup services have expanded to more locations and now include non-contact payment functionality. This technology has only been available for a few months and already over 12,000 orders were fulfilled during the quarter by more than 2,000 unique users. Two of our newer innovative platforms have gained momentum, we call them, OnCall Air, and the second one CreditForComfort. These platforms provide digital connectivity for contractors and homeowners when making proposals and buying and financing replacement systems. Contractors using our, what we call, OnCall Air platform provided digital proposals to over 39,000 households during the quarter, and generated $114 million in sales, nearly double that of last year. Our CreditForComfort platform processed double the number of digital financing applications resulting in an 87% increase in third-party funded loans. Investments in inventory management software have also benefited us this year with inventory turns improving 25 basis points over last year, and of course, contributing to cash flow and operating efficiency.  All of this is exciting, but we believe Watsco technologies are only scratching the surface of their full potential.  As always, free feel to schedule a Zoom call with us and we can further explain our technology and progress. We also strengthened Watsco\u2019s balance sheet this quarter, we generated record operating cash flow of $373 million, which is far away a record for the year so far, and we have no debt at this time. Importantly, we have the capacity to make almost any size investment to grow in our business. And I always like to comment that we're in a $40 billion industry, in which we are only $5 billion, so we have lots of room for growth. And then finally, one more very important thought. Our results are a testament to the efforts of our teams across the Watsco network. We deeply appreciate their commitment.  With that, A.J., Paul, Barry and I are happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. We will go to Brett Linzey from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. \nBrett Linzey : I wanted to start with just the sales trends, 10% growth in HVAC equipment, 19% in the U.S. resi products. What was the big driver in that category? So, everything excluding equipment, where did you see strength? \nAlbert Nahmad: Why don\u2019t we turn to Paul Johnston for that answer? \nPaul Johnston : Yes, I'd like to make sure I understand. Everything but equipment? \nBrett Linzey : Well, just the total U.S. resi sales up much stronger than the equipment. So, what was the big driver kind of ex-equipment? What categories drove that? \nAlbert Nahmad: Oh, no. You misunderstood. Go ahead, Paul, and explain that. \nPaul Johnston: Yes, resi is equipment. It's gas furnaces, coils, air handlers, split systems for residential. So, it's included in the total equipment. \nAlbert Nahmad: I think they previously came in equipment, that's what he is -- that\u2019s what we're trying to say. \nBrett Linzey: And just a follow up to that. Did you see any mix benefit in terms of the gross margin line from kind of strength in the other categories versus just the equipment side? \nAlbert Nahmad: Paul?\nPaul Johnston : Well, yes, we had some moderate growth in the parts and supply side of our business, which we indicated, a little heavier on the part side in mid-single-digits. And that, obviously, is an enhancement to our gross profit. So, that mix did help a bit. \nAlbert Nahmad : Yes. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nJeff Hammond: Just on the equipment side, can you remind us what the mix is of kind of the -- on the equipment side, the U.S. residential versus I guess would be -- the drags would be commercial and international?\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul?\nPaul Johnston : Yes. Barry, why don\u2019t you handle that as far as what is offshore versus onshore? \nBarry Logan: Exactly. You are on the right track, the largest part of our equipment business is the U.S. residential business by far. To a lesser extent there's commercial U.S. and there's international which is -- which has a slant toward the commercial applied market. So, that core-core business of ours which is residential U.S. is what -- is up 19% this quarter. The commercial U.S. market is recovering but it is still not anywhere near the growth rate of obviously residential. International is what has been more impacted than anything else. You'll find some of our international data in our 10-Q when we file it. But that's a market where it is much tilted towards the commercial market and those markets have been more impacted than anything else we operate. But as I say that from a profit perspective, from a EBIT perspective -- actually our international business is up this quarter from a profit perspective. Although the sales have been impacted, they've done a great job with managing the business and actually are more profitable this quarter internationally. \nJeff Hammond: Okay, great. And then, can you just -- I guess a couple of questions. One, on inventory levels, just kind of where do you see your inventory levels? Are they too low for the demand environment or about right? Do you still have some restocking to do? And just speak to a lot of discussion about IAQ, what you're doing there? What you're seeing there? What you're doing to kind of broaden that in light of kind of increased interest there?\nAlbert Nahmad: As you heard earlier, we do have investments in inventory management software that's considerably helping us to maintain and grow revenues with less investment in inventory. Maybe more color can be provided by Barry or Paul. Either one jump in.\nBarry Logan: First one, inventory, I -- Paul, I -- you have layers to this. But big picture, we started the year, early this year talking about inventory being something we want to improve inventory turns from 4 to 5, is a very straightforward goal, a very straightforward math calculation to say what that's worth in cash flow and that's before any of the disruptions or any of the noise of supply chain discussions that we've had. So we started the year with that in mind as a strong source of cash flow, as well as obviously an operational efficiency that can be gained through our 600 locations that we operate. So that's been an initiative before any of this noise. And Paul, you can comment on current state of what's going on with the supply chain and so on.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. The supply chain rapidly recovered in the September timeframe and pretty much got back into a normal flow. And we started seeing inventory flowing again. We're not really experiencing the big stock outs. We got some spotty issues with inventory on the supply chain side. But for the most part, I think the OEMs have recovered nicely. As far as our inventory levels, we were able to not only use the technology that we've invested in to improve the inventory turns, but we were also able to improve the quality of our inventory. And so now we're able to analyze by branch, by division, by product line, by SKU exactly the types of inventories that we need to have in place. So it was -- it's been a wonderful investment that we've made in it. I think the dividends that we're going to receive from it are going to be paying back over the next several years. \nJeff Hammond: A.J. a little color on the technology involved in this inventory.\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes. I think Paul, your last point was important and that it's not just the amount of inventory or even the turns of the inventory, but it's the quality of the inventory. And that is absolutely a function of the technology that we're using and the people, the teams that are using them. That's been a major focus and there's been major achievements there. And also given the constraints on supply with the demand going on, it's important to note how great of a job our team from the field did, signing products that our customers filled -- or their orders filled, so they could sell product. So that was really a herculean effort. And we're proud of them. \nJeff Hammond: Okay. So it sounds like inventories have kind of normalized in the lower year-on-year is maybe a function largely as some of the internal changes. Can you just talk about IAQ? How big is it for you guys? Is it moving the needle? Is it something you're excited about given kind of the COVID dynamic? And it just seems to be a lot of people talking about it. \nA.J. Nahmad: Yes. It\u2019s -- it definitely is an important piece of our business now. Historically, as you know, IAQ has been something we always talk about. But I think definitely, the pandemic made it into a frontline product area. It\u2019s growing very, very rapidly, 2 or 3 times what it was in prior year. Excited about all the new products that we're putting in new lights.\nAlbert Nahmad: UV light.\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes, UV-C lights, air cleaners, filtration, the entire gambit is growing rapidly. And very good and I think it's sustainable.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. And being the industry leader and having the scale that we have when new products, roll out from new companies, whether they're start up or mature companies, we often get the call first as a distribution partner and we're getting first look at a lot of these products. \nBarry Logan: And Jeff, what I would add is just to -- A.J. kind of -- we talked about before on platforms and technology and people and execution. IAQ is now part of every single recommendations in our platform called OnCall Air, OnCall Air is this presentation platform that contractors give to homeowners to sell them solutions. And again, that would be an example where old school, a contractor may or may not present that feature or benefit, may or may not add it to the collection of things he is doing.  Now, it's embedded in the technology, embedded in the presentation, embedded in the proposal that's being given. So looking at the future state, that kind of thing is very important.\nJeff Hammond: A.J. why don't you explain more in lay language what the OnCall Air does? \nA.J. Nahmad: Sure. OnCall Air is a business that we built that has a software tool, that is sold on a FAS basis to contractors to help them sell in the house. So it replaces the yellow carbon copy pieces of paper that they previously used to write proposals on. And it\u2019s sure a full digital interactive experience with lots of product information and videos about the product offering and enables contractors to sell with a good-better-best offering. And all those add-ons and accessories and recommendations that Barry was hinting at are embedded in the tool. Consumer financing options are embedded in the tool. It's basically a modern sales platform designed to only for HVAC contractors. And the contractors that are using it are growing faster, they're getting bigger tickets, they're closing more deals. And it's also a tremendous start. Thank you.\nBarry Logan: And it's also using all the product data that we've curated for the last five years with not just a sales platform, it's an information platform of all the products, all the data, all the SKUs, all the connectivity to e-commerce to allow for fulfillment. It's really I think again a terrific platform, really go into that future state of how things can be sold in the home. \nJeff Hammond: Remind me, A.J. how many SKUs that we have in terms of data?\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes, in our product information management system now, we've mastered about 800,000 SKUs in the industry.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Dankert of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nChris Dankert: I guess, first off, congrats on the U.S. res growth. Really impressive. If I'm remembering correctly, I mean, your fulfillment metrics are typically mid to high 90s, very strong. I guess, with that kind of a spike in demand from flattish to up almost 20%, was there any dip in your ability to fill? Or was the team pretty well able to keep up with the needs of the customers there?\nAlbert Nahmad: That's a great question and all the OEMs were stressed. And from our observation is they kept up with us as best they could as they did with other distributors. So yes, did we lose a little bit of sales? Probably. But overall, I think they kept up with us, and as I said, with other distributors as well. And they're working hard. They're not messing around here. They know this is an opportunity so they run hard. Anybody want to add color to that?\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes. I mentioned it earlier, there's a herculean effort in the field. Where there was product shortages, our teams found ways to fill orders anyway. There's a lot of warehouse transfers going on. There was a lot of helping contractors find, if they were looking for product A but we didn't have enough of it, we could substitute a product B and get them at a competitive price. There's a lot of little wins like that, that helped our customer fulfilled.\nPaul Johnston : And our OEMs, like Al said, came too magnificently. We were working with them daily. We had conversations with all of our major OEMs on a daily basis, talking to what our needs were, where our needs were. And they really jumped through hoops to be able to help us fill open orders where we had spot shortages. It was very well done.\nChris Dankert : I got to imagine being able to keep up with customers this quarter, just it's got to breathe a lot of goodwill. So nice work.\nPaul Johnston: Well said, I agree with that.\nChris Dankert : And just 1 quick update. Any update on VRF, the size for you today, what the growth looks there? Is it meaningful for you at the moment?\nPaul Johnston: It's not a material size in our market. The VRF is and by itself. The general duct-free split market is becoming larger and larger each year and continues to grow in the low 20s. VRF, we had a good quarter for VRF. It did grow. It kind of suffered in the second quarter a little bit. A similar situation that you had with all commercial products because that's generally where VRF goes. And so it did have a downtick to it but then a recovery because most of the jobs that we have with VRF are long-term jobs that are forecast out 6, 8, 9 months.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Manthey of Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Manthey : So relative to all of the comments you had here on stock-outs, do you think that manufacturer shortfalls were positive or negative in the third quarter? And I mean net-net, did Watsco miss out on sales or did they actually benefit from shortfalls that other distributors may have been experiencing, and you picked up some contractor business that you may not have had before? Do you have a feel for that?\nAlbert Nahmad : Well, I don't think that OEMs discriminated for us as opposed to their other customers. I don't believe that. But I think they were a part for all their customers.\nDavid Manthey : I'm thinking between brands. One brand was out and that contractor would switch over to something that you had in stock. Do you think you saw it in there or is there anything measurable?\nAlbert Nahmad : Paul, do you want to take a shot?\nPaul Johnston : Yes. That's a great question and one that we have to do a lot of forensics to try to identify exactly what the impact of it was. Right now, I would not say that it really had a big impact because we were obviously going hand to mouth with our inventory. So it became very, very difficult for us to go out -- reach out and take somebody else's customer, if you will, and provide inventory to them when we were trying to maintain the growth of our customers in the market. So a little...\nAlbert Nahmad : I think that's well said, yes.\nPaul Johnston : Yes. A little bit more time, I think, under our belt, I think we'll have a better feel on that.\nDavid Manthey : Okay, fair enough. And then second on the other HVAC products. If I heard you right, Paul, I think you said that the parts business was up mid-single, which, I guess, would imply the supplies being something lower than that to get to the plus 2 overall. And I'm just confused on why that would be, given that we're seeing such a strong push in the new residential construction market. I guess a bigger picture question for all of you is that, in that other HVAC products business, do you envision a world where that can grow? It seems like it's been flat or down forever because there\u2019s offsetting factor between parts and supplies. Is there a world where that can grow on a more regular basis?\nPaul Johnston : Definitely. Yes, that is a marketplace that we have a strong focus on, as far as you know how -- what are the dynamics of where we can make that market grow. And of course, a lot of that is going to be market share. It's going to be product availability, it's going to be using our technology to be able to replenish dealer stocks in a more rapid economical manner for the dealer. So there are a number of efforts that we can get into to make that market grow again.\nAlbert Nahmad : But Dave, I think you're spot on. Being the largest distributor dealing with 1,000 vendors, we believe that we're able to negotiate, due to our volume buying, as good the prices as anybody and we believe that should help us gain share. But we think that we have more work to do in order to get the growth rates going. I don't -- certainly don't think it's going to stay at -- proportionately at this level. I'm very hopeful that parts and supplies will increase as a percentage of our overall business. And some of the things we're doing with our OEMs, I think, will assist that. Don't count us out on parts and supply just because...\nA.J. Nahmad : No. I was going to say stay tuned. That's a new major data-driven initiative that we're just kicking off now in earnest, and that will be kind of a next-generation effort on parts and supplies.\nBarry Logan : And I'd just like to add another layer to that, if needed, probably not needed but I feel like saying it anyway is -- there is no, I think, big macro dynamic, Dave, where parts are suddenly becoming a solution. The equipment growth rates have been too consistent. And through today, as we said in the opening comments, that consistency is through today. So I think what we're alluding to is, this is a market share gain for parts and supplies also. And we have probably 15 competitors in Miami selling parts and supplies, and it's the most fragmented part of our industry as distributors that sell parts and supply. So where A.J. is alluding to as well as this can become a technology play in a far different advanced way than what's being done historically and it's an opportunity for us.\nAlbert Nahmad : That was much more eloquent than me, Barry. \nA.J. Nahmad : Well done. Barry is a very eloquently. \nAlbert Nahmad : He is. \nA.J. Nahmad : In every way, in every way.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephen Volkmann : Barry, if I can pick on your elegance again for a moment. Well, you said something I thought was interesting earlier. Many things, obviously, that I thought were interesting, but 1 specifically was that the IAQ is now sort of part of all of these OnCall Air proposals that come through. Is it possible to ballpark what -- how much of the add-on would that be like 10% to the project or 20% or 50%? I just really have no idea.\nBarry Logan : Yes. It's certainly not 50%. But the OnCall Air concept that differs from the historical sales concept is, giving the homeowner a good-better-best solution which includes IAQ. It's not just adding IAQ, it's adding a bundle. It's selling higher efficiencies. And then the fact that consumer financing can then make those higher efficiencies and larger bundles more affordable is part of the holy grail of what we're trying to create here. So I wouldn't say IAQ adds -- Paul, you may know, but it's not just adding 10% or whatever the percent might be. It's presenting this bundle in a very connected way with the homeowner that's going to respond to it differently than if a contractor happens to remember it when he's writing down on paper on an Office Depot form. So far different sales process is really what it's about.\nPaul Johnston : And there are various layers of IAQ. IAQ is not just 1 product. You've got a number of different products. You can tier into the installation. So a baseline installation would be -- if you use just minimum IAQ products would be probably around 10% of the install price could go as high as 25% to 30%.\nA.J. Nahmad: Just 1 more thing on that. In OnCall Air, it's no longer just a static proposal. It's a digital interactive sales experience, so just like buying online when we all buy -- when we all shop online in Amazon and others, we're seeing other products that might make sense in this purchase. That happens in the OnCall Air experience. And it also happens in our B2B e-commerce as our customers shop on our website. And the line item has fascinating statistics but the line items for invoice on our online stores, meaning our subsidiary's website, is 30% higher than offline sales. And that's the number that stayed true for a while.\nStephen Volkmann : And then just my actual question I was going to ask originally was more on the SG&A side. Very impressive SG&A control in the quarter here, I guess, flat on a same-store sales basis. Just how do we think about that going forward? I assume there's probably some costs that are going to kind of creep back in as the world opens up. But how should we think about it?\nAlbert Nahmad : Barry, that he will answer that, so let's get this up.\nBarry Logan : Again, every distributor has 2 things they're managing, SG&A, obviously, the fixed cost that he would like to lower over time and the variable cost that he don't mind spending because they're -- usually, they're driven by sales or margin growth. So we're no different. The key this year has been to get cost -- fixed costs down. How do we take some of the latent costs in our -- not just renting facilities, but any measure of latent cost in our stores down. And that's where we've been accomplishing the most this year. Renting facilities, for example, was lower year-over-year on 6% higher sales would be an example. Some of the fixed payroll where we're examining really the technology benefits that might come. This has been obviously a climate to address some of those costs and then try to push for the permanence of them as they go into next year. So I'll have a great analytic for you to say X amount of fixed cost has been reduced and will stay permanent. But culturally, there's not 1 of our 30 regional presidents that hasn't taken the task, their own local cost structure to accomplish that. The variable cost will be driven by sales. There will be more commissions. There will be more performance-based comp. There will be more delivery costs as the business is growing the way it is, and that's obviously embedded in our third quarter performance where you see SG&A flat. We have growth in variable. We have offsetting reductions in fixed. And again, culturally, just it\u2019s a huge effort to go on to sustain this because it's -- they can be more permanent than temporary benefits, especially on the fixed cost side.\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes. I'll add to that on the variable cost side, well, all SG&A -- the third biggest bucket of all of our SG&A is freight. That's the cost of moving product into our locations, between our locations and out of our locations to our customers. We fill orders. And I hate to be a broken record on technology, but we now have new technologies that exposes more data and enables more optimization around how we do all of that, how we bring the product in, how we deliver it to our customers, just making smarter decisions day-by-day, transaction-by-transaction, of which we do 7 million-plus a year to optimize costs and gain efficiencies. Early innings of that.\nStephen Volkmann : And A.J., is there enough of that technological opportunity to offset the general increase in logistics costs that we're seeing broadly?\nA.J. Nahmad: I would say TBD. Yes, that's the goal, right, is to be ever more efficient.\nAlbert Nahmad : Yes, the largest cost of that discussion is delivering products from 1 of our 600 stores within 10, 15 miles of where it sits. And that activity-based cost used to be largely a branch manager figuring it out every day. And then with technology, how do we help empower, enable and change the game of how that local process is done. Or if it's moving inventory around, then it becomes embedded in the inventory optimization project that we have going on. So as we said in the call, scratching the surface. But yes, some of that scratching is having an impact on results.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Merkel of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel : So first off, the resi growth, also very impressive, in my view. This is probably hard to answer. But I'm just wondering about sustainability. What level of growth can continue? Because I have to imagine there was some pent-up demand that deferred work from Q2 that got done in 3Q. So I don't know, it's hard to answer, but what do you think?\nAlbert Nahmad : Well, I would say that your conclusion is correct. It's very hard to answer. It started in the third quarter. It is not tailed. I mean the growth rate -- there is growth going on at the start of the fourth quarter. How long that will be sustained is hard to say. But we'll just have to see. Our game plan is, if we can't get it from industry growth, we're going to get it from the share growth. We're going to use the advantage of our technology. So unless somebody can add can add to that, Barry, Paul, A.J.?\nBarry Logan : I think when the industry numbers are all added up, I mean, obviously, there's going to be an anomaly in shipment data coming out of the industry association in Q3 where the industry is going to show this huge bubble of growth. But when you put it all together, we're going to have to look at it at year-end as far as what the actual growth in equipment sales were for the year. And I think going forward then, the pent-up demand from second quarter that we pulled -- pushed into the third quarter, we're still seeing, as Al said, some of that in the October time frame. It's a crystal ball outlook as far as what's going to occur in 2021. I think when everything is added up, it's going to look like a pretty normal year for the industry.\nRyan Merkel: I think what you're also saying is the first half industry shipments were not -- were probably below where they should have been in the second half and somewhat in terms of catching up.\nBarry Logan : Right, right. \nRyan Merkel: Yes, it won't be necessarily out of line.\nBarry Logan: I'll try to kind of -- it's a good question. I looked through that. And I think you have to look at things on a year-to-date basis and smooth things out and then ask the question. So year-to-date, the U.S. residential market, our business is up 8%. And there's virtually no price in that. So that's simply machines breaking, the same number we're going to break. No matter what is going on in the economy or COVID, machines don't know. So you have an 8% growth rate, largely driven by a healthy replacement market, contractor confidence to go in and install the right thing or upgrade the right thing and get the work done. And that type of growth rate is above average but not so far out in the space that it doesn't seem sustainable because again, I think homeowner, contractor, distributor, even OEM is feeling this kind of health in the market and if stay-at-home added something, fine. But I think in big picture, 8% sustaining itself is not out of the question or out of the ordinary. And some of the short-term choppiness, you need to look through it, I think.\nRyan Merkel : Yes. Okay, that's a good answer. That context helps.\nPaul Johnston : Just 1 more point there. Whether it comes from industry growth or share gain, I'll tell you 1 more detail is that our growth rate to new customers is higher than it's ever been, meaning we have more sales to more new customers. And we can attribute that to a number of factors, but we have more customers buying more products than ever.\nRyan Merkel : Yes. So it speaks to share gain on top of whatever the market gives you, which I think will be pretty \u2026.\nPaul Johnston : Absolutely.\nRyan Merkel : Okay. And then I'm going to come at the SG&A again and -- because you had troubles the last couple of years leveraging SG&A, and then here this quarter, right, it was incredibly strong. Based on your answer to the prior question, it sounds like you've taken fixed costs down. You've got this technology that's now making it more efficient. So my question is, should we look at this as an inflection point or is the new normal? I mean, have we turned the corner and now assuming the top-line is there, you're going to start delivering more consistent SG&A leverage?\nAlbert Nahmad : I would say that the first, I'm going to comment on like what you've said. For the last 2 years, we've reported over and over again that we were doing, more than that time, significant investments in our technology and I don't think that's going to stop. It may even increase because we do think it's a competitive edge to do what we're doing. But obviously, some of that's being offset by other efficiencies that are occurring. Barry, my SG&A expert?\nBarry Logan : Yes. First, Ryan, I was right. I mean, $30 million of technology spending today didn't exist 5, 6 years ago, and that's 50 basis points of EBIT margin. We could have built an elaborate pro forma EBIT calculation for everyone but we didn't do that. And instead, we just tell people, this is the right way to do it and execute it. So obviously, the rate of increase in that spending has diminished as things are maturing. And Al is right, we will spend more. But this is a good time to talk about it. It's very clear that sales, margin, share, efficiency, other technologies that we're building beyond the customer-facing stuff has started to have an impact. So I think as an inflection point, that's a nice big clich\u00e9 to ponder. I think the basic question is, is it having an impact? And answer is yes, it clearly is. And culturally, when you talk about new normal, again, I go back to the 30 leaders across Watsco's footprint. There isn't 1 of the 30 that isn't looking at their business differently because of their actions this year and because the technology is just beginning to really influence all aspects of their locations in their business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brandon McCann of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski : Yes. It's actually Josh. Had to sneak in because I was embarrassed about missing it the first time. I guess a few things that maybe I missed because of the -- I've joined a little late. I guess, first, just given the healthy end to the season and at some point, every consumer kind of throws in the towel on summer and says, well, guy, I can't wait until next year for some of the stuff, especially if the contractor can't get there for a while. Do you feel like you're having a longer-than-normal season that maybe stretches out in the months that you normally don't talk about cooling demand? Or potentially some level of -- I know it's not a backlog industry but a backlog of broken stuff out there waiting for attention as we get into the spring of next year?\nAlbert Nahmad : I'll take a shot at the first half of October. Strong demand. Will that be sustained? I don't know. But first half of October, we got smiles on our face. Maybe because we're gaining share, maybe because the industry is doing better. It's hard to say but I like it.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski : And from what you guys have been seeing on contractor lead times that would maybe kind of speak to, like, hey, you guys just can't get in the job site fast enough?\nAlbert Nahmad: I think most of that would have been completed in the -- during September. Any sort of backlog that the contractor would have had. So I don't think that's an issue right now.\nBarry Logan : Josh, just to add to it, I would say that if 80% of what we do is in the Sunbelt, and there's -- people didn't are going to wait until next spring. I think we've always been, and to the extent, we'll always be this kind of real-time way of looking at us in terms of our sales and our seasonality. So I don't think we'd see the deferrals. I think where we see deferrals right now is the commercial market that's built the backlog, waiting for jobs, waiting for money, waiting for contractors to fulfill backlog in the commercial market. I would say that's the only part of our business where that might be true for next year.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski : And that\u2019s financial and not anything else, right?\nAlbert Nahmad : Yes. Let him say what he was going to, what did you say, Josh?\nJoshua Pokrzywinski : I was just saying that the commercial comment would be more of a financial decision, not like residential, just saying, well, I'm not used to...\nBarry Logan: That's right. Yes. Although the indoor air quality is a big theme now of the commercial as well. Carrier, for example, has introduced equipment that's used in the applied world for buildings and that sort of thing. Very useful to attack on the spread of the virus.\nAlbert Nahmad : And then, Paul, you had something.\nPaul Johnston : Yes. I think we're putting together some additional data on -- one of the things I keep hearing is that people had more replacement jobs because people were staying at home. And so they were running their air-conditioning longer. And I guess that sounds good on paper. I want to get underneath that and find out really if the data proves that correctly, were the run times actually longer in the Sunbelt, as Barry said, 80% of our business is in the Sunbelt. Were they actually longer in the Sunbelt because people were home and not at work or in school? And I think the jury is out on that a little bit right now.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski : Got it, that's helpful. And then just shifting gears entirely. Any observation that you would have out or revisitation that you would have on the dividend policy or payout? Obviously, you guys have a pretty high dividend payout right now. But with any potential changes to the statutory tax rate, did that -- is that color you're thinking? Or is that something that would be revisited if taxes were to go up?\nAlbert Nahmad : That's an easy one. We have consistently followed the principle that we will share our growth with the stockholders. And I have a history of doing that year after year for a number of years. We see no reason not to continue that, no reason at all, especially given that we have no debt and strong cash flow. So I would say that we're going to sustain what we've been doing in the past, unless there's something that comes up that I'm unaware of it. But right now, it looks pretty good to do that. Don't forget cash flow has been, to a large extent, a little greater than earnings, and that gives us additional opportunity to do more for our stockholders.\nOperator: And we have a question from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Great performance this year managing some of these supply constraints, spotted supply constraints and big numbers on the sell-through, for sure.\nAlbert Nahmad : Thank you.\nSteve Tusa : I'm just curious though, when you guys -- Barry mentioned kind of the plus 8% this year, it sounds like, I guess, you're thinking the market kind of grew a bit below that obviously, if you're taking market share. Plus 8% is still a pretty big number to call kind of a normalized growth rate. If people aren't running their machines longer or harder, i.e., kind of shortening the useful lives for an installed base that's kind of grown low to mid-single-digits, maybe in the 4% range. How do you kind of get to a higher normalized kind of number than that? What is -- I guess, what's changed?\nAlbert Nahmad : That's a good question. Barry, so sustain your 8% idea.\nBarry Logan : Well, the -- I mean, just to be philosophical and then I'll actually answer your question. There are 2 things that happened this year that are interesting and frankly surprised me. And 1 is that we have another year where the mix of high efficiency is growing. So if there is a consumer risk this year, it's not evident in the mix of products we're selling. It's a positive and it speaks to the homeowner contractor relationship as that's playing out. Secondly is...\nSteve Tusa : Is that about 1 point -- do you think mix is about 1 point, I think Lennox said mix was about 1 point? Is that about right?\nBarry Logan : That\u2019s maybe a little strong, but rounded, that's probably okay. The other -- I think it's probably a little high but that's just my feeling. The other thing that no one ever asked about is contractor credit. When we sell $5 billion of stuff to contractors, 80% of it is on credit. So we have to wait 30 days to get our money, and it's the best -- one of the best leading indicators of how our contractors' health is...\nAlbert Nahmad : How we're going to collect it, yes. Okay, Barry. I know where you're going.\nBarry Logan : And we see almost the lowest default rate, lowest bad debt, lowest kind of risk factors and credit than we have seen. And again, it does speak to the idea that contractors are active and closing deals. And if we're helping them through our technology, great, but does speak I think to the industry and to our contractor relationships I think in terms of health of that end market and how homeowners are reacting to what's going on when something breaks or if something needs to get replaced and so on. So I don't know if that adds to 8%, Steve. Market share gains, I think, will prove out this year adding to that 8%. I feel like that momentum is only getting started for longer-term body of work we're doing with our OEMs right now. It may be -- time will tell, but I think that we can't underestimate the health of what's going on with the contractor, homeowner relationships that are out there.\nSteve Tusa : And that's been -- you said you're kind of implying that, that was not something that pre-pandemic, it was kind of normal, and that this has gotten better post pandemic?\nBarry Logan: Yes. \nSteve Tusa : It's amazing that an 8% unemployment rate means better consumer credit behavior. Interesting. This whole thing is pretty interesting.\nAlbert Nahmad: But Steve, also remember, our customer is the homeowner, and the unemployment rate is much lower with homeowners than it is for people who are renters. There is facts there. And the second thing that we mentioned on really gaining market share is a combination of 2 things: one, is acquiring new customers; but also, as A.J. indicated, with some of our new technology, we've reduced the attrition rate of existing customers. And so it's a combination of the 2, reduce attrition and grow new customers that yields you a higher return as far as share of market.\nSteve Tusa : Right, right. And I guess to that point, I mean, what changed for you guys on that front? I mean, I don't -- when you just compare factually kind of your growth rates versus the market, they weren't that great ahead of the pandemic -- heading into the pandemic. I mean, did something -- did you kind of turn on something here where because of the e-commerce dynamic like people went to you guys because you had the technology ready? And was there something that kind of flipped for you guys specifically? Because I think the supply constraints in the industry, on net, probably would have hurt you guys because one of the major players that supplies you guys, I heard, was kind of out. So that shouldn't have helped you. Was there something that kind of flipped for you guys specifically here in the last couple of quarters?\nAlbert Nahmad : We're just great leaders. What can I tell you?\nSteve Tusa : Other than, of course, great management, other than that.\nAlbert Nahmad : Sometimes, I think that to see that you underestimate the earlier investments we were making, which was affecting growth rates of earnings. Maybe others were too short-term orientated. And -- but we didn't mind because we're in for the long-term. And so we may have been hurt by the recent growth rates in recent years. But we're starting to get a payback in what we do. And I'm optimistic that we'll do even better. What the industry will do? I have to say that being home because of the virus, and having, in some cases, record heat, did not hurt demand. It is a very hot summer and most of us are staying home. We don't go to restaurants, we don't go to movies, we don't go to supermarkets. And that means you're using cooling more than you normally would, and wear and tear on equipment does create needs for repairs and replacements.\nSteve Tusa : Right. How much was -- one last one for you. Pretty big difference between the resi growth rate in equipment and your total equipment growth rate and resi is obviously a big piece of that. How much was kind of commercial down for you guys?\nAlbert Nahmad : Paul or Barry?\nBarry Logan : Yes. The commercial in the U.S. is down, I would say, right at double-digits, and again, a slight improvement over where the second quarter was. And international is the larger impacting component, which is where we sell not to contractors internationally but also other distributors. So there's some changes in the channel internationally. So again, I will report what our international component looks like in our 10-Q in a couple of days.\nSteve Tusa : Sorry, one last quick one. What was price for you guys on that equipment, growth rate for this quarter? And are you seeing any of these OEMs that may have had supply issues get a little more aggressive as far as trying to kind of regain that market share so far?\nA.J. Nahmad : No. Really, we have not seen price on the equipment side. No, we have not seen price move a bit. A big change in the market dynamics.\nAlbert Nahmad : Will they increase prices in the New Year might be your question. And it's hard to say but my prediction would be they will.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks.\nAlbert Nahmad : Well, thanks for paying attention to our company. We think we're the best in the industry, we'll continue to be, and we look forward to the next quarter to report our progress. And in the meantime, stay healthy, stay safe. Thanks, again. Bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Albert Nahmad",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Watsco's third quarter earnings call. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO; and with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Executive Vice President; and Barry Logan, Executive Vice President. Now before we start, our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Before I report, let me first wish that you and your family are healthy and safe. Now on to our report. Watsco just completed an outstanding third quarter. EPS grew 25% to a record $2.76. Records were set for sales, gross profit, operating profit, operating margins, and net income. These results were driven by strong growth in our U.S. residential HVAC equipment business, which grew 19% during the quarter, and from operating efficiencies achieved throughout our network, as evidenced by the nominal change in SG&A.  Homeowners clearly are investing in their homes as HVAC replacement sales have remained strong from early summer through today. We also believe that greater adoption of our Watsco technologies has contributed to our results and led to gains in market share. Our best indication of this impact are two simple metrics. First, customers that use Watsco technologies are growing at a much faster rate than non-users. Second, we are experiencing minimal attrition among active users on a year-over-year basis. Now keep this in mind, we continue to invest in our platforms and to drive for greater adoption by more customers. Here are some examples of our progress. Weekly users of our mobile apps have grown 31% since last year, with over 100,000 downloads. E-commerce transactions have grown by 19% this year to nearly 1 million online orders, which is about $1.5 billion dollars in annual rate at the moment. Our annualized e-commerce sales run rate is 32% versus 29% at the end of last year, and in certain markets, the use of e-commerce is over 50%. Our dockside pickup services have expanded to more locations and now include non-contact payment functionality. This technology has only been available for a few months and already over 12,000 orders were fulfilled during the quarter by more than 2,000 unique users. Two of our newer innovative platforms have gained momentum, we call them, OnCall Air, and the second one CreditForComfort. These platforms provide digital connectivity for contractors and homeowners when making proposals and buying and financing replacement systems. Contractors using our, what we call, OnCall Air platform provided digital proposals to over 39,000 households during the quarter, and generated $114 million in sales, nearly double that of last year. Our CreditForComfort platform processed double the number of digital financing applications resulting in an 87% increase in third-party funded loans. Investments in inventory management software have also benefited us this year with inventory turns improving 25 basis points over last year, and of course, contributing to cash flow and operating efficiency.  All of this is exciting, but we believe Watsco technologies are only scratching the surface of their full potential.  As always, free feel to schedule a Zoom call with us and we can further explain our technology and progress. We also strengthened Watsco's balance sheet this quarter, we generated record operating cash flow of $373 million, which is far away a record for the year so far, and we have no debt at this time. Importantly, we have the capacity to make almost any size investment to grow in our business. And I always like to comment that we're in a $40 billion industry, in which we are only $5 billion, so we have lots of room for growth. And then finally, one more very important thought. Our results are a testament to the efforts of our teams across the Watsco network. We deeply appreciate their commitment.  With that, A.J., Paul, Barry and I are happy to answer your questions. Why don't we turn to Paul Johnston for that answer? Oh, no. You misunderstood. Go ahead, Paul, and explain that. I think they previously came in equipment, that's what he is -- that's what we're trying to say. Paul? Yes. Paul? As you heard earlier, we do have investments in inventory management software that's considerably helping us to maintain and grow revenues with less investment in inventory. Maybe more color can be provided by Barry or Paul. Either one jump in. UV light. Yes. And being the industry leader and having the scale that we have when new products, roll out from new companies, whether they're start up or mature companies, we often get the call first as a distribution partner and we're getting first look at a lot of these products. That's a great question and all the OEMs were stressed. And from our observation is they kept up with us as best they could as they did with other distributors. So yes, did we lose a little bit of sales? Probably. But overall, I think they kept up with us, and as I said, with other distributors as well. And they're working hard. They're not messing around here. They know this is an opportunity so they run hard. Anybody want to add color to that? Well, I don't think that OEMs discriminated for us as opposed to their other customers. I don't believe that. But I think they were a part for all their customers. Paul, do you want to take a shot? I think that's well said, yes. But Dave, I think you're spot on. Being the largest distributor dealing with 1,000 vendors, we believe that we're able to negotiate, due to our volume buying, as good the prices as anybody and we believe that should help us gain share. But we think that we have more work to do in order to get the growth rates going. I don't -- certainly don't think it's going to stay at -- proportionately at this level. I'm very hopeful that parts and supplies will increase as a percentage of our overall business. And some of the things we're doing with our OEMs, I think, will assist that. Don't count us out on parts and supply just because... That was much more eloquent than me, Barry. He is. Barry, that he will answer that, so let's get this up. Yes, the largest cost of that discussion is delivering products from 1 of our 600 stores within 10, 15 miles of where it sits. And that activity-based cost used to be largely a branch manager figuring it out every day. And then with technology, how do we help empower, enable and change the game of how that local process is done. Or if it's moving inventory around, then it becomes embedded in the inventory optimization project that we have going on. So as we said in the call, scratching the surface. But yes, some of that scratching is having an impact on results. Well, I would say that your conclusion is correct. It's very hard to answer. It started in the third quarter. It is not tailed. I mean the growth rate -- there is growth going on at the start of the fourth quarter. How long that will be sustained is hard to say. But we'll just have to see. Our game plan is, if we can't get it from industry growth, we're going to get it from the share growth. We're going to use the advantage of our technology. So unless somebody can add can add to that, Barry, Paul, A.J.? I would say that the first, I'm going to comment on like what you've said. For the last 2 years, we've reported over and over again that we were doing, more than that time, significant investments in our technology and I don't think that's going to stop. It may even increase because we do think it's a competitive edge to do what we're doing. But obviously, some of that's being offset by other efficiencies that are occurring. Barry, my SG&A expert? I'll take a shot at the first half of October. Strong demand. Will that be sustained? I don't know. But first half of October, we got smiles on our face. Maybe because we're gaining share, maybe because the industry is doing better. It's hard to say but I like it. I think most of that would have been completed in the -- during September. Any sort of backlog that the contractor would have had. So I don't think that's an issue right now. Yes. Let him say what he was going to, what did you say, Josh? And then, Paul, you had something. That's an easy one. We have consistently followed the principle that we will share our growth with the stockholders. And I have a history of doing that year after year for a number of years. We see no reason not to continue that, no reason at all, especially given that we have no debt and strong cash flow. So I would say that we're going to sustain what we've been doing in the past, unless there's something that comes up that I'm unaware of it. But right now, it looks pretty good to do that. Don't forget cash flow has been, to a large extent, a little greater than earnings, and that gives us additional opportunity to do more for our stockholders. Thank you. That's a good question. Barry, so sustain your 8% idea. How we're going to collect it, yes. Okay, Barry. I know where you're going. But Steve, also remember, our customer is the homeowner, and the unemployment rate is much lower with homeowners than it is for people who are renters. There is facts there. And the second thing that we mentioned on really gaining market share is a combination of 2 things: one, is acquiring new customers; but also, as A.J. indicated, with some of our new technology, we've reduced the attrition rate of existing customers. And so it's a combination of the 2, reduce attrition and grow new customers that yields you a higher return as far as share of market. We're just great leaders. What can I tell you? Sometimes, I think that to see that you underestimate the earlier investments we were making, which was affecting growth rates of earnings. Maybe others were too short-term orientated. And -- but we didn't mind because we're in for the long-term. And so we may have been hurt by the recent growth rates in recent years. But we're starting to get a payback in what we do. And I'm optimistic that we'll do even better. What the industry will do? I have to say that being home because of the virus, and having, in some cases, record heat, did not hurt demand. It is a very hot summer and most of us are staying home. We don't go to restaurants, we don't go to movies, we don't go to supermarkets. And that means you're using cooling more than you normally would, and wear and tear on equipment does create needs for repairs and replacements. Paul or Barry? Will they increase prices in the New Year might be your question. And it's hard to say but my prediction would be they will. Well, thanks for paying attention to our company. We think we're the best in the industry, we'll continue to be, and we look forward to the next quarter to report our progress. And in the meantime, stay healthy, stay safe. Thanks, again. Bye."

            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "Exactly. You are on the right track, the largest part of our equipment business is the U.S. residential business by far. To a lesser extent there's commercial U.S. and there's international which is -- which has a slant toward the commercial applied market. So, that core-core business of ours which is residential U.S. is what -- is up 19% this quarter. The commercial U.S. market is recovering but it is still not anywhere near the growth rate of obviously residential. International is what has been more impacted than anything else. You'll find some of our international data in our 10-Q when we file it. But that's a market where it is much tilted towards the commercial market and those markets have been more impacted than anything else we operate. But as I say that from a profit perspective, from a EBIT perspective -- actually our international business is up this quarter from a profit perspective. Although the sales have been impacted, they've done a great job with managing the business and actually are more profitable this quarter internationally. First one, inventory, I -- Paul, I -- you have layers to this. But big picture, we started the year, early this year talking about inventory being something we want to improve inventory turns from 4 to 5, is a very straightforward goal, a very straightforward math calculation to say what that's worth in cash flow and that's before any of the disruptions or any of the noise of supply chain discussions that we've had. So we started the year with that in mind as a strong source of cash flow, as well as obviously an operational efficiency that can be gained through our 600 locations that we operate. So that's been an initiative before any of this noise. And Paul, you can comment on current state of what's going on with the supply chain and so on. And Jeff, what I would add is just to -- A.J. kind of -- we talked about before on platforms and technology and people and execution. IAQ is now part of every single recommendations in our platform called OnCall Air, OnCall Air is this presentation platform that contractors give to homeowners to sell them solutions. And again, that would be an example where old school, a contractor may or may not present that feature or benefit, may or may not add it to the collection of things he is doing.  Now, it's embedded in the technology, embedded in the presentation, embedded in the proposal that's being given. So looking at the future state, that kind of thing is very important. And it's also using all the product data that we've curated for the last five years with not just a sales platform, it's an information platform of all the products, all the data, all the SKUs, all the connectivity to e-commerce to allow for fulfillment. It's really I think again a terrific platform, really go into that future state of how things can be sold in the home. And I'd just like to add another layer to that, if needed, probably not needed but I feel like saying it anyway is -- there is no, I think, big macro dynamic, Dave, where parts are suddenly becoming a solution. The equipment growth rates have been too consistent. And through today, as we said in the opening comments, that consistency is through today. So I think what we're alluding to is, this is a market share gain for parts and supplies also. And we have probably 15 competitors in Miami selling parts and supplies, and it's the most fragmented part of our industry as distributors that sell parts and supply. So where A.J. is alluding to as well as this can become a technology play in a far different advanced way than what's being done historically and it's an opportunity for us. Yes. It's certainly not 50%. But the OnCall Air concept that differs from the historical sales concept is, giving the homeowner a good-better-best solution which includes IAQ. It's not just adding IAQ, it's adding a bundle. It's selling higher efficiencies. And then the fact that consumer financing can then make those higher efficiencies and larger bundles more affordable is part of the holy grail of what we're trying to create here. So I wouldn't say IAQ adds -- Paul, you may know, but it's not just adding 10% or whatever the percent might be. It's presenting this bundle in a very connected way with the homeowner that's going to respond to it differently than if a contractor happens to remember it when he's writing down on paper on an Office Depot form. So far different sales process is really what it's about. Again, every distributor has 2 things they're managing, SG&A, obviously, the fixed cost that he would like to lower over time and the variable cost that he don't mind spending because they're -- usually, they're driven by sales or margin growth. So we're no different. The key this year has been to get cost -- fixed costs down. How do we take some of the latent costs in our -- not just renting facilities, but any measure of latent cost in our stores down. And that's where we've been accomplishing the most this year. Renting facilities, for example, was lower year-over-year on 6% higher sales would be an example. Some of the fixed payroll where we're examining really the technology benefits that might come. This has been obviously a climate to address some of those costs and then try to push for the permanence of them as they go into next year. So I'll have a great analytic for you to say X amount of fixed cost has been reduced and will stay permanent. But culturally, there's not 1 of our 30 regional presidents that hasn't taken the task, their own local cost structure to accomplish that. The variable cost will be driven by sales. There will be more commissions. There will be more performance-based comp. There will be more delivery costs as the business is growing the way it is, and that's obviously embedded in our third quarter performance where you see SG&A flat. We have growth in variable. We have offsetting reductions in fixed. And again, culturally, just it's a huge effort to go on to sustain this because it's -- they can be more permanent than temporary benefits, especially on the fixed cost side. I think when the industry numbers are all added up, I mean, obviously, there's going to be an anomaly in shipment data coming out of the industry association in Q3 where the industry is going to show this huge bubble of growth. But when you put it all together, we're going to have to look at it at year-end as far as what the actual growth in equipment sales were for the year. And I think going forward then, the pent-up demand from second quarter that we pulled -- pushed into the third quarter, we're still seeing, as Al said, some of that in the October time frame. It's a crystal ball outlook as far as what's going to occur in 2021. I think when everything is added up, it's going to look like a pretty normal year for the industry. Right, right. I'll try to kind of -- it's a good question. I looked through that. And I think you have to look at things on a year-to-date basis and smooth things out and then ask the question. So year-to-date, the U.S. residential market, our business is up 8%. And there's virtually no price in that. So that's simply machines breaking, the same number we're going to break. No matter what is going on in the economy or COVID, machines don't know. So you have an 8% growth rate, largely driven by a healthy replacement market, contractor confidence to go in and install the right thing or upgrade the right thing and get the work done. And that type of growth rate is above average but not so far out in the space that it doesn't seem sustainable because again, I think homeowner, contractor, distributor, even OEM is feeling this kind of health in the market and if stay-at-home added something, fine. But I think in big picture, 8% sustaining itself is not out of the question or out of the ordinary. And some of the short-term choppiness, you need to look through it, I think. Yes. First, Ryan, I was right. I mean, $30 million of technology spending today didn't exist 5, 6 years ago, and that's 50 basis points of EBIT margin. We could have built an elaborate pro forma EBIT calculation for everyone but we didn't do that. And instead, we just tell people, this is the right way to do it and execute it. So obviously, the rate of increase in that spending has diminished as things are maturing. And Al is right, we will spend more. But this is a good time to talk about it. It's very clear that sales, margin, share, efficiency, other technologies that we're building beyond the customer-facing stuff has started to have an impact. So I think as an inflection point, that's a nice big cliche\u0301 to ponder. I think the basic question is, is it having an impact? And answer is yes, it clearly is. And culturally, when you talk about new normal, again, I go back to the 30 leaders across Watsco's footprint. There isn't 1 of the 30 that isn't looking at their business differently because of their actions this year and because the technology is just beginning to really influence all aspects of their locations in their business. Josh, just to add to it, I would say that if 80% of what we do is in the Sunbelt, and there's -- people didn't are going to wait until next spring. I think we've always been, and to the extent, we'll always be this kind of real-time way of looking at us in terms of our sales and our seasonality. So I don't think we'd see the deferrals. I think where we see deferrals right now is the commercial market that's built the backlog, waiting for jobs, waiting for money, waiting for contractors to fulfill backlog in the commercial market. I would say that's the only part of our business where that might be true for next year. That's right. Yes. Although the indoor air quality is a big theme now of the commercial as well. Carrier, for example, has introduced equipment that's used in the applied world for buildings and that sort of thing. Very useful to attack on the spread of the virus. Well, the -- I mean, just to be philosophical and then I'll actually answer your question. There are 2 things that happened this year that are interesting and frankly surprised me. And 1 is that we have another year where the mix of high efficiency is growing. So if there is a consumer risk this year, it's not evident in the mix of products we're selling. It's a positive and it speaks to the homeowner contractor relationship as that's playing out. Secondly is... That's maybe a little strong, but rounded, that's probably okay. The other -- I think it's probably a little high but that's just my feeling. The other thing that no one ever asked about is contractor credit. When we sell $5 billion of stuff to contractors, 80% of it is on credit. So we have to wait 30 days to get our money, and it's the best -- one of the best leading indicators of how our contractors' health is... And we see almost the lowest default rate, lowest bad debt, lowest kind of risk factors and credit than we have seen. And again, it does speak to the idea that contractors are active and closing deals. And if we're helping them through our technology, great, but does speak I think to the industry and to our contractor relationships I think in terms of health of that end market and how homeowners are reacting to what's going on when something breaks or if something needs to get replaced and so on. So I don't know if that adds to 8%, Steve. Market share gains, I think, will prove out this year adding to that 8%. I feel like that momentum is only getting started for longer-term body of work we're doing with our OEMs right now. It may be -- time will tell, but I think that we can't underestimate the health of what's going on with the contractor, homeowner relationships that are out there. Yes. Yes. The commercial in the U.S. is down, I would say, right at double-digits, and again, a slight improvement over where the second quarter was. And international is the larger impacting component, which is where we sell not to contractors internationally but also other distributors. So there's some changes in the channel internationally. So again, I will report what our international component looks like in our 10-Q in a couple of days."

            "name": "A.J. Nahmad",
            "content": "Yes. I think Paul, your last point was important and that it's not just the amount of inventory or even the turns of the inventory, but it's the quality of the inventory. And that is absolutely a function of the technology that we're using and the people, the teams that are using them. That's been a major focus and there's been major achievements there. And also given the constraints on supply with the demand going on, it's important to note how great of a job our team from the field did, signing products that our customers filled -- or their orders filled, so they could sell product. So that was really a herculean effort. And we're proud of them. Yes. It's -- it definitely is an important piece of our business now. Historically, as you know, IAQ has been something we always talk about. But I think definitely, the pandemic made it into a frontline product area. It's growing very, very rapidly, 2 or 3 times what it was in prior year. Excited about all the new products that we're putting in new lights. Yes, UV-C lights, air cleaners, filtration, the entire gambit is growing rapidly. And very good and I think it's sustainable. Sure. OnCall Air is a business that we built that has a software tool, that is sold on a FAS basis to contractors to help them sell in the house. So it replaces the yellow carbon copy pieces of paper that they previously used to write proposals on. And it's sure a full digital interactive experience with lots of product information and videos about the product offering and enables contractors to sell with a good-better-best offering. And all those add-ons and accessories and recommendations that Barry was hinting at are embedded in the tool. Consumer financing options are embedded in the tool. It's basically a modern sales platform designed to only for HVAC contractors. And the contractors that are using it are growing faster, they're getting bigger tickets, they're closing more deals. And it's also a tremendous start. Thank you. Yes, in our product information management system now, we've mastered about 800,000 SKUs in the industry. Yes. I mentioned it earlier, there's a herculean effort in the field. Where there was product shortages, our teams found ways to fill orders anyway. There's a lot of warehouse transfers going on. There was a lot of helping contractors find, if they were looking for product A but we didn't have enough of it, we could substitute a product B and get them at a competitive price. There's a lot of little wins like that, that helped our customer fulfilled. No. I was going to say stay tuned. That's a new major data-driven initiative that we're just kicking off now in earnest, and that will be kind of a next-generation effort on parts and supplies. Well done. Barry is a very eloquently. In every way, in every way. Just 1 more thing on that. In OnCall Air, it's no longer just a static proposal. It's a digital interactive sales experience, so just like buying online when we all buy -- when we all shop online in Amazon and others, we're seeing other products that might make sense in this purchase. That happens in the OnCall Air experience. And it also happens in our B2B e-commerce as our customers shop on our website. And the line item has fascinating statistics but the line items for invoice on our online stores, meaning our subsidiary's website, is 30% higher than offline sales. And that's the number that stayed true for a while. Yes. I'll add to that on the variable cost side, well, all SG&A -- the third biggest bucket of all of our SG&A is freight. That's the cost of moving product into our locations, between our locations and out of our locations to our customers. We fill orders. And I hate to be a broken record on technology, but we now have new technologies that exposes more data and enables more optimization around how we do all of that, how we bring the product in, how we deliver it to our customers, just making smarter decisions day-by-day, transaction-by-transaction, of which we do 7 million-plus a year to optimize costs and gain efficiencies. Early innings of that. I would say TBD. Yes, that's the goal, right, is to be ever more efficient. No. Really, we have not seen price on the equipment side. No, we have not seen price move a bit. A big change in the market dynamics."

            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Yes, I'd like to make sure I understand. Everything but equipment? Yes, resi is equipment. It's gas furnaces, coils, air handlers, split systems for residential. So, it's included in the total equipment. Well, yes, we had some moderate growth in the parts and supply side of our business, which we indicated, a little heavier on the part side in mid-single-digits. And that, obviously, is an enhancement to our gross profit. So, that mix did help a bit. Yes. Barry, why don't you handle that as far as what is offshore versus onshore? Yes. The supply chain rapidly recovered in the September timeframe and pretty much got back into a normal flow. And we started seeing inventory flowing again. We're not really experiencing the big stock outs. We got some spotty issues with inventory on the supply chain side. But for the most part, I think the OEMs have recovered nicely. As far as our inventory levels, we were able to not only use the technology that we've invested in to improve the inventory turns, but we were also able to improve the quality of our inventory. And so now we're able to analyze by branch, by division, by product line, by SKU exactly the types of inventories that we need to have in place. So it was -- it's been a wonderful investment that we've made in it. I think the dividends that we're going to receive from it are going to be paying back over the next several years. And our OEMs, like Al said, came too magnificently. We were working with them daily. We had conversations with all of our major OEMs on a daily basis, talking to what our needs were, where our needs were. And they really jumped through hoops to be able to help us fill open orders where we had spot shortages. It was very well done. Well said, I agree with that. It's not a material size in our market. The VRF is and by itself. The general duct-free split market is becoming larger and larger each year and continues to grow in the low 20s. VRF, we had a good quarter for VRF. It did grow. It kind of suffered in the second quarter a little bit. A similar situation that you had with all commercial products because that's generally where VRF goes. And so it did have a downtick to it but then a recovery because most of the jobs that we have with VRF are long-term jobs that are forecast out 6, 8, 9 months. Yes. That's a great question and one that we have to do a lot of forensics to try to identify exactly what the impact of it was. Right now, I would not say that it really had a big impact because we were obviously going hand to mouth with our inventory. So it became very, very difficult for us to go out -- reach out and take somebody else's customer, if you will, and provide inventory to them when we were trying to maintain the growth of our customers in the market. So a little... Yes. A little bit more time, I think, under our belt, I think we'll have a better feel on that. Definitely. Yes, that is a marketplace that we have a strong focus on, as far as you know how -- what are the dynamics of where we can make that market grow. And of course, a lot of that is going to be market share. It's going to be product availability, it's going to be using our technology to be able to replenish dealer stocks in a more rapid economical manner for the dealer. So there are a number of efforts that we can get into to make that market grow again. And there are various layers of IAQ. IAQ is not just 1 product. You've got a number of different products. You can tier into the installation. So a baseline installation would be -- if you use just minimum IAQ products would be probably around 10% of the install price could go as high as 25% to 30%. Just 1 more point there. Whether it comes from industry growth or share gain, I'll tell you 1 more detail is that our growth rate to new customers is higher than it's ever been, meaning we have more sales to more new customers. And we can attribute that to a number of factors, but we have more customers buying more products than ever. Absolutely. Yes. I think we're putting together some additional data on -- one of the things I keep hearing is that people had more replacement jobs because people were staying at home. And so they were running their air-conditioning longer. And I guess that sounds good on paper. I want to get underneath that and find out really if the data proves that correctly, were the run times actually longer in the Sunbelt, as Barry said, 80% of our business is in the Sunbelt. Were they actually longer in the Sunbelt because people were home and not at work or in school? And I think the jury is out on that a little bit right now."

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Albert Nahmad. Please go ahead, sir.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Watsco\u2019s second quarter earnings call. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO; and with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Executive Vice President; and Barry Logan, Executive Vice President. Before we start, our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by the SEC laws and regulations and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. First and foremost, I hope all of you and your families are healthy, safe and managing well. I\u2019m pleased to say Watsco is experiencing a very busy summer selling season. There are many heroic people in our company making an exceptional effort to serve and protect customers while protecting themselves. Our most sincere thanks to them. We also want to express our appreciation to our OEM and vendor partners who have done extraordinary things to react to the accelerated ramp up in demand. Since our last call in April, a steady recovery began in May, an acceleration to double-digit growth occurred in June and it continues into July. The growth occurred across our footprint and was driven by our U.S. residential HVAC equipment business which experienced 20% plus growth rates in June with similar trends in July. Homeowners are clearly investing in their homes as sales of replacements systems at higher efficiencies are accelerating. Sales of commercial HVAC refrigeration products which were soft early on in the quarter are now recovering. I\u2019m also glad to report that our industry leading technologies are contributing to our results in driving market share gains. Adoption and use of our mobile apps and e-commerce platforms have increased significantly as more customers use our technology. Our best measurement of impact is that customers that use our technology generally are growing faster than non-users of our technology. Examples of our progress, mobile app weekly average users has grown 34% over the last year to more than 22,000 with 100,000 total downloads, new processes were introduced to provide rapid on-boarding of e-commerce sales. So far this year the number of e-commerce users has grown 14% and the number of transaction is up by 12%. Our e-commerce sales run rate in June was 33% versus 29% in December 2019. And in certain markets our e-commerce run rate is now over 50% which kind of shows potential of this e-commerce platform. We also justified promotion of two other innovative platforms. They are called OnCall Air and CreditForComfort. These two platforms provide digital support for contractors and homeowners and connect proposals for buying products and for financing replacement systems.  Our contractors\u2019 fulfillment activities, which we refer to as curbside or dockside pickup expanded to more locations and soon will include contactless payment functionality. It is early -- it's in the early days that adopting and growth has been terrific to this point. As always, feel free to schedule a Zoom call with us and we can further explain our technology in progress. We believe these capabilities provide a differentiated customer experience by engaging with us digitally in every way. We also believe a new standard for contractor service has been established, which will serve us well in the long-term.  Also during the quarter, we improved operating efficiency by reducing costs. Same-store SG&A declined 7% with few store closings and loss of business across our network. Our financial position is evidenced by our balance sheet strengthened during the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of $216 million, the highest of any quarter in our history. Over the last 12 months, we've generated $529 million in cash flow versus net income of $285 million. Dividends have been increased and we have no debt at this time. Further financial analysis of our second quarter is provided in our press release.  And now with that, A.J., Paul, Barry and I are happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator instructions]. And our first question will come from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nJosh Pokrzywinski : So, I guess clearly some stimulus payments there helped put up a very good quarter relative to maybe the broader macro. But any regional commentary from Paul that you can share either at the Watsco level or maybe industry observations that can help square up that performance?\nAlbert Nahmad: But we don't like to share regional for competitive reasons. But Paul, the second part of the question? \nPaul Johnston: Have we seen any other trends in the industry? Well, obviously demand is high and we're constantly focused on trying to make sure that we can maintain the inventory to satisfy our customer needs. That's been a battle for the last 60 days, obviously. Pretty much demand has been has strong on the replacement side and picking up again on the supply side right now, and we hope it continues through the quarter. \nJosh Pokrzywinski : And then just on the technology initiatives, Al or A.J. I think most contractors, at least, kind of the bigger, more stable ones tend to use a couple of different brands, but are fairly sticky in that and not rotating around a lot. I guess, does that mean with the share gains or outgrowth or however you want to track the technology, is it just doing more business with customers that are already doing something with Watsco and just can do more or is it really causing folks to bring on a new distributor relationship? \nAlbert Nahmad: A.J. you want to answer that?\nA.J. Nahmad : Yes, sure. It's both. I mean, we touch a lot of contractors in North America. Some of them buy lots of products from us every day, some of them buy just a little bit of products from us every once in a while, but those are all targets to get a visibility and see the technology in action and what it can mean for their businesses and that outreach to customers, whether they're small customers of ours or not customers at all, getting them exposure to the tech, helping them understand how different it is doing business with our companies versus our competition is moving the needle.  So I guess to say it more succinctly, there are small customer of ours doing more business with us, and there are customers coming on board for the first time. And the technology is driving a lot of those conversations. \nAlbert Nahmad: Another way to look at it might be, Paul can you discuss here?\nPaul Johnston: Yes. I mean for the second quarter we definitely had market share increases. As you guys recognize the industry shipments were probably down in the 10% range for the second quarter and our residential sales were flat. So that's a pretty monumental move towards an increase in market share. And in the front half of the year the same numbers apply, the market was down, mid single-digits and Watsco basically was slightly up given what we did in the first quarter. So we are gaining share there. Proud to say we're gaining share in Canada. Those numbers come out faster than the U.S. numbers. So we're becoming a force in Canada again. So I'm very happy to see everything that's happening from a share perspective.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nStephen Volkmann: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I'm curious if you could comment a little bit around gross margin. I think that was a little better than some of us were expecting, especially given -- I think your mix is shifting a little bit more towards equipment, which I would have thought would be a margin headwind. So, just what's going on in gross margin? How should we think about that sort of going forward as business remains strong?\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry or Paul, somebody jump in with that one.\nBarry Logan: Yes. Stephen, good morning. You're right. As equipment grows at a much faster rate, algebraically our gross profit margin is impacted by that in terms of what you see optically on the face of the income statement. Also as we get through a selling season and a busy time and making the efforts to sell products, price and margin and cost and every day market-by-market, local competitive landscape, there's not one answer, there's 50 answers. There's 50 variables that are playing out every day. So this year is showing some improvement over the last year in terms of trend, but still there's a lot of work to do on margin, a lot of work to do as we get through the selling season and looking into next year and beyond.\nStephen Volkmann : Okay, thanks, Barry. Is there any reason to think the second quarter was unusually a little bit better than it would be or how do we think about the trajectory going forward?\nBarry Logan: Now, there's nothing remarkable or unremarkable about the second quarter Stephen, that would be a lead commentary.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead. \nDavid Manthey : Al, I believe that you said June and July month to-date were -- the June all in and July month to-date were up 20% year-on-year. First, did I hear that, right? And second, could you put that in the context of same-store daily sales for us? \nAlbert Nahmad: That was good. I enjoyed that. Barry?\nBarry Logan: Sure. Well, Dave. Yes, you heard right. And we did comment on trends. We are adjusting for sales days. Those are average selling day trends that you're hearing in the remarks.\nDavid Manthey : And that was based on residential air conditioning sales. That wasn\u2019t based on total, no?\nBarry Logan: Yes, in the press release, you read double-digit growth in June. And Al\u2019s remarks you hear, residential up 20%, that's what you're hearing. \nDavid Manthey : Got it. And that's same store daily sales. Okay. Second, looking at the operating expenses from the first to the second quarter, the reduction was impressive. Probably the most impressive we've seen in Watsco\u2019s history sequentially like that. You basically did $350 million more in revenues on $9 million lower OpEx sequentially. I know the company is very decentralized. But are there any major cost buckets you can talk about that drove that decline. And that's really unusual and a big drop?\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan : Hey, David. Well, again, I can't invite you to our Friday Zoom call with 35 core managers across Watsco. If I could, what you hear is what you said, decentralized challenges to constantly react to what's going on in the market. So, it was a Watsco pen and paper session, it's 35 managers going out and prosecuting what they believe is important to take care of customers, employees, they have markets where revenues were untouched that needed to deal with a cost structure in that respect. We had other markets that were more heavily impacted. They cut costs and [indiscernible 14:59] costs very aggressively in the short-term. And so the good news is this is all a local lead and reaction to what's going on in the marketplace that drove the cost. As a parent company, we certainly have the conversation, but it's all driven in the field. \nA.J. Nahmad: This is A.J. I just have to add, those 35 leaders or so have just been tremendously impressive during this whole period and the 5,000, 6,000 people that work for them, it's just unbelievable effort and spirit, and they deserve all the credit.\nDavid Manthey: Yes, it's really impressive, guys. Thank you.\nAlbert Nahmad: And this is Al. I mean the corporate cost of Watsco, corporate expenses is under 5% of SG&A. So for any level of reductions going on in the field, any reductions that you're seeing optically in terms of performance is all driven by them. So again, once again the credit belongs there.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jeff Hammond with Keybanc Capital Markets Incorporated. Please go ahead. \nJeff Hammond: So Paul mentioned, inventory being a challenge. Just talk about -- we picked up on our check, some of the OEMs, kind of struggling to get product out the door. And certainly it may be that expectation was demand was going to be weaker than it is. So can you just speak about your ability to get product, how quickly that kind of normalizes and how you're able to kind of keep up with these strong demand trends? \nPaul Johnston: Well, we can't speak for the OEMs, but I can tell you they're doing their best. It\u2019s complicated to get their supply lines to accelerate. But they've done it and they're doing a pretty good job. And I don't think they're going to lay off, they're going to continue to support the demand and God bless them. They're just great suppliers and not just the OEMs, but also the regular vendors. We've kept up our continuous cadence of orders, even in the down times of April and May. We continued replenishing the inventory. We didn't cancel any orders. We followed through with it. We have daily discussions with our primary OEMs. We have weekly discussions with our vendors. We're talking to them constantly about what their problems are and giving them lead time and a look at what we're doing and what our needs are going to be.  Also Barry and A.J. are mentioning the -- a more cohesive opportunity that we've had with senior managers talking every Friday and going through what their issues are. We're seeing more and more intra-company movement of inventory as one part of the country gets hot and the other one cools down on sales, we're able to move inventory intra-company, but also a new feature that we've been able to do with our new technology on inventory is intra-Watsco inventory where we're actually moving orders or inventory amongst the Watsco companies. So it's tough. It's still tough. We've had to do some substituting the product from time-to-time. But once again, I'm very, very proud of what our OEMs and our vendors have been able to provide us to-date. And we just hope they can continue all the way through the season.\nAlbert Nahmad: Every one of our OEMs has come to the party. They're functioning as best they can. And we're very grateful to them.\nJeff Hammond: Hopefully those aren\u2019t pool parties in Florida that they're coming to. Just on the -- you talked about the residential trends. Can you just talk about the commercial piece of the business, and any signs as markets kind of open back up, you're seeing some stabilization there. \nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I commented on that but I\u2019ll let Paul go ahead.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. Second quarter obviously was absolutely brutal on the commercial side. However, as states began to open up, we started to see some upticks, but we're not back to zero yet, obviously on the commercial rooftop side of our business. Applied has remained strong. And even commercial refrigeration we've seen good life in that in the month of July\u2026. \nJeff Hammond : Okay, and then just last one. Can you give us the tech spend in the quarter either in total or year-on-year, how much you expect that to be up for the year?\nAlbert Nahmad: It is running the same. And it will change from time to time as we see opportunities. So, don't think that's the end of it. I know that's a persistent question of yours. We're going to add as much as needed. Anything that we see we're going to invest, some of it will work and some of it will not but that's the business we're in, innovation. That's what Watsco is, an innovative business and we're going to -- we have the financial means to invest in it. But there hasn't been any dramatic change from recent spending. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Brett Linzey with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. \nBrett Linzey: Could you just update us on the efficiency mix trends in the quarter, any noticeable change whether it be mixed up or mixed down by homeowners, just a little bit of color there would be great?\nAlbert Nahmad: By homeowners. Paul, have you seen any data on that? \nPaul Johnston: Yes, we've seen some data on that. We've seen a mix up, where we've seen a bit more on the 16 SEER, 18 SEER front. It's not a remarkable change. I guess the thing it\u2019s been the most amazing to me this second quarter was I didn't see any material change in system change outs that people were replacing the entire system. They weren't just replacing the outdoor unit. So, the consumer would never have guessed is was acting fairly normal as far as what we've seen historically.\nAlbert Nahmad: Just an interesting data point on our technology, we mentioned OnCall Air in the prepared remarks. That tool is about helping contractors sell into homes, into building owners. And it provides a very modern, very feature rich platform to provide a beautiful modern experience in the sales process and without going into too specific, it is early days with a tool. High efficiency sales are much higher on that tool, and without the tool, in other words it\u2019s helping sell bigger tickets, higher margin products, and higher efficiency systems.\nBrett Linzey: And then maybe just shifting to price, what are you seeing from a pricing standpoint? Any intra, inter-quarter July price increases given the strength of the market here?\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul, have you seen any? \nPaul Johnston: No, I really haven't seen any price increases on the equipment side, there's been some commodity moves, which are normal this time of the season but nothing on the equipment side and nothing on the finished goods, supply and part side.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. \nChris Dankert : Kind of circling back to SG&A for just a moment. Again, really impressive, as David pointed out. I guess just out of curiosity, how quick does some of that spending had to turn back on, I know the mantra is, we're investing for the next 10 years. So again, I was also very surprised to see SG&A come down to the magnitude it did. Just any comments on hiring, on what it takes to kind of maintain this level of growth you've seen in June and July here? \nAlbert Nahmad: Well, so Barry, you\u2019re the futurist, given the gust of what you see is best you see it. Oh, gosh.\nBarry Logan: Well, I mean the big picture obviously is that we're a labor-driven company. If you visited our stores, you'd find five to 20 people helping customers. And to the extent that business is roaring, we will have more resources, more costs dealing with that issue. So that's a good problem to have where much of our labor can be variable or discretionary in a way that can be tied to the sales trends. So that will occur and we will see SG&A spend creeping up as business volume drives it. That's part of being a distribution company and inherent in the distribution model. But we've also challenged the 35 leaders to look at under every rock over the last two or three months and determine what they can really change in terms of mindset or sacredness, or how do they react to the technology flow that's going on, really challenging their status quo. That's where as a parent company and our culture we can have an impact. It\u2019s challenging that status quo in all of these markets. So that is going on as well.  I would expect there to be efficiencies that we can sustain well beyond just this temporary state that we're in. How much and how material? We'll find out as we get through this year. And that's sort of being a futurist, I know that we're a better company today. 60, 90 days into this and the cost structure is a portion of that improvement that we've made and we'll see how much of it once we get into next year. I wouldn't want to try to have you to guess right now. \nChris Dankert: And then again both your labor force and your customer labor force is a little more specialized, skilled. But again, we have seen some issues with guys not being able to show up or being kind of enticed away from certain jobs. Is any difficulty in labor availability either for you or your customers that's having any meaningful impact? \nAlbert Nahmad: We don't know what our customers are having issues that way or not, but I can tell you that our workforce has been just terrific. And we're keeping up with demand and we're very appreciative and we expect that to continue. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan Securities. please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hey guys. Good morning. Congrats on the execution and kind of a volatile quarter here. I'm just trying to put the pieces together. Did you have any significant difference in the performance of your suppliers on the equipment side in resi? \nAlbert Nahmad: No, they're all just doing the best they can. And they're all -- know the fit, know what's going on. They're very supportive. We're not their only customer, they're supporting the entire work -- their entire customer base. And they're just doing a great job. I'm just -- couldn't say nothing about them, every one of them. Yes. True partnerships. \nSteve Tusa: And you guys don't sell a ton of Lennox, right? \nAlbert Nahmad : I don't know that we sell any. Unless you have some ideas, we will continue to. \nSteve Tusa : I don't have any ideas right now, it sounds a little bit confusing. So, I guess if your kind of major brands are gaining share and they're -- I mean is there like an outlier in the industry that's really struggling to kind of deliver product that you guys don't sell? Because Lennox already reported and they're claiming to have gained share. You guys are flat, they were down 6. I am just trying to kind of -- is everybody on the same boat do you see like or are there some that are struggling more than others?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I would say that all major equipment brands that we have are doing well. I mean the issue is, how quickly can they produce and get the product to us, but they're all doing well and they're all very supportive. I couldn't be happier with it. \nSteve Tusa: Right. How do you guys look at the inventory situation, where the inventory stand today and then will you -- how you kind of play that out in the back half of the year? \nAlbert Nahmad: That's a very good question, because the inventory has come down. But part of that is the tools that we've -- our technology group has come up with, very good technology. I don't know how much detail you want to get at that but we're happy to. Well, A.J, go ahead and talk about this. \nA.J. Nahmad: Sure, So, some of the or a lot of the inventory reduction is because of supply chain constraint, and the -- it\u2019s non-excessive but extreme demand. But also to the broader point of, we are doing better managing inventory. We have new tools and technologies, better teams, better system, better focus and daily effort on what we call non-performing inventory, and moving low performers, SKUs that don't sell in one place, moving them around. And I would say a significant portion of the inventory reduction we've seen is about getting our inventory position healthier. And that should be sustained and continued over the next \u2026.\nSteve Tusa: Right, so you're kind of using these tools to maintain kind of a lean inventory position while you're delivering and when you get to the back half of the year, there's not some need for a big kind of load up heading into next year. Do you feel comfortable with what you have?\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes, I wouldn't say lean, I would say healthy, right? To put products at the right place at the right time is the key. \nAlbert Nahmad: The term we use is inventory effectiveness as opposed to inventory turns, how effective is our inventory. Before we had these tools, can you imagine trying to manage hundreds of thousands of SKUs and try to regulate or try to figure out where they should be in 600 branches? And the math is what you heard. And so the new tools that we have -- we have meetings every day with our senior inventory management teams for every one of the Watsco companies and sharing their information, sharing data among those people has been just invaluable. When I look at the technology gains that we've made, for me, personally, the inventory systems are just magnificent. \nA.J. Nahmad: And they're going to get better. Because we haven't implemented the tools throughout the company yet. We\u2019ve just partially through it.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks, please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, let me just close with what\u2019s on everybody\u2019s mind, the pandemic. We truly wish all of you to stay healthy and stay safe. We are staying at home here as much as we can and just want everybody to have the best possible outcome from this terrible virus. Bye now. Thank you for attending.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

And this is Al. I mean the corporate cost of Watsco, corporate expenses is under 5% of SG&A. So for any level of reductions going on in the field, any reductions that you're seeing optically in terms of performance is all driven by them. So again, once again the credit belongs there. Every one of our OEMs has come to the party. They're functioning as best they can. And we're very grateful to them. Well, I commented on that but I'll let Paul go ahead. It is running the same. And it will change from time to time as we see opportunities. So, don't think that's the end of it. I know that's a persistent question of yours. We're going to add as much as needed. Anything that we see we're going to invest, some of it will work and some of it will not but that's the business we're in, innovation. That's what Watsco is, an innovative business and we're going to -- we have the financial means to invest in it. But there hasn't been any dramatic change from recent spending. By homeowners. Paul, have you seen any data on that? Just an interesting data point on our technology, we mentioned OnCall Air in the prepared remarks. That tool is about helping contractors sell into homes, into building owners. And it provides a very modern, very feature rich platform to provide a beautiful modern experience in the sales process and without going into too specific, it is early days with a tool. High efficiency sales are much higher on that tool, and without the tool, in other words it's helping sell bigger tickets, higher margin products, and higher efficiency systems. Paul, have you seen any? Well, so Barry, you're the futurist, given the gust of what you see is best you see it. Oh, gosh. We don't know what our customers are having issues that way or not, but I can tell you that our workforce has been just terrific. And we're keeping up with demand and we're very appreciative and we expect that to continue. No, they're all just doing the best they can. And they're all -- know the fit, know what's going on. They're very supportive. We're not their only customer, they're supporting the entire work -- their entire customer base. And they're just doing a great job. I'm just -- couldn't say nothing about them, every one of them. Yes. True partnerships. I don't know that we sell any. Unless you have some ideas, we will continue to. Well, I would say that all major equipment brands that we have are doing well. I mean the issue is, how quickly can they produce and get the product to us, but they're all doing well and they're all very supportive. I couldn't be happier with it. That's a very good question, because the inventory has come down. But part of that is the tools that we've -- our technology group has come up with, very good technology. I don't know how much detail you want to get at that but we're happy to. Well, A.J, go ahead and talk about this. The term we use is inventory effectiveness as opposed to inventory turns, how effective is our inventory. Before we had these tools, can you imagine trying to manage hundreds of thousands of SKUs and try to regulate or try to figure out where they should be in 600 branches? And the math is what you heard. And so the new tools that we have -- we have meetings every day with our senior inventory management teams for every one of the Watsco companies and sharing their information, sharing data among those people has been just invaluable. When I look at the technology gains that we've made, for me, personally, the inventory systems are just magnificent. Well, let me just close with what's on everybody's mind, the pandemic. We truly wish all of you to stay healthy and stay safe. We are staying at home here as much as we can and just want everybody to have the best possible outcome from this terrible virus. Bye now. Thank you for attending."

            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "Yes. Stephen, good morning. You're right. As equipment grows at a much faster rate, algebraically our gross profit margin is impacted by that in terms of what you see optically on the face of the income statement. Also as we get through a selling season and a busy time and making the efforts to sell products, price and margin and cost and every day market-by-market, local competitive landscape, there's not one answer, there's 50 answers. There's 50 variables that are playing out every day. So this year is showing some improvement over the last year in terms of trend, but still there's a lot of work to do on margin, a lot of work to do as we get through the selling season and looking into next year and beyond. Now, there's nothing remarkable or unremarkable about the second quarter Stephen, that would be a lead commentary. Sure. Well, Dave. Yes, you heard right. And we did comment on trends. We are adjusting for sales days. Those are average selling day trends that you're hearing in the remarks. Yes, in the press release, you read double-digit growth in June. And Al's remarks you hear, residential up 20%, that's what you're hearing. Hey, David. Well, again, I can't invite you to our Friday Zoom call with 35 core managers across Watsco. If I could, what you hear is what you said, decentralized challenges to constantly react to what's going on in the market. So, it was a Watsco pen and paper session, it's 35 managers going out and prosecuting what they believe is important to take care of customers, employees, they have markets where revenues were untouched that needed to deal with a cost structure in that respect. We had other markets that were more heavily impacted. They cut costs and [indiscernible 14:59] costs very aggressively in the short-term. And so the good news is this is all a local lead and reaction to what's going on in the marketplace that drove the cost. As a parent company, we certainly have the conversation, but it's all driven in the field. Well, I mean the big picture obviously is that we're a labor-driven company. If you visited our stores, you'd find five to 20 people helping customers. And to the extent that business is roaring, we will have more resources, more costs dealing with that issue. So that's a good problem to have where much of our labor can be variable or discretionary in a way that can be tied to the sales trends. So that will occur and we will see SG&A spend creeping up as business volume drives it. That's part of being a distribution company and inherent in the distribution model. But we've also challenged the 35 leaders to look at under every rock over the last two or three months and determine what they can really change in terms of mindset or sacredness, or how do they react to the technology flow that's going on, really challenging their status quo. That's where as a parent company and our culture we can have an impact. It's challenging that status quo in all of these markets. So that is going on as well.  I would expect there to be efficiencies that we can sustain well beyond just this temporary state that we're in. How much and how material? We'll find out as we get through this year. And that's sort of being a futurist, I know that we're a better company today. 60, 90 days into this and the cost structure is a portion of that improvement that we've made and we'll see how much of it once we get into next year. I wouldn't want to try to have you to guess right now."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "A.J. Nahmad",
            "content": "Yes, sure. It's both. I mean, we touch a lot of contractors in North America. Some of them buy lots of products from us every day, some of them buy just a little bit of products from us every once in a while, but those are all targets to get a visibility and see the technology in action and what it can mean for their businesses and that outreach to customers, whether they're small customers of ours or not customers at all, getting them exposure to the tech, helping them understand how different it is doing business with our companies versus our competition is moving the needle.  So I guess to say it more succinctly, there are small customer of ours doing more business with us, and there are customers coming on board for the first time. And the technology is driving a lot of those conversations. This is A.J. I just have to add, those 35 leaders or so have just been tremendously impressive during this whole period and the 5,000, 6,000 people that work for them, it's just unbelievable effort and spirit, and they deserve all the credit. Sure, So, some of the or a lot of the inventory reduction is because of supply chain constraint, and the -- it's non-excessive but extreme demand. But also to the broader point of, we are doing better managing inventory. We have new tools and technologies, better teams, better system, better focus and daily effort on what we call non-performing inventory, and moving low performers, SKUs that don't sell in one place, moving them around. And I would say a significant portion of the inventory reduction we've seen is about getting our inventory position healthier. And that should be sustained and continued over the next .... Yes, I wouldn't say lean, I would say healthy, right? To put products at the right place at the right time is the key. And they're going to get better. Because we haven't implemented the tools throughout the company yet. We've just partially through it."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Have we seen any other trends in the industry? Well, obviously demand is high and we're constantly focused on trying to make sure that we can maintain the inventory to satisfy our customer needs. That's been a battle for the last 60 days, obviously. Pretty much demand has been has strong on the replacement side and picking up again on the supply side right now, and we hope it continues through the quarter. Yes. I mean for the second quarter we definitely had market share increases. As you guys recognize the industry shipments were probably down in the 10% range for the second quarter and our residential sales were flat. So that's a pretty monumental move towards an increase in market share. And in the front half of the year the same numbers apply, the market was down, mid single-digits and Watsco basically was slightly up given what we did in the first quarter. So we are gaining share there. Proud to say we're gaining share in Canada. Those numbers come out faster than the U.S. numbers. So we're becoming a force in Canada again. So I'm very happy to see everything that's happening from a share perspective. Well, we can't speak for the OEMs, but I can tell you they're doing their best. It's complicated to get their supply lines to accelerate. But they've done it and they're doing a pretty good job. And I don't think they're going to lay off, they're going to continue to support the demand and God bless them. They're just great suppliers and not just the OEMs, but also the regular vendors. We've kept up our continuous cadence of orders, even in the down times of April and May. We continued replenishing the inventory. We didn't cancel any orders. We followed through with it. We have daily discussions with our primary OEMs. We have weekly discussions with our vendors. We're talking to them constantly about what their problems are and giving them lead time and a look at what we're doing and what our needs are going to be.  Also Barry and A.J. are mentioning the -- a more cohesive opportunity that we've had with senior managers talking every Friday and going through what their issues are. We're seeing more and more intra-company movement of inventory as one part of the country gets hot and the other one cools down on sales, we're able to move inventory intra-company, but also a new feature that we've been able to do with our new technology on inventory is intra-Watsco inventory where we're actually moving orders or inventory amongst the Watsco companies. So it's tough. It's still tough. We've had to do some substituting the product from time-to-time. But once again, I'm very, very proud of what our OEMs and our vendors have been able to provide us to-date. And we just hope they can continue all the way through the season. Yes. Second quarter obviously was absolutely brutal on the commercial side. However, as states began to open up, we started to see some upticks, but we're not back to zero yet, obviously on the commercial rooftop side of our business. Applied has remained strong. And even commercial refrigeration we've seen good life in that in the month of July.... Yes, we've seen some data on that. We've seen a mix up, where we've seen a bit more on the 16 SEER, 18 SEER front. It's not a remarkable change. I guess the thing it's been the most amazing to me this second quarter was I didn't see any material change in system change outs that people were replacing the entire system. They weren't just replacing the outdoor unit. So, the consumer would never have guessed is was acting fairly normal as far as what we've seen historically. No, I really haven't seen any price increases on the equipment side, there's been some commodity moves, which are normal this time of the season but nothing on the equipment side and nothing on the finished goods, supply and part side."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Watsco First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Albert Nahmad, CEO. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the first quarter earnings call. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. With me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Executive Vice President; and Barry Logan, Executive Vice President.  Now before we start, our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by the SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements.  Once again, good morning. I hope you and your families are healthy and getting through this period safely. Today's press release speaks to Watsco's strength and innovative spirit. These are attributes that we believe will bring comfort and confidence to our employees, our customers, OEM partners and our shareholders.  As we highlight in our press release, Watsco's financial strength is our most important attribute. Our philosophy of maintaining a strong balance sheet, low debt levels and ongoing access to capital is a significant advantage for us as we work through the impact of the pandemic.  We are well positioned to support our customers, employees and OEM partners while actively looking to invest in expanded product offerings, new locations and acquisitions to benefit our long term. Our ability to generate consistent cash flow also represents an important strength. Next week's scheduled dividends, which reflects an 11% increase, signals our confidence in our business.  We also operate in a great industry as HVAC products are fundamental necessities in homes and businesses. Local authorities in our markets have deemed our industry as essential. Our branches are open, providing needed products and services to our contractor customers. Watsco's technology team has also accomplished a lot in recent weeks, and adoption of our tech platforms is rapidly expanding.  In terms of day-to-day activities, our leaders took immediate actions in response to the pandemic. In many cases, in less than 48 hours. For example, branch locations were quickly transformed from retail walk-in showrooms to no-touch e-commerce curbside pickup centers. These changes have been well received, and our customers are asking us to sustain these services going forward. As to growth in investment, we remain in touch with great companies, knowing it's an opportune time for them to join the Watsco family. Our resources can help them grow and develop scale, and we can provide access to our great technology platforms.  In terms of results for the first quarter, sales growth was driven by strength in U.S. markets for residential HVAC equipment, which grew 5%. Sales and earnings in international markets declined due to softer market conditions and strong comparable results. Results also reflect 35 new locations, mostly from acquisitions completed in 2009 -- I'm sorry, 2019, including Peirce-Phelps, DASCO Supply and N&S Supply. These companies come with great leaders who are now part of our culture and team and are responding to current events in their respective markets.  Further analysis of our financial results are provided in our press release. I will not recite these details in my prepared remarks, but we will be happy to provide more color during the Q&A.  With that, A.J., Barry, Paul and I are happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: So appreciate that visibility is kind of tempered right now. But a couple of questions that I just want to make sure that, to the extent that you don't really have a ton of visibility, maybe you can still answer. I guess, first, have you seen any change in consumer behavior vis-a-vis trading down in efficiency or more repair versus replace? Anything that would give you an indication of, hey, people are still spending money, but under the surface, there's a couple of changes afoot. Has that shown up? Have you gotten that anecdotal feedback yet?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, our data expert, Paul Johnston.\nPaul Johnston: In the first quarter, we really didn't see it. We had a pretty good balance between system sales as opposed to just an outdoor replacement. Perhaps anecdotally, we'll see a little bit more of a repair or just replace the outdoor unit in the second quarter perhaps. Really, we're not at the consumer level. But what we hear from our contractors is regular checkups and service calls that don't require repair are pretty much being pushed out right now. Consumers aren't looking for someone to be in their home.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. Which would be more of a social distancing comment? Not a like, \"Hey, I ran out of money\" comment?\nPaul Johnston: Correct.\nAlbert Nahmad: But we also have a very effective consumer finance program that would help at such a thing, if it should come to that.\nPaul Johnston: Yes.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then I guess, I'll leave some of the other kind of near-term or macro questions to some of the other folks. But maybe to turn away from COVID for a second. Obviously, one of your major equipment partners is now kind of liberated from their multi-industry owner. What have been kind of the early changes, observations, engagement actions that you guys have seen with Carrier now?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, first, it was good news that they separated. They can be focused on our industry, and they are. They're very well led. They're very responsive. I think it's all great news going forward. I couldn't be happier.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Anything, I guess, more specific on where they're saying, \"Hey, we did this before, but now we've rethought that initiative.\" Anything, I guess, more tangible on an action?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I keep saying the focus, there -- they don't have to worry about dividends going up to the parent, United Technologies, that can be more focused than they are. And they assure us in investing in their own industry and their own company. It's all great news. There's nothing negative about what's occurred. And we very much like the leadership.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Brett Linzey of Vertical Research Partners.\nBrett Linzey: Hope you're well. Just a question on pricing. I guess, from your vantage point, are you seeing any signs of deflationary pressures across some of your markets as we've shifted in April here, be it on the equipment side or other products, which I think you typically do see at first in?\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul?\nPaul Johnston: No, we're not seeing any deflation. In fact, we've had some of our commodity pricing actually starting to move back up again. So no, no deflation.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. And I guess I'll ask the April question. Maybe just an update on the trend so far. You did mention in the release it decelerated. But just any sense on the magnitude? And then if you could maybe just drill down into the regional or state-by-state view. Any particular regions that stand out strong or weak?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, in terms of April, we don't like to get ahead of ourselves because once again, the most important thing is that the first quarter is over. That's always -- the fourth and first quarter always don't tell you much. But April is beginning of the second quarter, and that's about the same time that people were asked to stay home or people were shut in to their homes. Now that we sense -- we sensed at the beginning of April some softness due to the -- that transition that was going on. People didn't want any strangers in their house or contractors they wouldn't know. They just didn't want much of that. However, I would say, we think, since the beginning of April, it stabilized. That was a quickie that happened in the beginning of first couple of weeks of April. And we believe, we believe that everything is stabilized now.\nOperator: The next question today comes from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies.\nStephen Volkmann: A couple of sort of recession questions for you since we seem to be heading into one. I think you alluded earlier, maybe it was Paul, to the fact that you might see some mix shift toward parts and away from units. Is that something you've seen historically? And should we expect a little but of margin improvement because of that?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I can say this unequivocally that last time there was a downturn, the product mix went a little bit more towards parts than equipment because they -- consumers wanted to repair more than they want to spend money for new equipment. What were the results to our company when that occurred? Well, first of all, our working capital came down. And second of all, our cash flow -- cash flow jumped, enormous cash flow gains. So everything has a benefit. If there is a slowdown or more of a conversion for new equipment to repairs and parts and that sort of thing, sure, it may slow sales. But from a perspective of cash flow, it will be very strong. Do we see any evidence of that now? I don't think so. It's too early. It's just beginning, the -- it's just beginning to get into an air conditioning season.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay. Great. You sort of predicted my follow-on, Al. Are you guys planning to reduce your inventories already? Or is it too early to make that decision?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, we're going into the season now. I wouldn't say we're planning to reduce, but we're certainly -- and I think the question is, well, as if we're talking about how we're handling orders for the future. And we have great software that helps us with that. But basically, we're a decentralized organization. And our regions, people that lead our regions, they influence that question. If they think they need to ramp up with inventory using our tools, they can do that. If they think they'd rather be more conservative, they'll do that. We don't try to determine inventory levels at the corporate level because we think that it's better to make those determinations in the markets that we're in.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay. Fair.\nBarry Logan: Al, it's Barry. I just want to add one layer of thought to what you asked earlier about the product mix. And first, replacement parts themselves are under 10% of what we do, just to put that in perspective in terms of the understanding of that question. And what we highlighted in the press release is diversity of products. And so what -- just like any other consumer product, what we see always is mix that can happen within the brands we sell, within the price points we sell, within the entire kind of array of products that we sell when it comes to equipment. And contractors who are at the kitchen table or at least today using our selling platform, maybe not yet at the kitchen table, is offering that variety of price points. And that's what we like about our business a great deal is that diversity is there. There -- I would say, our competitors, in some cases, have more concentration of fewer brands versus the wider array of more brands and those kind of circumstances. So again, when we use that term diversity in the press release, that's part of what we're talking about.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Merkel of William Blair & Company.\nRyan Merkel: All right. So first off, just wanted to clarify the comment on April. So it sounded like you saw trends decelerate right at the beginning of April.\nAlbert Nahmad: Decelerate.\nRyan Merkel: Yes, decelerate. I think, Al, you said kind of stabilized here. Is that just in the last couple of days? Last week? And I know you never want to over-extrapolate a couple of days of sales, but what makes you confident that maybe we could be stabilizing?\nAlbert Nahmad: Daily sales numbers. And I would say, over the last few days.\nRyan Merkel: Okay, okay. I guess we'll see. And then the 5% resi equipment growth, that's what I would have expected, but then it was 2% to the total company. So it implies some big declines in some of the other areas. Can you just expand on that?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I'll let Barry add to it. But we said in our statements earlier, Canada, Mexico and exports in Latin America compared to last year were much softer. And it's been a soft business, the international business. And it's also the regions that you could -- common sense is that the northeast of the United States is having all the problems that they have been having. It gets softer, at least temporarily. But the rest of our network has been stable throughout the period.\nBarry Logan: Yes, I would not add much to that. It is -- the international markets, revenues were down, profits were down. There was dilution in the quarter for international business. Last year was particularly strong in those markets. So part of that is a comparison. And yes, that's probably -- and those things obviously stand out more in what would be the smallest part of our year, which is the first quarter in terms of their impact on EPS and so on. But as Al suggested, where the sun is out and the earth is warm, as you go south, we're seeing, again, stability in the business.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Manthey of Baird.\nDavid Manthey: So first question, what part of your business goes away under social distancing? I'm thinking if my AC stopped working down here in mid-80s Florida today, and I knew for a fact that my contractor had COVID, I'd probably still take my chances. I'm just trying to understand.\nAlbert Nahmad: I hope you don't.\nDavid Manthey: Conceptually. I mean, how do you miss sales if air conditioners are doing what they're doing? I mean, where is the gap in someone saying, \"I'm just going to wait\" or \"I'm not going to have that service.\"\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, that's a very valid issue. I don't think that people will do that because you don't want to be uncomfortable when the heat comes, this -- the hot weather. But if it's mild, you'll postpone. The weather is mild. Because you don't want a stranger in your home. I'm guessing these things. I don't have data to reflect that. But I think as the temperature warms up, the choice will be less and less. Consumers will have to get their systems working, either upgraded or fix the problem that they have.\nDavid Manthey: Right. Okay. That makes sense.\nAlbert Nahmad: It's a pretty necessary industry, as you know. In fact, as you've heard me say, we're considered an essential industry. And good reasons. You've got to have the cooling, and you've got to have the heating.\nDavid Manthey: Right. Yes, I definitely consider you essential. Second question, in -- when we look back to '08, '09, it was obviously a housing-driven recession. It's probably not a good template. But if you go back to '01 and '02, the housing market barely paused during that time frame. And your revenues, I think, were down 5% to 7% in that time frame. Is that not a reasonable expectation? Like you're saying here, Al, there's clearly, if an air conditioner goes out, someone is going to either repair or replace it. There's this trade-down effect. And I think that's what leads to those kind of declines as people repairing rather than replacing lower ticket size and/or trading to the good from the better and best. Can you talk a little bit about that as sort of an initial outlook, just to say, mid-single? Is that kind of what we should be thinking about?\nAlbert Nahmad: You mean in terms of revenue growth?\nDavid Manthey: Yes.\nAlbert Nahmad: Oh, gosh, we don't want to do that. It's too early, much too early. I don't want to guess. I'd rather report something that we're a little more certain of. But I do know that we're so strong financially that we have an edge over our competition, and our technology gives us an edge in our -- against our competition. So we're feeling pretty good about ourselves. And I certainly hope that the M&A program will be used in order to help some distributors be part of us. So I always see opportunity with an industry that might slow down. I'm not saying it will, but I'm saying if it does, we'll see opportunity there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: So I guess you guys aren't going to comment really on your revenues, but like Lennox was out talking about a 15% decline in the industry. I mean, any broad color on kind of what you think the industry is going to do this year, not really talking about you guys?\nAlbert Nahmad: See, I'm not that smart. Paul, do you want to give it a shot?\nPaul Johnston: Boy, if you're not that smart, I'm certainly not that smart. Steve, we represent so many different products, we represent so many different OEMs and constantly polling them for what their outlooks are and that type of thing. And frankly, there's no consensus that I've been able to locate out there to guide us in our direction. So we're with the market. We think we can outpace the market and outgrow the markets. So whatever that market is, we think we're going to outperform it. That's about as close as I can come to, I guess, on what's going to happen.\nSteve Tusa: Right, right. Okay. On the margin side, how are you guys thinking about gross margins kind of over the course, assuming -- I don't know, if you assume kind of trends that are in line with the first quarter, I guess, or like a flat kind of revenue dynamic? Like where would you -- how do we think about gross margin going forward here?\nAlbert Nahmad: I understand why you want to know that. But again, that's hard to predict. But nevertheless, let me tell Mr. Logan, he should try to answer that.\nBarry Logan: Sure. Well, again, with the concentration in equipment and the OEMs having a fairly close watch over their own pricing and margin, I don't think there's any disruption or any real strangeness or weirdness that we would expect to come from that. The price increases a couple of years ago, obviously, did disrupt what ended up being at margins, and we're kind of climbing through that and working with our OEMs through that as well still. But we don't expect anything dramatic or epic or disruptive or necessarily helpful either as we're in this kind of arena. So I think you see some progress in terms of this quarter versus the sequential change of last quarter and the prior one. Again, we'll get it this season, and we'll know more, but I don't expect any disruption to price.\nSteve Tusa: I guess you guys had guided for up gross margins last quarter. I mean, is that -- did we kind of read into that too much? Is that still kind of on the board? Or maybe I misread that comment?\nAlbert Nahmad: Oh, gosh, whatever we did last quarter, we weren't -- no pandemic was in view at the time.\nSteve Tusa: That's a very, very, very fair comment. Just one last one. I know you guys don't touch commercial a ton. But what are you seeing there in the last several weeks on the commercial unitary front or VRF front?\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul? Well, obviously, it's for sure.\nPaul Johnston: Yes, it's very heavily skewed towards internationally and the Northeast for us on the VRF and the commercial applied products. It's -- all those projects and jobs have basically been stopped. So perhaps, we'll have a little backlog there. On the unitary side, unitary has been weak. And it's going to probably be a little bit longer term before that comes up. But once again, when you take commercial in total, it's a small percent of our total business.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Yes, yes. Just you guys always have a good window and hear what's going on out there. So I thought I'd ask. All right. Thanks a lot, and best of luck to you guys executing through whatever comes in the next couple of months here.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJeffrey Hammond: So just on, I guess, maybe focusing on the 1Q margins, which were down. I know it's a shoulder quarter. Can you just give some better color? Because I think you gave on a same-store and ex the investments, margins were still down. I'm just trying to understand, was it mix? Was it some other added SG&A costs, et cetera?\nAlbert Nahmad: I'm not sure I understood. But Barry, you're the numbers guy, what do you got?\nBarry Logan: Sure. Well, on the gross margin, Jeff, again, we do operate with higher gross margins internationally and in the Northeast. So there's some algebra there that did impact the performance in the quarter. That accounts for some of the profitability dropping down to the EBIT line as well. On SG&A, there were investments made in the business to start the season as we get into the year. And that SG&A does stand out in a, I think, in a shoulder quarter like this. Some technology investments, as we highlighted, is in that number as well. And so it goes into the mix of how our leadership is managing their local markets. And SG&A will play out very differently and very sensitively to what's going on in local markets. But to start the year, just some of these numbers show up more materially in terms of their impact in the shoulder quarters.\nAlbert Nahmad: But I keep trying to communicate a picture here that financial strength that we have, little to no -- very little debt, allows us to move with the market wherever it goes. If it gets softer, we use all the attributes that we have. We've talked about diversity of products. We've talked about technology that allows for speedier service. We talked about our ability to finance the distributor -- I'm sorry, the contractor and the homeowner. All these things come into place. I'm very, very happy in our position now. I'm so glad we have very little debt. And I just think that, wherever the markets go, we're just going to be probably the stronger distributor out there.\nAaron Nahmad: This is A.J. I have to say that in my own words, I appreciate the micro questions on Q1 and April, and those are very hard to see forward. But we have to remember the macro picture of Watsco. This is a long-term company. And we have tremendous leadership at the local and the regional level. And in the face of this pandemic, we're operating from a position of strength, from financial strength, from leadership strength, from market strength, in the words we used earlier, we've got our heads down. Every part of the business and everybody in the business is focused on not surviving this pandemic, but how we're going to thrive and how we're going to be a better company and how we're going to take market share. And the early results of what's in play and the expectations of what -- how we'll operate and what we'll look like on the outside of this relative to our competitors is exciting, and it makes me very proud. So you've heard some examples with the contactless pickup. I mean that happened in about 48 hours on a manual basis. In the next week or so, that will be digitized throughout our apps facing the contractors and apps facing our warehouse guys and teams. And that will transform how we operate, and the customers love it. And this is just one example. So just there's a lot of exciting energy going on about processes, about leveraging our technology and our data in ways that we never even thought to explore before or put more focus, more heads down. And we're going to thrive. This is awkward to say maybe, but it's sort of an exciting time from that perspective, if you think of the long term.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. Great. And then just -- I guess, if we get into it, I mean, it sounds like you're seeing some stabilization into April. But if we get into a period of 5% to 10% declines this settling season because the economy is taking a big hit, unemployment's high, et cetera. Do you guys anticipate just continuing to invest through that decline period? Are there actions...\nAlbert Nahmad: Absolutely. No, absolutely. We will. That's the nature of our thinking because our financial strength allows us to invest during downturns as well as steady markets. We are long-term-orientated, and we have the ability to invest, and we'll continue to invest. We're relatively a $5 billion revenues in that side. It's a $40 billion market. We're very ambitious. And in order to get some growth, you've got to continue investing, and you've got to continue improving the customer experience, things that we're really getting good at. So we're not going to stop the investing.\nPaul Johnston: And Jeff, we reminded everyone in the press release that in 2009, that is when we made our largest investments in our careers. And it wasn't just buying a company or doing the joint venture. It was adding capital and adding branches, adding people, adding an entire renaissance to a business in the middle of the recession last time. And dividends were increasing, and cash flow was increasing. So again, it's a script that we know and can play out.\nJeffrey Hammond: Just a final one on the mobile. I just want to -- because it looks like about 8% of your contractors use the mobile app, but like 36% of sales are e-commerce. Is that just still a lion's share of the e-commerce is done through computer-based online ordering? Or I just want to understand like the difference between mobile app usage and ordering on there versus just kind of the broader e-commerce comment?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I don't know the data that -- where you got the data, but we've expressed that data in the press release. Pick it up from there.\nJeffrey Hammond: No, no. I have it. That's what I'm pulling out of the press release.\nAaron Nahmad: Yes. You're looking at weekly active users on the mobile app. I mean, if you look at monthly or quarterly, it's a much larger portion of our customer base. Those numbers double. I mean, last year, for example, in 2019, which is a number I have off the top of my head, I think we had about 110,000 unique users of our mobile app. So it's a much bigger portion than your reference. But yes, I mean the -- and the mobile app, by the way, is focused on technicians in the field, right? The idea is that when a technician shows up at your home, he can very quickly understand what system you have, all the components, and they understand which part do you need, see those inventory in our locations, get every document ever written about that part and that piece of equipment, check warranty, process warranty or the product, have it delivered. I mean that's very much a technician tool and an extension of e-commerce, but it goes well beyond just the e-commerce capabilities.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. So the mobile app usage is much higher than what you would have indicated in the press release? That's just a point in time number or...\nAaron Nahmad: Well, it's just the period that you're looking at. So the number in the press release is weekly unique users, average weekly unique users. And the number I gave you before was unique users for an entire year in 2019, and that number is increased in 2020 -- or the run rate has increased in 2020.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Dankert of Longbow Research.\nChristopher Dankert: So we -- the Credit for Comfort numbers, utilization is up quite a bit there. Obviously, Watsco is in a very strong liquidity position. But how are your customers feeling right now? Is there any stress there? Just any comment on credit, yes.\nAlbert Nahmad: That's a great question. Yes. They're feeling it, naturally, but that's where we come in. We can help them. We can give them dating programs so that they can use our money to develop their business. And we can help their consumers the same way. It's -- it gets rough for customer -- our contractors. But as we continue to say, we -- that's when we shine, when things get tougher. We use our financial strength, which some of our competitors don't have to use. Can you add to that, Barry, Paul or A.J.?\nAaron Nahmad: Yes. This is A.J. Let me take a stab, Barry. I mean, we have probably about 2,000 Watsco associates calling on contractors every day over the last several weeks, with the first question being, how can we help you? Is it access to product? Is it access to -- is it longer credit terms? Is it -- whatever it is. And we are getting interactions with customers that we do business with often and customers that we don't do business with often. And there's a lot of follow-up activity. There's a lot of goodwill being earned. There's a lot of more exposure to some customers that we don't -- or contractors in the market that we don't touch every day that are now understanding who we are, what we're capable of and how interested we are in helping them grow their business. And these contractors have a long memory. So even in periods, especially in periods when they might have some difficulty in their markets or with their customers, when we are there and we're providing a helping hand, it's not only helpful now, but I believe it will, again, potentially change the paradigm going forward. Go ahead, Barry.\nBarry Logan: Yes. And Chris, you mentioned about Credit for Comfort. And just to be very specific about what that is, this year, there'll be about 7 million replacement systems sold in the U.S. and only a very small fraction of them can a contractor sit with someone and offer credit to help that homeowner acquire that system and install that system. So consumer credit really has been a laggard in this industry for most of my career. Credit for Comfort is our digital platform that takes all of our product information, takes all of our capabilities as a distributor into the contractor and into the home to help provide consumer credit through different credit companies. We don't provide the actual financing. This is all third-party financing, but bringing in the actual technology into a digital platform that's easy to use that a contractor can use to grow its business. And that's the growth that we're seeing. Because inevitably, two things can happen. Innovation can help the entire equation, and the necessity helps the whole equation. And so part of that customer engagement over the last several weeks is engaging contractors and that potential of this financing platform. That's what Credit for Comfort is.\nChristopher Dankert: Got it. Got it. Thanks so much for the color there. Certainly, a market share opportunity to be had. I guess, just one other thing for me. Is there any way to quantify kind of any additional cost to operate some of the shorter-term costs, I assume, in terms of social distancing, additional PPE, that kind of thing? Or can't you really break that out from the SG&A at the moment?\nAlbert Nahmad: No. Those categories, as you mentioned, don't apply to us. We're not installing anything where our customers are. I don't see any additional information there. Anybody else? Paul?\nPaul Johnston: No. No, no. It really hasn't impacted us.\nChristopher Dankert: Yes. I just think in the disease, just trying to make sure everyone stays safe. But yes, obviously, that's a smaller impact then, not material. Well, thanks so much, guys. Good luck, and take care.\nOperator: The next question comes from Cory Fulton of Gabelli Fund.\nAlbert Nahmad: Where are you from? What firm are you in?\nCory Fulton: I'm with Gabelli, Mario Gabelli.\nAlbert Nahmad: Oh, I know that guy. He's a good man.\nCory Fulton: He was sad to miss you when he was in Miami a few weeks ago.\nAlbert Nahmad: But he met my better half, my son.\nAaron Nahmad: Yes, that was like the most fun 30 minutes of my month.\nCory Fulton: Yes, that would be very fun. Yes, he could ask some very straightforward questions. So guys, just a quick question here. I know you guys made a flurry of acquisitions last year. And typically, when you make those acquisitions, they're a little bit below the normal margin of the overall business. Can you just kind of give an update on where margins for those acquisitions are now and how maybe the new -- or how COVID might impact or prolong them reaching the overall Watsco margin level?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, generally speaking, we don't order anything to -- we don't ask them to change their gross profit margin because that's not our business. They have to figure out. Well, I just had a phone interruption. Is that just me? Hello?\nCory Fulton: Yes, we can hear you. We can hear you.\nAlbert Nahmad: And so it's very difficult for -- in fact, we cannot answer that because those 3 companies are very independent. And we want them to be very independent, and we want them to continue very entrepreneurial. And now if they need us to improve their margins, they'll use us. But -- so I cannot answer that question.\nCory Fulton: Okay. And I think that maybe an answer to my second question, which is -- I know it's obviously a decentralized business model. You allow your regional managers to make decisions at the market level. But anything in terms of what you're seeing or potentially seeing from maybe a cost-cutting perspective? Anything impacting the business in terms of layoffs or furloughs or anything like that, that so far, maybe giving you an indication of something that might take place throughout the year?\nAlbert Nahmad: You're talking about these three companies that we acquired or in general?\nCory Fulton: No, no, just overall business level for this question.\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: Again, as you said perfectly, it is a decentralized model. And that local knowledge and that local intimacy with the market is going to play out, and SG&A is going to be a component of that leader's daily life. And -- but as A.J. said, so is growth. How can we engage more customers? How can we grow our business? How can we add more technology? How can we do more training? All that is going on at the same time. So it is a dance. It's a short-term dance with managing the business and a long-term hustle to grow share and to invest and get more business out of this. And both are going on in the local markets. So there's no one answer. There's no big paint brush here at all. It's all being dissected and led in local markets.\nAaron Nahmad: Yes, and I'll just speak to this. It's A.J. I'll just -- I'll give you just an anecdote to your first question as well. So those 3 businesses we acquired last year are in the Northeast and are -- which is the epicenter of this pandemic. And the benefit that they are realizing, which I pay witness to, is the ability to just communicate with each other. These are business leaders that have very successful businesses that have been doing what they do for a very long time, but they are connecting at least weekly and sharing ideas and hearing what each other are doing and seeing if there's ways to help each other or share each other's resources or what have you. And again, just being a fly on the wall in those conversations, I know how valuable those are for those guys and how much of a -- how helpful it is to be part of a bigger company like Watsco to have that sort of resource.\nCory Fulton: Okay. I appreciate the color. That's it for me. And Al and A.J., I'll make sure to tell Mario you guys said hello.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Blake Hirschman of Stephens.\nBlake Hirschman: First one for me. Could you give us any rough sense as to what kind of top line declines or just really what kind of combination of different factors would have to occur for the dividend to be at any risk of potentially being cut?\nAlbert Nahmad: Oh, gosh. I haven't got a clue. Barry, go ahead. I mean we're in such financial strength that if this slows down, our cash flow increases. It doesn't decrease. So...\nBarry Logan: Yes. I mean, I'll give you a textbook answer, then I'll give you some track record answer. And I think both are -- both can be given the way that you wish it to. But Al's right. This is a business where if revenues go down, working capital is -- responds within a few days. And we mean we're placing orders with OEMs every day. We're collecting money every day. And our working capital essentially gets adjusted every day. So in a short period of time, working capital gets produced and cash gets put in the bank and is available for use, either in paying off debt. And today, for example, our debt is under $100 million. So the idea of...\nAlbert Nahmad: $85 million.\nBarry Logan: That's right. The idea of having a bit of an ATM machine in a softer environment is both, again, comforting, but also helps answer the question of having cash available to sustain a dividend and keep people very involved and comfortable in the story.  The track record is in going back to 2008, '09, '10. Again, we were seeing three things: epic knives falling in market in terms of new construction coming out; an immense investment being made in the Carrier joint venture, second thing; and third thing, our cash flow and dividend went up about 60% during those three years. Those are pretty epic bullet points to answer your question. So what -- does it answer your question for the future? We'll see, but that's the track record. And I think that's the good mechanics to what goes on in this kind of condition.\nBlake Hirschman: Got it. And then I know a lot's changed since last call, but I believe there was like some ongoing OEM price cost negotiations. Did everything that's happened, the pandemic and stuff, has that impacted those ongoing talks? Or is the margin outlook and stuff just more based on the uncertainty around what happens with the market?\nAlbert Nahmad: Our OEMs are very cooperative. We work as a team. And it's in their best interest also to keep this competitive. And I certainly feel they're doing that. And it's just a very strong relationship. We are generally, every -- I think we have 1,000 vendors, and I'm guessing, but I think we're the largest customer of 1,000 vendors.\nBarry Logan: Yes. Well, I would have time and say in the last 59 minutes since this call started, we've been pricing and competitiveness and reaction to marketplace dynamics has gone on the last 59 minutes, Blake. So there's no end to that. And in this environment, again, it -- we think we have more data, technology, insight, corroborating evidence across markets of what pricing and margins should be. And it's every minute of the day grind.\nPaul Johnston: We have been -- this is Paul. We end up working with our vendors on a daily basis to make sure that we've got a steady flow of product coming in, that there aren't any interruptions on the product that we have. There -- a change in the market conditions is reacted to almost immediately. So we have a whole team of people at the operating units who are working those relationships not only at the OEM level, but also at the vendor level.\nOperator: As there are no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. Thank you very much. I want to say again that I'm sure hoping that all of you are safe and stay healthy, and let's be together as Americans during this pandemic and come out stronger than when this started. I certainly hope so. Thank you again for your interest in our company. Bye now.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Albert Nahmad",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the first quarter earnings call. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. With me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Executive Vice President; and Barry Logan, Executive Vice President.  Now before we start, our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by the SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements.  Once again, good morning. I hope you and your families are healthy and getting through this period safely. Today's press release speaks to Watsco's strength and innovative spirit. These are attributes that we believe will bring comfort and confidence to our employees, our customers, OEM partners and our shareholders.  As we highlight in our press release, Watsco's financial strength is our most important attribute. Our philosophy of maintaining a strong balance sheet, low debt levels and ongoing access to capital is a significant advantage for us as we work through the impact of the pandemic.  We are well positioned to support our customers, employees and OEM partners while actively looking to invest in expanded product offerings, new locations and acquisitions to benefit our long term. Our ability to generate consistent cash flow also represents an important strength. Next week's scheduled dividends, which reflects an 11% increase, signals our confidence in our business.  We also operate in a great industry as HVAC products are fundamental necessities in homes and businesses. Local authorities in our markets have deemed our industry as essential. Our branches are open, providing needed products and services to our contractor customers. Watsco's technology team has also accomplished a lot in recent weeks, and adoption of our tech platforms is rapidly expanding.  In terms of day-to-day activities, our leaders took immediate actions in response to the pandemic. In many cases, in less than 48 hours. For example, branch locations were quickly transformed from retail walk-in showrooms to no-touch e-commerce curbside pickup centers. These changes have been well received, and our customers are asking us to sustain these services going forward. As to growth in investment, we remain in touch with great companies, knowing it's an opportune time for them to join the Watsco family. Our resources can help them grow and develop scale, and we can provide access to our great technology platforms.  In terms of results for the first quarter, sales growth was driven by strength in U.S. markets for residential HVAC equipment, which grew 5%. Sales and earnings in international markets declined due to softer market conditions and strong comparable results. Results also reflect 35 new locations, mostly from acquisitions completed in 2009 -- I'm sorry, 2019, including Peirce-Phelps, DASCO Supply and N&S Supply. These companies come with great leaders who are now part of our culture and team and are responding to current events in their respective markets.  Further analysis of our financial results are provided in our press release. I will not recite these details in my prepared remarks, but we will be happy to provide more color during the Q&A.  With that, A.J., Barry, Paul and I are happy to answer your questions. Well, our data expert, Paul Johnston. But we also have a very effective consumer finance program that would help at such a thing, if it should come to that. Well, first, it was good news that they separated. They can be focused on our industry, and they are. They're very well led. They're very responsive. I think it's all great news going forward. I couldn't be happier. Well, I keep saying the focus, there -- they don't have to worry about dividends going up to the parent, United Technologies, that can be more focused than they are. And they assure us in investing in their own industry and their own company. It's all great news. There's nothing negative about what's occurred. And we very much like the leadership. Paul? Well, in terms of April, we don't like to get ahead of ourselves because once again, the most important thing is that the first quarter is over. That's always -- the fourth and first quarter always don't tell you much. But April is beginning of the second quarter, and that's about the same time that people were asked to stay home or people were shut in to their homes. Now that we sense -- we sensed at the beginning of April some softness due to the -- that transition that was going on. People didn't want any strangers in their house or contractors they wouldn't know. They just didn't want much of that. However, I would say, we think, since the beginning of April, it stabilized. That was a quickie that happened in the beginning of first couple of weeks of April. And we believe, we believe that everything is stabilized now. Well, I can say this unequivocally that last time there was a downturn, the product mix went a little bit more towards parts than equipment because they -- consumers wanted to repair more than they want to spend money for new equipment. What were the results to our company when that occurred? Well, first of all, our working capital came down. And second of all, our cash flow -- cash flow jumped, enormous cash flow gains. So everything has a benefit. If there is a slowdown or more of a conversion for new equipment to repairs and parts and that sort of thing, sure, it may slow sales. But from a perspective of cash flow, it will be very strong. Do we see any evidence of that now? I don't think so. It's too early. It's just beginning, the -- it's just beginning to get into an air conditioning season. Well, we're going into the season now. I wouldn't say we're planning to reduce, but we're certainly -- and I think the question is, well, as if we're talking about how we're handling orders for the future. And we have great software that helps us with that. But basically, we're a decentralized organization. And our regions, people that lead our regions, they influence that question. If they think they need to ramp up with inventory using our tools, they can do that. If they think they'd rather be more conservative, they'll do that. We don't try to determine inventory levels at the corporate level because we think that it's better to make those determinations in the markets that we're in. Decelerate. Daily sales numbers. And I would say, over the last few days. Well, I'll let Barry add to it. But we said in our statements earlier, Canada, Mexico and exports in Latin America compared to last year were much softer. And it's been a soft business, the international business. And it's also the regions that you could -- common sense is that the northeast of the United States is having all the problems that they have been having. It gets softer, at least temporarily. But the rest of our network has been stable throughout the period. I hope you don't. Well, that's a very valid issue. I don't think that people will do that because you don't want to be uncomfortable when the heat comes, this -- the hot weather. But if it's mild, you'll postpone. The weather is mild. Because you don't want a stranger in your home. I'm guessing these things. I don't have data to reflect that. But I think as the temperature warms up, the choice will be less and less. Consumers will have to get their systems working, either upgraded or fix the problem that they have. It's a pretty necessary industry, as you know. In fact, as you've heard me say, we're considered an essential industry. And good reasons. You've got to have the cooling, and you've got to have the heating. You mean in terms of revenue growth? Oh, gosh, we don't want to do that. It's too early, much too early. I don't want to guess. I'd rather report something that we're a little more certain of. But I do know that we're so strong financially that we have an edge over our competition, and our technology gives us an edge in our -- against our competition. So we're feeling pretty good about ourselves. And I certainly hope that the M&A program will be used in order to help some distributors be part of us. So I always see opportunity with an industry that might slow down. I'm not saying it will, but I'm saying if it does, we'll see opportunity there. See, I'm not that smart. Paul, do you want to give it a shot? I understand why you want to know that. But again, that's hard to predict. But nevertheless, let me tell Mr. Logan, he should try to answer that. Oh, gosh, whatever we did last quarter, we weren't -- no pandemic was in view at the time. Paul? Well, obviously, it's for sure. I'm not sure I understood. But Barry, you're the numbers guy, what do you got? But I keep trying to communicate a picture here that financial strength that we have, little to no -- very little debt, allows us to move with the market wherever it goes. If it gets softer, we use all the attributes that we have. We've talked about diversity of products. We've talked about technology that allows for speedier service. We talked about our ability to finance the distributor -- I'm sorry, the contractor and the homeowner. All these things come into place. I'm very, very happy in our position now. I'm so glad we have very little debt. And I just think that, wherever the markets go, we're just going to be probably the stronger distributor out there. Absolutely. No, absolutely. We will. That's the nature of our thinking because our financial strength allows us to invest during downturns as well as steady markets. We are long-term-orientated, and we have the ability to invest, and we'll continue to invest. We're relatively a $5 billion revenues in that side. It's a $40 billion market. We're very ambitious. And in order to get some growth, you've got to continue investing, and you've got to continue improving the customer experience, things that we're really getting good at. So we're not going to stop the investing. Well, I don't know the data that -- where you got the data, but we've expressed that data in the press release. Pick it up from there. That's a great question. Yes. They're feeling it, naturally, but that's where we come in. We can help them. We can give them dating programs so that they can use our money to develop their business. And we can help their consumers the same way. It's -- it gets rough for customer -- our contractors. But as we continue to say, we -- that's when we shine, when things get tougher. We use our financial strength, which some of our competitors don't have to use. Can you add to that, Barry, Paul or A.J.? No. Those categories, as you mentioned, don't apply to us. We're not installing anything where our customers are. I don't see any additional information there. Anybody else? Paul? Where are you from? What firm are you in? Oh, I know that guy. He's a good man. But he met my better half, my son. Well, generally speaking, we don't order anything to -- we don't ask them to change their gross profit margin because that's not our business. They have to figure out. Well, I just had a phone interruption. Is that just me? Hello? And so it's very difficult for -- in fact, we cannot answer that because those 3 companies are very independent. And we want them to be very independent, and we want them to continue very entrepreneurial. And now if they need us to improve their margins, they'll use us. But -- so I cannot answer that question. You're talking about these three companies that we acquired or in general? Barry? Oh, gosh. I haven't got a clue. Barry, go ahead. I mean we're in such financial strength that if this slows down, our cash flow increases. It doesn't decrease. So... $85 million. Our OEMs are very cooperative. We work as a team. And it's in their best interest also to keep this competitive. And I certainly feel they're doing that. And it's just a very strong relationship. We are generally, every -- I think we have 1,000 vendors, and I'm guessing, but I think we're the largest customer of 1,000 vendors. Yes. Thank you very much. I want to say again that I'm sure hoping that all of you are safe and stay healthy, and let's be together as Americans during this pandemic and come out stronger than when this started. I certainly hope so. Thank you again for your interest in our company. Bye now."

            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "Al, it's Barry. I just want to add one layer of thought to what you asked earlier about the product mix. And first, replacement parts themselves are under 10% of what we do, just to put that in perspective in terms of the understanding of that question. And what we highlighted in the press release is diversity of products. And so what -- just like any other consumer product, what we see always is mix that can happen within the brands we sell, within the price points we sell, within the entire kind of array of products that we sell when it comes to equipment. And contractors who are at the kitchen table or at least today using our selling platform, maybe not yet at the kitchen table, is offering that variety of price points. And that's what we like about our business a great deal is that diversity is there. There -- I would say, our competitors, in some cases, have more concentration of fewer brands versus the wider array of more brands and those kind of circumstances. So again, when we use that term diversity in the press release, that's part of what we're talking about. Yes, I would not add much to that. It is -- the international markets, revenues were down, profits were down. There was dilution in the quarter for international business. Last year was particularly strong in those markets. So part of that is a comparison. And yes, that's probably -- and those things obviously stand out more in what would be the smallest part of our year, which is the first quarter in terms of their impact on EPS and so on. But as Al suggested, where the sun is out and the earth is warm, as you go south, we're seeing, again, stability in the business. Sure. Well, again, with the concentration in equipment and the OEMs having a fairly close watch over their own pricing and margin, I don't think there's any disruption or any real strangeness or weirdness that we would expect to come from that. The price increases a couple of years ago, obviously, did disrupt what ended up being at margins, and we're kind of climbing through that and working with our OEMs through that as well still. But we don't expect anything dramatic or epic or disruptive or necessarily helpful either as we're in this kind of arena. So I think you see some progress in terms of this quarter versus the sequential change of last quarter and the prior one. Again, we'll get it this season, and we'll know more, but I don't expect any disruption to price. Sure. Well, on the gross margin, Jeff, again, we do operate with higher gross margins internationally and in the Northeast. So there's some algebra there that did impact the performance in the quarter. That accounts for some of the profitability dropping down to the EBIT line as well. On SG&A, there were investments made in the business to start the season as we get into the year. And that SG&A does stand out in a, I think, in a shoulder quarter like this. Some technology investments, as we highlighted, is in that number as well. And so it goes into the mix of how our leadership is managing their local markets. And SG&A will play out very differently and very sensitively to what's going on in local markets. But to start the year, just some of these numbers show up more materially in terms of their impact in the shoulder quarters. Yes. And Chris, you mentioned about Credit for Comfort. And just to be very specific about what that is, this year, there'll be about 7 million replacement systems sold in the U.S. and only a very small fraction of them can a contractor sit with someone and offer credit to help that homeowner acquire that system and install that system. So consumer credit really has been a laggard in this industry for most of my career. Credit for Comfort is our digital platform that takes all of our product information, takes all of our capabilities as a distributor into the contractor and into the home to help provide consumer credit through different credit companies. We don't provide the actual financing. This is all third-party financing, but bringing in the actual technology into a digital platform that's easy to use that a contractor can use to grow its business. And that's the growth that we're seeing. Because inevitably, two things can happen. Innovation can help the entire equation, and the necessity helps the whole equation. And so part of that customer engagement over the last several weeks is engaging contractors and that potential of this financing platform. That's what Credit for Comfort is. Again, as you said perfectly, it is a decentralized model. And that local knowledge and that local intimacy with the market is going to play out, and SG&A is going to be a component of that leader's daily life. And -- but as A.J. said, so is growth. How can we engage more customers? How can we grow our business? How can we add more technology? How can we do more training? All that is going on at the same time. So it is a dance. It's a short-term dance with managing the business and a long-term hustle to grow share and to invest and get more business out of this. And both are going on in the local markets. So there's no one answer. There's no big paint brush here at all. It's all being dissected and led in local markets. Yes. I mean, I'll give you a textbook answer, then I'll give you some track record answer. And I think both are -- both can be given the way that you wish it to. But Al's right. This is a business where if revenues go down, working capital is -- responds within a few days. And we mean we're placing orders with OEMs every day. We're collecting money every day. And our working capital essentially gets adjusted every day. So in a short period of time, working capital gets produced and cash gets put in the bank and is available for use, either in paying off debt. And today, for example, our debt is under $100 million. So the idea of... That's right. The idea of having a bit of an ATM machine in a softer environment is both, again, comforting, but also helps answer the question of having cash available to sustain a dividend and keep people very involved and comfortable in the story.  The track record is in going back to 2008, '09, '10. Again, we were seeing three things: epic knives falling in market in terms of new construction coming out; an immense investment being made in the Carrier joint venture, second thing; and third thing, our cash flow and dividend went up about 60% during those three years. Those are pretty epic bullet points to answer your question. So what -- does it answer your question for the future? We'll see, but that's the track record. And I think that's the good mechanics to what goes on in this kind of condition. Yes. Well, I would have time and say in the last 59 minutes since this call started, we've been pricing and competitiveness and reaction to marketplace dynamics has gone on the last 59 minutes, Blake. So there's no end to that. And in this environment, again, it -- we think we have more data, technology, insight, corroborating evidence across markets of what pricing and margins should be. And it's every minute of the day grind."

            "content": "In the first quarter, we really didn't see it. We had a pretty good balance between system sales as opposed to just an outdoor replacement. Perhaps anecdotally, we'll see a little bit more of a repair or just replace the outdoor unit in the second quarter perhaps. Really, we're not at the consumer level. But what we hear from our contractors is regular checkups and service calls that don't require repair are pretty much being pushed out right now. Consumers aren't looking for someone to be in their home. Correct. Yes. No, we're not seeing any deflation. In fact, we've had some of our commodity pricing actually starting to move back up again. So no, no deflation. Boy, if you're not that smart, I'm certainly not that smart. Steve, we represent so many different products, we represent so many different OEMs and constantly polling them for what their outlooks are and that type of thing. And frankly, there's no consensus that I've been able to locate out there to guide us in our direction. So we're with the market. We think we can outpace the market and outgrow the markets. So whatever that market is, we think we're going to outperform it. That's about as close as I can come to, I guess, on what's going to happen. Yes, it's very heavily skewed towards internationally and the Northeast for us on the VRF and the commercial applied products. It's -- all those projects and jobs have basically been stopped. So perhaps, we'll have a little backlog there. On the unitary side, unitary has been weak. And it's going to probably be a little bit longer term before that comes up. But once again, when you take commercial in total, it's a small percent of our total business. And Jeff, we reminded everyone in the press release that in 2009, that is when we made our largest investments in our careers. And it wasn't just buying a company or doing the joint venture. It was adding capital and adding branches, adding people, adding an entire renaissance to a business in the middle of the recession last time. And dividends were increasing, and cash flow was increasing. So again, it's a script that we know and can play out. No. No, no. It really hasn't impacted us. We have been -- this is Paul. We end up working with our vendors on a daily basis to make sure that we've got a steady flow of product coming in, that there aren't any interruptions on the product that we have. There -- a change in the market conditions is reacted to almost immediately. So we have a whole team of people at the operating units who are working those relationships not only at the OEM level, but also at the vendor level."

            "content": "This is A.J. I have to say that in my own words, I appreciate the micro questions on Q1 and April, and those are very hard to see forward. But we have to remember the macro picture of Watsco. This is a long-term company. And we have tremendous leadership at the local and the regional level. And in the face of this pandemic, we're operating from a position of strength, from financial strength, from leadership strength, from market strength, in the words we used earlier, we've got our heads down. Every part of the business and everybody in the business is focused on not surviving this pandemic, but how we're going to thrive and how we're going to be a better company and how we're going to take market share. And the early results of what's in play and the expectations of what -- how we'll operate and what we'll look like on the outside of this relative to our competitors is exciting, and it makes me very proud. So you've heard some examples with the contactless pickup. I mean that happened in about 48 hours on a manual basis. In the next week or so, that will be digitized throughout our apps facing the contractors and apps facing our warehouse guys and teams. And that will transform how we operate, and the customers love it. And this is just one example. So just there's a lot of exciting energy going on about processes, about leveraging our technology and our data in ways that we never even thought to explore before or put more focus, more heads down. And we're going to thrive. This is awkward to say maybe, but it's sort of an exciting time from that perspective, if you think of the long term. Yes. You're looking at weekly active users on the mobile app. I mean, if you look at monthly or quarterly, it's a much larger portion of our customer base. Those numbers double. I mean, last year, for example, in 2019, which is a number I have off the top of my head, I think we had about 110,000 unique users of our mobile app. So it's a much bigger portion than your reference. But yes, I mean the -- and the mobile app, by the way, is focused on technicians in the field, right? The idea is that when a technician shows up at your home, he can very quickly understand what system you have, all the components, and they understand which part do you need, see those inventory in our locations, get every document ever written about that part and that piece of equipment, check warranty, process warranty or the product, have it delivered. I mean that's very much a technician tool and an extension of e-commerce, but it goes well beyond just the e-commerce capabilities. Well, it's just the period that you're looking at. So the number in the press release is weekly unique users, average weekly unique users. And the number I gave you before was unique users for an entire year in 2019, and that number is increased in 2020 -- or the run rate has increased in 2020. Yes. This is A.J. Let me take a stab, Barry. I mean, we have probably about 2,000 Watsco associates calling on contractors every day over the last several weeks, with the first question being, how can we help you? Is it access to product? Is it access to -- is it longer credit terms? Is it -- whatever it is. And we are getting interactions with customers that we do business with often and customers that we don't do business with often. And there's a lot of follow-up activity. There's a lot of goodwill being earned. There's a lot of more exposure to some customers that we don't -- or contractors in the market that we don't touch every day that are now understanding who we are, what we're capable of and how interested we are in helping them grow their business. And these contractors have a long memory. So even in periods, especially in periods when they might have some difficulty in their markets or with their customers, when we are there and we're providing a helping hand, it's not only helpful now, but I believe it will, again, potentially change the paradigm going forward. Go ahead, Barry. Yes, that was like the most fun 30 minutes of my month. Yes, and I'll just speak to this. It's A.J. I'll just -- I'll give you just an anecdote to your first question as well. So those 3 businesses we acquired last year are in the Northeast and are -- which is the epicenter of this pandemic. And the benefit that they are realizing, which I pay witness to, is the ability to just communicate with each other. These are business leaders that have very successful businesses that have been doing what they do for a very long time, but they are connecting at least weekly and sharing ideas and hearing what each other are doing and seeing if there's ways to help each other or share each other's resources or what have you. And again, just being a fly on the wall in those conversations, I know how valuable those are for those guys and how much of a -- how helpful it is to be part of a bigger company like Watsco to have that sort of resource."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. And welcome to the Watsco, Inc. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Albert Nahmad, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, everyone. I hope you\u2019re safe and healthy wherever you are. I want to welcome you to our fourth quarter earnings call. And this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. And with me is A.J. Nahmad, President of Watsco; and Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Before we start our report, here is our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws and ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. On to our report. Watsco delivered an exceptional quarter to close out a fantastic year. New records were set for virtually every measure of performance. During the quarter, earnings per share jumped 77% to a record $2.02 per share. Sales grew 31% to a record $1.5 billion. And operating income increased 76% to a record $123 million. And operating margins expanded 210 basis points to a record 8.1% in the fourth quarter. Now \u2013 for results for the year. Earnings per share increased 54% to a record $10.78 per share as sales grew 24% to a record $6.3 billion. During the year, operating income increased $227 million or 57% to a record $629 million, and operating margins reached 10%, a 210 basis points increase from last year. And very important, I only like to emphasize this because this is our culture, we ended the year with a strong balance sheet with very little debt. In fact, our performance gives us confidence to share once again with our shareholders by boosting our dividend 13% to an annual rate of $8.80 per share. Our strong balance sheet also gives us the ability to invest in most any size opportunity as we continue to build scale in the very fragmented $50 billion North American market. We continue to look for acquisitions as Watsco is a great home for family businesses, given that we sustain their cultures, invest in people and provide technology to secure and build on their great legacies. Beyond sales and profits, it is important to understand Watsco\u2019s immense potential to impact climate change. Let me explain that. Heating and air conditioning systems account for roughly half of U.S. household energy consumption. Therefore, the purchase and installation of high-efficiency replacement systems is one of the most meaningful steps a homeowner can take to lower his energy cost and reduce CO2 emissions. Given our scale, our access to capital, our entrepreneurial spirit and technology, we believe we are well positioned to help the greatest number of contractors who, in turn, can help more homeowners and businesses to reduce CO2 emissions. Now in terms of impact on CO2. Over the last two years, we estimated Watsco\u2019s sales of more efficient systems helped avoid 10.1 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, which is equivalent to taking 2.2 million cars off the road. This is over a two-year period. We note that the regulatory changes \u2013 I\u2019m moving on to a different subject. The government has now moved to change \u2013 make changes that will take effect the beginning of next year. These changes mandate an increase in the minimum efficiency for our HVAC equipment. We know \u2013 excuse me, I\u2019ve got a cold. Regulatory changes are also on the horizon related to refrigerants to also aid with climate change. That\u2019s also a very big move on the emphasis on climate change. OEMs are actively engineering new products to meet the new requirements, all of which should take shape over the next couple of years. Moving on to technology. We continue to invest in technologies to transform our contractor customer experience. Greater adoption and use of our technologies was achieved during 2021. An example is e-commerce sales, which now approach $2 billion a year, and we can see that our active users continue to grow at faster rates than others. If you have an interest in learning more about Watsco technology, please let us know. We will schedule some time with A.J. and his team. We enjoy sharing our passion and the long-term view that is transforming our business. My final thought before we answer questions is to thank all of the Watsco teams across our markets. They have done an extraordinary job to serve customers and produce this type of performance. With that, let\u2019s move on to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nAlbert Nahmad: How many are on queue?\nOperator: Right now it looks like we have a queue of about eight participants. And the first question is from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Tommy.\nTommy Moll: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So another record quarter for gross margin, which I hope we could unpack a bit here.\nAlbert Nahmad: Never heard that question put it that way. That\u2019s good.\nTommy Moll: Anything you could share on mix? Anything on accounting we should be aware of? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re FIFO or LIFO. And maybe a more interesting component there, what could you share about any of the latest on pricing strategy and realization?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I\u2019m going to call on two of the resources on the phone, starting with Barry and then followed by Paul.\nBarry Logan: Good morning, Tommy, appreciate that. Well, again, I think there are several things to \u2013 layers to the discussion and one of which is not accounting. We use weighted average cost on a FIFO basis. And as we buy products and sell them and mark them up, it\u2019s a pretty clean mechanism to get to gross margin. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s interesting or unordinary in terms of that simple equation. But in terms of the layers, again, you\u2019re right, sales mix does drive higher margin. We do see higher margins as we sell a richer mix of efficiency. We give some inference in that in our press release in terms of growth rate of high efficiency versus the base efficiency or the overall, I should say, the overall growth rates. Also, inflation, as we pass through inflation, as we receive higher cost from OEMs and we move that product through to our customers, it is an opportunity for us to be a good merchant and realize some margin dollars as we pass that through. You can also see that the non-equipment business has had a terrific year. Gross margin rates in our non-equipment business have done very well. And again, yields an overall improvement in margin. So probably a few more layers, maybe Paul can cover. But if you listen to my words carefully, this is about buying products, passing them through the value chain to our customer and yielding a terrific result. There\u2019s really not much more to it than that. Paul?\nPaul Johnston: Yes. And part of that, we made a \u2013 part of our technology investment, we made a strong investment in the latest technology for pricing systems. So, we have a better handle on, as the price increases occur, we\u2019re able to move them through faster and also make sure that we\u2019re getting the yield from the price increase that we expect. Are we continuing to see price increases? Yes, there were price increases from most OEMs on the equipment side that were passed through January 1, and we\u2019ve implemented those. Secondly, we\u2019re seeing price increases on a lot of different non-equipment products, which we don\u2019t talk about an awful lot, but, as Barry indicated, has been a very strong growth area for us, both in the way of sales as well as emphasis. So it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t see any letdown in prices or a reduction in prices. It\u2019s pretty much been full steam ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: A.J., perhaps you could add something regarding our capability now to see what\u2019s going on with competitors and how we react to that.\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes. Paul mentioned we\u2019ve made major investments in technology regarding pricing and pricing optimization, and that does give us visibility to all of our customers who all buy all the products that we sell at different prices, believe it or not. So the tool gives us and our teams and our analysts very quick access to see are the right \u2013 are we matching the right pricing profiles with the right customers and giving them a price that\u2019s appropriate for them to buy? So it\u2019s not just about raising prices per se, it\u2019s also about selling more product. And that is in the early days, but we expect it to have a continued impact on our margin realization.\nTommy Moll: Thank you all. Appreciate the context. If I could follow-up, going to the topic of your OEM, your key OEM relationships. In the recent past, you\u2019ve talked about a body of work, an ongoing body of work to enhance those partnerships and plan more closely. What initiatives do you have in place for the next year as you look ahead to 2022?\nAlbert Nahmad: What initiatives do we have with our OEMs? Well, we got all day. Who wants to deal with that?\nBarry Logan: I can give it a start. We\u2019re in constant communication with our OEMs. They\u2019re vital to our success and we\u2019re vital to their success. And so we have generally weekly meetings with most of our major OEMs where we go through inventory analysis, pricing that we see in the field, opportunities that we could get in front of to do, marketing programs, the whole list of things that we do with our OEMs. Our relationship is very strong.\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes, if I may, this is A.J. again. I mean I hate to be just a technology guy, but as we speak, our senior technology folks are sitting with the senior technology folks of one of our leading OEMs and plotting how we can leverage each other\u2019s capabilities and data sets to make one plus one equals three, serve our collective customers better and help them grow their businesses. Those are opportunities that Watsco has, I think, pretty uniquely with our OEM partners because of our strength and what we do and in the technologies and platforms that we\u2019ve made.\nTommy Moll: Appreciate the context and I\u2019ll turn in back.\nOperator: The next question is from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hi, David.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you. Hi, good morning, Al. In the press release, you said that you achieved 9% price in 2021 in residential HVAC. And last quarter, I think you told us year-to-date, you\u2019re at running plus 6%. Mathematically, that would put you closer to 20% in the fourth quarter if I\u2019m doing that math right. So, I\u2019m just thinking about moving into next year, I know you\u2019re just passing through these manufacturer price increases as they come to you, but if we just think about the glide path from the price increases that have already been implemented and made including this Gen 1 [ph], should we assume that pricing is going to be still double digits throughout 2022 as the year \u2013 or maybe high single digits? And that\u2019s even if prices don\u2019t change at all from here. Is that logic somewhat correct?\nAlbert Nahmad: I have to say I don\u2019t understand your 20% calculation, and how you derived that. Probably the best resource we have to deal with that is Paul to answer your question.\nPaul Johnston: As you know, we saw record price increases last year from the OEMs. And as I indicated, we started the year with a price increase. Do we see a second price increase? I don\u2019t know. I have no idea if the OEMs are going to be having to put through another price increase. However, we do know that we\u2019ve got a change in standards coming, which is going to result in another price increase as we implement the new products that are coming out that are going to meet the new higher efficiency.\nAlbert Nahmad: Let\u2019s describe unit growth. He\u2019s focused on pricing.\nBarry Logan: Yes. I was going to fill in the blanks for you, Dave. First, our math and our numbers, as you see in the press release, a 22% growth in HVAC equipment, and that excludes acquisitions. Price and mix together is somewhere in the low double-digits and the rest, closer to 10%, is the unit growth in the quarter. So if I look at it in a context of a year, unit growth in the quarter and unit growth for the year is exactly the same, 9%.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. That sounds good. As you think about 2022, and I know you\u2019re very decentralized as an organization, but when you roll up the business unit operating budgets, is there any reason to believe that we should expect unit growth to be abnormally high or low in the coming year? And I\u2019m just thinking about the components of growth that you expect to see. Is mid-single digit what the operating units are arising at when you roll everything up to the corporate level?\nAlbert Nahmad: A.J.?\nA.J. Nahmad: I\u2019m not sure...\nAlbert Nahmad: We gave you the hard way.\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes. I\u2019m not sure that information, we\u2019re ready, willing, able to share. But I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any reason to expect abnormally high or low unit growth to answer your question, Dave. Paul, maybe you have a better answer on that?\nPaul Johnston: I guess we\u2019ve all got our models, and I\u2019ve read a lot about your models. But all models are great, but they\u2019re all wrong. But I guess what I\u2019m looking at is I\u2019m looking at what are the \u2013 what are the currents that go on in the marketplace that really drive our sales? And one, existing home sales are strong right now. So, I feel good about that. Because generally, people will buy or upgrade their system when they buy an existing home. We\u2019ve already talked about price. We\u2019ve seen a continuous trend of heat pump growth in the marketplace and heat pumps command a higher price than a trade cool unit. The efficiency progress that we\u2019ve made in the past, we expect to continue. So all in all, I expect a normal year regardless of what the models say, I see a normal year.\nAlbert Nahmad: Or [indiscernible] January, we\u2019d be very excited. January is very strong.\nDavid Manthey: That\u2019s all great colors. Thanks very much guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Good morning everyone. Yes. I get the same math. You go from 6% price through nine months to 9% for a year, it implies 18% or so in the quarter. But I guess we\u2019ll circle back and figure out. We\u2019re missing something on price mix there, I guess. But could \u2013 could you just give us a little update on inventories? Usually your inventories come down sequentially in Q4. That didn\u2019t happen. I imagine there\u2019s some inflation and some other things going on there. But would just love some perspective on that.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, our inventory king is Barry Logan.\nBarry Logan: Yes, Jeff, good morning. You\u2019re right, you\u2019re right, sequentially they grew. And sequentially last year, it was in a much different position. So year-over-year, if you look at it that way, it\u2019s a peculiar comparison. Third quarter to fourth quarter, you\u2019re right, there is a measure of inflation. But put things in this context, looking at a longer time period, I\u2019m going to make everyone do that, look at longer time periods than just a quarter, which is inventory today or year-end versus two years ago and take the volatility of all the supply chain out, let\u2019s look out over a two-year period, like inventories are up around 12% 2019 to 2021. And Watsco is obviously a 20% larger company over that time period. And I\u2019m adjusting for acquisitions when I make that \u2013 do that math. So, I think as we said in the press release, it\u2019s kind of reestablishing inventories kind of where they \u2013 where they should be given the outlook and the OEMs in the off-season here having more capability of doing that. And it puts our inventory more in line with where it should be given what\u2019s going on.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks for that. And are you still of the view that there would be relatively muted attempt to kind of pre-buying and things of that nature in front of the SEER change here at year-end?\nBarry Logan: Yes.\nPaul Johnston: Yes, definitely. The pre-buys in the past were predicated on an availability or a channel that was able to supply the units to the distribution, which hasn\u2019t existed here in the last, what, 18 months to 24 months. But the second reason why I don\u2019t see a real big pre-buy on anybody\u2019s part is because some of the equipment is based upon date of sale and not date of manufacture. And so if it\u2019s been manufactured after a certain date \u2013 or if you sell it after a certain date, you\u2019re not allowed to do that.\nJeff Sprague: Okay. And just speaking of higher efficiency, that 26% growth rate you cited in the press release, is that a unit number or that\u2019s a revenue number?\nBarry Logan: They\u2019re both revenue numbers. You can compare 26% to the overall of 17%.\nJeff Sprague: All right. Thank you very much guys. Appreciated.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hi, Jeff.\nJeff Hammond: Hey good morning, everyone. So maybe first, the acquisition contribution was higher than I had in my model. And I just didn\u2019t know if that\u2019s a particular strength from the acquisitions or if there\u2019s any kind of nuanced differences in seasonality with respect to some of the deals coming in?\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: Good morning, Jeff. The big company that was acquired in, I think, March or April, was TEC and they\u2019ve had a record year and has a terrific contribution to our results this year. The smaller ones also performed well and contributed what they contributed. So nothing other than great performance on their part as being the first year as part of Watsco.\nAlbert Nahmad: Or another way to say it is our retiring network is growing at a very rapid rate throughout the system to 673 locations.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. Great. Just back on price. I think the 9% you gave was for equipment. Just ballpark is the non-equipment kind of a comparable number for the year? And then just back on the \u2013 if you just take all the OEM and pricing that you\u2019ve gotten plus the carryover, like is it \u2013 is kind of a mid-single-digit starting point for pricing in the 2022 year kind of the right way to look at it?\nAlbert Nahmad: Not sure I even understand. But Paul, if you got it.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. I don\u2019t know if the mid-single digit or the single digit is the starting point or not. But the non-equipment that you asked about, yes, that varies by product type. Some products, obviously like steel products, steel duckboard, flat steel, that type of thing, they\u2019ve been going up at a higher rate than that. Whereas things like motors and some \u2013 and thermostats have been going up at a more planned rate. But it\u2019s pretty much across the board, equipment and non-equipment have seen price increases.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Steven.\nStephen Volkmann: Hi, good morning guys. Maybe just a quick follow-up, if I could, on the gross margin. Barry, it sounded like from your commentary earlier that there\u2019s no real reason that this should revert back at all and that maybe this 27% run rate is kind of sustainable. But I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth. Would you agree with that? Or is there a little something that could cause it to pull back a little bit.\nBarry Logan: Again...\nAlbert Nahmad: He can answer that, he\u2019s a better man than me. Go ahead.\nBarry Logan: Well, kind of as Paul said, all the variables we believe always will have some variability going forward. So that\u2019s just the reality of business. And again, being a merchant and managing all the variables as they play out, not having necessarily live and die by the metric. So probably the thing that is realistic and the answer is that any kind of inflation that we pass through to our customers that we absorb and move through and benefits gross margin, there\u2019s a benefit to the inventory that we own at a certain cost as that \u2013 as our prices increase and it passes through the system, so to speak, there\u2019s a benefit to that, a margin benefit to that. And every distributor of every kind that is public that you can invest in will have that same capability of yielding slightly higher margins as things pass through. And so that \u2013 I would say there is a benefit there that is reliant on continued growth in price. As Paul suggested, I think we were comfortable with seeing a higher price environment this year. We have new products on the horizon next year that relate to the higher SEER units that will pass through, and we\u2019re talking about different refrigerant products a couple of years out. So, I think the industry as a whole has this inflationary feel to it. And the manufacturers are having to invest a bunch of their R&D in these new products. So they\u2019re under pressure to sustain pricing, I believe. And so I think we\u2019re in a good place in terms of that inflationary feeling [ph]. That is helpful.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, there\u2019s also the climate change, that we see as a growing part of our demand because it\u2019s becoming more and more in the minds of homeowners and business owners. And we started to discuss that in the press release or we\u2019re adding more to it, I should say, that we started. And I see that as a constant increasing demand for these higher efficiency products. I see this as a positive in the short term and the long term. And it does a lot of good by removing CO2 emissions every time we install one of these things. These units require less power and less power means less CO2 emissions by the power companies. That\u2019s not a short-term issue. It\u2019s going to go on for quite a while. It\u2019s just beginning actually. And we are the largest player in the industry, I think, can make the most significant impact.\nPaul Johnston: I agree with Al. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 even without inflation, without inflation, we\u2019re still going to have to trend towards more heat pumps. We\u2019re still going to have to trend to higher efficiency, that is going to be not just a trend, but a regulation from the federal government. And as Barry indicated, we go through a second phase of this on a longer-term basis as we change refrigerants and move away from the 410 that we\u2019ve used for the last 15 years and move into new lower CO2-emitting refrigerants.\nAlbert Nahmad: I mean this country and the rest of the world, most of the rest of the world, they want less CO2 emission, and they\u2019re going to regulate to get it. And our industry is no exception. That\u2019s what the regulations are, to mandate higher efficiency rates and also to mandate the change of the refrigerant. So it harms \u2013 so it reduces the harm to the climate. Those are big factors that will drive our performance.\nBarry Logan: And just one last thought that we really haven\u2019t covered, and we kind of covered it, but I want to cover it more specifically, is we are the largest customer of most of our manufacturers. I say that with no bravado or ego, it\u2019s an opportunity. If our OEMs want to grow share and grow the market and grow their business and grow their profitability, we collaborate together and do it. And the equation that we obviously work on together is the profitability when we sell their products and how much we can invest in the markets to help grow the mutual share of our OEMs. So that\u2019s an equation that is obviously always being worked on and always being examined to not just be more profitable, but to grow the business.\nStephen Volkmann: Super. All right. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it. Maybe just a quick follow-up, A.J., since you are the tech guy today maybe.\nA.J. Nahmad: He\u2019s more than that. He started at tech for sure, he let it \u2013 he\u2019s put together an extraordinary team, nothing like it anywhere that I\u2019m aware of in the industry. But he \u2013 ask him anything that to be technology involved.\nStephen Volkmann: Well, I meant that as a compliment, to be clear. But I\u2019m curious just how you\u2019re feeling about the various kind of adoption rates, the things that you guys are pursuing on the tech front. And I was sort of struck by the 11% growth in Contractor Assist. I know it\u2019s not apples and oranges, it seems a little slower than the growth of the overall business. Maybe we\u2019re just early in the S curve, but either that or any of the others in terms of adoption, just any of your comments would be great.\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes. Well, for starters, we\u2019re never satisfied. I mean, we sell products to 100,000 contractors. And in my opinion, all of them should be using all of our technologies all the time. I mean that\u2019s the end goal. I have to say that there is some there is opportunity that to do better and you heard to say about e-commerce, for example, which is a good barometer for most of it, is about one-third of our sales. Well, we have some regions, major regions of our business, $400 million, $500 million regions that are over 60% of our sales with e-commerce. So you know it\u2019s possible. And when that happens, it\u2019s good for everybody. It\u2019s good for our customers because they have a more efficient means to find the product they need, get them order, reduce their \u2013 or I should say, increase their efficiency. It\u2019s good for our business because it reduces our cost to serve as it frees up the time of our sales force to go be consultative instead of taking orders. And those customers, as we always mention, that are buying online, they\u2019re way stickier. Their attrition rates are way about one-third of the rate of non-users and they grow faster with us. So it\u2019s just good all the way around. And so we are, I would say, relentless in our pursuit of driving adoption. And maybe not a great answer, but I think in some areas, we\u2019ve seen great adoption. In others, there\u2019s still a lot of room for improving, but it\u2019s a major focus of ours and will be for the long term. I still think that we\u2019re early days in this whole changing the industry or enabled. But I also still think we\u2019re at the forefront of it.\nStephen Volkmann: I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hello, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Hey good morning. Congrats to you guys and A.J. on a great year and all this technology advances, it really is impressive.\nAlbert Nahmad: Thank you.\nA.J. Nahmad: Thank you.\nSteve Tusa: What\u2019s the \u2013 when you look at your HVAC equipment, could you just \u2013 68% of sales or whatever it is, how much of that now is resi?\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: Yes, Steve. Let me look at it here. Yes.\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul, go ahead.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. The number I have right now is that it\u2019s, for the quarter \u2013 just one quick math here. It\u2019s around 15% to 20%. Excuse me, it\u2019s reverse of that, 85%, 80% - I was doing the reverse math, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, that seems a little bit low. Carrier said something about mid-single-digit movement in the quarter on units. Obviously, you guys are a big percentage of their movement. Do you \u2013 can you help reconcile that number? Is that roughly about kind of the unit movement you guys saw for the quarter?\nPaul Johnston: Yes. Yes, I won\u2019t speak to Carrier, Steve. But we said earlier that overall unit growth was 9% in the quarter.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. For resi or for \u2013 for like the whole equipment business?\nPaul Johnston: That would be primarily resi, yes.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Got it. And I mean, if I kind of look at your \u2013 is the profitability of your resi equipment business, I kind of lost track over this because I know the parts and pieces were pretty strong margin for you guys. Is resi equipment kind of about average when it comes to your gross margin? I would assume given it\u2019s such a big piece of the buy.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. I don\u2019t want to get \u2013 I would not get too specific about that. What I\u2019ll say is this, which is kind of an inverted way of saying \u2013 of answering your question, because I don\u2019t want to speak to residential margins versus the overall. The growth rate in the quarter for equipment was 22%. The growth rate for commercial versus residential in the quarter was within a fraction of that percent, 22%. Residential versus commercial in the quarter or in the year, for that matter, would not have influenced gross margin percent very much. Growth was almost identical. Yes.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. I\u2019m just thinking like just on an annual basis, I just want to make sure that I mean resi such a big piece I would assume it\u2019s around the average of your gross margin for the year.\nPaul Johnston: No comment.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then just one last one. Are there certain OEMs that are growing kind of faster than others within your mix?\nAlbert Nahmad: Is there anything else you want to talk \u2013 Therein \u2013 all our OEMs, they\u2019re all doing the best they can with us to stay up with our demand.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Got you. And then just one last one for you. I don\u2019t know if this was asked before, but what\u2019s your kind of assumption on price capture into 2022? Are you assuming kind of a wraparound from what you\u2019ve gotten and what you put through on Jan 1? Or is there \u2013 are you assuming you\u2019re going to get more as kind of the year progresses?\nAlbert Nahmad: I think we touched on that with the introduction of the whole new lineup of products to meet the regulatory demands. But Paul, you could answer that if you want to.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. We really don\u2019t have a crystal ball. We the OEMs do not consult with us on their price increases. So we do not know if they have another one planned or if they\u2019re going to have to have another one planned on the \u2013 what we do know is there\u2019s going to be product introduced that meets the new energy requirements. And hopefully, we start introducing that in the third or fourth quarter. And that will have a higher price than what we currently sell.\nSteve Tusa: So you kind of wait for an e-mail from Carrier that\u2019s going everybody else as far as the price increases are concerned? You guys don\u2019t discuss that? Okay.\nAlbert Nahmad: Although we always ask the lower prices, no matter what that\u2026\nSteve Tusa: And then last one, because it\u2019s only 10:30, so I feel like we have a little bit of time. Out of that 9% benefit for the year, how much of that \u2013 on price and resi products, how much of that was from mix? And how much was that from just pure price? Because you said ASP, so I would assume that there\u2019s some mix impact in there as well.\nPaul Johnston: Yes, more from price than mix, Steve, yes.\nSteve Tusa: Like a percent or two for mix?\nPaul Johnston: It\u2019s more from price than mix, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, got it.\nPaul Johnston: But \u2013 it is an interesting kind of asterisk to put on that number is part of the \u2013 we talked about this last quarter, part of the supply chain shortage and the most fractured part of the supply chain was ultra-high efficiency equipment. So that\u2019s almost missing from the equation this year as OEMs ramp up production of 20 SEER and above, for example, assuming that they get the chips and the technology in place, is actually a mix opportunity that didn\u2019t play out in 2021.\nSteve Tusa: What, you guys did that \u2013 I got one more that just popped in my mind from that conversation. We\u2019re hearing a lot of distributors are kind of ordering out almost for the entire season, orders, not necessarily taking inventory, obviously, but ordering, which is kind of unusual, I think, relative to history. Are you guys \u2013 did you guys kind of approach things that way with your orders? I know they\u2019re kind of nonbinding, you don\u2019t really even have to put down a deposit. But like have you guys changed your patterns when it comes to ordering here?\nAlbert Nahmad: No. That requires a more complete question that as specific how we deal with inventory. A.J., want to talk about, what we use to determine inventory needs?\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes. I could say that we\u2019re \u2013 our demand planning, demand forecasting, demand planning inventory optimization efforts are maturing and they\u2019re much more sophisticated they ever have been. And that includes helping us in our ability to collaborate with our OEM partners and helping them with their supply chain challenges as well. So without answering your question directly, we\u2019re trying to be helpful to our OEM partners that they want orders ahead of time so they can help with their planning, we\u2019re happy to help with that. If they want us to adjust, we\u2019re happy to help with that. So it\u2019s very much a collaborative effort, it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s no longer a one-way street where you just place an order and wait. It\u2019s a lot of conversation, a lot of data driving around it. And with that collaboration have a lot of flexibility, and we feel like we\u2019re in a very good position.\nSteve Tusa: Great. Alright, thanks for all the color guys. Appreciated.\nA.J. Nahmad: You bet.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hi.\nRyan Merkel: Hey good morning everyone. Nice quarter. So let\u2019s start off on SG&A. So SG&A gross sales in the quarter and for the year, I think we know why, but my question is, how do we think about 2022? Does some of that start to normalize the supply chain fixes itself? Do you think you can leverage SG&A in 2022?\nAlbert Nahmad: We sure hope so. Jan...\nRyan Merkel: Plan in anyway?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, if we continue to do what we did in January, I doubt it, because it\u2019s just too powerful, the growth is too high. Barry, you got a better answer? Or Paul? Or A. J.?\nBarry Logan: Yes. I mean there is, first in the performance-based compensation, Ryan, I\u2019d say if we grow EBIT 57% again in 2022, we\u2019re going to pay \u2013 we\u2019re going to reward our entire team for it. So to the extent growth rates like that moderate, then those variable costs will moderate in the same way, too, in that respect. Freight and some of the variable costs that are typically very predictable, became more unpredictable, to get products to customers and to compete in the market. So I would \u2013 it\u2019s an abstract answer, I realize, but I would expect our variable cost to adjust to whatever the typical business model is. Some of the incremental spending on the fire drills that have had to go on this year to serve customers, I would expect to moderate some. But as Al said, it\u2019s not a visibility that we can point to yet because the business is still very strong.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Okay. No, fair answer. And then I wanted to...\nBarry Logan: It\u2019s a good problem to have.\nRyan Merkel: It is. I hope to grow EBIT 50% again for the record. So I wanted to follow up on mix. So I had that question ready. So I guess two parts of the question. What was the mix of \u2013 in equipment for high efficiency versus sort of base units? And then it seems to me that there\u2019s a few tailwinds, right? You got the SEER change, the OEMs couldn\u2019t produce the high stuff, right, that should probably improve a little bit this year at least. And then you mentioned OnCall Air, I think, is helping you sell or the contractors sell more high-efficiency units. So I don\u2019t know what does that look like over the next couple of years, it feels like it could be a real tailwind.\nAlbert Nahmad: A.J.?\nA.J. Nahmad: I think you\u2019re right. I mean specific to \u2013 well, first of all, it\u2019s a focus of ours, more so than it ever has been. And we\u2019re increasing our focus in the time that\u2019s challenging, like you said or has been said. The high-efficiency systems, especially on the high end of the high-efficiency systems, are largely not available because of supply chain issues, specifically around the shortage of chips that we all read about that go on our cell phones and everything else, they also go on a high-efficiency HVAC systems. But we are increasing our focus on it as a means to help to do our part and help reduce the climate change dynamic. Every time we sell high-efficiency system, it needs fewer CO2e reduction or emission, and we feel like we should do our part to help drive that. OnCall Air, as you mentioned, is a phenomenal tool in that mission. I think, roughly, the math is that about one-third of our sales in total are high-efficiency systems. And OnCall Air is roughly two-third of the sales. And last year, we did almost $650 million or so of gross merchandise volume through that tool, meaning our customer sales to their customers were almost $700 million, and we expect that number to hopefully double this year. So \u2013 and going back to a question you got earlier about adoption, if and when we drive the adoption of that tool to another 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 customers and they\u2019re using that tool at scale, it\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s a good thing for those businesses, it will be driving more sales. It\u2019s a good thing for our business, driving more sales. It\u2019s a good thing for the mix. Hopefully, high-efficiency systems will continue to increase as a part of our sales.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Alright. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hi, Josh.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning guys. So Barry, you\u2019ve sort of referenced it a few times here and I think maybe directly in the question to Steve Volkmann on this whole kind of merchant distributor behavior of kind of passing along price increases pretty orderly or maybe relative to what your inventory carrying costs are. Any way to sort of separate how much of that has really been a function of inventory inflation maybe on the equipment side versus something more commoditized? I mean, I think we can all sort of conceptualize like equipment prices don\u2019t really go backwards, but maybe some of the inventory-related stuff could be a bit more volatile over the next 12 months?\nBarry Logan: Yes. Again, it\u2019s hard to put numbers around all the different product lines because you\u2019re right, it\u2019s duct tape, there may have been an increase in pricing and inflation related to duct tape. But Paul, maybe you have \u2013 you cover a lot of fronts, not just equipment, but all the non-equipment stuff as well. What\u2019s your read?\nPaul Johnston: Yes, on the non-equipment things, it\u2019s \u2013 nobody focuses that much on it, they\u2019re always focused on the OEMs. But I mean, most, everything that we\u2019ve seen on the non-commodity side on the non-equipment has been increasing at a pretty steady rate, more comparable to that of what the OEMs are seeing on the equipment side. A lot of petroleum base, a lot of freight costs going up for those vendors and a lot of disruption in their supply chain. On the commodity side, there\u2019s \u2013 steel and copper, I never try to predict and we don\u2019t hedge and we don\u2019t buy forward based on any sort of mystical knowledge that we have on where those products are going with. On some of the other commodities, there\u2019s a regulation out, like on refrigerant, where this year the industry has to cut back at least 10% of their carbon emissions that they have on refrigerants. So definitely seeing a supply that\u2019s been planned by the government. It\u2019s going to reduce it. And we see another step coming in 2024 where they cut back another 30% on the amount of carbon dioxide emissions that you can have with refrigerants. So that one, at least I can say, I think that\u2019s going to continue to go up as the supply becomes more limited.\nBarry Logan: Josh, to put it in perspective, the word commodity is kind of a big word. And what we look at commodities in our business is roughly 6% of what we do, just to put it \u2013 put some, again, a number on it, where it\u2019s kind of this a year ago that can play out. And a big chunk of that is refrigerant. And as Paul said, there\u2019s more than just commodity activities going on with refrigerant for example.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then you mentioned high efficiency a couple of times here and maybe some of the bottlenecks that are more focused on that given electronics stuffs I got, but just given the level of inflation, has the payback for a customer actually increased like pretty substantially over the past two years? I got to imagine if the price point is 15% or 20% higher or whatever the number is, like it will take you several extra years to kind of claw back whatever the annual savings are to be in the black there. Like is that something that kind of comes forward at the kitchen table and the contractors talking about that?\nPaul Johnston: I think there\u2019s more to it, Josh, than just the payback. I think the payback has been a difficult nut for several years for high efficiency. I think there\u2019s a number of consumers that are buying the units for more than just the efficiency. They\u2019re also buying it for the increased comfort because it has variable speed motors in it. It\u2019s quieter running. It has less temperature change, up and down as the unit comes on and goes off or stays on at a lower speed. So there\u2019s other reasons why people buy high-efficiency equipment besides the economic payback.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then just in terms of the volume growth in the quarter, obviously, more of the shoulder season right now. I get that maybe where some of you guys \u2013 where some of the locations are regionally, there could still be some cooling weather earlier in the fourth quarter. But how much would you say is just sort of catch-up from stuff that didn\u2019t get done maybe in 2Q or 3Q versus kind of new breakage? I know that\u2019s probably more anecdotal in terms of what you guys would have access to, but like is this really kind of new demand that sprung up or more some industry backlog from further down the chain that just needed to get made up over on a later date?\nPaul Johnston: Right. I think that would really be anecdotal. Yes, I would say. And let\u2019s not forget, air conditioning means heating and cooling. So as it gets cold in the north, Watsco now has a great presence in the northern climates, all through the Northeast and now in the Midwest. And as that happens, we get more into the heating season. It\u2019s still not as large to us as the cooling season, but it\u2019s getting larger. And secondly, as I\u2019ve said three times about heat pumps, heat pumps are becoming more and more important and a bigger percent of sales and heat pumps are all about heating indoor air.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. I leave it there.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, thanks for listening, and thanks for your interest in our company. And once again, I hope that all of you stay safe and healthy in this pandemic. Appreciate the interest and don\u2019t hesitate to contact us, if you need more answers to questions. Bye-bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Albert Nahmad",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I hope you're safe and healthy wherever you are. I want to welcome you to our fourth quarter earnings call. And this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. And with me is A.J. Nahmad, President of Watsco; and Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Before we start our report, here is our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws and ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. On to our report. Watsco delivered an exceptional quarter to close out a fantastic year. New records were set for virtually every measure of performance. During the quarter, earnings per share jumped 77% to a record $2.02 per share. Sales grew 31% to a record $1.5 billion. And operating income increased 76% to a record $123 million. And operating margins expanded 210 basis points to a record 8.1% in the fourth quarter. Now \u2013 for results for the year. Earnings per share increased 54% to a record $10.78 per share as sales grew 24% to a record $6.3 billion. During the year, operating income increased $227 million or 57% to a record $629 million, and operating margins reached 10%, a 210 basis points increase from last year. And very important, I only like to emphasize this because this is our culture, we ended the year with a strong balance sheet with very little debt. In fact, our performance gives us confidence to share once again with our shareholders by boosting our dividend 13% to an annual rate of $8.80 per share. Our strong balance sheet also gives us the ability to invest in most any size opportunity as we continue to build scale in the very fragmented $50 billion North American market. We continue to look for acquisitions as Watsco is a great home for family businesses, given that we sustain their cultures, invest in people and provide technology to secure and build on their great legacies. Beyond sales and profits, it is important to understand Watsco's immense potential to impact climate change. Let me explain that. Heating and air conditioning systems account for roughly half of U.S. household energy consumption. Therefore, the purchase and installation of high-efficiency replacement systems is one of the most meaningful steps a homeowner can take to lower his energy cost and reduce CO2 emissions. Given our scale, our access to capital, our entrepreneurial spirit and technology, we believe we are well positioned to help the greatest number of contractors who, in turn, can help more homeowners and businesses to reduce CO2 emissions. Now in terms of impact on CO2. Over the last two years, we estimated Watsco's sales of more efficient systems helped avoid 10.1 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, which is equivalent to taking 2.2 million cars off the road. This is over a two-year period. We note that the regulatory changes \u2013 I'm moving on to a different subject. The government has now moved to change \u2013 make changes that will take effect the beginning of next year. These changes mandate an increase in the minimum efficiency for our HVAC equipment. We know \u2013 excuse me, I've got a cold. Regulatory changes are also on the horizon related to refrigerants to also aid with climate change. That's also a very big move on the emphasis on climate change. OEMs are actively engineering new products to meet the new requirements, all of which should take shape over the next couple of years. Moving on to technology. We continue to invest in technologies to transform our contractor customer experience. Greater adoption and use of our technologies was achieved during 2021. An example is e-commerce sales, which now approach $2 billion a year, and we can see that our active users continue to grow at faster rates than others. If you have an interest in learning more about Watsco technology, please let us know. We will schedule some time with A.J. and his team. We enjoy sharing our passion and the long-term view that is transforming our business. My final thought before we answer questions is to thank all of the Watsco teams across our markets. They have done an extraordinary job to serve customers and produce this type of performance. With that, let's move on to Q&A. How many are on queue? Good morning, Tommy. Never heard that question put it that way. That's good. Well, I'm going to call on two of the resources on the phone, starting with Barry and then followed by Paul. A.J., perhaps you could add something regarding our capability now to see what's going on with competitors and how we react to that. What initiatives do we have with our OEMs? Well, we got all day. Who wants to deal with that? Hi, David. I have to say I don't understand your 20% calculation, and how you derived that. Probably the best resource we have to deal with that is Paul to answer your question. Let's describe unit growth. He's focused on pricing. A.J.? We gave you the hard way. Or [indiscernible] January, we'd be very excited. January is very strong. Well, our inventory king is Barry Logan. Hi, Jeff. Barry? Or another way to say it is our retiring network is growing at a very rapid rate throughout the system to 673 locations. Not sure I even understand. But Paul, if you got it. Good morning, Steven. He can answer that, he's a better man than me. Go ahead. Well, there's also the climate change, that we see as a growing part of our demand because it's becoming more and more in the minds of homeowners and business owners. And we started to discuss that in the press release or we're adding more to it, I should say, that we started. And I see that as a constant increasing demand for these higher efficiency products. I see this as a positive in the short term and the long term. And it does a lot of good by removing CO2 emissions every time we install one of these things. These units require less power and less power means less CO2 emissions by the power companies. That's not a short-term issue. It's going to go on for quite a while. It's just beginning actually. And we are the largest player in the industry, I think, can make the most significant impact. I mean this country and the rest of the world, most of the rest of the world, they want less CO2 emission, and they're going to regulate to get it. And our industry is no exception. That's what the regulations are, to mandate higher efficiency rates and also to mandate the change of the refrigerant. So it harms \u2013 so it reduces the harm to the climate. Those are big factors that will drive our performance. Hello, Steve. Thank you. Barry? Paul, go ahead. Is there anything else you want to talk \u2013 Therein \u2013 all our OEMs, they're all doing the best they can with us to stay up with our demand. I think we touched on that with the introduction of the whole new lineup of products to meet the regulatory demands. But Paul, you could answer that if you want to. Although we always ask the lower prices, no matter what that... No. That requires a more complete question that as specific how we deal with inventory. A.J., want to talk about, what we use to determine inventory needs? Hi. We sure hope so. Jan... Well, if we continue to do what we did in January, I doubt it, because it's just too powerful, the growth is too high. Barry, you got a better answer? Or Paul? Or A. J.? A.J.? Hi, Josh. Well, thanks for listening, and thanks for your interest in our company. And once again, I hope that all of you stay safe and healthy in this pandemic. Appreciate the interest and don't hesitate to contact us, if you need more answers to questions. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "Good morning, Tommy, appreciate that. Well, again, I think there are several things to \u2013 layers to the discussion and one of which is not accounting. We use weighted average cost on a FIFO basis. And as we buy products and sell them and mark them up, it's a pretty clean mechanism to get to gross margin. There's nothing that's interesting or unordinary in terms of that simple equation. But in terms of the layers, again, you're right, sales mix does drive higher margin. We do see higher margins as we sell a richer mix of efficiency. We give some inference in that in our press release in terms of growth rate of high efficiency versus the base efficiency or the overall, I should say, the overall growth rates. Also, inflation, as we pass through inflation, as we receive higher cost from OEMs and we move that product through to our customers, it is an opportunity for us to be a good merchant and realize some margin dollars as we pass that through. You can also see that the non-equipment business has had a terrific year. Gross margin rates in our non-equipment business have done very well. And again, yields an overall improvement in margin. So probably a few more layers, maybe Paul can cover. But if you listen to my words carefully, this is about buying products, passing them through the value chain to our customer and yielding a terrific result. There's really not much more to it than that. Paul? I can give it a start. We're in constant communication with our OEMs. They're vital to our success and we're vital to their success. And so we have generally weekly meetings with most of our major OEMs where we go through inventory analysis, pricing that we see in the field, opportunities that we could get in front of to do, marketing programs, the whole list of things that we do with our OEMs. Our relationship is very strong. Yes. I was going to fill in the blanks for you, Dave. First, our math and our numbers, as you see in the press release, a 22% growth in HVAC equipment, and that excludes acquisitions. Price and mix together is somewhere in the low double-digits and the rest, closer to 10%, is the unit growth in the quarter. So if I look at it in a context of a year, unit growth in the quarter and unit growth for the year is exactly the same, 9%. Yes, Jeff, good morning. You're right, you're right, sequentially they grew. And sequentially last year, it was in a much different position. So year-over-year, if you look at it that way, it's a peculiar comparison. Third quarter to fourth quarter, you're right, there is a measure of inflation. But put things in this context, looking at a longer time period, I'm going to make everyone do that, look at longer time periods than just a quarter, which is inventory today or year-end versus two years ago and take the volatility of all the supply chain out, let's look out over a two-year period, like inventories are up around 12% 2019 to 2021. And Watsco is obviously a 20% larger company over that time period. And I'm adjusting for acquisitions when I make that \u2013 do that math. So, I think as we said in the press release, it's kind of reestablishing inventories kind of where they \u2013 where they should be given the outlook and the OEMs in the off-season here having more capability of doing that. And it puts our inventory more in line with where it should be given what's going on. Yes. They're both revenue numbers. You can compare 26% to the overall of 17%. Good morning, Jeff. The big company that was acquired in, I think, March or April, was TEC and they've had a record year and has a terrific contribution to our results this year. The smaller ones also performed well and contributed what they contributed. So nothing other than great performance on their part as being the first year as part of Watsco. Again... Well, kind of as Paul said, all the variables we believe always will have some variability going forward. So that's just the reality of business. And again, being a merchant and managing all the variables as they play out, not having necessarily live and die by the metric. So probably the thing that is realistic and the answer is that any kind of inflation that we pass through to our customers that we absorb and move through and benefits gross margin, there's a benefit to the inventory that we own at a certain cost as that \u2013 as our prices increase and it passes through the system, so to speak, there's a benefit to that, a margin benefit to that. And every distributor of every kind that is public that you can invest in will have that same capability of yielding slightly higher margins as things pass through. And so that \u2013 I would say there is a benefit there that is reliant on continued growth in price. As Paul suggested, I think we were comfortable with seeing a higher price environment this year. We have new products on the horizon next year that relate to the higher SEER units that will pass through, and we're talking about different refrigerant products a couple of years out. So, I think the industry as a whole has this inflationary feel to it. And the manufacturers are having to invest a bunch of their R&D in these new products. So they're under pressure to sustain pricing, I believe. And so I think we're in a good place in terms of that inflationary feeling [ph]. That is helpful. And just one last thought that we really haven't covered, and we kind of covered it, but I want to cover it more specifically, is we are the largest customer of most of our manufacturers. I say that with no bravado or ego, it's an opportunity. If our OEMs want to grow share and grow the market and grow their business and grow their profitability, we collaborate together and do it. And the equation that we obviously work on together is the profitability when we sell their products and how much we can invest in the markets to help grow the mutual share of our OEMs. So that's an equation that is obviously always being worked on and always being examined to not just be more profitable, but to grow the business. Yes, Steve. Let me look at it here. Yes. Yes. I mean there is, first in the performance-based compensation, Ryan, I'd say if we grow EBIT 57% again in 2022, we're going to pay \u2013 we're going to reward our entire team for it. So to the extent growth rates like that moderate, then those variable costs will moderate in the same way, too, in that respect. Freight and some of the variable costs that are typically very predictable, became more unpredictable, to get products to customers and to compete in the market. So I would \u2013 it's an abstract answer, I realize, but I would expect our variable cost to adjust to whatever the typical business model is. Some of the incremental spending on the fire drills that have had to go on this year to serve customers, I would expect to moderate some. But as Al said, it's not a visibility that we can point to yet because the business is still very strong. It's a good problem to have. Yes. Again, it's hard to put numbers around all the different product lines because you're right, it's duct tape, there may have been an increase in pricing and inflation related to duct tape. But Paul, maybe you have \u2013 you cover a lot of fronts, not just equipment, but all the non-equipment stuff as well. What's your read? Josh, to put it in perspective, the word commodity is kind of a big word. And what we look at commodities in our business is roughly 6% of what we do, just to put it \u2013 put some, again, a number on it, where it's kind of this a year ago that can play out. And a big chunk of that is refrigerant. And as Paul said, there's more than just commodity activities going on with refrigerant for example."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "A.J. Nahmad",
            "content": "Yes. Paul mentioned we've made major investments in technology regarding pricing and pricing optimization, and that does give us visibility to all of our customers who all buy all the products that we sell at different prices, believe it or not. So the tool gives us and our teams and our analysts very quick access to see are the right \u2013 are we matching the right pricing profiles with the right customers and giving them a price that's appropriate for them to buy? So it's not just about raising prices per se, it's also about selling more product. And that is in the early days, but we expect it to have a continued impact on our margin realization. Yes, if I may, this is A.J. again. I mean I hate to be just a technology guy, but as we speak, our senior technology folks are sitting with the senior technology folks of one of our leading OEMs and plotting how we can leverage each other's capabilities and data sets to make one plus one equals three, serve our collective customers better and help them grow their businesses. Those are opportunities that Watsco has, I think, pretty uniquely with our OEM partners because of our strength and what we do and in the technologies and platforms that we've made. I'm not sure... Yes. I'm not sure that information, we're ready, willing, able to share. But I don't think that there's any reason to expect abnormally high or low unit growth to answer your question, Dave. Paul, maybe you have a better answer on that? He's more than that. He started at tech for sure, he let it \u2013 he's put together an extraordinary team, nothing like it anywhere that I'm aware of in the industry. But he \u2013 ask him anything that to be technology involved. Yes. Well, for starters, we're never satisfied. I mean, we sell products to 100,000 contractors. And in my opinion, all of them should be using all of our technologies all the time. I mean that's the end goal. I have to say that there is some there is opportunity that to do better and you heard to say about e-commerce, for example, which is a good barometer for most of it, is about one-third of our sales. Well, we have some regions, major regions of our business, $400 million, $500 million regions that are over 60% of our sales with e-commerce. So you know it's possible. And when that happens, it's good for everybody. It's good for our customers because they have a more efficient means to find the product they need, get them order, reduce their \u2013 or I should say, increase their efficiency. It's good for our business because it reduces our cost to serve as it frees up the time of our sales force to go be consultative instead of taking orders. And those customers, as we always mention, that are buying online, they're way stickier. Their attrition rates are way about one-third of the rate of non-users and they grow faster with us. So it's just good all the way around. And so we are, I would say, relentless in our pursuit of driving adoption. And maybe not a great answer, but I think in some areas, we've seen great adoption. In others, there's still a lot of room for improving, but it's a major focus of ours and will be for the long term. I still think that we're early days in this whole changing the industry or enabled. But I also still think we're at the forefront of it. Thank you. Yes. I could say that we're \u2013 our demand planning, demand forecasting, demand planning inventory optimization efforts are maturing and they're much more sophisticated they ever have been. And that includes helping us in our ability to collaborate with our OEM partners and helping them with their supply chain challenges as well. So without answering your question directly, we're trying to be helpful to our OEM partners that they want orders ahead of time so they can help with their planning, we're happy to help with that. If they want us to adjust, we're happy to help with that. So it's very much a collaborative effort, it's not \u2013 it's no longer a one-way street where you just place an order and wait. It's a lot of conversation, a lot of data driving around it. And with that collaboration have a lot of flexibility, and we feel like we're in a very good position. You bet. I think you're right. I mean specific to \u2013 well, first of all, it's a focus of ours, more so than it ever has been. And we're increasing our focus in the time that's challenging, like you said or has been said. The high-efficiency systems, especially on the high end of the high-efficiency systems, are largely not available because of supply chain issues, specifically around the shortage of chips that we all read about that go on our cell phones and everything else, they also go on a high-efficiency HVAC systems. But we are increasing our focus on it as a means to help to do our part and help reduce the climate change dynamic. Every time we sell high-efficiency system, it needs fewer CO2e reduction or emission, and we feel like we should do our part to help drive that. OnCall Air, as you mentioned, is a phenomenal tool in that mission. I think, roughly, the math is that about one-third of our sales in total are high-efficiency systems. And OnCall Air is roughly two-third of the sales. And last year, we did almost $650 million or so of gross merchandise volume through that tool, meaning our customer sales to their customers were almost $700 million, and we expect that number to hopefully double this year. So \u2013 and going back to a question you got earlier about adoption, if and when we drive the adoption of that tool to another 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 customers and they're using that tool at scale, it's a good thing. It's a good thing for those businesses, it will be driving more sales. It's a good thing for our business, driving more sales. It's a good thing for the mix. Hopefully, high-efficiency systems will continue to increase as a part of our sales."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Yes. And part of that, we made a \u2013 part of our technology investment, we made a strong investment in the latest technology for pricing systems. So, we have a better handle on, as the price increases occur, we're able to move them through faster and also make sure that we're getting the yield from the price increase that we expect. Are we continuing to see price increases? Yes, there were price increases from most OEMs on the equipment side that were passed through January 1, and we've implemented those. Secondly, we're seeing price increases on a lot of different non-equipment products, which we don't talk about an awful lot, but, as Barry indicated, has been a very strong growth area for us, both in the way of sales as well as emphasis. So it's \u2013 I don't see any letdown in prices or a reduction in prices. It's pretty much been full steam ahead. As you know, we saw record price increases last year from the OEMs. And as I indicated, we started the year with a price increase. Do we see a second price increase? I don't know. I have no idea if the OEMs are going to be having to put through another price increase. However, we do know that we've got a change in standards coming, which is going to result in another price increase as we implement the new products that are coming out that are going to meet the new higher efficiency. I guess we've all got our models, and I've read a lot about your models. But all models are great, but they're all wrong. But I guess what I'm looking at is I'm looking at what are the \u2013 what are the currents that go on in the marketplace that really drive our sales? And one, existing home sales are strong right now. So, I feel good about that. Because generally, people will buy or upgrade their system when they buy an existing home. We've already talked about price. We've seen a continuous trend of heat pump growth in the marketplace and heat pumps command a higher price than a trade cool unit. The efficiency progress that we've made in the past, we expect to continue. So all in all, I expect a normal year regardless of what the models say, I see a normal year. Yes, definitely. The pre-buys in the past were predicated on an availability or a channel that was able to supply the units to the distribution, which hasn't existed here in the last, what, 18 months to 24 months. But the second reason why I don't see a real big pre-buy on anybody's part is because some of the equipment is based upon date of sale and not date of manufacture. And so if it's been manufactured after a certain date \u2013 or if you sell it after a certain date, you're not allowed to do that. Yes. I don't know if the mid-single digit or the single digit is the starting point or not. But the non-equipment that you asked about, yes, that varies by product type. Some products, obviously like steel products, steel duckboard, flat steel, that type of thing, they've been going up at a higher rate than that. Whereas things like motors and some \u2013 and thermostats have been going up at a more planned rate. But it's pretty much across the board, equipment and non-equipment have seen price increases. I agree with Al. I mean it's \u2013 even without inflation, without inflation, we're still going to have to trend towards more heat pumps. We're still going to have to trend to higher efficiency, that is going to be not just a trend, but a regulation from the federal government. And as Barry indicated, we go through a second phase of this on a longer-term basis as we change refrigerants and move away from the 410 that we've used for the last 15 years and move into new lower CO2-emitting refrigerants. Yes. The number I have right now is that it's, for the quarter \u2013 just one quick math here. It's around 15% to 20%. Excuse me, it's reverse of that, 85%, 80% - I was doing the reverse math, Steve. Yes. Yes, I won't speak to Carrier, Steve. But we said earlier that overall unit growth was 9% in the quarter. That would be primarily resi, yes. Yes. I don't want to get \u2013 I would not get too specific about that. What I'll say is this, which is kind of an inverted way of saying \u2013 of answering your question, because I don't want to speak to residential margins versus the overall. The growth rate in the quarter for equipment was 22%. The growth rate for commercial versus residential in the quarter was within a fraction of that percent, 22%. Residential versus commercial in the quarter or in the year, for that matter, would not have influenced gross margin percent very much. Growth was almost identical. Yes. No comment. Yes. We really don't have a crystal ball. We the OEMs do not consult with us on their price increases. So we do not know if they have another one planned or if they're going to have to have another one planned on the \u2013 what we do know is there's going to be product introduced that meets the new energy requirements. And hopefully, we start introducing that in the third or fourth quarter. And that will have a higher price than what we currently sell. Yes, more from price than mix, Steve, yes. It's more from price than mix, Steve. But \u2013 it is an interesting kind of asterisk to put on that number is part of the \u2013 we talked about this last quarter, part of the supply chain shortage and the most fractured part of the supply chain was ultra-high efficiency equipment. So that's almost missing from the equation this year as OEMs ramp up production of 20 SEER and above, for example, assuming that they get the chips and the technology in place, is actually a mix opportunity that didn't play out in 2021. Yes, on the non-equipment things, it's \u2013 nobody focuses that much on it, they're always focused on the OEMs. But I mean, most, everything that we've seen on the non-commodity side on the non-equipment has been increasing at a pretty steady rate, more comparable to that of what the OEMs are seeing on the equipment side. A lot of petroleum base, a lot of freight costs going up for those vendors and a lot of disruption in their supply chain. On the commodity side, there's \u2013 steel and copper, I never try to predict and we don't hedge and we don't buy forward based on any sort of mystical knowledge that we have on where those products are going with. On some of the other commodities, there's a regulation out, like on refrigerant, where this year the industry has to cut back at least 10% of their carbon emissions that they have on refrigerants. So definitely seeing a supply that's been planned by the government. It's going to reduce it. And we see another step coming in 2024 where they cut back another 30% on the amount of carbon dioxide emissions that you can have with refrigerants. So that one, at least I can say, I think that's going to continue to go up as the supply becomes more limited. I think there's more to it, Josh, than just the payback. I think the payback has been a difficult nut for several years for high efficiency. I think there's a number of consumers that are buying the units for more than just the efficiency. They're also buying it for the increased comfort because it has variable speed motors in it. It's quieter running. It has less temperature change, up and down as the unit comes on and goes off or stays on at a lower speed. So there's other reasons why people buy high-efficiency equipment besides the economic payback. Right. I think that would really be anecdotal. Yes, I would say. And let's not forget, air conditioning means heating and cooling. So as it gets cold in the north, Watsco now has a great presence in the northern climates, all through the Northeast and now in the Midwest. And as that happens, we get more into the heating season. It's still not as large to us as the cooling season, but it's getting larger. And secondly, as I've said three times about heat pumps, heat pumps are becoming more and more important and a bigger percent of sales and heat pumps are all about heating indoor air."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask question. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Albert Nahmad, CEO. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. First, I hope everyone is safe and healthy given the virus is going on. But this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. And with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; our two Executive Vice President, Paul Johnston and Barry Logan; and Rick Gomez, Vice President. Before we start our normal cautionary statement, this conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Now I am pleased to share that Watsco delivered another record quarter. New records were achieved in virtually every performance metric. Earnings per share jumped 31% to a record $3.62 per share and a 32% increase in net income. Sales grew 16% or nearly $250 million during the quarter, to a record $1.78 billion. Gross profit increased 29% with gross margins expanding 280 basis points. Operating income increased $50 million, or 32%, to a record $207 million. Operating margins expanded 100 basis points to a record 11.6%. And cash flow for the quarter was a record $238 million. Today's results are all the more positive when considered against last year's record results and in light of the industry-wide supply challenges that are still going on. Our teams throughout all of Watsco are doing an extraordinary job taking care of customers, and that has made a big difference. I want to say thanks to all of you. We also ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with virtually no debt and cash of $137 million. This financial strength provides us the flexibility to invest in most any size opportunity. Our press release summarizes important fundamentals that are critical to understand as we continue to invest and build further scale in what is a very fragmented $50 billion North American market. An important fundamental is Watsco's geographic coverage and our large number of low cases across many markets. The diversity of markets we serve reduces volatility and provide stability during a difficult operating environment, such as the one we are witnessing. Also, our large and growing customer base is increasingly equipped with our state-of-the-art technology that helps our customers grow their business and purchase more from us. Another advantage now and in the future is our offerings of the broadest variety of products and brands in the industry. The depth and diversity of our product offerings should continue to serve us well. We're optimistic about current market conditions. Let me say that again, optimistic about current market conditions and recent trends. End market demand remains strong, and we see signs of improvement in our OEM's ability to help us fulfill that demand. Looking ahead, the industry will experience more change in the years to come as minimum SEER standards rise, that normally will be done by the federal government, by the way, and refrigerant changes that take shape in the coming years. And with changes come opportunities, we believe that our long-term focus, our scale, speed to market, relationship with OEMs, technology offerings position us better than anyone to capitalize on these upcoming changes. We are living in unusual times, but could not be more positive and excited about the future of the industry and our role in it. Now let's go on to our Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Okay, moving on. Our next first question is coming from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: You referenced increasing engagement with some of your OEM partners and an increased ability to help you meet the robust underlying demand. At this point in the year, I wonder if you've started to talk to some of the initiatives for 2022 planning? And if so, what, if any, insight, can you give us on those\nAlbert Nahmad: I like that question because all of us in the industry are finding just to get enough product to continue to meet the demand. But 2022, but best one for that, I think, is Paul Johnston.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. First of all, I'd like to say that we're not increasing our conversation with the OEMs. We're under -- we have been continually communicating with our OEMs and them with us. So the relationship there, all barring the pandemic and even before the pandemic, we are working with them on product planning and delivery planning and all that. Right now, what we're looking at in 2022 is we're trying to straighten the inventories out a bit. What we ended up with was some of our inventories ended up to be a little bit lopsided on indoor versus outdoor-type units. So we're working with them trying to balance that out so we can sell complete systems. We've been working with them on what the transition plans obviously, are going to be given that next year is a big year when we're going to be transitioning to 2023 to the -- or 2022 and 2023 to the new SEER levels. So it's been a -- it's a full agenda that we have with our OEM partners as far as communicating and planning with most of them, as you recognize, we're one of the largest customers, if not their largest customer. And so we're important to each other.\nTommy Moll: If I could, I wanted to pivot to the customer side of the business for you. How receptive have they been of late to price increases? And I ask that because clearly, there's input inflation on the OEM side, presumably in this environment, your customers are going to be pretty receptive to your passing that through. It would occur to me that if you've got product available, there's less concern around pricing, which is going to be pretty well passed through to the end user anyway. But any context you can give us on that dynamic?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I think your thought process is a good one, but let's see if Paul can fill in to hole there.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. It's -- we always talk about the equipment. Yes, those are the most recognized price increases that we have. And the dealer contractors have been accepting of them, especially those who are in the replacement business. Perhaps, a little more resistance from people who are on the new construction side. But we've also -- they are also experiencing upticks in commodity pricing, with copper going up above $4.70 here recently a pound. We're seeing flex stock go up double digit pretty much every 3 to 6 months. So a lot of the other products that go into actually installing a units are going up at the same time. So I think we're all a little bit numb to it, including our contractors and accepting it, and trying to pass it on as best we can, given the timing of how many price increases we've had here in the last call it, 18 months.\nAlbert Nahmad: But it doesn't seem to be slowing demand. Our demand is strong.\nPaul Johnston: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question is from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSteve Volkmann: Just following up on that last one, Al. Are you guys seeing any change in your mix relative to the type of equipment customers are willing to pay for at this point?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, that's a very enlightened question because there is a chip shortage. So we see high efficiency demand there, but we're unable to fulfill it given the supply of that product. Paul, do you want to fill in?\nPaul Johnston: Yes, that's very true. It's -- it takes more hours for an OEM to make a high efficiency to make an 18 or 20 SEER product. And so the focus has been pretty much on the 16 SEER, 15 SEER, 14 SEER, 13 SEER product. So a little bit of a shift there where we're seeing a bump in 16 SEER sales and obviously, 14, 13 SEER sales and a small decline in 18, 20 SEER. Having said that, the 18, 20 SEER has never been a major portion of the market. And obviously, it's something we would like to have as a major portion of the market. And hopefully, with the new energy standards, we'll be able to expand the very high efficiency products as a greater percentage of our sales.\nBarry Logan: Yes, just to add a thought to that. Just so it's clear on the data, what the data says, the high-efficiency mix increased again this quarter. It's almost 11 straight years of quarters where it increased. But that ultra-high efficiency is where the missing link is and did not contribute, but overall, high efficiency grew at a faster rate than base efficiency.\nSteve Volkmann: So it almost sounds like as -- or if maybe, I should say, if the supply chain issues ultimately normalize, and we have these kind of SEER changes happening in '23, we may actually see a better mix shift going forward?\nAlbert Nahmad: I would agree with that. Absolutely.\nPaul Johnston: But we're definitely going to see a better mix change because the efficiency going up to 14 SEER in the north and 15 in the south. So\nAlbert Nahmad: Which is mandated by the federal government.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. So we're going to see that regardless. Our focus is we really want to make sure that, that ultra-high efficiency that Barry refers to grows at a faster rate and becomes a more material piece of the market.\nSteve Volkmann: Understood. Okay. And then a quick follow-up. I think you mentioned in your prepared release that SG&A spending was a little bit elevated, and you expected that to normalize as we go forward. Obviously, gross margin was also very good. Do you also expect gross margin to normalize going forward? Or do you think you can kind of hold the rate that we have?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, that's a very perceptive question. Looking into the future. Who wants to take that? Barry or Paul.\nPaul Johnston: Barry, that sounds like your question.\nBarry Logan: Alright. Here we go. So let's get to SG&A first because that's easier to think about. Obviously, everything we've said -- and I just want to say this also, so it's on the table for the rest of the call. Sales volume in the second quarter was up 29% on a same-store basis, I think, something like that. So this has been an extraordinary summer if you look at things as a combined last 6 months. Let's not just talk in quarters, let's look at our seasonal realities of what we dealt with. Extraordinary demand, SG&A that needed to deal with, a lot of stuff going on in terms of supply chain to make it work. A lot of austerity that came off last year's comparison that is now in this year's numbers. And just, again, as I said, drinking through a firehose over the last 6 months. So SG&A, we wanted to highlight some things very specific to SG&A that are big buckets. And the word normalized usually means it goes down or declines. Let's put it this way, there's a lot of variable costs that increased those costs remain variable and will adjust themselves to whatever the sales volume is over the next 12 months. As Al suggested in the remarks, we're not necessarily seeing a slack in demand as we get out of season right now. In fact, we're seeing increased demand as we're going out of season from, let's say, recent days. And so SG&A will normalize. But again, time will tell and the variable cost should adjust over time. Gross profit is a more interesting question. Obviously, I've said this for a career, and we've said this in our comments over many years, inflation is something that we pass through and pass on. It adds to a gross profit equation and makes more money for us. There's no question of that. We're also doing immense work with technology to improve pricing and margin. And to optimize pricing, that doesn't necessarily mean just getting higher margins. That means improving our pricing profile across customers, competitors, products and so on. There's a benefit this year in that equation, which is only just the beginning of a pricing discussion. And I think mix also obviously has a benefit. And you heard Paul's comments earlier about mix maybe looking forward. But that's a big crystal ball to look into, to be honest. And for some of the undercurrent of inflation and mix and technology and incentives and the way we pay salespeople and commission our sales force, all those things are pulling in that direction. So in next year, I'll tell you more when we know more, but that's what I would tell you today.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: So just follow-on on the gross margin. It looks like if I do the math right, the gross margins on the acquisitions are higher than your blended average and the SG&A seems higher on a blended basis. Is there anything -- I know like TEC, I think, is the biggest acquisition contributor, but maybe just speak to those dynamics, those impacts?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I got to say, Barry will answer that, but this is a $6 billion a year business. And what you're talking about is small relative to the overall in revenue. I can't imagine that's driving the overall numbers that you perceive. But Barry, go ahead.\nBarry Logan: Yes, Jeff, I mean again, as related to what we've acquired lately. And yes, the margin and yes, the cost of doing businesses is higher. That's unique and eccentric to TEC, and it's part of their legacy and profile of how they go to market. So they've had an exceptional last 6 months as part of Watsco. They've had an exceptional year coming into this year. And very proud and happy that they're part of Watsco.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. Great. Thanks for all the color on the '21 performance. That was really helpful. Just sticking to the price dynamic, I think you called out 6% increase in average selling price for the year-to-date. I'm just wondering if that number overall, is higher within the context of 3Q? And then if there's any noticeable difference in that 6% between equipment versus the nonequipment?\nPaul Johnston: I'll take a first stab, but Barry, do you want to take the second half? But is there a difference between equipment and nonequipment? Yes. Anything that's commodity-based has an external profile where the pricing fluctuates on a daily, weekly basis. And as I mentioned earlier, things like copper, refrigerant, steel have definitely been on the incline and have gone up faster than for the last 18 months have gone up faster than equipment. Equipment has a more slower cadence to it because there has to be an announced period of time before we have a recognized price increase. So normally, we get anywhere from 60- to 90-day lead time on the announcement before it's implemented. So it gives us an opportunity to adjust ourselves. So timing is not unique to the third quarter or to 2021 so far.\nOperator: The next question is from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Manthey: So just definitionally, when you're talking about the 6% year-to-date price increase on residential HVAC, is that the typical price mix definition that you've given us historically ?\nBarry Logan: Yes, it is, Joe -- yes, it is, Dave.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. And then as far as the increased investment that you outlined, and thanks for doing that out of that clarity, is some of that incumbent on the gross margin being elevated here? And Barry, you noted that some of the variable expenses will obviously naturally flex down if things moderate a bit next year. But if gross margin moderates and sales moderate, is this a fluid plan? Do you kind of modifying that investment plan if things moderate a bit next year?\nBarry Logan: Yes. The answer is, of course. I mean, this is 673 location managers managing P&Ls. It's 30, 35 super power presidents running markets. It's a data platform suggesting, and telling, and reminding, and monitoring margins and cost and profitability every single minute of the day. It's incentive systems that geared toward EBIT growth and cash flow production. So, yes. I mean, culturally, the intent and the obvious culture is profitability growth responsible ways is what the mission is. So it may be different in Texas than in Massachusetts next year. It may be different in California than it is in Chicago. So this decentralization and data flow that goes on in markets is how we operate. And when I say, of course, it's because all those dynamics get measured and carried out in different ways in different markets. So clearly, all these moving pieces that are going on are different everywhere. And so culturally, every Friday morning, we spend a few hours together, go through it all together and act and react accordingly. So the answer is, of course, there'll be actions and reactions going on as things change.\nDavid Manthey: Yes. Got it. Okay. And just quickly as it relates to technology investments or other sort of corporate level decisions, I know there's not that many of those, but what about those? I mean, those are obviously not controlled by the markets individually. Are those subject to? Or those set in stone at this point?\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes, let me deal with that. I agree that that's not controlled the way you stated. But let's have A.J. respond to that.\nAaron Nahmad: Yes. Well, as you saw in our release, our investments in technology continue to grow. And that's because we are maturing things that are already in flight, and we're taking on new projects and programs, all with the intent of continually improving and modernizing everything we do, all focused around helping our customers do business loss and helping them grow their businesses. So as we see more and more opportunity, we're going to continue to invest.\nAlbert Nahmad: In other words, we are dedicated to the long-term, and A.J. said it, but we don't see any reason not to continue to invest regardless of what's going on in fluctuations from season to season.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: I was wondering if you could give us your early thoughts on behavior around the potential for prebuy next year. And I asked the question kind of in the spirit that folks are programmed for prices to move up. And so is there actually much logic or much to be gained from distributors wanting to prebuy into that efficiency change?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, right now, the reality is that prebuy doesn't help anything. We can't get what we want now, and we don't seem to be -- we don't see an end of that yet. So we don't even face those prebuy decisions. What we need now is enough product to meet the demand that we seem to be having at record levels into the -- going into the fourth quarter. It will be adjust and prebuys, of course, we would. We have a lot of data that -- and a lot of software that tells us how to manage our investment in inventory. Right now, it's a scramble.\nJeff Sprague: So you would be interested in prebuying along maybe historical patterns if the product was available to do so?\nPaul Johnston: No. No, I don't think that would be the case. We just want what we have on order. We want to bring it in exactly -- Al spot on. I don't see a prebuy. We don't see a prebuy coming at us. We want to make sure we get the inventory that we need to meet current demand and as well as early part demand. I don't think anybody is looking at carrying a huge amount of inventory into 2022 because there's going to be different government regulations, which are going to have different requirements for where and how you can sell it. So I don't think it's going to be an issue this year.\nJeff Sprague: Yes. I was sort of meaning prebuying in '22, not right now. But it sounds like the answer is probably the same, regardless?\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes.\nJeff Sprague: Yes. And sort of related to that, what percent of your sales now is above the minimum efficiency standards across the platform?\nAlbert Nahmad: They all have to be -- or above.\nPaul Johnston: Minimum. I'm saying -- so you got 80% or 90%, I would think, at, right? I guess the question is, what's the percent above.\nAlbert Nahmad: Above the minimum. That's a good question. Do we have that data available?\nPaul Johnston: Yes. It's quite a bit higher than you think. It's higher than 50% is actually above the minimum.\nJeff Sprague: Interesting. That is higher than I would have guessed.\nPaul Johnston: You've got a lot of other rules that apply to it, such as EPA, new home construction in order to get your sticker from the EPA, you have to have a higher efficiency product. And there's an awful lot of the 14 SEER product that actually goes to 15.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Dankert with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nChris Dankert: I guess maybe just one a little more target A.J.. You did highlight some new projects. I guess, anything specifically you're right to discuss over at the skunkworks Watsco yet? Or we -- anything new to talk about there? You got about a week.\nAaron Nahmad: Yes, exactly. Now you know that these are all long-term things that we're a long-term company. So I wouldn't -- we don't need to highlight things that are just in early stage development. I will tell you some of the earlier things that are getting a little bit more mature, which we -- I don't know if we include in this quarter's release, but our OnCall Air, which is our tool to help the contractors sell to their customers and CreditForComfort, which is a companion tool to help them sell the financing, they're both continuing to grow and very exciting. And customers that are using those tools and really our technology in general continue to be better customers for us, meaning they're stickier, their attrition rates are much lower and their growth rates with us are much higher. So all the data shows that these technology investments are paying off and having a nice return.\nChris Dankert: Got it. And you've given us some of the numbers in the past. I guess, are you guys willing to comment on kind of what e-commerce growth was in the third quarter here?\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes, we can give me that. Sure. Who's got that number? Barry or Rick, anybody?\nBarry Logan: 15%, 16% was the growth in e-commerce for the quarter.\nAlbert Nahmad: Rick, I was trying to get you in, but Barry cut you off.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: So I think it was Al maybe you mentioned that the supply chain is going to get better in the fourth quarter. Is that all of your equipment OEs? Or are certain OEMs doing better than others?\nAlbert Nahmad: Let me say that it's not gotten better just yet. And when I say that, I'm talking about all of them. We're hoping it will get better in the fourth quarter. But as I said earlier, the demand is so high now that it's not easy for them to catch up. And it's all of them, and it's not one that's better than the other. I mean, there -- as you know, we're probably the biggest customer for all of them that represent our brands. Now, I would still say it's still catch up. I don't see any solutions to supply chain yet that we're optimistic.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. And I don't know if you mentioned this, but did you leave revenue on the table you think this quarter because you just didn't have -- okay. Probably hard to quantify, but is it material? Or\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. Did we take a shot at that, Paul? I don't remember? Let's not speculate. I'd rather not speculate.\nPaul Johnston: It's pure speculation. If you listen to the salesman, it's a lot higher than it is when you listen to the data. It's a way.\nAlbert Nahmad: The OEMs are running flat out, and they're doing the best they can. And I'm talking about all of them that we buy from and I think we have, besides the three major equipment OEMs, we have numerous other OEMs, and they're doing the best they can. Have they caught up, not even close. Will we see some improvement as the quarter proceeds? I think so.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. That's helpful. And then I'm noticing there's more private equity interest in HVAC distribution lately. And I'm just curious, are you seeing multiples rise in space? And is there more competition for deals?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, that question answers itself. Sure, with private equity gets involved, there is more competition. Is it affecting how we think about our strategy? We won't. We will not chase pricing because we're in for the long term. I don't know how long they're going to be in terms of valuations for businesses. So -- but there are a large number of distributors. What's our latest count, Barry, more or less?\nBarry Logan: In terms of acquisition, 65.\nAlbert Nahmad: No, no, no. Available -- independent distributors. How many\nBarry Logan: 1,300.\nAlbert Nahmad: 1,300. So there's room for lots of stuff for us.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: So on price, you guys booked 12% ASP in the second quarter, 2% in the first quarter. I think you're saying it's up 6% year-to-date. Can you just give us what the -- I mean, given the seasonality, I guess we could kind of do the math, but what was the third quarter ASP for U.S. resi year-over-year?\nBarry Logan: Very consistent, Steve, with the overall 6%.\nSteve Tusa: So why did that decel? Am I missing something on kind of like the comps. Most guys are thinking things continue to accelerate with all these price increases coming through. Any particular reason why that decelerated quarter-to-quarter?\nPaul Johnston: I'm not -- season, things change very much in terms of price in the course of the season. There are some late quarter price increases that flow in, I think, September that will flow into the fourth quarter. But in-season, Steve, there's not much variation. And with the kind of volatility that went on, I'm not going to surmise much over the last 90 days, just given what was going on.\nAlbert Nahmad: But I would -- we sense that there will be more price increases in the near future.\nSteve Tusa: Right. So that would suggest that your U.S. resi volume was down a little bit in the quarter, right?\nPaul Johnston: No, it was up slightly.\nAlbert Nahmad: Did you mean unit -- it was not down, no. It was up slightly, yes.\nPaul Johnston: Most of our major resi suppliers, the price increases that they had in the third quarter was in September. So it didn't get impacted.\nSteve Tusa: Do you think you guys took market share in the quarter? Like is the industry -- I mean, if you guys took market share, that means the industry was down in the quarter, right?\nPaul Johnston: You really don't know for the quarter until all the data comes out. And like we said this on the last call, the shipment data versus movement data has been so out of sorts here for about the last 12 months. I think it's thrown all of our models off. Would I like to say, we gained market share? Well, August shipments, as you know, were down, what, 2.2%. July was down, what, 5.6%. So we weren't down. So we must have gained market share, but I don't think that's a hollow statement.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. And then so for these price increases that are coming through, should we expect price to accelerate here in the fourth quarter? I mean, can you get to kind of back to that kind of high single double-digit level for the fourth quarter?\nPaul Johnston: No idea. No. I really can't predict that. So we see -- essential demand is in the fourth quarter. We don't know what that's going to be.\nSteve Tusa: And then one last one just on inventories. They were flat quarter-to-quarter. Hard to tell what would be kind of volume and what would be some sort of inflation there. Usually, it's down a bit seasonally. Is there -- I'm trying to reconcile that with kind of the supply constraints that are out there because you guys look like you're pretty good on inventory. How do you feel your own inventory situation is?\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry gave you a clue on that in terms of having inventory, particularly in equipment, where we only have part of this system, not all of the systems. So we are carrying unusually high numbers of this item that doesn't -- we don't have the matching part yet of the unit. Barry, do you want to elaborate on that?\nBarry Logan: Yes, just do some math. The -- our version of inventory turns, which we can calculate usual monthly averages, it's hard for you all to do that. But the monthly average inventory turn as of September 30 was identical to the prior 12 months. So all the investment level, if you will, is the same. The mix of that investment is what we're talking about that needs to improve and so on. And Steve, there's not a great story there. There's some inflation, yes. There's some shortages, yes. There's a lot of product being moved around, as we mentioned in the press release in terms of our logistics to handle customer needs and all that balances out and should help the inventory position as we go into next year. Still dependent on normalcy, which means normal lead times are normal. Normal feeling in terms of order flow, and we're not there yet.\nSteve Tusa: Right. Right. Well, congrats on executing continually here in a challenging environment.\nOperator: The next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: I guess, maybe first question on some of the availability stuff. I know we've kind of broadened this path already. But even though it's not a critical market to Watsco, we are transitioning into furnace season, you guys do have some exposure there in a few regions. Does that availability look any different than the AC market? I mean, obviously, the lines aren't the same. The components aren't fungible. Like any improvement just by virtue of turning on furnaces this year?\nPaul Johnston: Yes. Furnaces are an important part of Watsco. Let's put it that way, especially with the acquisitions that we've made over the last several years with pure stuffs and TEC and N&S supply and ASCO, et cetera. Furnaces, right now, what we're seeing there is kind of an inversion a little bit to the air-conditioning. What we need more of the -- what we call a standard furnace right now. And there seems to be some shortage on standard furnaces where we're getting some of the high-end furnaces. Just got off a call with one of our groups on furnaces and a manufacturer, and we're trying to supplement that and make sure we get them in. They may be a little bit later than normal. Normally, we're able to do a preseason with the contractors to presell furnaces into the marketplace. And this year, it looks like that may be a little bit of a delay coming up with a preseason program.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: And then just on the refrigerated transition, I guess, the phaseout on R-22. I think some of the other OEMs have described is this sort of de facto $1,000 off the system because it's cost avoidance on having to recharge a system that had work done or had a leak. I guess maybe a couple of questions off that. What is sort of the pricing on R-22 today? And how does that work in the homeowners demand? And I feel like if we would have this conversation, I don't know, 7, 8 years ago, recycling of refrigerant was something that was a little bit more of a topical moment in time, like isn't that helping at all? So just maybe speak to like how much of these upgrades or replacement is driven by the refrigerant piece and maybe some of the numbers behind that, if you wouldn't mind?\nPaul Johnston: Well, the number of R-22 units is decreasing, obviously, every year. And my best estimate is it's probably 20%, 25% of what it was when we did the transition. So there's fewer units out there that we have to service. But the other side of R-22 is that there were drop-in replacements from both DuPont as well as from Arkema or Chemours and Arkoma that we're able to work around any sort of higher prices or shortages in R-22. We continue to see 22 sales as just a raw gas on the residential side of these continue to move down.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Okay. So the actual like homeowner economics haven't changed that much because of these drop-ins?\nPaul Johnston: No, it really hasn't. And if you think back to how many years it's been since we went with 410 across the board, a lot of those units have become replacement vehicles. And as we move forward into -- obviously, into the phase down of the refrigerants that we currently are using, the 410s and such, I think there'll be a slight acceleration on the remaining balance of those 22 units coming forward to be replaced, and that's just a guess.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Of course, all my questions have been answered at this point. So -- remaining. Just like to clarify the point on pricing. You mentioned you got 69 days notice from the OEM on price increases. Does that allow you a chance to maybe get ahead of that and therefore, there's a mismatch between price utilized from your customers versus what you pay out?\nAlbert Nahmad: It's interesting.\nPaul Johnston: It's 60 to 90 days. It's not 69 days.\nAlbert Nahmad: Answer the question, though, Paul.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. And yes, of course, we can move ahead of that.\nNigel Coe: Okay, okay. It's -- I just want to clear that up. And then on the air-conditioning and refrigeration, I mean, focus on your sales that spend much time here, but it was up 27%. So I'd be curious what drove that extraordinary strength?\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul. Here's Paul.\nPaul Johnston: Okay. Generally, what drove that is a lot of it has to do with restaurants supply, ice machines, reach-in coolers, that type of thing was really driving that progress. Rebound in opened\nNigel Coe: Okay. That makes total sense. And then just a quick one, if I may, on the other HVAC products outgrew HVAC equipment. Was that because of the availability issues, was there a slight shift towards repair versus replace in the quarter because you just couldn't get product out?\nAlbert Nahmad: Has anybody study that mix?\nPaul Johnston: No, I have not.\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: I can take a quick look. I mean, first, it is about -- and I said this for a long time, too, there's over 100 product lines and 600 vendors in that bucket. Anything from duck tape to sunglasses to refrigerant to copper tubing and so on. So -- and replacement parts is a component of that. Replacement parts does not account for the increase because it's a single-digit increase in parts during the quarter. So it's everything else and it across, again, 100 different product lines. So a measure of inflation going on, as Paul suggested, in some of the, what I'll call the building materials in there, which would be flex duck, copper tubing and other products. It's also been a mission of our business units to grow that part of our business. It is much higher margin. That's part of the consequence of the higher margin across Watsco as well in the quarter. So there's not one story there, Nigel, and the story is not repair versus replace.\nNigel Coe: Okay. I didn't know you sold sunglasses. So that's something -- I've done today.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks. .\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, thanks again for your interest in our company. We hope that you'll join us for more of these calls and follow us as we progress scaling the company. Thanks again.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Albert Nahmad",
            "content": "Well, good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. First, I hope everyone is safe and healthy given the virus is going on. But this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. And with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; our two Executive Vice President, Paul Johnston and Barry Logan; and Rick Gomez, Vice President. Before we start our normal cautionary statement, this conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Now I am pleased to share that Watsco delivered another record quarter. New records were achieved in virtually every performance metric. Earnings per share jumped 31% to a record $3.62 per share and a 32% increase in net income. Sales grew 16% or nearly $250 million during the quarter, to a record $1.78 billion. Gross profit increased 29% with gross margins expanding 280 basis points. Operating income increased $50 million, or 32%, to a record $207 million. Operating margins expanded 100 basis points to a record 11.6%. And cash flow for the quarter was a record $238 million. Today's results are all the more positive when considered against last year's record results and in light of the industry-wide supply challenges that are still going on. Our teams throughout all of Watsco are doing an extraordinary job taking care of customers, and that has made a big difference. I want to say thanks to all of you. We also ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet with virtually no debt and cash of $137 million. This financial strength provides us the flexibility to invest in most any size opportunity. Our press release summarizes important fundamentals that are critical to understand as we continue to invest and build further scale in what is a very fragmented $50 billion North American market. An important fundamental is Watsco's geographic coverage and our large number of low cases across many markets. The diversity of markets we serve reduces volatility and provide stability during a difficult operating environment, such as the one we are witnessing. Also, our large and growing customer base is increasingly equipped with our state-of-the-art technology that helps our customers grow their business and purchase more from us. Another advantage now and in the future is our offerings of the broadest variety of products and brands in the industry. The depth and diversity of our product offerings should continue to serve us well. We're optimistic about current market conditions. Let me say that again, optimistic about current market conditions and recent trends. End market demand remains strong, and we see signs of improvement in our OEM's ability to help us fulfill that demand. Looking ahead, the industry will experience more change in the years to come as minimum SEER standards rise, that normally will be done by the federal government, by the way, and refrigerant changes that take shape in the coming years. And with changes come opportunities, we believe that our long-term focus, our scale, speed to market, relationship with OEMs, technology offerings position us better than anyone to capitalize on these upcoming changes. We are living in unusual times, but could not be more positive and excited about the future of the industry and our role in it. Now let's go on to our Q&A. I like that question because all of us in the industry are finding just to get enough product to continue to meet the demand. But 2022, but best one for that, I think, is Paul Johnston. Well, I think your thought process is a good one, but let's see if Paul can fill in to hole there. But it doesn't seem to be slowing demand. Our demand is strong. Well, that's a very enlightened question because there is a chip shortage. So we see high efficiency demand there, but we're unable to fulfill it given the supply of that product. Paul, do you want to fill in? I would agree with that. Absolutely. Which is mandated by the federal government. Well, that's a very perceptive question. Looking into the future. Who wants to take that? Barry or Paul. Well, I got to say, Barry will answer that, but this is a $6 billion a year business. And what you're talking about is small relative to the overall in revenue. I can't imagine that's driving the overall numbers that you perceive. But Barry, go ahead. Yes, let me deal with that. I agree that that's not controlled the way you stated. But let's have A.J. respond to that. In other words, we are dedicated to the long-term, and A.J. said it, but we don't see any reason not to continue to invest regardless of what's going on in fluctuations from season to season. Well, right now, the reality is that prebuy doesn't help anything. We can't get what we want now, and we don't seem to be -- we don't see an end of that yet. So we don't even face those prebuy decisions. What we need now is enough product to meet the demand that we seem to be having at record levels into the -- going into the fourth quarter. It will be adjust and prebuys, of course, we would. We have a lot of data that -- and a lot of software that tells us how to manage our investment in inventory. Right now, it's a scramble. Yes. They all have to be -- or above. Above the minimum. That's a good question. Do we have that data available? Yes, we can give me that. Sure. Who's got that number? Barry or Rick, anybody? Rick, I was trying to get you in, but Barry cut you off. Let me say that it's not gotten better just yet. And when I say that, I'm talking about all of them. We're hoping it will get better in the fourth quarter. But as I said earlier, the demand is so high now that it's not easy for them to catch up. And it's all of them, and it's not one that's better than the other. I mean, there -- as you know, we're probably the biggest customer for all of them that represent our brands. Now, I would still say it's still catch up. I don't see any solutions to supply chain yet that we're optimistic. Yes. Did we take a shot at that, Paul? I don't remember? Let's not speculate. I'd rather not speculate. The OEMs are running flat out, and they're doing the best they can. And I'm talking about all of them that we buy from and I think we have, besides the three major equipment OEMs, we have numerous other OEMs, and they're doing the best they can. Have they caught up, not even close. Will we see some improvement as the quarter proceeds? I think so. Well, that question answers itself. Sure, with private equity gets involved, there is more competition. Is it affecting how we think about our strategy? We won't. We will not chase pricing because we're in for the long term. I don't know how long they're going to be in terms of valuations for businesses. So -- but there are a large number of distributors. What's our latest count, Barry, more or less? No, no, no. Available -- independent distributors. How many 1,300. So there's room for lots of stuff for us. But I would -- we sense that there will be more price increases in the near future. Did you mean unit -- it was not down, no. It was up slightly, yes. Barry gave you a clue on that in terms of having inventory, particularly in equipment, where we only have part of this system, not all of the systems. So we are carrying unusually high numbers of this item that doesn't -- we don't have the matching part yet of the unit. Barry, do you want to elaborate on that? It's interesting. Answer the question, though, Paul. Paul. Here's Paul. Has anybody study that mix? Barry? Well, thanks again for your interest in our company. We hope that you'll join us for more of these calls and follow us as we progress scaling the company. Thanks again."

            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "Yes, just to add a thought to that. Just so it's clear on the data, what the data says, the high-efficiency mix increased again this quarter. It's almost 11 straight years of quarters where it increased. But that ultra-high efficiency is where the missing link is and did not contribute, but overall, high efficiency grew at a faster rate than base efficiency. Alright. Here we go. So let's get to SG&A first because that's easier to think about. Obviously, everything we've said -- and I just want to say this also, so it's on the table for the rest of the call. Sales volume in the second quarter was up 29% on a same-store basis, I think, something like that. So this has been an extraordinary summer if you look at things as a combined last 6 months. Let's not just talk in quarters, let's look at our seasonal realities of what we dealt with. Extraordinary demand, SG&A that needed to deal with, a lot of stuff going on in terms of supply chain to make it work. A lot of austerity that came off last year's comparison that is now in this year's numbers. And just, again, as I said, drinking through a firehose over the last 6 months. So SG&A, we wanted to highlight some things very specific to SG&A that are big buckets. And the word normalized usually means it goes down or declines. Let's put it this way, there's a lot of variable costs that increased those costs remain variable and will adjust themselves to whatever the sales volume is over the next 12 months. As Al suggested in the remarks, we're not necessarily seeing a slack in demand as we get out of season right now. In fact, we're seeing increased demand as we're going out of season from, let's say, recent days. And so SG&A will normalize. But again, time will tell and the variable cost should adjust over time. Gross profit is a more interesting question. Obviously, I've said this for a career, and we've said this in our comments over many years, inflation is something that we pass through and pass on. It adds to a gross profit equation and makes more money for us. There's no question of that. We're also doing immense work with technology to improve pricing and margin. And to optimize pricing, that doesn't necessarily mean just getting higher margins. That means improving our pricing profile across customers, competitors, products and so on. There's a benefit this year in that equation, which is only just the beginning of a pricing discussion. And I think mix also obviously has a benefit. And you heard Paul's comments earlier about mix maybe looking forward. But that's a big crystal ball to look into, to be honest. And for some of the undercurrent of inflation and mix and technology and incentives and the way we pay salespeople and commission our sales force, all those things are pulling in that direction. So in next year, I'll tell you more when we know more, but that's what I would tell you today. Yes, Jeff, I mean again, as related to what we've acquired lately. And yes, the margin and yes, the cost of doing businesses is higher. That's unique and eccentric to TEC, and it's part of their legacy and profile of how they go to market. So they've had an exceptional last 6 months as part of Watsco. They've had an exceptional year coming into this year. And very proud and happy that they're part of Watsco. Yes, it is, Joe -- yes, it is, Dave. Yes. The answer is, of course. I mean, this is 673 location managers managing P&Ls. It's 30, 35 super power presidents running markets. It's a data platform suggesting, and telling, and reminding, and monitoring margins and cost and profitability every single minute of the day. It's incentive systems that geared toward EBIT growth and cash flow production. So, yes. I mean, culturally, the intent and the obvious culture is profitability growth responsible ways is what the mission is. So it may be different in Texas than in Massachusetts next year. It may be different in California than it is in Chicago. So this decentralization and data flow that goes on in markets is how we operate. And when I say, of course, it's because all those dynamics get measured and carried out in different ways in different markets. So clearly, all these moving pieces that are going on are different everywhere. And so culturally, every Friday morning, we spend a few hours together, go through it all together and act and react accordingly. So the answer is, of course, there'll be actions and reactions going on as things change. 15%, 16% was the growth in e-commerce for the quarter. In terms of acquisition, 65. 1,300. Very consistent, Steve, with the overall 6%. Yes, just do some math. The -- our version of inventory turns, which we can calculate usual monthly averages, it's hard for you all to do that. But the monthly average inventory turn as of September 30 was identical to the prior 12 months. So all the investment level, if you will, is the same. The mix of that investment is what we're talking about that needs to improve and so on. And Steve, there's not a great story there. There's some inflation, yes. There's some shortages, yes. There's a lot of product being moved around, as we mentioned in the press release in terms of our logistics to handle customer needs and all that balances out and should help the inventory position as we go into next year. Still dependent on normalcy, which means normal lead times are normal. Normal feeling in terms of order flow, and we're not there yet. I can take a quick look. I mean, first, it is about -- and I said this for a long time, too, there's over 100 product lines and 600 vendors in that bucket. Anything from duck tape to sunglasses to refrigerant to copper tubing and so on. So -- and replacement parts is a component of that. Replacement parts does not account for the increase because it's a single-digit increase in parts during the quarter. So it's everything else and it across, again, 100 different product lines. So a measure of inflation going on, as Paul suggested, in some of the, what I'll call the building materials in there, which would be flex duck, copper tubing and other products. It's also been a mission of our business units to grow that part of our business. It is much higher margin. That's part of the consequence of the higher margin across Watsco as well in the quarter. So there's not one story there, Nigel, and the story is not repair versus replace."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Yes. First of all, I'd like to say that we're not increasing our conversation with the OEMs. We're under -- we have been continually communicating with our OEMs and them with us. So the relationship there, all barring the pandemic and even before the pandemic, we are working with them on product planning and delivery planning and all that. Right now, what we're looking at in 2022 is we're trying to straighten the inventories out a bit. What we ended up with was some of our inventories ended up to be a little bit lopsided on indoor versus outdoor-type units. So we're working with them trying to balance that out so we can sell complete systems. We've been working with them on what the transition plans obviously, are going to be given that next year is a big year when we're going to be transitioning to 2023 to the -- or 2022 and 2023 to the new SEER levels. So it's been a -- it's a full agenda that we have with our OEM partners as far as communicating and planning with most of them, as you recognize, we're one of the largest customers, if not their largest customer. And so we're important to each other. Yes. It's -- we always talk about the equipment. Yes, those are the most recognized price increases that we have. And the dealer contractors have been accepting of them, especially those who are in the replacement business. Perhaps, a little more resistance from people who are on the new construction side. But we've also -- they are also experiencing upticks in commodity pricing, with copper going up above $4.70 here recently a pound. We're seeing flex stock go up double digit pretty much every 3 to 6 months. So a lot of the other products that go into actually installing a units are going up at the same time. So I think we're all a little bit numb to it, including our contractors and accepting it, and trying to pass it on as best we can, given the timing of how many price increases we've had here in the last call it, 18 months. Yes. Yes, that's very true. It's -- it takes more hours for an OEM to make a high efficiency to make an 18 or 20 SEER product. And so the focus has been pretty much on the 16 SEER, 15 SEER, 14 SEER, 13 SEER product. So a little bit of a shift there where we're seeing a bump in 16 SEER sales and obviously, 14, 13 SEER sales and a small decline in 18, 20 SEER. Having said that, the 18, 20 SEER has never been a major portion of the market. And obviously, it's something we would like to have as a major portion of the market. And hopefully, with the new energy standards, we'll be able to expand the very high efficiency products as a greater percentage of our sales. But we're definitely going to see a better mix change because the efficiency going up to 14 SEER in the north and 15 in the south. So Yes. So we're going to see that regardless. Our focus is we really want to make sure that, that ultra-high efficiency that Barry refers to grows at a faster rate and becomes a more material piece of the market. Barry, that sounds like your question. I'll take a first stab, but Barry, do you want to take the second half? But is there a difference between equipment and nonequipment? Yes. Anything that's commodity-based has an external profile where the pricing fluctuates on a daily, weekly basis. And as I mentioned earlier, things like copper, refrigerant, steel have definitely been on the incline and have gone up faster than for the last 18 months have gone up faster than equipment. Equipment has a more slower cadence to it because there has to be an announced period of time before we have a recognized price increase. So normally, we get anywhere from 60- to 90-day lead time on the announcement before it's implemented. So it gives us an opportunity to adjust ourselves. So timing is not unique to the third quarter or to 2021 so far. No. No, I don't think that would be the case. We just want what we have on order. We want to bring it in exactly -- Al spot on. I don't see a prebuy. We don't see a prebuy coming at us. We want to make sure we get the inventory that we need to meet current demand and as well as early part demand. I don't think anybody is looking at carrying a huge amount of inventory into 2022 because there's going to be different government regulations, which are going to have different requirements for where and how you can sell it. So I don't think it's going to be an issue this year. Minimum. I'm saying -- so you got 80% or 90%, I would think, at, right? I guess the question is, what's the percent above. Yes. It's quite a bit higher than you think. It's higher than 50% is actually above the minimum. You've got a lot of other rules that apply to it, such as EPA, new home construction in order to get your sticker from the EPA, you have to have a higher efficiency product. And there's an awful lot of the 14 SEER product that actually goes to 15. It's pure speculation. If you listen to the salesman, it's a lot higher than it is when you listen to the data. It's a way. I'm not -- season, things change very much in terms of price in the course of the season. There are some late quarter price increases that flow in, I think, September that will flow into the fourth quarter. But in-season, Steve, there's not much variation. And with the kind of volatility that went on, I'm not going to surmise much over the last 90 days, just given what was going on. No, it was up slightly. Most of our major resi suppliers, the price increases that they had in the third quarter was in September. So it didn't get impacted. You really don't know for the quarter until all the data comes out. And like we said this on the last call, the shipment data versus movement data has been so out of sorts here for about the last 12 months. I think it's thrown all of our models off. Would I like to say, we gained market share? Well, August shipments, as you know, were down, what, 2.2%. July was down, what, 5.6%. So we weren't down. So we must have gained market share, but I don't think that's a hollow statement. No idea. No. I really can't predict that. So we see -- essential demand is in the fourth quarter. We don't know what that's going to be. Yes. Furnaces are an important part of Watsco. Let's put it that way, especially with the acquisitions that we've made over the last several years with pure stuffs and TEC and N&S supply and ASCO, et cetera. Furnaces, right now, what we're seeing there is kind of an inversion a little bit to the air-conditioning. What we need more of the -- what we call a standard furnace right now. And there seems to be some shortage on standard furnaces where we're getting some of the high-end furnaces. Just got off a call with one of our groups on furnaces and a manufacturer, and we're trying to supplement that and make sure we get them in. They may be a little bit later than normal. Normally, we're able to do a preseason with the contractors to presell furnaces into the marketplace. And this year, it looks like that may be a little bit of a delay coming up with a preseason program. Well, the number of R-22 units is decreasing, obviously, every year. And my best estimate is it's probably 20%, 25% of what it was when we did the transition. So there's fewer units out there that we have to service. But the other side of R-22 is that there were drop-in replacements from both DuPont as well as from Arkema or Chemours and Arkoma that we're able to work around any sort of higher prices or shortages in R-22. We continue to see 22 sales as just a raw gas on the residential side of these continue to move down. No, it really hasn't. And if you think back to how many years it's been since we went with 410 across the board, a lot of those units have become replacement vehicles. And as we move forward into -- obviously, into the phase down of the refrigerants that we currently are using, the 410s and such, I think there'll be a slight acceleration on the remaining balance of those 22 units coming forward to be replaced, and that's just a guess. It's 60 to 90 days. It's not 69 days. Yes. And yes, of course, we can move ahead of that. Okay. Generally, what drove that is a lot of it has to do with restaurants supply, ice machines, reach-in coolers, that type of thing was really driving that progress. Rebound in opened No, I have not."

And that's because we are maturing things that are already in flight, and we're taking on new projects and programs, all with the intent of continually improving and modernizing everything we do, all focused around helping our customers do business loss and helping them grow their businesses. So as we see more and more opportunity, we're going to continue to invest. Yes, exactly. Now you know that these are all long-term things that we're a long-term company. So I wouldn't -- we don't need to highlight things that are just in early stage development. I will tell you some of the earlier things that are getting a little bit more mature, which we -- I don't know if we include in this quarter's release, but our OnCall Air, which is our tool to help the contractors sell to their customers and CreditForComfort, which is a companion tool to help them sell the financing, they're both continuing to grow and very exciting. And customers that are using those tools and really our technology in general continue to be better customers for us, meaning they're stickier, their attrition rates are much lower and their growth rates with us are much higher.

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Nahmad. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, everyone. I hope that everyone is having a safe and good day. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call and what an incredible quarter it was for Watsco. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO; and with me is A.J. Nahmad, who is our President; and our two Executive Vice Presidents, Paul Johnston and Barry Logan. Now, as we normally do, before we start, I need to read our cautionary statement. The conference call has forward-looking statements, as defined by SEC laws and regulations, that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws. The ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Now on to our report, I am pleased to share that Watsco has delivered an incredible second quarter, achieving new records in virtually every performance metric. Earnings per share jumped 64% to a record $3.71 per share on a 66% increase in net income. This was, by far, our most successful quarter ever.  Sales grew 36% or nearly $500 million to a record $1.850 billion in sales for the quarter. Gross profits increased 50% with gross margin expanding 220 basis points. Operating income increased $88 million or 68% to $217 million, and operating margins, this is a big one, operating margins expanded 220 basis points to a record 11.7%. Now, these results are all the more positive when considered against last year's second quarter which had only a modest impact from the COVID-related slowdowns Now, we have two new companies in our family; TEC and Acme. They perform very well, and we cannot be happier that they are now part of an -- an important part of Watsco. They have a rich and successful history, and we will help them any way we can. Looking ahead, we are engaged in a very fragmented $50 billion North American market. Again, this is a $50 billion North American market. And we hope to find more great companies to join us. The greater scale in this industry provides more capital for us to fund our growth priorities. Also, Watsco\u2019s industry-leading technologies continue to gain traction, and we believe they are helping us gain market share. Here are a few important highlights to mention. First, growth rates among active users of our technologies continues to outpace the growth rates of nonusers. Customers using our technology are simply growing faster. Next, attrition among customers using our technology is meaningfully lower compared to nonusers. The technology enables us to create stickier customer relationships. Also, more customers are using our digital selling platform that are called OnCall Air and CreditForComfort. They help in modernize our HV solutions that are presented to homeowners. As evidence of the success of OnCall Air and CreditForComfort, the number of digital sales presentations made by our contractor customers to end consumers increased by 84% and helped close over $200 million of sales during the quarter. These tools have also benefited the sale of higher efficiency systems, which we think is an important contributor to the climate change discussion. As owner systems are replaced, our technology can play an important role in helping consumers choose more energy efficient solutions. Our progress is very encouraging. But we believe it is still early in terms of reaching the full potential of our technology investments. Our focus remains in the long term. I think you've heard me say that over and over again. We are long-term players in the industry. Please feel free to schedule a Zoom call with us and we can further explain our technology and its impact. Finally, but very important our balance sheet remains in pristine condition with only a small amount of debt. We have plenty of capacity and even more ambitions to grow our company both organically and through acquisitions. With that, A.J., Paul Barry and I are happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nJeff Hammond: Hey, morning, Al. Morning, guys. So, I just want to hit on the gross margins, They\u2019ve been kind of exceptional here the last couple of quarters. And I just want to understand what's driving it and how you feel about the sustainability. It just seems like kind of in the last five to seven years, you've been in that 24% to 24.5% and now we're up close to 26%. \nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: Good morning, Jeff. Again, gross margin always is a primary component of what we pay for products and what do we sell products for. And it's all very decent -- decentralized and regional and local and customer specific. And so if there isn't one answer to your question, there's about 16,000 answers to your question as to how it plays out in the marketplace each year.  Clearly, high efficiency systems are being sold at a greater rate. Clearly, price increases as they flow through benefit some of the gross margin, you know, flow through if you will. Also culturally, we've done a lot with pricing systems and pricing technology and pricing data, pricing software to optimize price. That doesn't mean we necessarily raise price, it means optimize price at markets. And also working closely with all of our OEMs. We have about 600 total manufacturers. They're facing, you know, inflation. They have to decide on their own pricing mechanism into the markets and as we work through that with them, you know, some of those benefits occur.  What does the future, you know, your next question was, what does the future hold. Well, Paul, maybe you want to comment on it. But there\u2019s still continued pricing actions going on in the market. And we would expect to continue to work with OEMs and customers and flow that dynamic through our business. \nPaul Johnston: I can agree with you more Barry. I think in the future we've got the right amount of discipline. We've been able to hire people who are in positions now where they\u2019re actually managing and looking at pricing on a daily, moment by moment basis. And I think working with our vendors and with our OEMs, I think we can continue -- continuing improving gross profit maybe in a more moderate rate than we've done in the past 18 months. But still we can improve.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. And then just on price, our channel checks were picking up kind of high single-digit price increases with kind of the multiple increases coming through. Can you just talk about how much you're seeing on price or price mix and if there's much variation between pricing traction and equipment versus non-equipment. Thanks. \nAlbert Nahmad: Paul. \nPaul Johnston: Yeah. The equipment manufacturers each one of them with the exception of one right now I think have announced that they've got their third price increase of the year going. And each one of them have announced a recent price increase, September, August time frame of anywhere from 4% to 8%. And they\u2019re real price increases. They genuinely need the price increases. We all do because there has been an increase in the [indiscernible] costs. So, on the OEM side, yeah, we've seen price increases three times this year. When you get to the non-equipment piece of it, the parts and the supply side. And it's been a pretty continuous stream of price increases that we've been administering, well in excess of roughly 200 price increases, most of them multiple, obviously. So, you know, the industry definitely has seen an upward turn in pricing. \nAaron Nahmad: This is A.J. I'll just add to that. As it relates to our total gross profit margins, we are focused on selling and aspire to sell more parts and supplies, which inherently have higher gross profit margin. So, that also contributes.\nJeff Hammond: And are you guys able to quantify what price or price mix was in the quarter?\nAlbert Nahmad: No, we haven't. You know, it's a -- there\u2019s not a regular cadence to it. So, for us, it's, you know, making sure that we're getting the price increases into the customers\u2019 hands has been a priority one. They have been coming at us so fast, you know? And, as far as the measurement, yes, we'll do a reconciliation and find out exactly what that is at some point at, you know, once the year progresses. \nJeff Hammond: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Two for me, first, just on the multiple price increases. It is interesting, you know, Barry mentioned more high efficiency systems. It doesn't feel like you're bumping any -- up against any elasticity here on pricing. You know, I understand that the consumer generally doesn't know what the stuff cost until a unit breaks and, you know, they find out. But any sign at all that, you know, there's a tilt towards mixing back down a little bit?\nAlbert Nahmad: What was the question? Any sign of what?\nJeff Sprague: Well, I'm just wondering if you see any mix erosion in response to the escalating in price. It doesn\u2019t like you did...\nAlbert Nahmad: No.\nJeff Sprague: ...in the quarter, but I just wonder if around the edges we are starting to see any signs of, like, demand disruption.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, let me say that we also are aware of the end consumer, and we are now presenting more and more renewals of our financing program so that whatever the cost increase is, is less of a burden for homeowners because of the terms of the --that we provide through one of our platforms for financing and particularly equipment. And somebody else want to say something. Go ahead.\nAaron Nahmad: Yeah. I don't think there's been much pushback from the consumer at all. You hit it right on the head. The consumer doesn't know what the -- what a price is. It's not a frequent purchase for the consumer. And so, to-date, we have not seen a lot of pushback. A lot of it has just been based on availability, being able to satisfy the customers\u2019 need for home comfort, indoor air quality and humidity control.\nAlbert Nahmad: So, just -- what I would add to that is two things. First, what we sell is a component of the consumer's cost. It isn't the consumer's cost. So how a contractor prices and ultimately completes a job and sells the job, and as Al mentioned how we can help them finance the job, it's a relatively layered type of transaction. And we haven't seen any deterioration. In fact, growth rates or high efficiency are well beyond the overall equipment growth rate that you see in the press release at 29%. Second thing I'd say is part of the technology that we have is the presentation software to push and recommend and really help contractors. They will be on paper when they present these different options to homeowners. And so, in the press release, you read about OnCall Air, you know, doubling in size in the quarter. That's that piece of software and high efficiency is ruling the day in that environment.\nJeff Sprague: Okay. That\u2019s interesting.\nAlbert Nahmad: And I want to get back to financing. Interest rates everybody knows are low. And so, we're helping our distributors which are our customers with financing. And then, we're helping their customers the homeowners with financing. And we're taking advantage of lower interest rates to help the end consumer and help the distributor.\nJeff Sprague: And you're doing that to third-party or you\u2019re bringing list on your balance sheet more or less on your balance sheet?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, we do sometimes with extended terms of our own. But it's a combination of that and using third party when it goes out several years.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. And my second question and I appreciate all the detail on the first one. Just on the issue of availability. Just looking at your inventories, you\u2019re a little lower than I might have guessed given the pace of demand. Would you characterize things as still mean in the channel? Or are we kind of getting caught up here within demand?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, first, let me say that the OEMs we deal with have really worked hard to meet demand. They're doing the best they can. Their suppliers on the other hand are sometimes letting them down or sometimes they're overwhelmed. But we do believe that they're getting better at it. We believe we could have sold more in the second quarter had we had more particularly equipment. But it's matter of time, demand will catch up with equipment -- I mean with supply. And in the meantime, we\u2019re doing the best we can as the number show. But everybody\u2019s got some -- every OEM has one particular, two particular items or a number of particular items that they're short on because they don't control the manufacturing of it.\nAaron Nahmad: I'll just add that I have to say that our teams in the field have been working tirelessly to meet their customer\u2019s demands and expectations. They've moved a lot of product around and household. And we're grateful and appreciate their hard work too.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nNigel Coe: Good Morning, Al. Good morning everyone. It's been a long time since I've been on Watsco. It's good to get a question. It's a great quarter, obviously very strong. I just want to pick up on Jeff\u2019s question on sort of the supply chain and port availability. Obviously, it sounds pretty prevalent. All OEMs have got some form of product shortages. I'm just wondering how you all sort of tools are helping you mitigate these pressures. And I'm wondering if you've managed to gain some share as a result of that and maybe just talk about any share shifts you're seeing because of your ability to manage that better than perhaps from your competitors. \nAlbert Nahmad: Who wants that question?\nAaron Nahmad: I'll take a stab at it. We manage -- we've got one of the best technology platforms available to manage our inventory. And we have constant update meetings with each one of our OEMs as well as some of our key suppliers who don't make finished goods inventory. And what we're working with them on is making sure that we have our complete visibility to what our needs are, what our forecasts are, and what our order reliability from them has been. And I think what it's what it's done is it's brought us a lot closer, communication wise, with the OEMs and made us, I wouldn't say a favorite nation, but it would certainly make us easier to do business with than most of the channel.  So, I think it has helped us. Have we lost market share? I think we've gained market share because of our inventory management systems.\nNigel Coe: Great. Okay. That's a lot to turn and drive up the share gain. And then just on the regional variations, I mean we have -- there\u2019s extreme heat on the West Coast, Pacific Northwest in June. Just wondering if we saw, you know, outsized growth in those areas relative to the 9%. \nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: Hi, Nigel, Barry here. Good morning. Well, the West Coast for us if you look at the branch count in our filings is actually a relatively small marketplace for us where we're not in the Pacific Northwest at all at zero. And as Western markets again from a contribution point of view, did well in the quarter but it didn't contribute to the overall results materially. So, we do want to be actually much bigger out there. In relative terms, it's not very material.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tommy Moll from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: You\u2019ve talked about gross margins and price costs a little bit. If we step back, as you think about on a multiyear basis potentially or even just through and in let's say through an inflationary cycle. In your mind, is that is that a net benefit, net neutral, net headwind for you as a distributor? Just smooth it all out.\nBarry Logan: Well, we don\u2019t like to be in an inflationary environment like any other business. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that's good for the consumer or anyone else in the distribution chain. But sometimes, things happen, and we do the best we can. And I keep referring to the way we can assist the distributor and his customer is by providing especially opportunistic financing given the lower rates to offset some of that. But generally speaking, wherever the inflation is, we'll adjust to it one way or the other. And I think we're gaining share by the things that we do. Anybody else want to add something to it, Barry or Paul or A.J.?\nBarry Logan: Yeah. I think the only thing I would add is we do operate a business with 655 locations and...\nAlbert Nahmad: It's different areas. Yeah.\nBarry Logan: ...5,000, 6,000 people. And to the extent there are -- as an element of fixed cost, we do benefit in terms of profitability and inflationary environment if those fixed costs are not growing or inflationary as well. So, there's always some pressure on cost in this environment. And if -- not always proportionate to the overall inflationary rate, and it's an opportunity to have some profitability growth. But, again, I wouldn't say it's a huge material amount. It's just an opportunity for us.\nTommy Moll: Great. That's helpful. If I could follow up on technology, it's good to see a continued momentum for adoption on a lot of the key platforms, as you highlighted in the release and in your remarks. And, as you think about the path forward, is now a time when you lean in even more and increase that investment given -- in addition to the momentum with adoption -- just the macro environment? \nBarry Logan: That's the favorite question of the President the company.\nAaron Nahmad: Yeah. I was going to say, I'm not sure -- we are -- we don't consider ourselves constrained in technology investments. This is a technology company that just happens to sell heating and air conditioning. And, you know, when we say technology, that's really a big broad umbrella term that we're using to define our culture, really, which is a continuous improvement, a continuous learning and continuous ways to find, find ways to help our customers grow their businesses which is, at the end of the day, that's our mission.  Our customers are small- and medium-sized entrepreneurial-led businesses, and we can bring tools and technology to them to help them grow. We could make ourselves better to help them grow. So, that is our ethos, you know? So, we call that technology for short, but that's really what we're in the business of doing and we'll continue to invest, yes.\nTommy Moll: Thank you. I'll turn it back.\nOperator: And the next question comes from David Manthey from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Manthey: Hey. Good morning, Al. My question is back to gross margin, if I look at the 10-year averages, the first quarter was close to 100 basis points above that. And, this quarter, it was about 200 basis points. And I understand the mix and some pricing dynamics and kind of those rebates or whatever in there. Could you talk about it -- do you see some portion of that gross margin overage as being transitory versus structurally sound going forward? \nAlbert Nahmad: You mean, in terms of the gross profit margin increases or a flattening or declining and that sort of thing? \nDavid Manthey: Well, the -- yeah, the gross margin percentage. If\u2026\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah.\nDavid Manthey: \u2026you've been sort of moving\u2026\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah. I know what you mean.\nDavid Manthey: \u2026along in a range and you popped 200 basis points above that range this quarter. I\u2019m just can you just step back and see.\nAlbert Nahmad: I think I understand.\nDavid Manthey: Yeah.\nAlbert Nahmad: But we\u2019re very focused on our gross margin percent. And we mentioned some technology we bought in with pricing effects. And we\u2019ve mentioned other ways that we're trying to achieve that. That's not going to stop. I don't know whether -- where the end will be. But that's what we're going to continue to seek to improve in a number of ways. So, that's an ongoing goal of ours and we've had successes with it as you say in the first half of this year. And we're going to continue to focus on that in the second half.  And don't forget, we're trying to change the supplies business in terms of the margins of the parts and supplies that they are generally higher than equipment. So, we're emphasizing to our branches sales of those goods. And so, that's something that could continue to increase the mix of our products more parts and supplies in the mix of the overall sales picture. Somebody want to add something to that?\nDavid Manthey: Yeah. As well as high efficiency equipment too, which is again\u2026\nAlbert Nahmad: So, we're not having [indiscernible] because high efficiency equipment we believe contributes to the climate change issue that's on there. You have to start with a premise that in homeowners or the electrical bill half of it is due to heating and cooling. Half of homeowners\u2019 electrical bills due to heating and cooling uses. And if you have a higher efficiency cooling and heating system you\u2019re going to use less electricity which in turn you\u2019re going to less power production and which in turn minimizes the release of CO2 gases. So, it\u2019s very well connected and we have a very clear eye about what we can do which is encourage the adoption and make it easier and help with financing it high efficiency equipment because not only does it help us as a corporation. But it also helps the climate change issue which we're trying to figure out in many different ways how to help that particular issue.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. And on the parts and supplies, I'm thinking more from a growth perspective. The last couple of calls you've sort of hinted at some initiatives you may be working on there. Are you willing to share anything at this time regarding how you're able to accelerate the growth in parts and supplies from here forward? \nAlbert Nahmad: You mean you want us to tell the competition how we\u2019re doing this?\nDavid Manthey: I\u2019m sure they have an idea.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, maybe it is better to give you a data how productive have we been in the effort. I think we can share growth rates and parts and supplies, Barry, Paul\nAaron Nahmad: Yeah. David, it shouldn\u2019t be lost -- yeah, it shouldn't be lost on anyone that you're looking at a quarter for example or even let's look at the half for maybe even better. Growth rate of residential products is up 24% in the half, first half of the year. Parts and supplies is up 19% and accelerated in the second quarter to closer to 25% parts and supplies.  Historically, there\u2019s some inversion in those two numbers, because as equipment grows, parts and supplies, generally, we\u2019ll grow at the same rate because people are replacing systems. So, this is a change the last six months. And it is a sales force, it is a culture, it is incentive system, it is many things, simply to bring energy and data and technology and e-commerce systems, and it's, again, it's 15 things. It's not one or two things.\nAlbert Nahmad: E-commerce is a major contributor because it's so efficient. Go ahead. I'm sorry for the interruption.\nBarry Logan: That's fine. So, clearly, there's change. And the benefits are there for [indiscernible]. And it started -- this all started last year in terms of our raw energy flowing into this, and it's something over time that should benefit gross margin because gross margin is, in fact, considerably higher in that part of the business.\nDavid Manthey: Great. All right.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah. And what\u2019s our e-commerce platform sales for the first half, Barry?\nBarry Logan: Our run rate is about $1.8 billion for the last 12 months. So, it\u2019d be close to $1 billion, I think, for a six-month period.\nAlbert Nahmad: That's about a third of our business now...\nBarry Logan: Yeah.\nAlbert Nahmad: ...of our revenues.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Yeah. Thank you for the details. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSteve Volkmann: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple of long-term questions because I heard that's how you manage the company. Serious, how big do you think -- you've mentioned financing several times. How big do you think financing could ultimately be for you, I don't know, as a percentage of stuff you'd sell or however you like them\u2026\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, that's a very good question because we haven't got an answer to that yet. For example, should we be in the financing business? Should we partner with somebody in the financing business? You know, these are big issues that we haven't resolved yet. But I don't see any reason why not to one way or the other figure out how to how to extend and increase the support we provide our distributors and their customers, the homeowners, financial assistance. I particularly like the interest rate feel that we can take advantage of something like that. And even when the rates go back up, there will always be ways to tweak that to help our customers.  So, we like -- we like the financing thing. We haven't figured it all out. If you've got a good company, we can buy that and accelerates it. We'd be happy to talk to them. It is a pillar of our growth, financing, But it\u2019s probably not going to run very fast in terms of development [ph] more of the same until we figure out the big picture by somebody or become part of somebody or you know, that sort of thing.\nSteve Volkmann: Okay. \nAlbert Nahmad: if you're looking for a headline number though, the products that we sell in our competitors stuff at wholesale level get resold at the retail level for $80 billion or $90 billion. And some portion of that is and will be finance.\nSteve Volkmann: It sounds like a big opportunity. Second unrelated question kind of more on the M&A front. And I'm just trying to think back, I know you guys have seen lots of different end market environments. Is this the type of environment where you see more of the independents that are willing to sell their businesses because it feels like everything is so good it can only kind of go one direction from her? Or is this the type of environment where these guys are doing so well that they don't want to sell and it's tougher to continue? \nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I think maybe you should go out and tell them, this is the time to do so. Look, we are engaged with distributors, and that's a part of our culture, always to be engaged with great companies. I don't think we have an answer to that. I think they may be concerned about the capital gains tax, for example, going up.  But, in the end, what they want to do, the family businesses especially, is connect with a company that's going to preserve their own names and culture, and that's what we specialize in, you know? These two companies that we recently bought, for example, at TEC, their culture is so strong. All we do -- we act at a support level, you know? We're not -- we're going to feed them whatever they want; capital or equity for their key executives, technology. That's our style and there'll be people that want to get engaged with that because of that reason.  In terms of their, you know, the atmosphere about the taxes going up and all of that, I -- do you see any trend in that, Barry, one way or the other? \nBarry Logan: Yeah. I mean, I would say, it all -- it always helps, quantitatively, the confidence of doing something when things are going well. It helps our confidence and it helps the sellers\u2019 mindset of optimizing valuation and not feeling like they're doing something, you know, ahead of time or what have you, and the taxes matter, too. But what really matters is none of that. What really matters is that it\u2019s an emotional process. These are families that have owned businesses for 70, 80 years, third and fourth generation, and I wish it was just that -- I wish it was just a financial process, but it's entirely, at times, an emotional process. So, that's the part where I feel like we've been successful as dealing with that emotion going forward for another generation or two, and it's why TEC and [indiscernible], a year before, after 90 years, 80 years of owning their business only talk to us and we completed it and it\u2019s moving forward. So, I think you\u2019re right. It helps the discussion to do well. It doesn\u2019t necessarily help the completion process because that still an emotional one for these guys.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah. It\u2019s really their family joining our family, right? That's an emotional decision more than anything else.\nSteve Volkmann: So, one big happy family. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nAlbert Nahmad: That's right.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: I like the use of the term blowout in the press release.\nAlbert Nahmad: Are we getting better in those press releases?\nSteve Tusa: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think you need to be more clear on how you feel about the results. \nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I did ask Barry to put in more color.\nSteve Tusa: That was a good one. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re allowed to say that a little bit compliance around here. But, obviously, a very strong result. I didn\u2019t -- I might have not caught this in the beginning, but can you guys just say how much price you booked in the quarter year-over-year?\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: we didn't -- we were asked and answered that we\u2019re not going to tell you exactly how much price was booked in the quarter. There obviously is positive price with, you know, again 29% same-store sales growth. You can imagine most of that is entirely unit growth prices of components, Steve. But we -- it's not something we've reported.\nStephen Tusa: Got it. And then, when you think about the gross profit improvement, which is obviously very strong, was there a big difference in the year-over-year on that? I think it was up like 40% or something on a same-store basis. Was there any difference between the parts and the equipment? \nBarry Logan: Difference in margin. \nStephen Tusa: Difference in gross profit performance. I mean was there -- yeah, I mean fine, gross margin improvement however you want to talk about it. \nBarry Logan: The more mix goes to parts and supplies, the higher corporate gross profit margin will be. \nStephen Tusa: Right. But I guess like-for-like just if you think about the performance of the year-over-year performance simply let's put it this way. What was the year-over-year gross profit performance for the parts business? Was it meaningfully better than the up 40% you saw for the total company?\nAlbert Nahmad: Oh, if I can tell. You\u2019ll deal with that Barry. \nBarry Logan: Yeah, Steve. There's really not much of a distinction in the performance. If I look at product groups and markets and product categories things like that it's pretty consistent across the company. There's no one bias or one pocket or one bubble if that\u2019s kind of what you're asking. That's there. It\u2019s pretty much across the board.\nStephen Tusa: Yeah. I'm just trying to discern like what the like there's some timing dynamics around your suppliers and you guys when it comes to pricing I would assume. And so, I'm trying to discern how much of that is kind of on the part side versus the equipment side.\nBarry Logan: Well, inventory turns which would matter in that algebra that you're talking about is\u2026\nStephen Tusa: Yeah. \nBarry Logan: \u2026.consistent across products. \nStephen Tusa: Okay. \nBarry Logan: So, again there's no distinction related in that kind of concept. Again, margins pretty much behave the same across products and markets.\nStephen Tusa: Got it. And then one final one, I guess Paul mentioned I think was Paul or maybe it was Al. The price increase that's kind of coming through in the fall and he said that was kind of a real price that they're going after. And, I guess, that means that, you know, we shouldn't like discount it too heavily like, you know, as you -- as we usually do or, at least, as we may normally have in the past. Those are some big numbers and, I mean, is kind of 5% of the annual price for kind of the players in the industry, and including you guys, like is that too big of a number to assume for price this year, price capture?\nPaul Johnston: Wow, like I said earlier, Steve -- and this is Paul -- we really haven't calculated that, you know? But the price increases that we're seeing and going through right now are holding and they\u2019re real. And, by real, I mean, you know, we're seeing the price increases actually stick because, you know, the cost has actually gone up, you know, to\u2026\nStephen Tusa: Right.\nPaul Johnston: \u2026the product and you've got an availability issue on the side that would certainly indicate that there is a supply component to it and so\u2026\nStephen Tusa: Right. And are you guys leveraging your kind of your buying power across the industry, at all, to kind of have an advantage over the competition\u2026\nAlbert Nahmad: Well\u2026\nStephen Tusa: \u2026when it comes to buying and what you\u2019re buying? \nAlbert Nahmad: Let's put it this way. We are the largest and, sure, we're going to try to get the best price. Every one of -- what is it, 1,000 vendors now, Paul?\nPaul Johnston: Right. \nAlbert Nahmad: Of course, we're going to try to leverage our size. Do we succeed? I guess, sometimes we do. But also, the subsidiaries themselves, the business units, they start figuring out whether they should buy the same stuff that their sister companies are buying. And, when they decide that, that also increases the amount of business that we can give a particular manufacturer, so that helps. And, again, we don\u2019t legislate what the business units have to buy because they know their markets better than us. We like the collaboration among them so that they can come up with, to answer your questions, let\u2019s just buy from one vendor or two vendors instead of three or four, and that helps to manufacture and give us better pricing.\nStephen Tusa: Right. Makes sense. Yeah.\nAlbert Nahmad: Those are things you get with scale.\nStephen Tusa: Makes a ton of sense. Cool. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel from William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: So, I guess stepping back a little bit, I'm just trying to understand why the HVAC market is so strong. When I talk to people in the channel, everyone is surprised by the strength. Now, obviously, high home prices, low interest rates, right, weather, that's all helpful. But do you think work from home and people running air conditioning more...\nAlbert Nahmad: Sure.\nRyan Merkel: ...is boosting demand?\nAlbert Nahmad: Sure. Sure. Paul, do you have the best sense for that?\nPaul Johnston: Yeah. I think in certain markets, it does, especially in the North and West, perhaps, where we're becoming a better force in the North. But I think in the South, I think it's just people buying existing homes. When they buy an existing home, they don't plan it, but they end up replacing an air conditioner at some point during the first twelve 12, 18 months of existing home purchase. We're seeing a lot around refrigerant and CR changes. It's impacting it. We're seeing a lot more technology getting into heat pump growth, which is greening up -- taking some carbon out of the environment that is creating some demand among consumers. Obviously, the price increases as prices have increased. I think that's driven some demand from the consumers when they talk to their contractor, dealer. And I think the availability issue I think creates further demand. So, there's probably a -- to use a [indiscernible]. That\u2019s probably 14 or 15 different things that I think have created here. And then we have beyond just people sitting at home and running their air conditioning more, you know. \nRyan Merkel: Yeah.\nAlbert Nahmad: I think -- just to add to that. I think one of the realities is that, you know, OEMs do not sell their air conditioning. We do not sell air conditioning. A contractor advising the homeowner is the one making the sales. And A.J. mentioned earlier about our customer engagement to help that process to engage them in the digital process to do that. And I think it\u2019s having some effectiveness. But I've said many times with contractors, if we see their credit at an all-time high, it means they're doing well. It means their confidence level is high. It means their design and desire to sell more stuff and sell higher efficiency stuff is a real thing.  And so that's what's been the nicest thing to see really for two years. It's not just a one quarter thing. The last two years, we've seen that that leading indicator, if you will, in our credit. And today, it's the best we've seen it.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. That's helpful. And then just quickly my follow-up. I'm not sure if this was asked yet but you didn't leverage SG&A this quarter. Maybe just explain why that was just given the blow out top line, if you put it? And second half do you think you'll leverage SG&A?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, how detailed -- Barry, you want to get with is?\nBarry Logan: No. \nAlbert Nahmad: The fact that we have a lot of people working overtime because we're shorthanded in certain places, whatever it is, it's that sort of thing and it's constructive. We met -- we\u2019ve met the challenge, not only of not having a sufficient product but, in some cases, not having a sufficient labor. And, I mean, we just did what we had to do. Is that going to continue in quarters from now, that same circumstances? Who knows? I hope not. \nAlbert Nahmad: As I add to that and a part of it is, you know, we have a commissioned sales force. We have branch managers who can make up a bonus if they do well. We have a leadership throughout the company that is a good chunk of performance-based compensation, all of which, needless to say, year-to-date is being earned and is a part of the cost structure this year that, you know, obviously, is important and earned. And comparative to last year, Ryan, you can see the difference in the performance. So, there is a good chunk of performance-based compensation in the numbers this year and it accounts for some of that and, again, well-deserved and well-earned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hey. Good morning, Al. So, I think it was -- I think it was Paul or it might have been Barry, you know, talking about, you know, kind of this anomaly where, you know, you're not seeing the trade-off between equipment and non-equipment, but the growth is kind of strong in tandem.  So, whatever's happening, you know, stuff is breaking and it may be a faster rate over the last year or so than what folks would have expected. Maybe think about how that rolls out in your own results. Would your expectation then be volume has more kind of room to normalize than mix or the consumer confidence is so high, the mix is also high, and maybe that also has new room to step down. Like, which one of those do you feel like is sort of the bigger surprise and maybe has the long-term average to get back to that\u2019s a little lower?\nAlbert Nahmad: Who wants that one? Barry, Paul, A.J.? And good luck with it.\nBarry Logan: I don\u2019t even understand it.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah.\nBarry Logan: I can\u2019t tell if there\u2019s a lot of nuances in that or not, but I'll give it a shot. Well, first on mix and high efficiency and so on, 70% of our business is equipment. And it's been 11 straight years, 44 quarters where mix has improved. And there's -- I don't think there's a reason to think that changes. And I think it's still far from any long-term average that goes back more than 10 years ago. And, again, our technology platform that we're witnessing, our sales platform, is at another level even than just what the market is doing. So, I'll take those fundamentals to mean that the ability to sell increasing efficiency is something that can continue. And we're investing a great deal with our customers to help it continue. And, obviously, there's some regulatory things in the horizon that will mandate that it continues. So, I think that's a -- that\u2019s how I would feel about it. Parts and supplies, again, is nuanced. There are probably 600 vendors, over 100 different product lines in that conversation. And my earlier comment where we see culturally a lot of growth, a lot of energy, a lot of salesmanship, a lot of data and technology, pushing those products. And I think that\u2019s for us to enjoy not necessarily analyze against the marketplace. And I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t if replacement parts are growing in the market. I know our business is and part of that is internal more so than what the market is doing. \nPaul Johnston: Yeah. I mean\u2026\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it.\nAlbert Nahmad: \u2026the easy way to think of that one -- an easy to think of that one is that our customers sometimes have to go to our competitors to buy products, HVCA/R products. We can and should have those products available at a competitive price for our customers. And that's the kind of focus and effort that we can bring.\nBarry Logan: A market like\u2026\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Okay. And then just on.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah. Just to add some color real quick. A market like Miami where we might have 6 or 7 major equipment distribution competitors, for parts and supplies we may have 15 or 20 in Miami. And so, that's the ground game where I think we're making some progress and growing our business.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Okay. And then on\u2026\nAlbert Nahmad: And we\u2019re working -- okay. We're coming up with better measurement systems, [ph] Josh as far as be able to identify if we're actually making a better penetration, looking at attachment rates on equipment, looking at that normal business cycles, looking at warranty rates and warranty population against what the industry has out there. So, we're doing an awful lot of analytic work on this to be able to measure and determine how we can continue to grow in that area.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Okay. Understood. Sorry. I had a lot of false starts that I wanted to give make sure everyone had a chance. On your kind of the competitive environment and availability it seems like you guys between, you know, maybe a better kind of internal sourcing and supply chain practice, and just being more the 100-pound gorilla from an industry perspective probably aren't having as many stock out issues or availability issues as some smaller folks. Do you guys think that's giving you sort of a wider aperture on pricing right now? If you, you know, if you guys can step in when maybe someone else can or a customer that's more of a mercenary-type customer rather than Watsco dedicated, you know, wants product. Is that sort of giving you a little bit more boost on the pricing side?\nAlbert Nahmad: Okay. I'll take that -- I'll cut at that. I don't believe that, Josh. Yes, we are big. We're very effective as far as being able to provide our OEMs with the data that they required to put their order plans together, their build plans together to be able to survive. But I don't think we've been benefited in any way, in any special way compared to the other distributors that those OEM felt it. \nJosh Pokrzywinski: No. I mean to your -- to customers. So, to the extent that someone else just doesn't have kind of the process rigor that, you know, regardless of whether or not you're purchasing things cheaper that you can price to a customer maybe a little bit better because they can only get it from you.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah. \nJosh Pokrzywinski: I haven\u2019t seen that, you know. Go ahead. \nAlbert Nahmad: I would say, I think that part of that dynamic is why we believe we're taking share. I don't think we're using an opportunistically to take advantage customers and get an extra few dollars along the way. That's not how we approach our customer base. You know, we talk about the [indiscernible] company. Our relationships with our customers are also long term. This is not a consumer transactional business. This is a B2B relationships and help our customers grow their long-term business.\nPaul Johnston: I totally agree with you, A.J. on that.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is a follow up from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Hey, guys. I\u2019m not sure anybody ask. So, I\u2019ll just try and see if you guys can give some color. I mean what do you see for kind of second half growth? And are you seeing anything in kind of July here that you'd want to comment on? Just trying to kind of get the best crystal ball view at this stage.\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: Yes, Steve. I'll speak about I think the last half of the year rather than, you know, the first 16 business days of July.\nSteve Tusa: Sure.\nBarry Logan: And how this morning went, right? No, I mean you can expect moderation in residential equipment just because that's common sense. You know, it's not going to grow 29% from here on, right? So, there will be moderation and how it plays out over the season versus into next year. There'll be some moderation. There has to be. At the same time, you know, there's absolute strength in commercial, absolute strength in our international markets which were in more of a [indiscernible] a year ago. We've talked about price and margin outlook for the next several months. And we've talked about our acquisition additions that we've made to add to growth rates going forward. And then, you can imagine already looking into next year and beyond with Arlington community having the same conversation about a growth in share going forward. So, it is a several moving pieces. And you know, that's how I would approach the answer there. But the way to look at it is what we\u2019ve done... Year-over-year, we\u2019ve been at this for a few years, and you can see what the record is. We always manage, in most cases, we always manage to grow, sometimes at a higher rate of growth than others. But -- some of its internally because we do things better internally, and some of it is because the industry is doing something.\nSteve Tusa: Can same-store sales be -- you said moderating, obviously. Can same-store sales be up 5% to 10% in the second half for resi equipment?\nBarry Logan: Who said they\u2019re moderating? We're not.\nSteve Tusa: Well, so, then, you're going to be up 30% in the second half for resi equipment?\nBarry Logan: No. I just was curious who said we were moderating.\nSteve Tusa: Barry just said that you guys will see moderate [indiscernible].\nAlbert Nahmad: Okay. You can say that Barry.\nSteve Tusa: He said there was evidence.\nAlbert Nahmad: I\u2019m going to say that Barry changed the barometer. Barry\u2019s point was that things can\u2019t grow at 30% forever.\nSteve Tusa: Right.\nAlbert Nahmad: No. I was just teasing.\nBarry Logan: We have that conversation with our leaders, and the challenge to them that they put on themselves is, well, how are we going to grow while things slow, which inevitably at some point can't grow for 30% forever. So, they are creating programs, and they're doing what they need to do now to continue to grow regardless of industry conditions.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And I guess last, one more to ask is that, do you think the industry will be down at any time in the second half?\nBarry Logan: No. I don\u2019t think so. Paul, you have a better handle on this.\nPaul Johnston: Yeah. It probably will. We'll probably shipment. But I don\u2019t know if...\nBarry Logan: Yeah. I said no, and you said yes.\nPaul Johnston: I don't know about it.\nBarry Logan: Who knows? The answer is who knows?\nPaul Johnston: You asked for my guess, and my guess would be you'll probably see maybe some -- there's a difference between what the -- what there's a shipment demand and there's a movement demand. And, I think, the movement right now is going to remain strong and maybe shipments will slow down a little bit, and that may not be because of orders. It may be because of the other supply issues that some of the OEMs are having.\nSteve Tusa: Right. So, AHRI could be down at certain points, and your sell-through is, you know, it continues to grow but at a slower rate than the 30%, which is, you know, the common sense comment. Is that a good way\u2026\nBarry Logan: Yeah. \nSteve Tusa: Okay. Awesome. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And there are no more questions in the queue. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, thanks very much for your continued interest in our company. I hope we don't disappoint you ever, going forward. And our record in the past, I hope that keeps you interested. So, thank you, again, for your interest and we look forward to talking to you in the next quarter. Bye now.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Albert Nahmad",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I hope that everyone is having a safe and good day. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call and what an incredible quarter it was for Watsco. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO; and with me is A.J. Nahmad, who is our President; and our two Executive Vice Presidents, Paul Johnston and Barry Logan. Now, as we normally do, before we start, I need to read our cautionary statement. The conference call has forward-looking statements, as defined by SEC laws and regulations, that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws. The ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Now on to our report, I am pleased to share that Watsco has delivered an incredible second quarter, achieving new records in virtually every performance metric. Earnings per share jumped 64% to a record $3.71 per share on a 66% increase in net income. This was, by far, our most successful quarter ever.  Sales grew 36% or nearly $500 million to a record $1.850 billion in sales for the quarter. Gross profits increased 50% with gross margin expanding 220 basis points. Operating income increased $88 million or 68% to $217 million, and operating margins, this is a big one, operating margins expanded 220 basis points to a record 11.7%. Now, these results are all the more positive when considered against last year's second quarter which had only a modest impact from the COVID-related slowdowns Now, we have two new companies in our family; TEC and Acme. They perform very well, and we cannot be happier that they are now part of an -- an important part of Watsco. They have a rich and successful history, and we will help them any way we can. Looking ahead, we are engaged in a very fragmented $50 billion North American market. Again, this is a $50 billion North American market. And we hope to find more great companies to join us. The greater scale in this industry provides more capital for us to fund our growth priorities. Also, Watsco's industry-leading technologies continue to gain traction, and we believe they are helping us gain market share. Here are a few important highlights to mention. First, growth rates among active users of our technologies continues to outpace the growth rates of nonusers. Customers using our technology are simply growing faster. Next, attrition among customers using our technology is meaningfully lower compared to nonusers. The technology enables us to create stickier customer relationships. Also, more customers are using our digital selling platform that are called OnCall Air and CreditForComfort. They help in modernize our HV solutions that are presented to homeowners. As evidence of the success of OnCall Air and CreditForComfort, the number of digital sales presentations made by our contractor customers to end consumers increased by 84% and helped close over $200 million of sales during the quarter. These tools have also benefited the sale of higher efficiency systems, which we think is an important contributor to the climate change discussion. As owner systems are replaced, our technology can play an important role in helping consumers choose more energy efficient solutions. Our progress is very encouraging. But we believe it is still early in terms of reaching the full potential of our technology investments. Our focus remains in the long term. I think you've heard me say that over and over again. We are long-term players in the industry. Please feel free to schedule a Zoom call with us and we can further explain our technology and its impact. Finally, but very important our balance sheet remains in pristine condition with only a small amount of debt. We have plenty of capacity and even more ambitions to grow our company both organically and through acquisitions. With that, A.J., Paul Barry and I are happy to answer your questions. Barry? Paul. No, we haven't. You know, it's a -- there's not a regular cadence to it. So, for us, it's, you know, making sure that we're getting the price increases into the customers' hands has been a priority one. They have been coming at us so fast, you know? And, as far as the measurement, yes, we'll do a reconciliation and find out exactly what that is at some point at, you know, once the year progresses. What was the question? Any sign of what? No. Well, let me say that we also are aware of the end consumer, and we are now presenting more and more renewals of our financing program so that whatever the cost increase is, is less of a burden for homeowners because of the terms of the --that we provide through one of our platforms for financing and particularly equipment. And somebody else want to say something. Go ahead. So, just -- what I would add to that is two things. First, what we sell is a component of the consumer's cost. It isn't the consumer's cost. So how a contractor prices and ultimately completes a job and sells the job, and as Al mentioned how we can help them finance the job, it's a relatively layered type of transaction. And we haven't seen any deterioration. In fact, growth rates or high efficiency are well beyond the overall equipment growth rate that you see in the press release at 29%. Second thing I'd say is part of the technology that we have is the presentation software to push and recommend and really help contractors. They will be on paper when they present these different options to homeowners. And so, in the press release, you read about OnCall Air, you know, doubling in size in the quarter. That's that piece of software and high efficiency is ruling the day in that environment. And I want to get back to financing. Interest rates everybody knows are low. And so, we're helping our distributors which are our customers with financing. And then, we're helping their customers the homeowners with financing. And we're taking advantage of lower interest rates to help the end consumer and help the distributor. Well, we do sometimes with extended terms of our own. But it's a combination of that and using third party when it goes out several years. Well, first, let me say that the OEMs we deal with have really worked hard to meet demand. They're doing the best they can. Their suppliers on the other hand are sometimes letting them down or sometimes they're overwhelmed. But we do believe that they're getting better at it. We believe we could have sold more in the second quarter had we had more particularly equipment. But it's matter of time, demand will catch up with equipment -- I mean with supply. And in the meantime, we're doing the best we can as the number show. But everybody's got some -- every OEM has one particular, two particular items or a number of particular items that they're short on because they don't control the manufacturing of it. Who wants that question? Barry? It's different areas. Yeah. You mean, in terms of the gross profit margin increases or a flattening or declining and that sort of thing? Yeah. Yeah. I know what you mean. I think I understand. But we're very focused on our gross margin percent. And we mentioned some technology we bought in with pricing effects. And we've mentioned other ways that we're trying to achieve that. That's not going to stop. I don't know whether -- where the end will be. But that's what we're going to continue to seek to improve in a number of ways. So, that's an ongoing goal of ours and we've had successes with it as you say in the first half of this year. And we're going to continue to focus on that in the second half.  And don't forget, we're trying to change the supplies business in terms of the margins of the parts and supplies that they are generally higher than equipment. So, we're emphasizing to our branches sales of those goods. And so, that's something that could continue to increase the mix of our products more parts and supplies in the mix of the overall sales picture. Somebody want to add something to that? So, we're not having [indiscernible] because high efficiency equipment we believe contributes to the climate change issue that's on there. You have to start with a premise that in homeowners or the electrical bill half of it is due to heating and cooling. Half of homeowners' electrical bills due to heating and cooling uses. And if you have a higher efficiency cooling and heating system you're going to use less electricity which in turn you're going to less power production and which in turn minimizes the release of CO2 gases. So, it's very well connected and we have a very clear eye about what we can do which is encourage the adoption and make it easier and help with financing it high efficiency equipment because not only does it help us as a corporation. But it also helps the climate change issue which we're trying to figure out in many different ways how to help that particular issue. You mean you want us to tell the competition how we're doing this? Well, maybe it is better to give you a data how productive have we been in the effort. I think we can share growth rates and parts and supplies, Barry, Paul E-commerce is a major contributor because it's so efficient. Go ahead. I'm sorry for the interruption. Yeah. And what's our e-commerce platform sales for the first half, Barry? That's about a third of our business now... ...of our revenues. Well, that's a very good question because we haven't got an answer to that yet. For example, should we be in the financing business? Should we partner with somebody in the financing business? You know, these are big issues that we haven't resolved yet. But I don't see any reason why not to one way or the other figure out how to how to extend and increase the support we provide our distributors and their customers, the homeowners, financial assistance. I particularly like the interest rate feel that we can take advantage of something like that. And even when the rates go back up, there will always be ways to tweak that to help our customers.  So, we like -- we like the financing thing. We haven't figured it all out. If you've got a good company, we can buy that and accelerates it. We'd be happy to talk to them. It is a pillar of our growth, financing, But it's probably not going to run very fast in terms of development [ph] more of the same until we figure out the big picture by somebody or become part of somebody or you know, that sort of thing. if you're looking for a headline number though, the products that we sell in our competitors stuff at wholesale level get resold at the retail level for $80 billion or $90 billion. And some portion of that is and will be finance. Well, I think maybe you should go out and tell them, this is the time to do so. Look, we are engaged with distributors, and that's a part of our culture, always to be engaged with great companies. I don't think we have an answer to that. I think they may be concerned about the capital gains tax, for example, going up.  But, in the end, what they want to do, the family businesses especially, is connect with a company that's going to preserve their own names and culture, and that's what we specialize in, you know? These two companies that we recently bought, for example, at TEC, their culture is so strong. All we do -- we act at a support level, you know? We're not -- we're going to feed them whatever they want; capital or equity for their key executives, technology. That's our style and there'll be people that want to get engaged with that because of that reason.  In terms of their, you know, the atmosphere about the taxes going up and all of that, I -- do you see any trend in that, Barry, one way or the other? Yeah. It's really their family joining our family, right? That's an emotional decision more than anything else. That's right. Are we getting better in those press releases? Well, I did ask Barry to put in more color. Barry? Oh, if I can tell. You'll deal with that Barry. Well... Let's put it this way. We are the largest and, sure, we're going to try to get the best price. Every one of -- what is it, 1,000 vendors now, Paul? Of course, we're going to try to leverage our size. Do we succeed? I guess, sometimes we do. But also, the subsidiaries themselves, the business units, they start figuring out whether they should buy the same stuff that their sister companies are buying. And, when they decide that, that also increases the amount of business that we can give a particular manufacturer, so that helps. And, again, we don't legislate what the business units have to buy because they know their markets better than us. We like the collaboration among them so that they can come up with, to answer your questions, let's just buy from one vendor or two vendors instead of three or four, and that helps to manufacture and give us better pricing. Those are things you get with scale. Sure. Sure. Sure. Paul, do you have the best sense for that? I think -- just to add to that. I think one of the realities is that, you know, OEMs do not sell their air conditioning. We do not sell air conditioning. A contractor advising the homeowner is the one making the sales. And A.J. mentioned earlier about our customer engagement to help that process to engage them in the digital process to do that. And I think it's having some effectiveness. But I've said many times with contractors, if we see their credit at an all-time high, it means they're doing well. It means their confidence level is high. It means their design and desire to sell more stuff and sell higher efficiency stuff is a real thing.  And so that's what's been the nicest thing to see really for two years. It's not just a one quarter thing. The last two years, we've seen that that leading indicator, if you will, in our credit. And today, it's the best we've seen it. Well, how detailed -- Barry, you want to get with is? The fact that we have a lot of people working overtime because we're shorthanded in certain places, whatever it is, it's that sort of thing and it's constructive. We met -- we've met the challenge, not only of not having a sufficient product but, in some cases, not having a sufficient labor. And, I mean, we just did what we had to do. Is that going to continue in quarters from now, that same circumstances? Who knows? I hope not. As I add to that and a part of it is, you know, we have a commissioned sales force. We have branch managers who can make up a bonus if they do well. We have a leadership throughout the company that is a good chunk of performance-based compensation, all of which, needless to say, year-to-date is being earned and is a part of the cost structure this year that, you know, obviously, is important and earned. And comparative to last year, Ryan, you can see the difference in the performance. So, there is a good chunk of performance-based compensation in the numbers this year and it accounts for some of that and, again, well-deserved and well-earned. Who wants that one? Barry, Paul, A.J.? And good luck with it. Yeah. ...the easy way to think of that one -- an easy to think of that one is that our customers sometimes have to go to our competitors to buy products, HVCA/R products. We can and should have those products available at a competitive price for our customers. And that's the kind of focus and effort that we can bring. Yeah. Just to add some color real quick. A market like Miami where we might have 6 or 7 major equipment distribution competitors, for parts and supplies we may have 15 or 20 in Miami. And so, that's the ground game where I think we're making some progress and growing our business. And we're working -- okay. We're coming up with better measurement systems, [ph] Josh as far as be able to identify if we're actually making a better penetration, looking at attachment rates on equipment, looking at that normal business cycles, looking at warranty rates and warranty population against what the industry has out there. So, we're doing an awful lot of analytic work on this to be able to measure and determine how we can continue to grow in that area. Okay. I'll take that -- I'll cut at that. I don't believe that, Josh. Yes, we are big. We're very effective as far as being able to provide our OEMs with the data that they required to put their order plans together, their build plans together to be able to survive. But I don't think we've been benefited in any way, in any special way compared to the other distributors that those OEM felt it. Yeah. I would say, I think that part of that dynamic is why we believe we're taking share. I don't think we're using an opportunistically to take advantage customers and get an extra few dollars along the way. That's not how we approach our customer base. You know, we talk about the [indiscernible] company. Our relationships with our customers are also long term. This is not a consumer transactional business. This is a B2B relationships and help our customers grow their long-term business. Barry? Okay. You can say that Barry. I'm going to say that Barry changed the barometer. Barry's point was that things can't grow at 30% forever. No. I was just teasing. Well, thanks very much for your continued interest in our company. I hope we don't disappoint you ever, going forward. And our record in the past, I hope that keeps you interested. So, thank you, again, for your interest and we look forward to talking to you in the next quarter. Bye now."

            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "Good morning, Jeff. Again, gross margin always is a primary component of what we pay for products and what do we sell products for. And it's all very decent -- decentralized and regional and local and customer specific. And so if there isn't one answer to your question, there's about 16,000 answers to your question as to how it plays out in the marketplace each year.  Clearly, high efficiency systems are being sold at a greater rate. Clearly, price increases as they flow through benefit some of the gross margin, you know, flow through if you will. Also culturally, we've done a lot with pricing systems and pricing technology and pricing data, pricing software to optimize price. That doesn't mean we necessarily raise price, it means optimize price at markets. And also working closely with all of our OEMs. We have about 600 total manufacturers. They're facing, you know, inflation. They have to decide on their own pricing mechanism into the markets and as we work through that with them, you know, some of those benefits occur.  What does the future, you know, your next question was, what does the future hold. Well, Paul, maybe you want to comment on it. But there's still continued pricing actions going on in the market. And we would expect to continue to work with OEMs and customers and flow that dynamic through our business. Hi, Nigel, Barry here. Good morning. Well, the West Coast for us if you look at the branch count in our filings is actually a relatively small marketplace for us where we're not in the Pacific Northwest at all at zero. And as Western markets again from a contribution point of view, did well in the quarter but it didn't contribute to the overall results materially. So, we do want to be actually much bigger out there. In relative terms, it's not very material. Well, we don't like to be in an inflationary environment like any other business. I don't think it's something that's good for the consumer or anyone else in the distribution chain. But sometimes, things happen, and we do the best we can. And I keep referring to the way we can assist the distributor and his customer is by providing especially opportunistic financing given the lower rates to offset some of that. But generally speaking, wherever the inflation is, we'll adjust to it one way or the other. And I think we're gaining share by the things that we do. Anybody else want to add something to it, Barry or Paul or A.J.? Yeah. I think the only thing I would add is we do operate a business with 655 locations and... ...5,000, 6,000 people. And to the extent there are -- as an element of fixed cost, we do benefit in terms of profitability and inflationary environment if those fixed costs are not growing or inflationary as well. So, there's always some pressure on cost in this environment. And if -- not always proportionate to the overall inflationary rate, and it's an opportunity to have some profitability growth. But, again, I wouldn't say it's a huge material amount. It's just an opportunity for us. That's the favorite question of the President the company. That's fine. So, clearly, there's change. And the benefits are there for [indiscernible]. And it started -- this all started last year in terms of our raw energy flowing into this, and it's something over time that should benefit gross margin because gross margin is, in fact, considerably higher in that part of the business. Our run rate is about $1.8 billion for the last 12 months. So, it'd be close to $1 billion, I think, for a six-month period. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I would say, it all -- it always helps, quantitatively, the confidence of doing something when things are going well. It helps our confidence and it helps the sellers' mindset of optimizing valuation and not feeling like they're doing something, you know, ahead of time or what have you, and the taxes matter, too. But what really matters is none of that. What really matters is that it's an emotional process. These are families that have owned businesses for 70, 80 years, third and fourth generation, and I wish it was just that -- I wish it was just a financial process, but it's entirely, at times, an emotional process. So, that's the part where I feel like we've been successful as dealing with that emotion going forward for another generation or two, and it's why TEC and [indiscernible], a year before, after 90 years, 80 years of owning their business only talk to us and we completed it and it's moving forward. So, I think you're right. It helps the discussion to do well. It doesn't necessarily help the completion process because that still an emotional one for these guys. we didn't -- we were asked and answered that we're not going to tell you exactly how much price was booked in the quarter. There obviously is positive price with, you know, again 29% same-store sales growth. You can imagine most of that is entirely unit growth prices of components, Steve. But we -- it's not something we've reported. Difference in margin. The more mix goes to parts and supplies, the higher corporate gross profit margin will be. Yeah, Steve. There's really not much of a distinction in the performance. If I look at product groups and markets and product categories things like that it's pretty consistent across the company. There's no one bias or one pocket or one bubble if that's kind of what you're asking. That's there. It's pretty much across the board. Well, inventory turns which would matter in that algebra that you're talking about is... ....consistent across products. So, again there's no distinction related in that kind of concept. Again, margins pretty much behave the same across products and markets. No. I don't even understand it. I can't tell if there's a lot of nuances in that or not, but I'll give it a shot. Well, first on mix and high efficiency and so on, 70% of our business is equipment. And it's been 11 straight years, 44 quarters where mix has improved. And there's -- I don't think there's a reason to think that changes. And I think it's still far from any long-term average that goes back more than 10 years ago. And, again, our technology platform that we're witnessing, our sales platform, is at another level even than just what the market is doing. So, I'll take those fundamentals to mean that the ability to sell increasing efficiency is something that can continue. And we're investing a great deal with our customers to help it continue. And, obviously, there's some regulatory things in the horizon that will mandate that it continues. So, I think that's a -- that's how I would feel about it. Parts and supplies, again, is nuanced. There are probably 600 vendors, over 100 different product lines in that conversation. And my earlier comment where we see culturally a lot of growth, a lot of energy, a lot of salesmanship, a lot of data and technology, pushing those products. And I think that's for us to enjoy not necessarily analyze against the marketplace. And I don't think -- I don't if replacement parts are growing in the market. I know our business is and part of that is internal more so than what the market is doing. A market like... Yes, Steve. I'll speak about I think the last half of the year rather than, you know, the first 16 business days of July. And how this morning went, right? No, I mean you can expect moderation in residential equipment just because that's common sense. You know, it's not going to grow 29% from here on, right? So, there will be moderation and how it plays out over the season versus into next year. There'll be some moderation. There has to be. At the same time, you know, there's absolute strength in commercial, absolute strength in our international markets which were in more of a [indiscernible] a year ago. We've talked about price and margin outlook for the next several months. And we've talked about our acquisition additions that we've made to add to growth rates going forward. And then, you can imagine already looking into next year and beyond with Arlington community having the same conversation about a growth in share going forward. So, it is a several moving pieces. And you know, that's how I would approach the answer there. But the way to look at it is what we've done... Year-over-year, we've been at this for a few years, and you can see what the record is. We always manage, in most cases, we always manage to grow, sometimes at a higher rate of growth than others. But -- some of its internally because we do things better internally, and some of it is because the industry is doing something. Who said they're moderating? We're not. No. I just was curious who said we were moderating. We have that conversation with our leaders, and the challenge to them that they put on themselves is, well, how are we going to grow while things slow, which inevitably at some point can't grow for 30% forever. So, they are creating programs, and they're doing what they need to do now to continue to grow regardless of industry conditions. No. I don't think so. Paul, you have a better handle on this. Yeah. I said no, and you said yes. Who knows? The answer is who knows? Yeah."

            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "I can agree with you more Barry. I think in the future we've got the right amount of discipline. We've been able to hire people who are in positions now where they're actually managing and looking at pricing on a daily, moment by moment basis. And I think working with our vendors and with our OEMs, I think we can continue -- continuing improving gross profit maybe in a more moderate rate than we've done in the past 18 months. But still we can improve. Yeah. The equipment manufacturers each one of them with the exception of one right now I think have announced that they've got their third price increase of the year going. And each one of them have announced a recent price increase, September, August time frame of anywhere from 4% to 8%. And they're real price increases. They genuinely need the price increases. We all do because there has been an increase in the [indiscernible] costs. So, on the OEM side, yeah, we've seen price increases three times this year. When you get to the non-equipment piece of it, the parts and the supply side. And it's been a pretty continuous stream of price increases that we've been administering, well in excess of roughly 200 price increases, most of them multiple, obviously. So, you know, the industry definitely has seen an upward turn in pricing. Wow, like I said earlier, Steve -- and this is Paul -- we really haven't calculated that, you know? But the price increases that we're seeing and going through right now are holding and they're real. And, by real, I mean, you know, we're seeing the price increases actually stick because, you know, the cost has actually gone up, you know, to... ...the product and you've got an availability issue on the side that would certainly indicate that there is a supply component to it and so... Right. Yeah. I think in certain markets, it does, especially in the North and West, perhaps, where we're becoming a better force in the North. But I think in the South, I think it's just people buying existing homes. When they buy an existing home, they don't plan it, but they end up replacing an air conditioner at some point during the first twelve 12, 18 months of existing home purchase. We're seeing a lot around refrigerant and CR changes. It's impacting it. We're seeing a lot more technology getting into heat pump growth, which is greening up -- taking some carbon out of the environment that is creating some demand among consumers. Obviously, the price increases as prices have increased. I think that's driven some demand from the consumers when they talk to their contractor, dealer. And I think the availability issue I think creates further demand. So, there's probably a -- to use a [indiscernible]. That's probably 14 or 15 different things that I think have created here. And then we have beyond just people sitting at home and running their air conditioning more, you know. Yeah. I mean... I totally agree with you, A.J. on that. Yeah. It probably will. We'll probably shipment. But I don't know if... I don't know about it. You asked for my guess, and my guess would be you'll probably see maybe some -- there's a difference between what the -- what there's a shipment demand and there's a movement demand. And, I think, the movement right now is going to remain strong and maybe shipments will slow down a little bit, and that may not be because of orders. It may be because of the other supply issues that some of the OEMs are having."

            "content": "This is A.J. I'll just add to that. As it relates to our total gross profit margins, we are focused on selling and aspire to sell more parts and supplies, which inherently have higher gross profit margin. So, that also contributes. Yeah. I don't think there's been much pushback from the consumer at all. You hit it right on the head. The consumer doesn't know what the -- what a price is. It's not a frequent purchase for the consumer. And so, to-date, we have not seen a lot of pushback. A lot of it has just been based on availability, being able to satisfy the customers' need for home comfort, indoor air quality and humidity control. I'll just add that I have to say that our teams in the field have been working tirelessly to meet their customer's demands and expectations. They've moved a lot of product around and household. And we're grateful and appreciate their hard work too. I'll take a stab at it. We manage -- we've got one of the best technology platforms available to manage our inventory. And we have constant update meetings with each one of our OEMs as well as some of our key suppliers who don't make finished goods inventory. And what we're working with them on is making sure that we have our complete visibility to what our needs are, what our forecasts are, and what our order reliability from them has been. And I think what it's what it's done is it's brought us a lot closer, communication wise, with the OEMs and made us, I wouldn't say a favorite nation, but it would certainly make us easier to do business with than most of the channel.  So, I think it has helped us. Have we lost market share? I think we've gained market share because of our inventory management systems. Yeah. I was going to say, I'm not sure -- we are -- we don't consider ourselves constrained in technology investments. This is a technology company that just happens to sell heating and air conditioning. And, you know, when we say technology, that's really a big broad umbrella term that we're using to define our culture, really, which is a continuous improvement, a continuous learning and continuous ways to find, find ways to help our customers grow their businesses which is, at the end of the day, that's our mission.  Our customers are small- and medium-sized entrepreneurial-led businesses, and we can bring tools and technology to them to help them grow. We could make ourselves better to help them grow. So, that is our ethos, you know? So, we call that technology for short, but that's really what we're in the business of doing and we'll continue to invest, yes. Yeah. David, it shouldn't be lost -- yeah, it shouldn't be lost on anyone that you're looking at a quarter for example or even let's look at the half for maybe even better. Growth rate of residential products is up 24% in the half, first half of the year. Parts and supplies is up 19% and accelerated in the second quarter to closer to 25% parts and supplies.  Historically, there's some inversion in those two numbers, because as equipment grows, parts and supplies, generally, we'll grow at the same rate because people are replacing systems. So, this is a change the last six months. And it is a sales force, it is a culture, it is incentive system, it is many things, simply to bring energy and data and technology and e-commerce systems, and it's, again, it's 15 things. It's not one or two things."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Albert Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Watsco\u2019s first quarter earnings call. And this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. And with me is A.J. Nahmad, who is the President; and our two Executive Vice Presidents, Paul Johnston and Barry Logan. Before we start, our usual cautionary statement. The conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws or regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. On to our financial report, Watsco achieved record first quarter results. Earnings per share grew 93% to a record $1.39 per share. Records were set for sales, gross profits, gross margin, operating income, operating margin, net income and earnings per share. Now, these results were driven by strong sales growth made at higher selling margins along with improved operating efficiencies. When we look at our product offering, we achieved double-digit sales growth in equipment, non-equipment and commercial refrigeration. And in terms of geography, growth rates during the quarter were similar for U.S. markets and international markets as a whole. For HVAC equipment, residential sales increased 18% and commercial equipment sales stabilized and are now trending more positively. But more important, this is not just about one quarter. Over the last 12 months, residential equipment sales in our U.S. markets have increased 15% and we believe meaningful market share gains have been achieved. Looking forward, we expect business to be strong and that 2021 will be another record year of performance for our company. Adding more color, Watsco\u2019s industry leading technology continues to gain adoption. That leads to new customer acquisition and we believe development of greater market share. Now a few important trends are also continuing. Active technology users continue to outpace growth rates of non-users. Customer attrition among active technology users is meaningfully lower compared to non-users and our platforms used by contractors to make sales to homeowners gain more users. That in turn doubled the number of at-home sales presentations and increased sales volumes that flow through our platforms called OnCall Air and CreditForComfort. We are happy with our progress, but we believe it is still early in terms of reaching the full potential of our technology investments. We, once again, invite you to schedule a Zoom call with us and we can further explain that technology and its impact. Moving along financially, our balance sheet remains in pristine condition with only a small amount of debt. We are excited to have closed 2 weeks ago on the acquisition of Temperature Equipment Corporation, also known as TEC. This is a long established, generationally owned company headquartered in Chicago. TEC adds 32 locations and approximately $300 million in revenue and establishes Watsco\u2019s first major presence in the Midwest United States. I must say that TEC is a great company with a long and proud history. They are led by wonderful team of entrepreneurs and we are honored to be part of their family. They are also off to a strong start this year and we expect their results to be accretive to 2021 results. We continue to look for other transactions with great businesses like TEC. While doing our search, we offer our well-known culture that is to say again, when we search, we offer our well-known culture that respects and continues a company\u2019s distinct legacy and we support their plans for growth. We think that Watsco is a great next step for family-owned companies in our industry. Lastly, a reminder that we raised our dividends by 10% in April 2021 to $7.80 a follow-up to the record cash flow achieved in 2020. We believe our dividend is a good reason to in Watsco over the long-term. 2021 marks our 47th consecutive year of paying dividends, and we have increased our dividends in 19 years of the last 20 years from $0.10 per share in \u201820 \u2013 in the year 2000. Let me say that again, from $0.10 per share in \u201820 \u2013 in the year 2000 to today\u2019s annual rate of $7.80. Now with all \u2013 with that, Al, Paul, A.J., Paul, Barry and I are happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hi Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Good morning now. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I hope everyone is well. I guess maybe just to start out here, we are about to approach a point in time where comps start to get kind of squarely and we lap some of the kind of early day challenges of COVID before the industry realize that things were going to be pretty solid. What is it that you think folks should focus on this selling season, is maybe something that you have visibility into now or maybe like a key performance indicator over the next couple of months, because I would imagine, as comps get easier and then tougher, volume will be all over the board. But what\u2019s your sense of kind of the health of the market, because in theory, you don\u2019t have more than, I don\u2019t know, 4% or 5% of the market, really fail any given point in time, but you guys are up quite a bit and low seasonal factor. So, just trying to tie out the strength today that probably isn\u2019t sustainable, understanding that comps kind of get wonky here? So, what are you guys seeing today that gives you some sense of the health of the business outside of the seasonal dynamic?\nAlbert Nahmad: Let me just remind you, and then I am going to turn the question over to Barry, that over the last 12 months, we are up double digits in equipment sales. The last 12 months. So, I should show you something in terms of continuity. And Barry?\nBarry Logan: Yes, Josh. Again good morning, well first, I think there is so much data floating around about the industry as a whole OEM data, shipment data. And of course, our focus is Watsco data. And if you do go back and look at last year in the summer time, really the second quarter and third quarter, things were choppy, but they were not volatile. I think same-store sales second quarter last year were down 6%, not 16%, not 26%, 6%. So yes, there is a comp that\u2019s kind of better as we approach this selling season, but not the volatility that I think most others in the industry are trying to tap dance about. So for us, again, our seasonality is really now through October. The Sun Belt, the sun is out at summer time. And of course, the technology, we have our partners, our OEM partners, who we have worked with over the last 6 months going into this season and beyond with kind of really a very aggressive stance on growth and share gain. There is some product launch going on that will be important as we get through this season and into next year also. So Josh, don\u2019t be too distracted by the amount of volatility that others have had when you look at Watsco going forward, because that volatility simply was not as great for us last year.\nPaul Johnston: So I have to add, Josh, if you know Watsco and I know you do, you know that we are a long time company also. So, while quarterly performance is important, our \u2013 we invest in our business with the distinct goal of continuing to separate ourselves from our competition over the long \u2013 over the long run. That\u2019s the thesis of all these technology investments we make and that\u2019s playing out. More customers are using more of our technologies. The customers that are using our technologies are growing faster, they are treating less, they are just better customers. And it\u2019s also \u2013 a byproduct of that is the M&A story. There is more M&A conversations that are spurred by the technology that we have and being able to leverage it in other businesses. So, I just want to \u2013 just the focus remains the long-term. It\u2019s not just a quarter-to-quarter business.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well said.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on that technology point, A.J., one of the things that\u2019s kind of gotten distributed out of that is you guys have been able to control inventory, perhaps a little bit better in recent years. I think broadly across the industry, inventories look a little high. What\u2019s your sense on either availability out there from the OEMs and kind of fill rates? And what maybe some of those high inventory levels that some of your competitors may have means for price realization if folks find themselves with a little extra on their hands this year?\nAlbert Nahmad: I think Paul would be best\u2026\nPaul Johnston: As you know, we have invested heavily in technology also internally. And we have invested millions in being able to analyze our inventory and make sure that our inventories are reaching the right spot at the right time with the demand that\u2019s being created out there. We work very closely with our OEMs to make sure that our inventories are in line with what our demand is. Yes, it\u2019s been a tough 12 months to 15 months so far working those through. But so far, our OEMs have worked very hard with us. As far as what the industry has for inventory, I think there has been a little increase in inventory among a lot of distributors out there. I think a little of that is more emotional than it is data struck. But I don\u2019t think the inventories in the field right now are really out of line with what the demand would be through most of the summer given that this is going to be a normal year, if it\u2019s a normal year.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it, okay. I appreciate the color on that. I will pass it on.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJeff Hammond: Hi, good morning. Good morning everybody. So just on the margins, really impressive on both SG&A and gross margins. And I know this \u2013 1Q and 4Q can sometimes be a little bit different given the seasonal light. But just walk me through what drove the big increase in gross margins? And how sustainable you think that is as you go into the selling season?\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: Sure, Jeff. Well, again, it\u2019s a progression. So the margin story, gross margin story, I think, started improving last spring and carrying through 12 months later. So again, I am going to tell 12 month stories, even though we are analyzing a quarter here, because I think these have all been progressions that have happened over periods of time to where we are. So, it is what we call selling margin, as we said in the script, selling margin meaning simply the market we make on pushing products through the channel. So, that\u2019s a blocking and tackling exercise. And throughout our marketplace by salespeople, we saw an increase in performance based pay this quarter, for example, which is sharing commissions and sharing some of that profitability with people that have earned it. That\u2019s part of the SG&A increase, which is a good thing. As far as the overall fixed cost structure, again, I use the word progression once again. We have seen fixed cost stay relatively neutral over the last 3 quarter to 4 quarters. This one is no different and it shows up in the incremental margin that was achieved this quarter. Again, for the last few quarters, very similar achievement.\nJeff Hammond: Okay, great. And then the non-equipment piece had spent a number of years kind of flattish to grow in low-single digits, and you have seen a couple of quarters of uptick. And just wondering what\u2019s driving that? And again, how sustainable you feel that is? Because it seems like a lot of \u2013 we are shifting a lot more to replace versus repair. And I didn\u2019t know how much is \u2013 you are still seeing a robust repair environment or is it parts associated with new construction, etcetera? Thanks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul?\nPaul Johnston: Yes. I have never figured out when we switch from repair to replacement back and forth. I think both of them have a dynamic to them that are not related to each other. We are replacing units as they break. But at the same time, there is another 100 million units out there that aren\u2019t being replaced that do need maintenance and repair. And so the part sales have started to pick up again. We have increased our focus, obviously, in those. And that\u2019s obviously helped us start growing that market again, too.\nAlbert Nahmad: A.J., do you want to add something to that?\nAaron Nahmad: I was going to say, that\u2019s the right word, Paul, focus. I mean, our leadership is very focused on parts and supplies sales now, and they are using data, and they are using our optimization tools around pricing and inventory and understanding customers\u2019 needs and getting the right product to the right place at the right time, the right price. So it\u2019s focus, which is, very proud to say, delivering some results.\nJeff Hammond: Okay. Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hi, good morning. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit more about consumer behavior, and maybe it was partially addressed in that repair versus replace. But it looks like mix is still shifting higher and maybe you could just provide a little bit of color on what you are seeing the consumer appetite to pay more for energy efficiency. And I wonder if, with all the price so that OEMs are pushing through the channel, on the flip side, do you see any kind of tension and the ability of the consumer to digest some of these price increases that are coming through?\nAlbert Nahmad: Excellent question. Barry or Paul, either one of you.\nBarry Logan: Give us some color, Jeff. Welcome back, by the way, Jeff. Well, first, I \u2013 the contractor is largely the player that is going into a home or now going through our technology into a home and saying, here is what I think you should do to the homeowner. And so that contractor\u2019s confidence, what they are able to close the job for, is very critical. And that drives a lot of other people\u2019s sales, including us and the OEMs. So that contractor focus, the customer facing technology that we talk about is where a lot of this conversation is heading, we think is the advocacy for high efficiency, the capability of the contractor to go ahead and recommend and install it and help his business as well. And so that\u2019s the first fundamental to understand about our technology. What we are seeing in the market also is almost one of the best credit environments we have ever seen. And when I say credit, I mean the credit we extend to contractors to go out and grow their business. We are seeing one of the very best metrics on past due receivables, write-offs, things like that, which no one ever ask about. But our credit profile with our customer right now is an all-time really performance level. And again, that goes to the confidence of the contractor that we think is going in and making these deals with homeowners and pulling through product, and we are helping them do it. So Paul, I know you had some color as well.\nPaul Johnston: Yes, I do. It\u2019s not just the high-efficiency that saves the contract or the consumer money on their electric bill or their heating bill, but it\u2019s also all the comfort attributes that you get from the high efficiency products. It\u2019s also the indoor air quality products that were associated with a lot of the high efficiency products. Those are also having a big play with the consumer right now. And we are hoping for 50 years of following this, that finally this is a market segment, which is going to continue to grow indoor air quality and indoor comfort.\nBarry Logan: I was going to add. And I don\u2019t \u2013 I think the OEM price question you have, whether those pricing actions influence ultimate outcomes, I don\u2019t think very much. If you think about what happens all the way through the channel with the profitability and pricing of an installed system, it really goes back to that contractor homeowner, I think, capability to get it done at that level.\nJeff Sprague: Yes. I was just going to ask as an add-on. You gave us the growth rate of above minimum standard. Could you share what percent of your revenues now or volumes are kind of above minimum zero level?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, Jeff, I appreciate the curiosity. It\u2019s not something we put out there, no.\nJeff Sprague: Right. I will leave it there. Thanks guys.\nAlbert Nahmad: It\u2019s the minority of the business, still. So that\u2019s the good news.\nAaron Nahmad: But I will add, just, I guess, I\u2019m the technology guy and Barry mentioned it earlier. When contractors use our OnCall Air platform to sell in the house, that dynamic flips, it\u2019s no longer the minority of the systems they sell are high-efficiency is the majority of systems they sell are high-efficiency when they use the tool, [Indiscernible] dynamic.\nJeff Sprague: Interesting. Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question is from David Manthey from Baird. Please go ahead. \nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, David.\nDavid Manthey: Hey, good morning everyone. Let\u2019s see. So from a contract or customer standpoint, could you tell us what number of customers you had at the end of the year 2020 versus year-end 2019?\nAlbert Nahmad: You want to know the number of customers we have?\nDavid Manthey: Yes.\nAlbert Nahmad: Is that what you say? Well, we publish those estimates in our publish we believe were we\u2019re doing business with about 90,000 contractor businesses, and that\u2019s grown, it hasn\u2019t declined.\nDavid Manthey: Okay.\nAlbert Nahmad: In the growing number\u2026\nDavid Manthey: On the \u2013 sorry. On the penetration of OnCall Air, what I\u2019m kind of getting at is, in terms of the uptake there, where do you stand today? And do you talk about retention rates of your customers and so forth. Could you tell us what kind of penetration you think you have with that technology today and where that compares to a year ago?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, certainly, not even close to where we want it to be. AJ, color?\nAaron Nahmad: I was going to say the same thing. It\u2019s not enough, but growth rates are almost triple digits. So it\u2019s just about getting it in front of more contractors, showing them the value of the tool. And when we do get them to a demo of the tool, they almost sell it, not almost always, but they sign up a lot of the times. So the conversion rates from a demo to using the tool is very high. And when they use the tool, it\u2019s a great win for them and a great win for us. But it\u2019s still very small numbers, relatively speaking.\nDavid Manthey: Could you at least tell us if it\u2019s a single or double digit number?\nAaron Nahmad: Of what? I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand. Of total of customers? As a percent [Speech overlap]\nDavid Manthey: As a percentage of total.\nAaron Nahmad: Yes, it\u2019s a single percent. Single digits.\nDavid Manthey: Good. Okay, great.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hey, David. They just helped you. I mean it\u2019s in the press release. About $105 million of business was driven on behalf of our contractor into the channel on his books, so to speak and that using our tool. And I think last year, it was over $300 million as a full year. Okay. It sounds like a lot, but it is a fraction of the overall installed market that we\u2019re servicing every day. So there is a lot of room ahead of us.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. And then finally on the TEC acquisition, how should we think about seasonality of that business? Should we be thinking sort of 30% in the second and third quarter and 20% first and fourth, ballpark?\nBarry Logan: Yes, I would say, 30%, second, third, fourth \u2013 sorry, second \u2013 30% each, second, third, fourth quarter and 10% first quarter.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Thanks a lot guys. \nAlbert Nahmad: Sure.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Please go ahead. \nAlbert Nahmad: Hi, good morning. \nRyan Merkel: Hey. Great quarter. Great to see.\nAlbert Nahmad: Thank you.\nRyan Merkel: So first off, tell us what you\u2019re seeing in the commercial market. Are you seeing kind of demand starting to come back here, Paul? \nPaul Johnston: Yes. We\u2019re starting to see \u2013 excuse me, a definite uptick in the commercial rooftop units. So will it be at the same magnitude we saw at the rush back on residential? We\u2019re not sure yet.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. Great. \nPaul Johnston: The federal government is pushing for retrofits and schools and things like that, that would impact the demand as well. They are creating or have created incentives to change HVAC systems to be reinstalled in schools. And I think eventually to even larger buildings and schools.\nAlbert Nahmad: Right. That\u2019s all part of the Biden\u2019s big plan for the infrastructure. We\u2019re seeing \u2013 there is a big block of money in there for school rehabilitation. And also we\u2019re seeing other legislations, right, in the moves to Congress where energy credits will go to commercial buildings for improving their energy efficiency also.\nRyan Merkel: Yes. I\u2019m pretty optimistic about what\u2019s coming with commercial. Okay. I was actually going to ask that question next, but you answered it. And I was also going to say that ESG trends and then a lot of population migration south again. So it seems to me HVAC industry is seeing some pretty long-tailed trends that could be helpful. And then on the TEC deal, was that also largely driven by the family wanting the technology? And then the second question would be, now that you\u2019ve planted a flag there, do you think you could close more deals up north? Is that how it works?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, those are two questions and since Barry Logan successfully succeeded with TEC, I\u2019ll let him answer that. When I say successfully, he was the point man for Watsco.\nBarry Logan: Thanks, Al. The first on TEC, it\u2019s been a 20-year relationship, not in the last 12 months. So we\u2019ve been building this and working on this for a long time, and it is a family business and as such, multi-generations of family as well as multi siblings of ownership. So I think they reached their own conclusion as a family of the right timing and the right desire to sell at a given time. And talking to us exclusively for all of this time is a great complement by them, from them. And technology is what really, I think, brought things into light. As you know, we bought the Philadelphia carrier distributor about 2 years ago. These guys are friends. They have been peers for 20, 30 years. The family has known each other for longer than that. And that was one [indiscernible] as primary reasons for selling as documented in our annual report last year. And [indiscernible] are good friends and shared notes and made my job easier in the last 12 months getting this done. And technology has a lot to do with why both companies, after 80 years, joined Watsco. So I think, as Jay said earlier, these kind of dynamics are not just these two. There is more to come, at least in terms of conversation and meaningful dialogue beyond just selling the business. It\u2019s joining the Watsco technology story. And then we\u2019ve asked Skip and his team to find other acquisition candidates in their markets, as part of their growth plan is to go out and use their own relationships in their local markets to grow, and that plan is set. And if you met Skip, which you\u2019re in Chicago also, I\u2019d be happy to introduce you to him. He\u2019d be a very big personality that really can\u2019t wait to help us grow and PUC grow as well. So it\u2019s a great acquisition.\nAlbert Nahmad: And I\u2019d like to add to that. Technology certainly is of interest in people that own businesses, but it\u2019s also the culture. We have a long track record of respecting the legacy of the companies that we buy. We don\u2019t change their names, we don\u2019t manage them. They manage it themselves. We\u2019re in the background. We provide financial support, technology support, whatever they call that they need. We\u2019re not about to even start to disassemble what they have already accomplished. Quite the contrary. We just wanted to go and get bigger and support it. That\u2019s a very big deal for people that have created great companies and don\u2019t want to see their legacy destroyed.\nBarry Logan: I was just going to add to the previous question on commercial, nobody does commercial better than TEC. And we are eager and excited. They will teach the rest of our business units a lot on that front. So that\u2019s a wonderful opportunity as well for the company.\nRyan Merkel: Appreciate it. Thanks. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nAlbert Nahmad: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Hi guys. Good morning.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning.\nSteve Tusa: The \u2013 could you just give us an idea of what commercial actually did in the quarter? You noted it was kind of stabilized and getting better. What was commercial actually in the quarter year-over-year, equipment?\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul?\nPaul Johnston: Well, yes, commercial as far as a variance, was basically flat. However, we\u2019re \u2013 a lot of that was influenced, obviously, by the larger applied type products not being flat. They are still suffering a little bit. But the unitary products are definitely showing growth, and we\u2019re starting to see some rebound on the VRF and some of the other products.\nSteve Tusa: On the VRF, okay, got it. Was the traditional commercial unitary stopped the rooftops up flat to down? Is that \u2013 was a lot of your growth driven there by VRF?\nPaul Johnston: No. Actually, unitary, it was up slightly.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. What is the \u2013 can you just give us an idea of kind of when the last OEM price increase that you see currently goes through? What kind of the rough dates of that currently is?\nPaul Johnston: June 1.\nSteve Tusa: June 1. Okay. Is that the vast majority of those guys?\nPaul Johnston: Yes, it is. Yes. They have all publicly announced. So yes, June 1, there is one in April and one in May.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And was there actual price realization for you guys in the quarter? And what was that?\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: Yes, there was a small amount of price in residential in the market. So you look at the 18% overall growth rate, a couple percent in price, the rest is units.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And then what is the supply status of the major OEMS? I mean, are they all back up and running? I know one or two had some supply issues last year. Are they backup and running yet? And do you expect them to be back in full force by the time the season really cranks up?\nAlbert Nahmad: Go ahead, answer that Paul.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. Okay. Yes. They all have had glitches with \u2013 during this entire period. But I would say right now, they are probably in the best shape that they have ever been. We still have some things that are \u2013 we\u2019re not out of stock, but some things we have to work harder to obtain. But there \u2013 it\u2019s becoming a little bit more normalized now.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. And then one last one for you, what were your sales into housing, like to \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you kind of differentiate that between builders and those bigger housing customers. Can you differentiate between those two at all?\nAlbert Nahmad: We really don\u2019t differentiate too much of that. It\u2019s not a great percentage of the business. \nSteve Tusa: Yes, okay.\nAlbert Nahmad: That hasn\u2019t grown that much.\nSteve Tusa: Sorry, Barry, one more follow-up there. What was pricing last year for you guys?\nBarry Logan: It was very very negligible, Steve, last year.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, got it.\nBarry Logan: As the year wound up, it was almost no price in terms of the residential equipment business.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And I would assume you still have some kind of \u2013 I guess, we\u2019re just trying to still parse out the strong selling margin. I mean, was any of that due to kind of \u2013 I mean, price cost is the wrong way to put it for you guys because you basically pay for the units, that is your cost. But was any of that due to kind of inventory dynamics, stuff you had on hand before all these price increases are going through? Like should we assume the gross margin stays this way? Or is it going to kind of narrow over the course of the year?\nBarry Logan: It\u2019s one of our major focuses, again, is being able to maintain and grow our gross profit. So we\u2019ve got a lot of initiatives in place to make sure that we can continue our growth in gross margin. That\u2019s our plan.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, great. Thanks for the color guys. I really appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Dankert from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.\nChris Dankert: Hey, good morning everybody. I guess thinking about the tools you\u2019ve been talking about here, is the real focus on developing new technology tools or is the opportunity really more deepening penetration at this point? I\u2019m just trying to think about where the incremental investment dollar goes? Is it really more on continuing to build out that tech team or is it more about the actual rollout at this point?\nAlbert Nahmad: Good question. AJ?\nAaron Nahmad: It\u2019s both. It\u2019s absolutely both. We \u2013 I think we\u2019ve built some fantastic platforms and that customers of ours that are using them are enjoying great success for themselves and they make them better customers for us. We are developing additional feature and functionality on those platforms. And we are constantly assessing and trying and experimenting with new things that might also be good for our customers in our business. So it\u2019s just who we are now. It sounds clich\u00e9 now, maybe in 2021, but we\u2019d like to think of ourselves as a technology company that just happens to sell HVAC. And so it\u2019s not going to stop. We\u2019re just constantly looking at and trying new things. And when we say technology, that\u2019s really an umbrella term, we need people, process, technology and modernization and experimentation and innovation. Technology\u2019s a catch all for continuous improvement.\nChris Dankert: Got it. Got it. Thanks. And then sorry to bring it back to this, Barry, but I think you kind of teased new product introduction later in the year. Anything you can give us on that? Are you talking about tools you guys are introducing or is this from your suppliers, new products that are being rolled out?\nBarry Logan: Well, I shouldn\u2019t tease because I don\u2019t want to show my hand as far as I know.\nChris Dankert: No, we\u2019re going to try and keep you out in the future here, I guess.\nBarry Logan: That\u2019s right. No, part of any OEM relationship is to sign either segments or products or features or benefits to launch into the market and gain share. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. And so we\u2019re going to keep it quiet. But when we say product, it really is going out and addressing segments and markets or price points where we feel there is market share opportunity and we\u2019ve got some very aggressive partners that are helping us do that.\nChris Dankert: Got it. Well, can\u2019t blame a guy for trying. Thanks so much guys and good luck here.\nOperator: There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Once again, thanks for your interest in our company. We are, as AJ Nahmad has said, always focused on long-term, and we hope your interest will continue for the long-term. So we will see u the next quarter. Bye-bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Albert Nahmad",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Watsco's first quarter earnings call. And this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. And with me is A.J. Nahmad, who is the President; and our two Executive Vice Presidents, Paul Johnston and Barry Logan. Before we start, our usual cautionary statement. The conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws or regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. On to our financial report, Watsco achieved record first quarter results. Earnings per share grew 93% to a record $1.39 per share. Records were set for sales, gross profits, gross margin, operating income, operating margin, net income and earnings per share. Now, these results were driven by strong sales growth made at higher selling margins along with improved operating efficiencies. When we look at our product offering, we achieved double-digit sales growth in equipment, non-equipment and commercial refrigeration. And in terms of geography, growth rates during the quarter were similar for U.S. markets and international markets as a whole. For HVAC equipment, residential sales increased 18% and commercial equipment sales stabilized and are now trending more positively. But more important, this is not just about one quarter. Over the last 12 months, residential equipment sales in our U.S. markets have increased 15% and we believe meaningful market share gains have been achieved. Looking forward, we expect business to be strong and that 2021 will be another record year of performance for our company. Adding more color, Watsco's industry leading technology continues to gain adoption. That leads to new customer acquisition and we believe development of greater market share. Now a few important trends are also continuing. Active technology users continue to outpace growth rates of non-users. Customer attrition among active technology users is meaningfully lower compared to non-users and our platforms used by contractors to make sales to homeowners gain more users. That in turn doubled the number of at-home sales presentations and increased sales volumes that flow through our platforms called OnCall Air and CreditForComfort. We are happy with our progress, but we believe it is still early in terms of reaching the full potential of our technology investments. We, once again, invite you to schedule a Zoom call with us and we can further explain that technology and its impact. Moving along financially, our balance sheet remains in pristine condition with only a small amount of debt. We are excited to have closed 2 weeks ago on the acquisition of Temperature Equipment Corporation, also known as TEC. This is a long established, generationally owned company headquartered in Chicago. TEC adds 32 locations and approximately $300 million in revenue and establishes Watsco's first major presence in the Midwest United States. I must say that TEC is a great company with a long and proud history. They are led by wonderful team of entrepreneurs and we are honored to be part of their family. They are also off to a strong start this year and we expect their results to be accretive to 2021 results. We continue to look for other transactions with great businesses like TEC. While doing our search, we offer our well-known culture that is to say again, when we search, we offer our well-known culture that respects and continues a company's distinct legacy and we support their plans for growth. We think that Watsco is a great next step for family-owned companies in our industry. Lastly, a reminder that we raised our dividends by 10% in April 2021 to $7.80 a follow-up to the record cash flow achieved in 2020. We believe our dividend is a good reason to in Watsco over the long-term. 2021 marks our 47th consecutive year of paying dividends, and we have increased our dividends in 19 years of the last 20 years from $0.10 per share in \u201820 \u2013 in the year 2000. Let me say that again, from $0.10 per share in \u201820 \u2013 in the year 2000 to today's annual rate of $7.80. Now with all \u2013 with that, Al, Paul, A.J., Paul, Barry and I are happy to answer your questions. Hi Josh. Let me just remind you, and then I am going to turn the question over to Barry, that over the last 12 months, we are up double digits in equipment sales. The last 12 months. So, I should show you something in terms of continuity. And Barry? Well said. I think Paul would be best... Barry? Paul? A.J., do you want to add something to that? Good morning Jeff. Excellent question. Barry or Paul, either one of you. Well, Jeff, I appreciate the curiosity. It's not something we put out there, no. It's the minority of the business, still. So that's the good news. Good morning, David. You want to know the number of customers we have? Is that what you say? Well, we publish those estimates in our publish we believe were we're doing business with about 90,000 contractor businesses, and that's grown, it hasn't declined. In the growing number... Well, certainly, not even close to where we want it to be. AJ, color? Hey, David. They just helped you. I mean it's in the press release. About $105 million of business was driven on behalf of our contractor into the channel on his books, so to speak and that using our tool. And I think last year, it was over $300 million as a full year. Okay. It sounds like a lot, but it is a fraction of the overall installed market that we're servicing every day. So there is a lot of room ahead of us. Sure. Hi, good morning. Thank you. Right. That's all part of the Biden's big plan for the infrastructure. We're seeing \u2013 there is a big block of money in there for school rehabilitation. And also we're seeing other legislations, right, in the moves to Congress where energy credits will go to commercial buildings for improving their energy efficiency also. Well, those are two questions and since Barry Logan successfully succeeded with TEC, I'll let him answer that. When I say successfully, he was the point man for Watsco. And I'd like to add to that. Technology certainly is of interest in people that own businesses, but it's also the culture. We have a long track record of respecting the legacy of the companies that we buy. We don't change their names, we don't manage them. They manage it themselves. We're in the background. We provide financial support, technology support, whatever they call that they need. We're not about to even start to disassemble what they have already accomplished. Quite the contrary. We just wanted to go and get bigger and support it. That's a very big deal for people that have created great companies and don't want to see their legacy destroyed. Hi, Steve. Good morning. Paul? Barry? Go ahead, answer that Paul. We really don't differentiate too much of that. It's not a great percentage of the business. That hasn't grown that much. Good question. AJ? Once again, thanks for your interest in our company. We are, as AJ Nahmad has said, always focused on long-term, and we hope your interest will continue for the long-term. So we will see u the next quarter. Bye-bye."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "Yes, Josh. Again good morning, well first, I think there is so much data floating around about the industry as a whole OEM data, shipment data. And of course, our focus is Watsco data. And if you do go back and look at last year in the summer time, really the second quarter and third quarter, things were choppy, but they were not volatile. I think same-store sales second quarter last year were down 6%, not 16%, not 26%, 6%. So yes, there is a comp that's kind of better as we approach this selling season, but not the volatility that I think most others in the industry are trying to tap dance about. So for us, again, our seasonality is really now through October. The Sun Belt, the sun is out at summer time. And of course, the technology, we have our partners, our OEM partners, who we have worked with over the last 6 months going into this season and beyond with kind of really a very aggressive stance on growth and share gain. There is some product launch going on that will be important as we get through this season and into next year also. So Josh, don't be too distracted by the amount of volatility that others have had when you look at Watsco going forward, because that volatility simply was not as great for us last year. Sure, Jeff. Well, again, it's a progression. So the margin story, gross margin story, I think, started improving last spring and carrying through 12 months later. So again, I am going to tell 12 month stories, even though we are analyzing a quarter here, because I think these have all been progressions that have happened over periods of time to where we are. So, it is what we call selling margin, as we said in the script, selling margin meaning simply the market we make on pushing products through the channel. So, that's a blocking and tackling exercise. And throughout our marketplace by salespeople, we saw an increase in performance based pay this quarter, for example, which is sharing commissions and sharing some of that profitability with people that have earned it. That's part of the SG&A increase, which is a good thing. As far as the overall fixed cost structure, again, I use the word progression once again. We have seen fixed cost stay relatively neutral over the last 3 quarter to 4 quarters. This one is no different and it shows up in the incremental margin that was achieved this quarter. Again, for the last few quarters, very similar achievement. Give us some color, Jeff. Welcome back, by the way, Jeff. Well, first, I \u2013 the contractor is largely the player that is going into a home or now going through our technology into a home and saying, here is what I think you should do to the homeowner. And so that contractor's confidence, what they are able to close the job for, is very critical. And that drives a lot of other people's sales, including us and the OEMs. So that contractor focus, the customer facing technology that we talk about is where a lot of this conversation is heading, we think is the advocacy for high efficiency, the capability of the contractor to go ahead and recommend and install it and help his business as well. And so that's the first fundamental to understand about our technology. What we are seeing in the market also is almost one of the best credit environments we have ever seen. And when I say credit, I mean the credit we extend to contractors to go out and grow their business. We are seeing one of the very best metrics on past due receivables, write-offs, things like that, which no one ever ask about. But our credit profile with our customer right now is an all-time really performance level. And again, that goes to the confidence of the contractor that we think is going in and making these deals with homeowners and pulling through product, and we are helping them do it. So Paul, I know you had some color as well. I was going to add. And I don't \u2013 I think the OEM price question you have, whether those pricing actions influence ultimate outcomes, I don't think very much. If you think about what happens all the way through the channel with the profitability and pricing of an installed system, it really goes back to that contractor homeowner, I think, capability to get it done at that level. Yes, I would say, 30%, second, third, fourth \u2013 sorry, second \u2013 30% each, second, third, fourth quarter and 10% first quarter. Thanks, Al. The first on TEC, it's been a 20-year relationship, not in the last 12 months. So we've been building this and working on this for a long time, and it is a family business and as such, multi-generations of family as well as multi siblings of ownership. So I think they reached their own conclusion as a family of the right timing and the right desire to sell at a given time. And talking to us exclusively for all of this time is a great complement by them, from them. And technology is what really, I think, brought things into light. As you know, we bought the Philadelphia carrier distributor about 2 years ago. These guys are friends. They have been peers for 20, 30 years. The family has known each other for longer than that.

So it's a great acquisition. I was just going to add to the previous question on commercial, nobody does commercial better than TEC. And we are eager and excited. They will teach the rest of our business units a lot on that front. So that's a wonderful opportunity as well for the company. Yes, there was a small amount of price in residential in the market. So you look at the 18% overall growth rate, a couple percent in price, the rest is units. It was very very negligible, Steve, last year. As the year wound up, it was almost no price in terms of the residential equipment business. It's one of our major focuses, again, is being able to maintain and grow our gross profit. So we've got a lot of initiatives in place to make sure that we can continue our growth in gross margin. That's our plan.

            "content": "So I have to add, Josh, if you know Watsco and I know you do, you know that we are a long time company also. So, while quarterly performance is important, our \u2013 we invest in our business with the distinct goal of continuing to separate ourselves from our competition over the long \u2013 over the long run. That's the thesis of all these technology investments we make and that's playing out. More customers are using more of our technologies. The customers that are using our technologies are growing faster, they are treating less, they are just better customers. And it's also \u2013 a byproduct of that is the M&A story. There is more M&A conversations that are spurred by the technology that we have and being able to leverage it in other businesses. So, I just want to \u2013 just the focus remains the long-term. It's not just a quarter-to-quarter business. As you know, we have invested heavily in technology also internally. And we have invested millions in being able to analyze our inventory and make sure that our inventories are reaching the right spot at the right time with the demand that's being created out there. We work very closely with our OEMs to make sure that our inventories are in line with what our demand is. Yes, it's been a tough 12 months to 15 months so far working those through. But so far, our OEMs have worked very hard with us. As far as what the industry has for inventory, I think there has been a little increase in inventory among a lot of distributors out there. I think a little of that is more emotional than it is data struck. But I don't think the inventories in the field right now are really out of line with what the demand would be through most of the summer given that this is going to be a normal year, if it's a normal year. Yes. I have never figured out when we switch from repair to replacement back and forth. I think both of them have a dynamic to them that are not related to each other. We are replacing units as they break. But at the same time, there is another 100 million units out there that aren't being replaced that do need maintenance and repair. And so the part sales have started to pick up again. We have increased our focus, obviously, in those. And that's obviously helped us start growing that market again, too. Yes, I do. It's not just the high-efficiency that saves the contract or the consumer money on their electric bill or their heating bill, but it's also all the comfort attributes that you get from the high efficiency products. It's also the indoor air quality products that were associated with a lot of the high efficiency products. Those are also having a big play with the consumer right now. And we are hoping for 50 years of following this, that finally this is a market segment, which is going to continue to grow indoor air quality and indoor comfort. Yes. We're starting to see \u2013 excuse me, a definite uptick in the commercial rooftop units. So will it be at the same magnitude we saw at the rush back on residential? We're not sure yet. The federal government is pushing for retrofits and schools and things like that, that would impact the demand as well. They are creating or have created incentives to change HVAC systems to be reinstalled in schools. And I think eventually to even larger buildings and schools. Well, yes, commercial as far as a variance, was basically flat. However, we're \u2013 a lot of that was influenced, obviously, by the larger applied type products not being flat. They are still suffering a little bit. But the unitary products are definitely showing growth, and we're starting to see some rebound on the VRF and some of the other products. No. Actually, unitary, it was up slightly. June 1. Yes, it is. Yes. They have all publicly announced. So yes, June 1, there is one in April and one in May. Yes. Okay. Yes. They all have had glitches with \u2013 during this entire period. But I would say right now, they are probably in the best shape that they have ever been.

            "content": "I was going to say, that's the right word, Paul, focus. I mean, our leadership is very focused on parts and supplies sales now, and they are using data, and they are using our optimization tools around pricing and inventory and understanding customers' needs and getting the right product to the right place at the right time, the right price. So it's focus, which is, very proud to say, delivering some results. But I will add, just, I guess, I'm the technology guy and Barry mentioned it earlier. When contractors use our OnCall Air platform to sell in the house, that dynamic flips, it's no longer the minority of the systems they sell are high-efficiency is the majority of systems they sell are high-efficiency when they use the tool, [Indiscernible] dynamic. I was going to say the same thing. It's not enough, but growth rates are almost triple digits. So it's just about getting it in front of more contractors, showing them the value of the tool. And when we do get them to a demo of the tool, they almost sell it, not almost always, but they sign up a lot of the times. So the conversion rates from a demo to using the tool is very high. And when they use the tool, it's a great win for them and a great win for us. But it's still very small numbers, relatively speaking. Of what? I'm sorry, I don't understand. Of total of customers? As a percent [Speech overlap] Yes, it's a single percent. Single digits. It's both. It's absolutely both. We \u2013 I think we've built some fantastic platforms and that customers of ours that are using them are enjoying great success for themselves and they make them better customers for us. We are developing additional feature and functionality on those platforms. And we are constantly assessing and trying and experimenting with new things that might also be good for our customers in our business. So it's just who we are now. It sounds cliche\u0301 now, maybe in 2021, but we'd like to think of ourselves as a technology company that just happens to sell HVAC. And so it's not going to stop. We're just constantly looking at and trying new things. And when we say technology, that's really an umbrella term, we need people, process, technology and modernization and experimentation and innovation. Technology's a catch all for continuous improvement."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there\u2019ll be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Albert Nahmad, CEO and Chairman. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, everyone. I do hope everyone is healthy and not struck by the virus. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. And this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO; and with me is A.J. Nahmad, President of Watsco; and Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Before we start, here is our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws, ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statement. Now, Watsco delivered an exceptional quarter to close out a fantastic year. We are especially pleased, because in the fourth quarter of last year, I should say the prior year, sales were up 21% and earnings per share were up 77%. So the results we are reporting today were against that performance in the fourth quarter of the prior year. So how did we do on the fourth quarter of this prior year of 2022? Well, sales grew 5% to a record $1.6 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 14% to $141 million. EBIT margins expanded 80 basis points to a record 8.9%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to a record $2.35. Now, we\u2019re going to explain what the adjustment as we go through here. So, remember, this fourth quarter results were running against the prior year, where sales were up 21% and earnings per share was up 77%. So we think we did well. Now for the full year, sales grew 16% to a record $7.3 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 33% to $835 million. EBIT margins expanded 150 basis points to a record 11.5%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to a record $14.20. Now, let me clarify what the adjustment means. These figures \u2013 the adjusted figures including $49 million, I should say, once again, the adjusted figures exclude a $49 million net tax benefit from vesting of restricted shares, which added $1.20 earnings per share for the quarter and $1.21 earnings per share for the year. Those were excluded in the numbers that I just gave you. And very important, we generated a record cash flow of $572 million doing 2023 and ended the year with a strong balance sheet and virtually no debt, I like having a very little debt, if any at all. Our financial strength gives us the ability to invest in most any opportunity as we continue to build scale in a very fragmented $50 billion North American distributor market. And we continue to look for acquisitions as Watsco is a great home for family businesses, and why is that? Well, because we sustain cultures, we invest in people and we provide technology to secure and build on their great legacies. Our focus is always on long-term, which makes us different than other acquires in the industry. We have challenged our leadership team to develop aggressive growth plans, utilizing our scale, product diversity, and technology leadership and build upon our growing market share position. To that end, we are working collaboratively with our OEM partners to develop forward-looking growth initiatives, particularly in light of the various regulatory and positive industry catalysts that lie ahead and there\u2019s some good ones. This quarter results also reflect continued progress on two key areas of focus, and those are sustaining gross margins and improving operating efficiencies. There\u2019s more to do on both, but we are encouraged by our progress and our intent and achieving more operating efficiencies across our network. This morning\u2019s press release provides important concepts and details that support Watsco\u2019s long-term growth trajectory. Some of them are, we have an immense technology advantage, and we are investing to grow that advantage. These technologies are increasing customer\u2019s engagement, reducing attrition and creating sustainable market share gains. In addition, Watsco\u2019s broad array of products and brands is a competitive advantage and allows us to serve contractors in any environment. We also have a leading market share position in Sunbelt markets, proving stability and higher growth over time. Regarding those Sunbelt markets, a lot of people seem to be immigrating to the Sunbelt markets in recent times, and that works in our favor since we\u2019re the leader in those markets. In addition, there are several important regulatory and industry catalysts for growth that will play out in the next few years. 2023 saw the introduction of high efficiency standard for HVAC equipment, which will provide a pricing opportunity for us as well, and this is very important, as well as energy saving opportunities for homeowners and businesses in 2023 and beyond. And then in 2025, we\u2019ll also market introduction of new refrigerant standards, which historically made it harder to repair existing systems and drive customers to new equipment. We also see continued movement towards electrification and greater adoption of heat pumps, which generally come at a higher price and higher margins. Sales of heat pumps grew 25% in 2022, I should say, our sales of heat pumps grew 25% in 2022 and 21% during the fourth quarter, outpacing overall growth rates. Finally, the new Inflation Reduction Act provides enhanced tax credits and incentives for efficiency upgrades and electrification. All of these catalysts will benefit the industry in the years ahead. And we certainly believe that our scale, technology and financial strength position us to capture these new market opportunities. Finally, we always concern about our balance sheet, so that we are in a position of financial strength. Today\u2019s balance sheet remains in pristine condition to invest in any size growth opportunity in the coming years. Lastly, before turning to Q&A, I would like to thank more than 7,000 employees of Watsco across our market for their service and commitment to customers. They have done an extraordinary job to serve our customers and generate historic performance as you\u2019ll see today. With that, let\u2019s go on to Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc. You may now go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Tommy.\nTommy Moll: Good morning, Al. So, I think, it\u2019s 2 quarters in a row you\u2019ve made a point to mention operational efficiencies on this call. And I was hoping you could give us a little more insight into what initiatives you have underway there and is the bottom line that SG&A will grow no faster than revenue and unlikely slower than revenue, even if volumes in the industry are pressured this year?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, we certainly \u2013 that\u2019s our goal is to constantly improve our profitability, and our revenues without significantly increasing SG&A. But let\u2019s get a little bit more color for you. Barry?\nBarry Logan: Yeah, Tommy, I would say \u2013 good morning, Tommy. I would say that first, there\u2019s obviously in any distribution model, a variable component to what we\u2019re spending on SG&A. And the variable components were probably the most volatile during the last couple of years when freight and overtime and even just the daily life of a branch manager and 10, 15 people on a branch was tested through all the disruption, everything that went on the last 2 years. So those variable costs, we definitely saw an improvement and reductions in the fourth quarter. And again, that would be, I would say, a foreshadowing for what we\u2019re looking for going forward is some of the variable costs and inefficiency, becoming opportunities to create efficiency this year and 2023. Obviously, we also have fixed costs, which is probably a half or so of our SG&A spend. And there it is inflation, there\u2019s been inflation over the last 12 months like every other fixed cost of every other business. So it\u2019s not that simple to simply reduced cost across the entire portfolio. For the variable costs we\u2019re seeing already and the fixed costs with more moderate inflation, I would expect to see some improvement. So net-net, I\u2019ll set at the goal is to have much more moderate SG&A spend versus revenue growth, and there\u2019s not a leader, a branch manager, a reasonable person in Watsco, that isn\u2019t focused on it.\nPaul Johnston: This is Paul. I can also add, we talked about technology for our customers and how it enhances their experience and provides them with a more efficient model to do business with Watsco. But also those same technologies work within Watsco to improve our efficiencies. We\u2019ve got, I think, world class inventory management systems, world class data management systems to be able to track and know what, where we\u2019re not efficient and where we\u2019re not \u2013 and where we are efficient. And I think our people have spent the last 4 or 5 years learning how to use these tools. And I think they\u2019re going to come into play now as we reach a more normal, if you will, business environment out there.\nTommy Moll: Appreciate the insight, and wanted to follow-up on a different topic on inventories. Even\u2026\nAlbert Nahmad: It\u2019s always a good topic by the way with inflation in the last couple of years. Yeah, go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Well, that\u2019s where I was going, Al. Even if your revenue was up this year, is it more likely than not that inventory dollars on your balance sheet will be lower by year end? And how much does supply chain have to improve to make that happen? Or is this more within your own control at this point?\nAlbert Nahmad: I\u2019ll hand it over to our financial people.\nBarry Logan: Yeah. Again, there\u2019s two pieces or probably 25 pieces to the answer, by the way, but I\u2019ll give you the two big ones. First is, lead times. Lead times have been tested with the last 2 years. Lead times is what determines what we order and what we carry and just what our inventory levels are. And to the extent they\u2019re either disrupted or uncertain, and we need to hedge in terms of what we keep in branches. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done in the last couple of years. So to the extent that over the next 12 months lead times become more dependable and less than there is the opportunity and would be the consequence of lowering inventory. Whether it\u2019s lower than it is today in absolute dollars, there\u2019s other factors involved. But we would expect lead times to shorten, and confidence to strengthen and lead to lower inventory levels over time. The second, today, it\u2019s hard to see it on a piece of paper, but our branches in the last 90 days have gone through the biggest inventory conversion from old product to new product that they\u2019ve experienced in their careers, it\u2019s still going and trickling into the first quarter as well. So in many respects, inventory is not business as usual also because of the product transition. And over the next 12 months, as that works itself through, I would expect that to help inventory levels, meaning reduce inventory levels. And we\u2019re kind of looking forward to the greater simplicity than we\u2019ve been experiencing the last couple of years.\nPaul Johnston: Correct. A little bit what Barry\u2019s saying there, you consider what we did with going from what we call the M inventory, which is what we sold last year to the new M1 inventory. Basically, we have to do a transition where we\u2019re replacing all of that inventory, because in most of our Sunbelt markets, the old M inventory would not be available to sell. So for us, it was a complete refresh of all of that inventory. And also adding to Barry\u2019s point, as we move into the new inventory, we\u2019re going to have a reduction in the number of SKUs that we have to handle on the equipment side, which we think will result in better efficiencies and higher turnovers in the inventory.\nTommy Moll: Appreciate the insight, and I\u2019ll turn it back.\nAlbert Nahmad: So all of that work on the inventory, obviously, it leads to better cash flow as well. We\u2019re very aware of that. The better we manage the inventory. And you\u2019ve just started all the forces that are being we\u2019re presently dealing with better the cash flow, so we expect to pay off in cash flow as well.\nTommy Moll: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hi, Dave.\nDavid Manthey: Hey, Al. Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you could talk about gross margin based on the mix of business and your current outlook is the annual gross margin floor still looking like it\u2019s approximately 27%.\nAlbert Nahmad: Mr. Logon?\nBarry Logan: The \u2013 again, Dave, good morning. Well, first, the most simple component of gross margin percent is the markup we sustain on selling products. And what is our markup and we call that selling margin. It\u2019s the simplest, most important analysis and that\u2019s what increased this quarter. And it\u2019s satisfying, because again there\u2019s a lot going on in the market, a lot of product changes, a lot of conversions, a lot of noise. And our teams did a great job of sustaining margin. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that\u2019s changed in our \u2013 either our thought process or analysis or what our business leaders are telling us in margin looking forward in 2023. And you\u2019ve heard 27% as a target. Our entrepreneurial CEO would tell you it\u2019s an interim target, because we have greater expectations than that. And, but I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s changed either in the mix of your thought process, Dave, of what the target is.\nDavid Manthey: Yeah. Good to hear. And then seconds is somewhat of a random question. But for future reference approximately what are you getting these days for a pound of R-410A refrigerant and what percentage of your sales is replacement refrigerant right now?\nBarry Logan: What do we get, it\u2019s around $25, $26 per pound of 410A, and that varies by region.\nAlbert Nahmad: [For a jug] [ph].\nBarry Logan: No, that\u2019s pound.\nAlbert Nahmad: That\u2019s pound. Okay.\nBarry Logan: And that varies by region, and it\u2019s a very small percentage of our total sales.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah. Yeah.\nDavid Manthey: All right. Appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nAlbert Nahmad: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprague: Hey, good morning, everyone. Hope you\u2019re doing well. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to come back to inventory also just for maybe a little bit more granularity if we get. Is the, I\u2019ll call it, disruption maybe you guys call it the internal fire drill. But from the transition from old to new, is product geographically where it needs to be? Is there stuff stranded now in the South that you can\u2019t sell that needs to move? Is there any particular noise that we should think about particularly in the first quarter here?\nAaron Nahmad: Well, that\u2019s a very good question. And we were very aware of what happened by year end. And so the answer is, we took care of that very, very well. There\u2019s no exposure to that, or no significant exposure. And whatever there was, we just dipped our northern branches, but it was very small.\nBarry Logan: That kind of makes Watsco unique, because we\u2019re a national North, South, East, West company, nothing is ever stranded. Because, as Al indicated, we\u2019ve got a large business that we do in the northern tier of the U.S. plus Canada, where we were able to move, very little inventory actually, but we didn\u2019t move the inventory to make sure it\u2019s available to sell.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah, we are very aware of this. So we were the inventory down in Southern states.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you for that. And can you just help us frame up kind of the volume next dynamics in the quarter volume price mix, I mean, obviously, you were selling old units, but you\u2019re also selling new stuff, we got multiple OEM price increases out there, plus your markup, just a little bit of help on how the quarter really played out.\nAlbert Nahmad: That\u2019s why they pay us the big bucks to figure all that out.\nJeffrey Sprague: But they pay us the smaller bucks to figure out what it was?\nBarry Logan: By the way, I would say that just to give some editorial on it, I think, the idea of selling out of the M product in the Sunbelt markets, and the gaining of the replacement inventory of M1, there was probably actually a gap there, as opposed to meaning that there\u2019s almost probably some branches and so on did not have the new stock to sell as they sold out of the old stock. So that transition was probably slightly negative to unit in the fourth quarter just to give you some color. So don\u2019t \u2013 I think the OEMs are still playing catch up on getting the M1 product everywhere it needs to be as opposed to being ahead of where it would have been. So\u2026\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah, some of the OEMs are doing better than others. So it\u2019s pretty good. Our supply chain in that respect.\nBarry Logan: To give you the answer, you can see the \u2013 we said U.S. products are up 4% in the quarter, if I gave you the units, units were down 8%, which would mean prices up 12%. In that 12% price is, again, fixed line items that would add up to 12%, not so much inflation, some inflation. But the heat pump growth obviously is a big component of that growth rate, because we\u2019re selling at higher unit prices there. And some inflation, that would give you the mix stuff.\nJeffrey Sprague: Terrific. I appreciate it.\nAlbert Nahmad: And don\u2019t ever forget that in the fourth quarter, and even the first quarter drawing inferences and what\u2019s a much smaller quarter than the others is, give it the weight that deserves given the size of the quarter.\nJeffrey Sprague: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ryan Merkel was William Blair. You may now go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Merkel: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start off with the question on price mix and the impact in 2023. I think, there\u2019s a little debate about what price mix could be given the sheer change. So any help give us there would be appreciated.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah, I would say by the way, I\u2019m turning it over to somebody knows more about this than I do. But also the mix change or product is affecting our margins. It\u2019s very significant part of what\u2019s going on, people start buying or have been buying more heat pumps that improves our margins just by that fact, because some of these products are at a higher margin than other products. So it\u2019s also a mix of products. But, Paul, go ahead, or Barry, whoever wants to take that.\nPaul Johnston: That\u2019s a very complex question, Ryan. Obviously, we\u2019ve indicated twice that the heat pumps help, they give us a better mix of heat pumps obviously give us a better price dynamic and more profit dollars. And when you get into some of the other products that we sell, like, we haven\u2019t mentioned it yet, but the duct free split market, has continued to grow at double-digits for us meddling in the quarter, but also on a year-to-date basis even more. So those also come with a higher margin to them, and that market has continued to escalate with new products. And as well as we\u2019re starting to see hybrid units that are getting into the ducted side. And without getting too far into the wheeze [ph] on that, we\u2019re starting to see a lot of crossover between the duct free products becoming ducted and becoming more functional, and that obviously has higher gross margins and better profits.\nAlbert Nahmad: The products also have a wonderful benefit for the end user. Explain that, Paul?\nPaul Johnston: Yeah, the products that we sell are well above the minimums under old SEER terminology, they were in the 18 to 24 SEER range, versus we consider 16, 17 SEER on the ducted product to be very high efficiency. So the consumer is saving money getting a great product. And we\u2019re seeing more and more on entrees into that marketplace from all of our OEMs.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Yeah, I appreciate that. Go ahead, Barry.\nBarry Logan: Yeah, just to add a \u2013 just a reminder on the M1 product, obviously, the OEMs needed to capture a higher selling price in the market. And I don\u2019t think anything has changed from what we\u2019re seeing in terms of price capture in 2023 on the new products and depends on which OEM and which conversation, but there are some March 1 or some March price increases also flowing from the OEMs in March. How much of that sticks into the market, time will tell, but there is a \u2013 obviously, some inflation to be captured this year, which is part of what the OEMs are feeling in terms of their pressure.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. So I was sort of thinking price mix next year to be mid-single-digit to high-single-digits given all the moving pieces, I mean, it\u2019s at least in the range?\nBarry Logan: I hate the comments specifically, Ryan, on a range, I would say what you\u2019ve seen the last 6 months from Watsco in terms of price does not include a lot of inflation, and includes a lot of price capture and mix. And so, I think there\u2019s still a big dependency on the contractor going into someone\u2019s home and selling these products and capturing their price. And so time will tell, but I think, obviously, we expect pretty strong pricing environment this year.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I hasten to add that these are not just price increases for the hell of it. The innovation of cooling and heating that\u2019s going on now is magnificent for the people that use HVAC. I mean, they\u2019re getting the savings of going to a heat pump, because the heat pump cools and heat, they don\u2019t need a cooler add the furnace. That\u2019s a wonderful use of it. The federal government\u2019s discovered that. So they\u2019re providing already and we\u2019ll provide more incentives for businesses and homes to use the heat pump, everybody wins on that. The consumer saves more and there are less emissions from it. So, I always like to think a little further out, I don\u2019t see anything that isn\u2019t positive, given that heating and cooling is 50% of homeowners cost of electricity. And all these innovations are focused on helping that consumer save money as well as benefits from more efficiency in the unit itself, which is how he saves money. So, I just think the industry is on a roll here now, because of the concern about emissions and the concern about the refrigerants damaging the environment. And there\u2019s a movement by the guys that make the stuff to innovate. And more they innovate, the more we enjoy providing great products to the contractor, who in turn provides it to the homeowner or the business owner. It\u2019s just a lot of good stuff going on.\nRyan Merkel: All right. I agree. Thanks, Al.\nAlbert Nahmad: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may now go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: So \u2013 good morning. So you mentioned the ductless split systems as growing double digits, it just strikes me that this is the byproduct for this time, given the efficiency, the price points, and it feels like the IRA is almost being written for the system. So do you think that 2023-2024 is going to be a real breakout for these units? And it sounds like it\u2019s a lower price point, lower revenue mix, but better margin? Is that the way to think about it?\nBarry Logan: Actually, it\u2019s \u2013 for the last 20 years, it\u2019s been growing and growing. And, I think, the \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a breakout period for it. You have to remember that there\u2019s approximately 70 or 80 million homes out there that have ductwork that runs through them. So their ability to adapt to a ducted system had to occur for really to be an important element. But the ducted systems that we have the new M1 products are our OEMs have done marvelous things with the technology and the engineering of them to come up with more efficiency to come up with a way to maintain cost and provide better comfort for the consumer. So, I think, it\u2019s going to be a nice balance now that we\u2019re going to have between the ductless and the duct free. I call it almost a conversions where I\u2019m going to where a homeowner would perhaps use both products in their home.\nNigel Coe: Right. Yeah, so more HVAC systems that makes sense. And then the down 8% units in the quarter, you mentioned that some of your warehouses were out of stock with the transition to sounds like that was bit of an impact. I mean, can you just give us a flavor on how that\u2019s been tracking through January perhaps? And when do you think we\u2019ll be in a situation where the OEMs are up to speed on this M1 product?\nBarry Logan: Well, most of the OEMs are improving, there is some dysfunction in the in the channel right now, obviously, with the higher demand for heat pumps as created some longer lead times or long lead times compared to the straight-cooler units and the gas furnaces. So we\u2019re hoping that they get those ironed out. When \u2013 that you\u2019d have to ask the OEMs when they\u2019re going to be able to do that, but it\u2019s our hope that will start stabilizing in the second quarter. We\u2019re also seeing some high demand on the commercial products that we offer, and lead times there are stretching out into the months, not year.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah, that\u2019s most difficult inventory accessibility that we have now in the commercial.\nBarry Logan: With the highest of the very high demand for them, and so that\u2019s kind of pushing sales along out into the year. And, frankly, with that that particular product, if demand continues where it\u2019s at, it\u2019s going to be probably throughout the entire 2023. We\u2019re going to see disconnect there between availability and demand.\nNigel Coe: But any improvements in that manifests into 1Q with the \u2013 perhaps the better player for new systems?\nBarry Logan: Yeah, with the residential systems, we are seeing definite improvement. But as I indicated earlier, again, it\u2019s mostly with the straight-cool products, and we\u2019re seeing the improvement we\u2019re not today, we\u2019re seeing small improvements on the heat pumps, but not where we want them to get our inventories adjusted.\nNigel Coe: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank a lot.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may now go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hello, Jeff.\nJeffrey Hammond: Hey, good morning, everyone. I like came down to Miami and it rained for 2 days. You said it\u2019s always sunny down there.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, you didn\u2019t call me. [indiscernible] And don\u2019t tell anybody it\u2019s going to be, what it\u2019s going to be, even if we take you to a big room, when were you here?\nJeffrey Hammond: A couple of weeks ago.\nAlbert Nahmad: Did you enjoy the weather at least?\nJeffrey Hammond: Well, it rained. It was nicer than Cleveland. But\u2026\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, rain [ph]. Yeah.\nJeffrey Hammond: Yeah. Just back in the inventory question, I guess, Barry, you mentioned lead times in the conversion, I guess, if you say lead times get back to normal. And, obviously, we don\u2019t know, when you get through this conversion. How much inventory ultimately do you think you can take out of the system, assuming those two things happen at some point within 2023, and if we get some of this destock, which everyone\u2019s talking about kind of is it end of the season? What\u2019s kind of your best guess on timing? Thanks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I\u2019ll give you a number that\u2019s a goal that whether we\u2019ll achieve it or not, but what I want us to achieve is to remove $200 million of our inventory.\nBarry Logan: Jeff, when you got to look at it on two sides, you got to look at it in dollars, you got to look at it units also. Our unit inventory is not up that dramatically it\u2019s up mid-single-digits. So when you look at it that way a lot of the dollars have to do with the inflation effect, and if that continues to go along we\u2019re going to have to work even harder to reach our goal, which I think we all want to receive and all want to meet.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. So just on 2023, I know, you guys don\u2019t give guidance, but most of the OEMs are kind of calling for kind of a sell through unit decline of mid-single-digits, and one, just wanted to get your take on that and that\u2019s market I understand you guys want to outgrow. But just your view of kind of market volume for 2023, and then presuming that can you still grow sales and earnings this year? Thanks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Oh, that\u2019s an easy one this year? Yes. I\u2019ll let somebody else answer the quarter.\nPaul Johnston: In terms of the year, Jeff, our team, our leaders, our business development people in the field, all expected growth sales earnings this year. So that\u2019s the target they set for us and other ones, managing all the local businesses that lots go operate. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s just \u2013 not just optimism, it\u2019s their plans to see growth. So, I think, short term, the first quarter is the funkiest quarter, and maybe my career, my 30-year career in that you have 30% revenue comps and 100% EPS comps of a year ago. And I\u2019m glad it\u2019s the smallest quarter of the year to have that type of a comparison to be up against. So, I think, you have to look beyond the first quarter and into the year. And, again, our teams are planning for growth in 2023.\nBarry Logan: And I\u2019m always \u2013 yeah, when you talk about the industry, of course, we always get focused on ducted residential split systems, and always remind people that over one-third of Watsco\u2019s businesses in the parts and supply business is a big piece of our business. And we expect that to continue to grow. We also have a large commercial presence, which we have a lot of tools and a lot of different markets and a lot of different products that we can focus on for growth. And something that hasn\u2019t been asked, so I\u2019ll offer it on the commercial side of the business, it was up over 20% this quarter, which is probably the 7th or 8th straight quarter of being up 20% or more. And I\u2019ll mentioned about the supply chain for commercial simply being truly challenged still. It\u2019s still it\u2019s not restraining growth, the growth rate of over 20%. And, I think, you\u2019ve heard all the OEMs talk about that dynamic over the next year or two. And we\u2019re certainly seeing the same thing.\nAlbert Nahmad: And to add Barry\u2019s comment, our non-equipment sales were up mid-teens.\nBarry Logan: But in the end, we need equipment to move the needle. And they think about who we are and our density of locations is that wherever the weather goes, we probably have facilities that serve what their needs are in that area.\nJeffrey Hammond: Just quick last one, international, I think was looked like it was a little softer than U.S., any nuances?\nAlbert Nahmad: It\u2019s a pretty steady business, and I expect growth there. For sure, it\u2019s very well managed, and even though some of these economies there are not doing well, I\u2019m positive on it.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hi, Josh, how you doing?\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Hey, Al, doing well. How about yourself?\nAlbert Nahmad: Good. Good.\nBarry Logan: Well, Josh, I got to say that\u2019s a new pronunciation of your last one. I haven\u2019t heard.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: I get more creative every time. Well, appreciate the question, guys. So we\u2019ve touched on heat pumps enough times now, we\u2019re just want to check your thoughts, Paul, on how you\u2019re thinking about anything. On the IRA side, there\u2019s anything to point to on rulemaking the single bar that they are paying more attention to.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah. Right now, the IRA in the first quarter obviously had, I would say, zero impact on what we\u2019ve seen to date. I think the 25-C portion of it where you can get a tax credit. I think we\u2019ll start seeing some positive feelings from it in the second quarter and third quarter. We still don\u2019t have a clear definition of what units qualify for the tax credit. And that\u2019s been delayed and we continue to follow-up to make sure that we understand which units are available for each one of our OEMs. So we can \u2013 we\u2019re ready. We\u2019ve launched programs with our dealers. We got the information in the dealers hands, it\u2019s a matter now of just matching it up with what units are available. On the other side of the IRA, the tax rebates I really don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a great impact at all. On the rebates side for 2023, I think, most of the impact there will start kicking in 2024. However, on the non-IRA side, we\u2019re starting to see a lot more municipalities and regions of the country that are pushing harder and harder on basically going with the heat pump. Places in Northern California, you can\u2019t replace a gas furnace, New York City, it\u2019s fossil fuel heat, forget it. In Canada, we\u2019re seeing the same thing. So as we move through this transition, the IRA has an impact that plus a lot of local municipalities and states are also getting behind the movement now to electrify our heating needs.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. Super comprehensive. I really appreciate that. Something else would like to follow-on maybe away from what\u2019s been touched on so far. Just saw that in the fourth quarter, you had a carrier distributor get picked up by, I think, the first one non-Watsco entity since the JV started, if memory serves, just how do you think about the kind of ability to maybe look at future regions or the balance of ownership their longer term?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, let me just kind of make that there have been other carrier distributors, so other people in during our time with carrier. It\u2019s not a new thing. But I have to remind you that we have 23 brands that we deal with. And our appetite is for distributors that are good, well run, and doesn\u2019t matter what the brand is.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: All right. That\u2019s helpful.\nAlbert Nahmad: I think we\u2019re very \u2013 we\u2019re Carrier\u2019s largest customer. We\u2019re never going to let him down. But we also want to grow our share of the $50 billion business that we see in the United States for distributors. So we will go where we can find great companies that want to be part of us. And I think we offer more than anybody else in terms of joining a family.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Right. Thanks, Al.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hello, Steve.\nStephen Tusa: Hi, guys, good morning.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning.\nStephen Tusa: Carrier sales to their JVs was up like low-20s in the quarter. I know they have some other JVs in there. You guys are obviously an important one. And I think you said commercial was up for you guys pretty nicely. So when that equipment number, that equipment volume is down 8%, what was the actual like resi number? The unit number for equipment in 4Q. What was the actual resi number?\nBarry Logan: I think it was pretty flat, Steve?\nStephen Tusa: Pretty \u2013 in and around that?\nBarry Logan: Wait to see.\nStephen Tusa: Because if commercial was up that strong. I mean, obviously commercials not as big but just carrying them.\nAlbert Nahmad: Now, I\u2019m commenting on all of what\u2019s going not certainly, not just carrier, but\u2026\nStephen Tusa: Yeah, totally, totally, all of Watsco. So units were down 8% on equipment. It sounds like you\u2019re like commercial was up comfortably. So what does that mean for resi like downloadable?\nAlbert Nahmad: We said overall it was down 8% for the quarter residential domestic. That\u2019s it.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. So that\u2019s the resi number.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. That makes sense. And then I am not sure if you answer this. I mean, you said you\u2019re going to grow sales. But what do you think the unit number is for? Was that are in reference to a unit number or I thought that was a sales number? Do you have kind of what your construct is for the industry for 2023? I\u2019m not sure if you guys answered that before units.\nAlbert Nahmad: [But you weren\u2019t] [ph] on the call, Steve, just kidding.\nStephen Tusa: Well, you think you\u2019re going to grow sales that includes, obviously, price and mix. So our volumes, actually \u2013 I think we had a question before, I\u2019m not sure\u2026\nAlbert Nahmad: We do expect units and prices to increase could contribute to sales growth both.\nStephen Tusa: For the year?\nAlbert Nahmad: Oh, yeah, for the year. We expect another price increase coming from the OEM now. It\u2019s already starting to occur because of the new mix, the new products that they\u2019re introducing.\nStephen Tusa: Got it. And then\u2026\nBarry Logan: And Steve, I just want to handle this, because it\u2019s important and it\u2019s important for other people to listen to it too. We don\u2019t sit here and like wonder what the markets going to do and just say, oh my goodness, they listen to what everybody is saying, when wringing our hands, and hoping it\u2019s not right. The last 2 years, it\u2019s almost been impossible to go to OEM community and ask for incremental opportunities to go OEMs, and say we want more territory, we want more brands, we want more products, we want to expand, what we\u2019re doing. Let\u2019s do that that\u2019s not been possible over the last 2 years, because OEMs could not make the product or couldn\u2019t offer the opportunity. And those types of initiatives are going on right now. I\u2019m not going to list them for you. But there\u2019s a lot of underground effort here to do what I just said, which is to grow our business with our manufacturers, some of them new manufacturers in order to expand what we\u2019re doing and grow the market this year.\nStephen Tusa: Got it. Got it. For your share \u2013 from a share perspective.\nAlbert Nahmad: That\u2019s correct.\nStephen Tusa: One last one for you, Paul, maybe you know the answer this question, but I was talking a lot about the savings for the consumer. What is the like \u2013 what do you think is the payback for the consumer? Obviously\u2026\nAlbert Nahmad: Very good question. Good\u2026\nStephen Tusa: What is the actual payback? Because, I mean, you\u2019re going to be spending a couple grand more on some of these systems. What is the actual payback is measured in years on some of these new\u2026\nPaul Johnston: Yeah. Obviously, it depends on the geography. In Florida, you get a faster payback. In Connecticut, your payback would be a lot slower. So in each one of the regions to pay back is also a factor of utility rebates, the state rebates, the IRA tax credits.\nStephen Tusa: But energy consumption. The drop in energy consumption is the key thing. All those other things add gravy to the meal, but what is the reduction in energy use, when we install a high efficiency.\nBarry Logan: Yeah, percentage wise, it could be 25% to 30%. We\u2019re even more on an older system. But I mean, to be able to come up with a year\u2019s analysis, you\u2019d have to take all those factors into consideration. So really a tough payback analysis to do, Steve, for the whole U.S.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah, if you start with a premise that they\u2019re going to use 25% less energy and probably more percentage wise, and energy is half the cost \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, cooling and heating is half the cost of electrical use in home. That\u2019s the way to look at it. We got a lot of homes where they\u2019re already paying X dollars. And if they go to \u2013 for their energy, and if they go to a higher efficiency heating and cooling system, they\u2019re going to save half of the half. The overall cost is half dedicated to heating and cooling, and the stuff we\u2019re selling is going to save them, half of that in costs with the electrical company. Plus as Barry and Paul starts to say all kinds of tax benefits that are going to run to the homeowner.\nStephen Tusa: Yeah, one more question for you, sorry, this hybrid ductless, it\u2019s my understanding that they have \u2013 that some of the guys like Daikin have gotten their products down to be essentially in line with the replacement for a unitary system. And I would assume that with the increase in fear for unitary, that kind of difference is going to get smaller. Is that about right or is the hybrid ductless still the first cost is still more expensive than what will be the baseline unitary product? Like how cost competitive are they?\nBarry Logan: They\u2019re very cost competitive. They\u2019re right in line with the ducted product. And beyond \u2013 I know, you made a comment about the Daikin product from the ASHRAE show, but every manufacturer either has one or will have one, right. We have been marketing it for what the last 2.5 years. It seems substantial growth in revenue.\nStephen Tusa: Yeah. Makes sense. All right. Thanks for all the colors as usual, guys, really helpful.\nAlbert Nahmad: Okay.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Chris Dankert with Loop Capital. You may now go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Chris.\nChristopher Dankert: Yeah, good morning, Al. It is. It is. I guess to stick with the heat pump theme here, really impressive growth on the quarter and the year. More than 2x the market if I\u2019m not mistaken, I guess, maybe could you tell us or remind us kind of what percent here mix of heat pumps today? And are we starting from a smaller base there? And any comments would be really helpful?\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah, it depends on the states. Once again, if you go to Texas, it\u2019s a very low percentage of the total market. It\u2019s in the low-20s. So we have a huge opportunity to grow the heat pumps here, there. If I go up into the Carolinas, we\u2019re already in the 65%, 70% range. So that\u2019s just a continuation of what we\u2019ve done over the last 10 years. So, regionally, it varies. And obviously, now the big push is to get into heat pumps, which are able to do what we call super heat, and operate at 15, 20, 25 degrees, below zero. So that we can move the market up into my home state of North Dakota, and actually keep people warm in the winter.\nChristopher Dankert: Got it. Okay\u2026\nBarry Logan: I was going to say after one on Watsco for another 20 years, which we want you to. But remember the furnace might last a lifetime. In fact, many of them have lifetime warranties. And heat pump useful life is probably 10 years at best in some markets. So there is a longer term churn of the replacement market for heat pumps, also that works itself out.\nChristopher Dankert: Okay. That makes sense. And there\u2019s a lot of understandable concern kind of on the strength of a consumer balance sheet and spending right now, part of why credit for comfort makes so much sense here. But are you seeing any change in the rate of repair versus replacement or hearing about any kind of homeowner belt tightening from your contractor customers here?\nAlbert Nahmad: Good question. Paul?\nPaul Johnston: Yeah, we didn\u2019t throughout the entire pandemic period, we were just talking this morning about in the amount of home equity that\u2019s available to consumers with the appreciation in their primary residence. So we haven\u2019t seen a repair versus replace discussion, which generally the industry gets into as we move into a transition to new products. So I think it\u2019s a little early to declare with which way the market is going to go right now. But for right now, we\u2019re seeing a nice balance between our equipment and our parts business.\nAaron Nahmad: Okay. I will say \u2013 this is A.J. I will say that if and when a repair dynamic plays out, we\u2019re well positioned. We\u2019ve done a lot of work around product assortment and making sure that each of our stores have the right products to meet that demand as well. And, of course, those products often come with a higher margin.\nAlbert Nahmad: That\u2019s a very unique advantage. I don\u2019t think anybody has the system to do that.\nChristopher Dankert: Got it. Well, thanks so much for the color, guys.\nOperator: It appears no further questions. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, thanks again for your interest in our company. We\u2019re very optimistic and we hope you stay interested. And please don\u2019t hesitate to come down and visit and hear from the players directly. Not only that, the sun always shines here. So thanks again for your interest, and we\u2019ll see you the next quarter. Bye-bye.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Albert Nahmad",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I do hope everyone is healthy and not struck by the virus. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. And this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO; and with me is A.J. Nahmad, President of Watsco; and Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Before we start, here is our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws, ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statement. Now, Watsco delivered an exceptional quarter to close out a fantastic year. We are especially pleased, because in the fourth quarter of last year, I should say the prior year, sales were up 21% and earnings per share were up 77%. So the results we are reporting today were against that performance in the fourth quarter of the prior year. So how did we do on the fourth quarter of this prior year of 2022? Well, sales grew 5% to a record $1.6 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 14% to $141 million. EBIT margins expanded 80 basis points to a record 8.9%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 16% to a record $2.35. Now, we're going to explain what the adjustment as we go through here. So, remember, this fourth quarter results were running against the prior year, where sales were up 21% and earnings per share was up 77%. So we think we did well. Now for the full year, sales grew 16% to a record $7.3 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 33% to $835 million. EBIT margins expanded 150 basis points to a record 11.5%, and adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to a record $14.20. Now, let me clarify what the adjustment means. These figures \u2013 the adjusted figures including $49 million, I should say, once again, the adjusted figures exclude a $49 million net tax benefit from vesting of restricted shares, which added $1.20 earnings per share for the quarter and $1.21 earnings per share for the year. Those were excluded in the numbers that I just gave you. And very important, we generated a record cash flow of $572 million doing 2023 and ended the year with a strong balance sheet and virtually no debt, I like having a very little debt, if any at all. Our financial strength gives us the ability to invest in most any opportunity as we continue to build scale in a very fragmented $50 billion North American distributor market. And we continue to look for acquisitions as Watsco is a great home for family businesses, and why is that? Well, because we sustain cultures, we invest in people and we provide technology to secure and build on their great legacies. Our focus is always on long-term, which makes us different than other acquires in the industry. We have challenged our leadership team to develop aggressive growth plans, utilizing our scale, product diversity, and technology leadership and build upon our growing market share position. To that end, we are working collaboratively with our OEM partners to develop forward-looking growth initiatives, particularly in light of the various regulatory and positive industry catalysts that lie ahead and there's some good ones. This quarter results also reflect continued progress on two key areas of focus, and those are sustaining gross margins and improving operating efficiencies. There's more to do on both, but we are encouraged by our progress and our intent and achieving more operating efficiencies across our network. This morning's press release provides important concepts and details that support Watsco's long-term growth trajectory. Some of them are, we have an immense technology advantage, and we are investing to grow that advantage. These technologies are increasing customer's engagement, reducing attrition and creating sustainable market share gains. In addition, Watsco's broad array of products and brands is a competitive advantage and allows us to serve contractors in any environment. We also have a leading market share position in Sunbelt markets, proving stability and higher growth over time. Regarding those Sunbelt markets, a lot of people seem to be immigrating to the Sunbelt markets in recent times, and that works in our favor since we're the leader in those markets. In addition, there are several important regulatory and industry catalysts for growth that will play out in the next few years. 2023 saw the introduction of high efficiency standard for HVAC equipment, which will provide a pricing opportunity for us as well, and this is very important, as well as energy saving opportunities for homeowners and businesses in 2023 and beyond. And then in 2025, we'll also market introduction of new refrigerant standards, which historically made it harder to repair existing systems and drive customers to new equipment. We also see continued movement towards electrification and greater adoption of heat pumps, which generally come at a higher price and higher margins. Sales of heat pumps grew 25% in 2022, I should say, our sales of heat pumps grew 25% in 2022 and 21% during the fourth quarter, outpacing overall growth rates. Finally, the new Inflation Reduction Act provides enhanced tax credits and incentives for efficiency upgrades and electrification. All of these catalysts will benefit the industry in the years ahead. And we certainly believe that our scale, technology and financial strength position us to capture these new market opportunities. Finally, we always concern about our balance sheet, so that we are in a position of financial strength. Today's balance sheet remains in pristine condition to invest in any size growth opportunity in the coming years. Lastly, before turning to Q&A, I would like to thank more than 7,000 employees of Watsco across our market for their service and commitment to customers. They have done an extraordinary job to serve our customers and generate historic performance as you'll see today. With that, let's go on to Q&A. Good morning, Tommy. Well, we certainly \u2013 that's our goal is to constantly improve our profitability, and our revenues without significantly increasing SG&A. But let's get a little bit more color for you. Barry? It's always a good topic by the way with inflation in the last couple of years. Yeah, go ahead. I'll hand it over to our financial people. So all of that work on the inventory, obviously, it leads to better cash flow as well. We're very aware of that. The better we manage the inventory. And you've just started all the forces that are being we're presently dealing with better the cash flow, so we expect to pay off in cash flow as well. Hi, Dave. Mr. Logon? [For a jug] [ph]. That's pound. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You bet. Good morning, Jeff. Yeah, we are very aware of this. So we were the inventory down in Southern states. That's why they pay us the big bucks to figure all that out. Yeah, some of the OEMs are doing better than others. So it's pretty good. Our supply chain in that respect. And don't ever forget that in the fourth quarter, and even the first quarter drawing inferences and what's a much smaller quarter than the others is, give it the weight that deserves given the size of the quarter. Good morning, Ryan. Yeah, I would say by the way, I'm turning it over to somebody knows more about this than I do. But also the mix change or product is affecting our margins. It's very significant part of what's going on, people start buying or have been buying more heat pumps that improves our margins just by that fact, because some of these products are at a higher margin than other products. So it's also a mix of products. But, Paul, go ahead, or Barry, whoever wants to take that. The products also have a wonderful benefit for the end user. Explain that, Paul? Well, I hasten to add that these are not just price increases for the hell of it. The innovation of cooling and heating that's going on now is magnificent for the people that use HVAC. I mean, they're getting the savings of going to a heat pump, because the heat pump cools and heat, they don't need a cooler add the furnace. That's a wonderful use of it. The federal government's discovered that. So they're providing already and we'll provide more incentives for businesses and homes to use the heat pump, everybody wins on that. The consumer saves more and there are less emissions from it. So, I always like to think a little further out, I don't see anything that isn't positive, given that heating and cooling is 50% of homeowners cost of electricity. And all these innovations are focused on helping that consumer save money as well as benefits from more efficiency in the unit itself, which is how he saves money. So, I just think the industry is on a roll here now, because of the concern about emissions and the concern about the refrigerants damaging the environment. And there's a movement by the guys that make the stuff to innovate. And more they innovate, the more we enjoy providing great products to the contractor, who in turn provides it to the homeowner or the business owner. It's just a lot of good stuff going on. You bet. Good morning, Nigel. Yeah, that's most difficult inventory accessibility that we have now in the commercial. Hello, Jeff. Well, you didn't call me. [indiscernible] And don't tell anybody it's going to be, what it's going to be, even if we take you to a big room, when were you here? Did you enjoy the weather at least? Well, rain [ph]. Yeah. Well, I'll give you a number that's a goal that whether we'll achieve it or not, but what I want us to achieve is to remove $200 million of our inventory. Oh, that's an easy one this year? Yes. I'll let somebody else answer the quarter. And to add Barry's comment, our non-equipment sales were up mid-teens. It's a pretty steady business, and I expect growth there. For sure, it's very well managed, and even though some of these economies there are not doing well, I'm positive on it. Hi, Josh, how you doing? Good. Good. Yeah. Right now, the IRA in the first quarter obviously had, I would say, zero impact on what we've seen to date. I think the 25-C portion of it where you can get a tax credit. I think we'll start seeing some positive feelings from it in the second quarter and third quarter. We still don't have a clear definition of what units qualify for the tax credit. And that's been delayed and we continue to follow-up to make sure that we understand which units are available for each one of our OEMs. So we can \u2013 we're ready. We've launched programs with our dealers. We got the information in the dealers hands, it's a matter now of just matching it up with what units are available. On the other side of the IRA, the tax rebates I really don't think we're going to see a great impact at all. On the rebates side for 2023, I think, most of the impact there will start kicking in 2024. However, on the non-IRA side, we're starting to see a lot more municipalities and regions of the country that are pushing harder and harder on basically going with the heat pump. Places in Northern California, you can't replace a gas furnace, New York City, it's fossil fuel heat, forget it. In Canada, we're seeing the same thing. So as we move through this transition, the IRA has an impact that plus a lot of local municipalities and states are also getting behind the movement now to electrify our heating needs. Well, let me just kind of make that there have been other carrier distributors, so other people in during our time with carrier. It's not a new thing. But I have to remind you that we have 23 brands that we deal with. And our appetite is for distributors that are good, well run, and doesn't matter what the brand is. I think we're very \u2013 we're Carrier's largest customer. We're never going to let him down. But we also want to grow our share of the $50 billion business that we see in the United States for distributors. So we will go where we can find great companies that want to be part of us. And I think we offer more than anybody else in terms of joining a family. Hello, Steve. Good morning. Now, I'm commenting on all of what's going not certainly, not just carrier, but... We said overall it was down 8% for the quarter residential domestic. That's it. Yes. [But you weren't] [ph] on the call, Steve, just kidding. We do expect units and prices to increase could contribute to sales growth both. Oh, yeah, for the year. We expect another price increase coming from the OEM now. It's already starting to occur because of the new mix, the new products that they're introducing. That's correct. Very good question. Good... Yeah, if you start with a premise that they're going to use 25% less energy and probably more percentage wise, and energy is half the cost \u2013 I'm sorry, cooling and heating is half the cost of electrical use in home. That's the way to look at it. We got a lot of homes where they're already paying X dollars. And if they go to \u2013 for their energy, and if they go to a higher efficiency heating and cooling system, they're going to save half of the half. The overall cost is half dedicated to heating and cooling, and the stuff we're selling is going to save them, half of that in costs with the electrical company. Plus as Barry and Paul starts to say all kinds of tax benefits that are going to run to the homeowner. Okay. Good morning, Chris. Yeah, it depends on the states. Once again, if you go to Texas, it's a very low percentage of the total market. It's in the low-20s. So we have a huge opportunity to grow the heat pumps here, there. If I go up into the Carolinas, we're already in the 65%, 70% range. So that's just a continuation of what we've done over the last 10 years. So, regionally, it varies. And obviously, now the big push is to get into heat pumps, which are able to do what we call super heat, and operate at 15, 20, 25 degrees, below zero. So that we can move the market up into my home state of North Dakota, and actually keep people warm in the winter. Good question. Paul? That's a very unique advantage. I don't think anybody has the system to do that. Well, thanks again for your interest in our company. We're very optimistic and we hope you stay interested. And please don't hesitate to come down and visit and hear from the players directly. Not only that, the sun always shines here. So thanks again for your interest, and we'll see you the next quarter. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "Yeah, Tommy, I would say \u2013 good morning, Tommy. I would say that first, there's obviously in any distribution model, a variable component to what we're spending on SG&A. And the variable components were probably the most volatile during the last couple of years when freight and overtime and even just the daily life of a branch manager and 10, 15 people on a branch was tested through all the disruption, everything that went on the last 2 years. So those variable costs, we definitely saw an improvement and reductions in the fourth quarter. And again, that would be, I would say, a foreshadowing for what we're looking for going forward is some of the variable costs and inefficiency, becoming opportunities to create efficiency this year and 2023. Obviously, we also have fixed costs, which is probably a half or so of our SG&A spend. And there it is inflation, there's been inflation over the last 12 months like every other fixed cost of every other business. So it's not that simple to simply reduced cost across the entire portfolio. For the variable costs we're seeing already and the fixed costs with more moderate inflation, I would expect to see some improvement. So net-net, I'll set at the goal is to have much more moderate SG&A spend versus revenue growth, and there's not a leader, a branch manager, a reasonable person in Watsco, that isn't focused on it. Yeah. Again, there's two pieces or probably 25 pieces to the answer, by the way, but I'll give you the two big ones. First is, lead times. Lead times have been tested with the last 2 years. Lead times is what determines what we order and what we carry and just what our inventory levels are. And to the extent they're either disrupted or uncertain, and we need to hedge in terms of what we keep in branches. That's what we've done in the last couple of years. So to the extent that over the next 12 months lead times become more dependable and less than there is the opportunity and would be the consequence of lowering inventory. Whether it's lower than it is today in absolute dollars, there's other factors involved. But we would expect lead times to shorten, and confidence to strengthen and lead to lower inventory levels over time. The second, today, it's hard to see it on a piece of paper, but our branches in the last 90 days have gone through the biggest inventory conversion from old product to new product that they've experienced in their careers, it's still going and trickling into the first quarter as well. So in many respects, inventory is not business as usual also because of the product transition. And over the next 12 months, as that works itself through, I would expect that to help inventory levels, meaning reduce inventory levels. And we're kind of looking forward to the greater simplicity than we've been experiencing the last couple of years. The \u2013 again, Dave, good morning. Well, first, the most simple component of gross margin percent is the markup we sustain on selling products. And what is our markup and we call that selling margin. It's the simplest, most important analysis and that's what increased this quarter. And it's satisfying, because again there's a lot going on in the market, a lot of product changes, a lot of conversions, a lot of noise. And our teams did a great job of sustaining margin. So I don't think there's anything that's changed in our \u2013 either our thought process or analysis or what our business leaders are telling us in margin looking forward in 2023. And you've heard 27% as a target. Our entrepreneurial CEO would tell you it's an interim target, because we have greater expectations than that. And, but I don't think anything's changed either in the mix of your thought process, Dave, of what the target is. What do we get, it's around $25, $26 per pound of 410A, and that varies by region. No, that's pound. And that varies by region, and it's a very small percentage of our total sales. That kind of makes Watsco unique, because we're a national North, South, East, West company, nothing is ever stranded. Because, as Al indicated, we've got a large business that we do in the northern tier of the U.S. plus Canada, where we were able to move, very little inventory actually, but we didn't move the inventory to make sure it's available to sell. By the way, I would say that just to give some editorial on it, I think, the idea of selling out of the M product in the Sunbelt markets, and the gaining of the replacement inventory of M1, there was probably actually a gap there, as opposed to meaning that there's almost probably some branches and so on did not have the new stock to sell as they sold out of the old stock. So that transition was probably slightly negative to unit in the fourth quarter just to give you some color. So don't \u2013 I think the OEMs are still playing catch up on getting the M1 product everywhere it needs to be as opposed to being ahead of where it would have been. So... To give you the answer, you can see the \u2013 we said U.S. products are up 4% in the quarter, if I gave you the units, units were down 8%, which would mean prices up 12%. In that 12% price is, again, fixed line items that would add up to 12%, not so much inflation, some inflation. But the heat pump growth obviously is a big component of that growth rate, because we're selling at higher unit prices there. And some inflation, that would give you the mix stuff. Yeah, just to add a \u2013 just a reminder on the M1 product, obviously, the OEMs needed to capture a higher selling price in the market. And I don't think anything has changed from what we're seeing in terms of price capture in 2023 on the new products and depends on which OEM and which conversation, but there are some March 1 or some March price increases also flowing from the OEMs in March. How much of that sticks into the market, time will tell, but there is a \u2013 obviously, some inflation to be captured this year, which is part of what the OEMs are feeling in terms of their pressure. I hate the comments specifically, Ryan, on a range, I would say what you've seen the last 6 months from Watsco in terms of price does not include a lot of inflation, and includes a lot of price capture and mix. And so, I think there's still a big dependency on the contractor going into someone's home and selling these products and capturing their price. And so time will tell, but I think, obviously, we expect pretty strong pricing environment this year. Actually, it's \u2013 for the last 20 years, it's been growing and growing. And, I think, the \u2013 I don't think it's going to be a breakout period for it. You have to remember that there's approximately 70 or 80 million homes out there that have ductwork that runs through them. So their ability to adapt to a ducted system had to occur for really to be an important element. But the ducted systems that we have the new M1 products are our OEMs have done marvelous things with the technology and the engineering of them to come up with more efficiency to come up with a way to maintain cost and provide better comfort for the consumer. So, I think, it's going to be a nice balance now that we're going to have between the ductless and the duct free. I call it almost a conversions where I'm going to where a homeowner would perhaps use both products in their home. Well, most of the OEMs are improving, there is some dysfunction in the in the channel right now, obviously, with the higher demand for heat pumps as created some longer lead times or long lead times compared to the straight-cooler units and the gas furnaces. So we're hoping that they get those ironed out. When \u2013 that you'd have to ask the OEMs when they're going to be able to do that, but it's our hope that will start stabilizing in the second quarter. We're also seeing some high demand on the commercial products that we offer, and lead times there are stretching out into the months, not year. With the highest of the very high demand for them, and so that's kind of pushing sales along out into the year. And, frankly, with that that particular product, if demand continues where it's at, it's going to be probably throughout the entire 2023. We're going to see disconnect there between availability and demand. Yeah, with the residential systems, we are seeing definite improvement. But as I indicated earlier, again, it's mostly with the straight-cool products, and we're seeing the improvement we're not today, we're seeing small improvements on the heat pumps, but not where we want them to get our inventories adjusted. Jeff, when you got to look at it on two sides, you got to look at it in dollars, you got to look at it units also. Our unit inventory is not up that dramatically it's up mid-single-digits. So when you look at it that way a lot of the dollars have to do with the inflation effect, and if that continues to go along we're going to have to work even harder to reach our goal, which I think we all want to receive and all want to meet. And I'm always \u2013 yeah, when you talk about the industry, of course, we always get focused on ducted residential split systems, and always remind people that over one-third of Watsco's businesses in the parts and supply business is a big piece of our business. And we expect that to continue to grow. We also have a large commercial presence, which we have a lot of tools and a lot of different markets and a lot of different products that we can focus on for growth. And something that hasn't been asked, so I'll offer it on the commercial side of the business, it was up over 20% this quarter, which is probably the 7th or 8th straight quarter of being up 20% or more. And I'll mentioned about the supply chain for commercial simply being truly challenged still. It's still it's not restraining growth, the growth rate of over 20%. And, I think, you've heard all the OEMs talk about that dynamic over the next year or two. And we're certainly seeing the same thing. But in the end, we need equipment to move the needle. And they think about who we are and our density of locations is that wherever the weather goes, we probably have facilities that serve what their needs are in that area. Well, Josh, I got to say that's a new pronunciation of your last one. I haven't heard. I think it was pretty flat, Steve? Wait to see. And Steve, I just want to handle this, because it's important and it's important for other people to listen to it too. We don't sit here and like wonder what the markets going to do and just say, oh my goodness, they listen to what everybody is saying, when wringing our hands, and hoping it's not right. The last 2 years, it's almost been impossible to go to OEM community and ask for incremental opportunities to go OEMs, and say we want more territory, we want more brands, we want more products, we want to expand, what we're doing. Let's do that that's not been possible over the last 2 years, because OEMs could not make the product or couldn't offer the opportunity. And those types of initiatives are going on right now. I'm not going to list them for you. But there's a lot of underground effort here to do what I just said, which is to grow our business with our manufacturers, some of them new manufacturers in order to expand what we're doing and grow the market this year. Yeah, percentage wise, it could be 25% to 30%. We're even more on an older system. But I mean, to be able to come up with a year's analysis, you'd have to take all those factors into consideration. So really a tough payback analysis to do, Steve, for the whole U.S. They're very cost competitive. They're right in line with the ducted product. And beyond \u2013 I know, you made a comment about the Daikin product from the ASHRAE show, but every manufacturer either has one or will have one, right. We have been marketing it for what the last 2.5 years. It seems substantial growth in revenue. I was going to say after one on Watsco for another 20 years, which we want you to. But remember the furnace might last a lifetime. In fact, many of them have lifetime warranties. And heat pump useful life is probably 10 years at best in some markets. So there is a longer term churn of the replacement market for heat pumps, also that works itself out."

            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "This is Paul. I can also add, we talked about technology for our customers and how it enhances their experience and provides them with a more efficient model to do business with Watsco. But also those same technologies work within Watsco to improve our efficiencies. We've got, I think, world class inventory management systems, world class data management systems to be able to track and know what, where we're not efficient and where we're not \u2013 and where we are efficient. And I think our people have spent the last 4 or 5 years learning how to use these tools. And I think they're going to come into play now as we reach a more normal, if you will, business environment out there. Correct. A little bit what Barry's saying there, you consider what we did with going from what we call the M inventory, which is what we sold last year to the new M1 inventory. Basically, we have to do a transition where we're replacing all of that inventory, because in most of our Sunbelt markets, the old M inventory would not be available to sell. So for us, it was a complete refresh of all of that inventory. And also adding to Barry's point, as we move into the new inventory, we're going to have a reduction in the number of SKUs that we have to handle on the equipment side, which we think will result in better efficiencies and higher turnovers in the inventory. That's a very complex question, Ryan. Obviously, we've indicated twice that the heat pumps help, they give us a better mix of heat pumps obviously give us a better price dynamic and more profit dollars. And when you get into some of the other products that we sell, like, we haven't mentioned it yet, but the duct free split market, has continued to grow at double-digits for us meddling in the quarter, but also on a year-to-date basis even more. So those also come with a higher margin to them, and that market has continued to escalate with new products. And as well as we're starting to see hybrid units that are getting into the ducted side. And without getting too far into the wheeze [ph] on that, we're starting to see a lot of crossover between the duct free products becoming ducted and becoming more functional, and that obviously has higher gross margins and better profits. Yeah, the products that we sell are well above the minimums under old SEER terminology, they were in the 18 to 24 SEER range, versus we consider 16, 17 SEER on the ducted product to be very high efficiency. So the consumer is saving money getting a great product. And we're seeing more and more on entrees into that marketplace from all of our OEMs. In terms of the year, Jeff, our team, our leaders, our business development people in the field, all expected growth sales earnings this year. So that's the target they set for us and other ones, managing all the local businesses that lots go operate. So I wouldn't say it's just \u2013 not just optimism, it's their plans to see growth. So, I think, short term, the first quarter is the funkiest quarter, and maybe my career, my 30-year career in that you have 30% revenue comps and 100% EPS comps of a year ago. And I'm glad it's the smallest quarter of the year to have that type of a comparison to be up against. So, I think, you have to look beyond the first quarter and into the year. And, again, our teams are planning for growth in 2023. Yeah. Obviously, it depends on the geography. In Florida, you get a faster payback. In Connecticut, your payback would be a lot slower. So in each one of the regions to pay back is also a factor of utility rebates, the state rebates, the IRA tax credits. Yeah, we didn't throughout the entire pandemic period, we were just talking this morning about in the amount of home equity that's available to consumers with the appreciation in their primary residence. So we haven't seen a repair versus replace discussion, which generally the industry gets into as we move into a transition to new products. So I think it's a little early to declare with which way the market is going to go right now. But for right now, we're seeing a nice balance between our equipment and our parts business."

I will say that if and when a repair dynamic plays out, we're well positioned. We've done a lot of work around product assortment and making sure that each of our stores have the right products to meet that demand as well.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Albert Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO, and with me is A.J. Nahmad, President of the company; Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Before we start our usual cautionary statement, this conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Now on to the quarter. We delivered another record quarter. Sales grew 14% to a record $2.04 billion and operating income increased 14% to a record $236 million. This third quarter performance builds on what we believe will be a record year for our business. So far nine month sales increased 19% to a record $5.7 billion and nine months operating profits increased 37% to a record $694 million. Year-to-date cash flow also improved increasing 12% to $359 million. Now, given our earnings growth, cash flow expectations and our confidence in the business, we announced today at 11% increase in our annual dividend to $9.80 per share effective in January of 2023. Thought I might comment that we believe the last two years have been among the most challenging and also the most gratifying periods in our history. Our growth and stability speaks for the fundamental necessities of the products we sell and to the value that our industry provides homeowners and businesses. Given our long-term focus, Watsco has also invested over the past two years in people, technology and infrastructure and we do these things to build market share in our $50 billion market. As industry demand and supply chains normalized, it is the right time to expect more productivity and we have challenged our leadership to improve operation efficiencies across our network. We're also working closely with our OEM partners to develop forward-looking growth initiatives. Watsco does maintain good relationships with virtually every domestic and international industry manufacturer. We believe collaboration with the manufacturer is all the more important given the industry changes taking place in the coming years. Many views of our company fundamentals are in this morning's press release. I really do urge investors to read that release and understand why we believe we have an exciting future. We have an immense technology advantage and we're investing to grow that advantage. These technologies bring in new customers. They help our existing customers grow and they reduce attrition of customers and most important they help us gain market share. Our active technology user community has grown 21% this year to more than 45,000 users. And OnCall Air, that's a platform that reaches into homes, keeps growing. During the quarter contractors has presented quotes to approximately 66,000 households. That is a 39% increase in households over last year and generated $269 million in sales for our contractor customers. That is a 47% increase. Watsco's diversity of products and brands is an important competitive advantage that allows us to serve contractors in any economic environment. We also have a leading market share position in Sun Belt markets, where both population migration is greatest and the necessity of HVAC products is the most absolute. You got to have cooling and heating if you live in the Sun Belt. In addition, there are several important catalysts for growth that will play out in the next few years. For HVAC equipment, the minimum federal efficiency standards will increase in 2023 across the entire United States. Price points associated with these higher-efficiency products will increase and should benefit our 2023 results. Federal mandates are now in place to phase out high global warming potential refrigerants used in millions and millions of existing systems. But in 2025, we'll mark the introduction of new HVAC systems that will incorporate lower-GWP refrigerants. We also see a strong movement towards electrification of heating systems through the use of more heat pumps, which generally come at a higher price; higher margins; and in the long run, a shorter replacement cycle. Our sales of the heat pumps grew 27% in the first nine months and interesting 32% during the quarter, outpacing overall sales growth rates. The new Inflation Reduction Act, which takes effect next year, also provides tax credits and incentives for qualified efficiency upgrades and electrification. All of this provides the basis for homeowners and businesses to upgrade systems that will, over time, be more efficient and more environmentally friendly. And all of this is good for climate change and good for Watsco. We certainly believe our scale, technology and financial strength position us to capture these new market opportunities. Finally, we always concern ourselves with our balance sheet so that we are in a position of financial strength. And today's balance sheet remains in pristine condition to invest in growth opportunities in coming years. I'd like to say that we can fund almost any size of investment to grow our business. With that, let's go on to Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Tommy Moll of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning.\nTommy Moll: Good morning, Al. Thanks for taking my questions.\nAlbert Nahmad: Of course.\nTommy Moll: Wanted to follow up on your comment regarding finding more operating efficiency in a more normal business environment. If we go through a period where industry volumes are pressured, I presume that still applies. But can you actually continue to show leverage on SG&A? And to the extent you can, is it intentioned with market share opportunities that you might otherwise be able to go after in a period of pressured industry fundamentals? Is there a natural tension there that we should think about, how you might reconcile?\nAlbert Nahmad: I think that's an excellent question, and I'm going to have Barry Logan and Paul Johnston answer that and A.J. Nahmad. You're going to get a trifecta here.\nBarry Logan: The last part first, Tom, and just to give some sense of product and brand and OEM and manufacturing and general conceptual stuff. Really been two years where I can attest to you that going to OEMs and saying, how are we going to grow, was met with the response of supply chain difficulty. OEMs have capacity, but yet, they have to have supply chain constraints. And in that environment, it's almost kind of bizarre, honestly, to go to our OEMs and say, how do we grow, what do we add, what brands can we go to market with, what incrementally can we do with you to help you grow and to be told you'll have to wait. So now we have that opportunity ahead of us in the next couple of years to play offense. We think the supply chain is better. There's still more to do. We're going through a big product transition as we head into next year. But that's a very unique and important opportunity that doesn't have much to do with our discussion on efficiency. It has everything to do with how do we use our balance sheet and how do we use our presence, how do we use our structure, how do we use our technology, to go grow brands and grow our relationships beyond where they are. So I think I would put that aside as a discrete strategy. And on the efficiency side, it's again a very kind of simple story to tell. We have to go prosecute and execute the strategy, but it has been a wild two years. There has really been nothing customary, nothing that's been ordinary in dealing with both the strength of the market, the real difficulties by the supply chain, you have a lot of inflation going on, you have really a fire drill going on to serve customers. And we were at no time going to look at cost as the critical item in serving customers in this environment. We were going to do anything it took to serve customers in this environment. So we're out of season as we head into the shoulder season here in the fall, and the message is very clear to our leadership, Al has made that message extremely clear, about stepping back from the business, looking at cost, looking at cost to serve, looking at efficiency, looking at technology and challenging them to be more productive as we get into the next environment. Paul, anything?\nPaul Johnston: Yes. It's \u2013 the supply chain disruption obviously caused a dysfunction in our productivity, and that was basically around being able to match up systems, having an outdoor unit in one warehouse and an indoor unit in another warehouse. So it did stretch our people to be able to satisfy the customer and make sure that we were able to put the pieces together so that they could complete the job that they were on. And so that did create some dysfunction, as I said, in our ability to improve the efficiency with all the tools that we provided to our people. The second thing that we're going to be going through now is, as we go through the transition to the new product line, it's obviously going to reduce the number of SKUs. It's going to hopefully simplify the supply chain. And hopefully, we'll have a long-term benefit from that going into 2023 and beyond.\nAlbert Nahmad: A.J.?\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes, I'll just add some figures to give you some sense of scale. We process and fulfill roughly 7 million customer orders every year. That's product going out. Product coming in, receiving of product coming in, there's also millions of receiving touches that we have to do with the products. And then we move product around our 700 or so locations with 800 or so vehicles and lots of forklifts and lots of humans and lots of touching of the product various times. And like Barry said, given the supply chain challenges and not necessarily receiving product when we hope to receive them or in the locations we hope to receive them or in the quantities have \u2013 we'd like to receive them, and the surge in demand, there's a lot of scrambling going on. And the policy \u2013 or not the policy, but the \u2013 our heart was to fill customer orders, take care of our customers. Well, now as things start to calm down, if you will, a little bit in the supply chain, and we expect them to continue to \"normalize\", we'll have more opportunity to improve our processes, improve our technologies, improve our ability to smoothly receive all those products, move products around less, because we'll have products in the right place at the right time and the right quantity, get customer orders filled accurately and on time and efficiently. So I'm just trying to give you some sense of scale of the operation and the chaos that ensued. And now as the chaos calms down, we can really drive some productivity and efficiency through the system.\nTommy Moll: All very helpful, thank you and as a follow-up I wanted to hit on technology investment. Is it safe to assume that, that's a separate discussion here, and that you'll remain forward-leaning, I guess, we could say, on technology investment? Any view you could give us there for the coming quarters would be helpful. And just to throw out a couple of data points that maybe you could discuss. I just \u2013 I noted the contractor-assist users were up meaningfully quarter-over-quarter. OnCall Air quotes were down meaningfully quarter-over-quarter. I realize there's a lot of noise in those KPIs that you give us every quarter. But to the extent you want to clarify any of those trends, it would be helpful as well. Thank you.\nA.J. Nahmad: I don't think that last specific is accurate. Right, Barry? OnCall Air quotes?\nBarry Logan: When you say quarter-over-quarter, you're talking about second quarter versus third quarter, or sequentially? Is that what you're looking at?\nTommy Moll: Correct.\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes. We had to look at it year-over-year because there is seasonality in the business. But I mean, starting with OnCall Air \u2013 yes, go ahead, Barry.\nBarry Logan: No. I would say there is a seasonality aspect to that answer. Yes.\nA.J. Nahmad: Right. But no, OnCall Air is thriving. And the customers of ours that are using it, which is a growing number, their performance with us, I mean, their sales growth rate with us is significantly higher than non-users. They're winning more times in the marketplace and that leads to more purchases from our business units. As for technology in general, will we continue to lean in and be a technology-driven company? The answer is yes. I'd like to say maybe it's become clich\u00e9 now that we are a technology company that just happened to sell HVAC products. And technology, we really use that as an umbrella term. It really means modernizing the company, including people's skill sets, our processes, our systems, how we operate and how we are able to impact our customers as far as their experience and their ability to find the products they need, get orders delivered or fulfilled quickly and accurately. And really, technology touches all parts of who we are and what we do, and it's all customer-focused, and it's appreciated. The customers that are using our technologies are better customers. Their attrition rates are much lower and their growth rates with us are significantly higher. So those numbers continue to grow as far as customers using our tools. And we continue \u2013 we believe it's made an impact in our ability to take market share from our customer \u2013 from our competitors who don't have nearly the breadth or depth of the technology offering that we do.\nTommy Moll: Thank you both. I will turn it back.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Hi, hi. How is it going? So, yes, thanks for the question. Just wondering how we should think about your inventory levels as we go into year-end. And it sounds \u2013 it looked like third quarter, we're kind of back on a more seasonal path of lower inventories in 3Q versus 2Q. But just wondering how you're managing inventories into year-end and of course curious about the 14 SEER versus 15 SEER dynamic as well.\nAlbert Nahmad: Those are two great questions. All I can generalize is inventory will be lower, and we hope not to have any or very few units that wouldn't qualify in the South given the efficiency mandate in the South. We're very conscious of that, but let me give you more in-depth that would be Paul.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. Nigel, we monitor the straight-cool units in the South to make sure that we have a smooth landing at year-end when those units become basically obsolete in the South. So we feel we're on the right trajectory there. We're going to beginning to receive the new products, hopefully, in late October, early November. So we'll be set up to be in business on January 1st. The new product will be more expensive than the existing products we have. But generally speaking, the inventories are a little bit restrained right now in certain product areas. And in other product areas on heat pumps, for instance, we have sufficient product to guide us through at least the fourth quarter and into the first quarter.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thanks Paul. And then just my follow-on is really around, I don\u2019t know if you want to throw out the price mix impact in HVAC products this quarter in residential.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes, we did.\nNigel Coe: You do that like you do sometimes.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes, we did do that.\nNigel Coe: Sorry. Okay. I'll go back to that. I missed that one. I'm sorry.\nAlbert Nahmad: It's in the press release Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Okay, got it. Got it. My eyesight is terrible. But if we think about, you mentioned the hurricane obviously a tragedy for Florida, but just wondering what impact you saw in the quarter? And what opportunity do you see from the rebuild as far as HVAC is concerned?\nPaul Johnston: This is Paul. I live in Fort Myers, so I'm right in the middle of the of the hurricane zone here. And I've been out visiting our branches and I was very proud to say that our branches were open within 24 to 48 hours after the hurricane passed. And taking tours of them we had one branch that was missing 160 feet of its wall, and there were 10 trucks lined up outside, and we had \u2013 our staff was there doing their job and filling orders. What did we lose in the quarter? It's an estimate, I would say, somewhere between $16 million and $18 million worth of business was probably pushed either into Q4 or perhaps is going to be lost. However, we've got a very strong market share presence in the three counties that were impacted. We've got 12 branches. It's a marketplace which is about equivalent to the size of the state of Louisiana. So, obviously as the work begins, we expect to see some upside in this marketplace. It's tragic that creates business, but we are here to help everybody get their lives normal again.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes, I would say just add color to that, we had about 40 locations under hurricane warning that had an irritation during the quarter, another 200 under hurricane watch that I'm sure there was some distraction. As that plays out into the fourth quarter there is some short term, immediate requirements to fix systems. What we have seen in other markets where there is destruction like this is and just conceive of a $20 billion insurance claim collectively in aggregate flowing capital into a market like this. And some portion of that $20 billion is our stuff that is part of either rebuilding, remodeling, or retrenching, or new building in that case. So there is a longer tail than just one quarter, but it's one of those events where we are witnessing the old destruction. And again, to some extent that's an opportunity for those markets within our business.\nNigel Coe: Right. Okay. Thanks.\nAlbert Nahmad: I'm happy to add that none, no serious injury to any of our employees, which we care a lot, quite a bit of \u2013 who were employed during the areas of the hurricane.\nPaul Johnston: Oh man, Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeff Hammond: Hey, good morning guys.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hey, good morning.\nJeff Hammond: So just wanted to come back on Nigel\u2019s questions on inventory. Maybe just speak to what you're seeing from your OEMs and parts suppliers around lead times and just, I think, Al you said inventory is going to be lower in the fourth quarter. And I don't know if that's a seasonal comment, but we've just seen some aggressive destocking in other kind of building products area, not so much HVAC. And I'm just wondering as you see lead times, what's the kind of the want and willingness to kind of bring inventory levels more normal?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well I would say generally speaking the manufacturers did the best they could, but in more cases than not, they were not able to deliver either on time or a complete order they would send the out outdoor unit, but not the indoor unit. And so we had the inventory something we weren't going to be able to sell until they fulfill the second part of the order, that sort of thing. And since they are catching up, we're going to be getting complete systems, especially with the new products that are coming out towards the end of the year. And that's why, I think, that not only will the inventory come down, but the cash flow will come down because everything is going to get better in the point of view of investing in inventory, and improving the mix of what's in the inventory. Anybody want to add to that?\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes. I think I indicated this earlier; the one good feature about the change to the higher efficiency products is a fairly large reduction in the number of SKUs that we have to handle. And what our hope is obviously is that as the number of SKUs come down, that makes it more efficient for us to be able to have the right inventory and a lower inventory at the same time, should also make it a simpler manufacturing process we hope for our manufacturers so that they will be able to provide us the products that we need. So, we're still having some problems. There still is sporadically something will go haywire at the manufacturing plants and we'll have a shortage of something. We're experiencing increasing demand as we indicated in the press release on heat pumps, we're seeing increasing demands on commercial products and we have a continuous demand increase that we've seen over the last several years on ductless products.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, from what can see in October the numbers throw strong growth, which is another reason why I feel good about the inventory?\nJeff Hammond: Okay, great color. Just on gross margins I know there has been a lot of questions on that. I think Barry last couple calls you kind of talked about some of the structural improvements and kind of a new target of 27% gross margins. I think you are there this quarter. I'm just wondering if that's a reasonable target for kind of 4Q and into 2023 or if we start to maybe dip below that as some of the inflation normalizes. Thanks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry you are on?\nBarry Logan: Yes, I am. Jeff, just to give some color first in the quarter, let's speak very narrowly about the quarter, the key business, component of gross profit in the business is what we simply call selling margin. What is our price cost effectiveness during the quarter and during the third quarter that was raised about 80 basis points. So we were still seeing higher margins in that kind of raw margin aspect of us selling products that will \u2013 there is not a reason to think that will change much as we play out the rest of this year. And so that's the positive. The negative was part of gross profit also is how we pay vendors when we pay vendors to the extent there is volatility and paying vendors. And there are cash discounts, there are vendor incentives, there are rebates that flow in that equation. And that volatility in a quarter that took away some of the gross profit profitability this quarter. So that's a short term one quarter conversation. Longer term, the good news is the price cost selling margin actually increased meaningfully this quarter.\nAlbert Nahmad: The selling margins, there you go again. That's the healthy part of our business.\nJeff Hammond: Okay, that's great color. I appreciate it guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Merkel: Hey, good morning. Good morning. So I wanted to pick up on the gross margin questions. So just to clarify, year-over-year you are saying that there was a positive 80 basis points of positive price costs, but that was offset by what rebates being lower?\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes.\nRyan Merkel: And if that\u2019s the case, why would rebates be so much lower in one quarter? I don't recall ever seeing that in the past.\nAlbert Nahmad: It's because of the level of purchasing activity and receipt activity a year ago versus this year. And that's where the chunk and the funkiness of inventory receipts that have kind of have been volatile play out a year later. So I would say a year ago there was a benefit in gross profit relative to the timing of receipts of inventory a year later a bit of an air pocket. We're talking about 30 basis points to put that in perspective.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Okay. And then gross margins were flat year-over-year, so what was the other part that offset the positive price cost?\nBarry Logan: Freight, inter-branch freight where we moved products around was negative in the quarter for all the reasons that we're talking about when we talk about freight and moving products around that's an inefficiency in gross profit year-over-year.\nRyan Merkel: I got it. Okay. So how do we think about the trend then? I would presume that the positive price cost situation will be with us for a bit. And then what about those other pieces? How do you think those will evolve in the next couple of quarters?\nBarry Logan: Yes, it does go back to the purchasing patterns. And again, inventory as we reduce inventory seasonally, which is normal through the rest of the year versus what we did last year; there could be a small amount of volatility in that. I would have to go back and look at a year ago, but I don't think to the same extent as what we saw in the third quarter. And as far as moving inventory around, I think, that is better, but still an irritant. And it's probably one of those a year from now opportunities to actually improve margin.\nRyan Merkel: Okay.\nBarry Logan: So, I would still stick with our target of 27% as a baseline. And some of those volatility that we're talking about this quarter flattens out or goes away as we get into next year.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Okay. That's what I was driving at. So thanks for that Barry. And then my last question, I just want to go back to the price mix impact in 2023 from this year change. So, I think what we're hearing is a lot of the OEMs are up sort of mid-teens for price increases on new base units, and I think there is actually some out there up 20. Are those the right numbers? And I think the mathematics would be price mix next year could be 6%, 7%, 8%, with carry over price from this year. Is that right?\nBarry Logan: I would say you are a little high. Everybody announces some of these price increases but, I think, what we're going to see is it probably, and this is a guess on my part, it\u2019s probably going to settle somewhere around the 10% to 15% range.\nRyan Merkel: I see. Okay. Great, thanks for that. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Manthey of Baird. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Dave.\nDavid Manthey: Hey, good morning Al. Good morning everyone. So playing off of that that pricing question, I apologize if I asked this before, but could you remind me the percentage of your parts and supplies products that might be more subject to commodity deflation, like steel ductwork and copper tubing and that sort of thing?\nAlbert Nahmad: Good question. Paul?\nPaul Johnston: Yes, it is copper tubing, it is steel. We sell a lot of steel. It's used in the production of ductwork. Refrigerant is another area that we look at, which is generally for us it's mostly 410A which, I think, is going to have upward price pressure throughout the next four to five years. And then our general parts business which is compressors and motors representing the largest portion of it. On the supply side it's everything from the ductwork that goes up there, the flex duct to insulation products, grills, registers, we've got gosh probably a couple hundred thousand SKUs when you get into that product.\nDavid Manthey: But when you look at that Paul just thinking about the types of products that are very sort of commodity heavy like copper tubing and steel, what percentage of your mix does that represent given that equipment and refrigerant are obviously seeing inflation, inflation, what components might see some deflation as commodity prices retrench?\nPaul Johnston: It would be, I would say, just hazard, I'd have to give you an exact number, but it would be south of 5%.\nDavid Manthey: Okay, yes.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes, I agree with that. I don't have to hazard it. I'm looking at the numbers. It is under 5%. Refrigerant, which is again, we label a commodity which has had nothing but inflationary reality was going on, is there, but as a group, that commodity group is still even with refrigerant right around 5% of sales.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Okay, thank you for that. And then a second, I hate to get too granular on this, but could we talk about the operating expense investment that you've been making here? And I'm looking at the OpEx level this quarter relative to a $2 billion revenue number. I'm just trying to understand, are all of those investments kind of at a full run rate in the third quarter? And then as we get the shoulder periods, some of your variable costs might come off a bit that the $3.22 million SG&A this quarter is a high watermark for the next couple of quarters, or were you implementing those programs during the quarter and we can actually see more of flatness or higher SG&A going forward? I'm just trying to understand the timing and what more we should expect as we look to the next couple quarters here.\nBarry Logan: Yes, I would say David first when we talk about 400 people, it's not recently, it's over the last couple of years. So that's just giving a big picture view that during what's been a tumultuous time, we've invested heavily to not just realized today's results, but investing, some of the future results that we're expecting. So, I would say it's a pretty mature looking number at this point in terms of what you see in a quarter. There are a lot of variable costs which moderate over time in terms of just moderating to what the top line and margins are doing. Gross margins are still up, over 25% this year that means every commission salesperson that sells off of gross profit, their income is up 25% this year. I wouldn't expect, I would like it, but I wouldn't expect that level of growth rate \u2013 I wanted to, but it's not going to sustain at that level obviously. So that would be a variable cost that moderates simply by the business, in terms of the scale of the business, changing, something like freight where it's a $60 million, $70 million number that's up 40%, 50% over the last 18 months, I would expect that to moderate for all the reasons that we're talking about. But also you have 675 branch managers that decide every day, how many people do I need? How many hours are we going to spend? How much overtime do I need? How much temporary help should I add? How many trucks should I own? And so when we talk about efficiency, it's going out to, and bringing data to the equation and culturally in the shoulder season and challenge kind of the thinking on what's going on in that regard. It's a lot of moving pieces.\nAlbert Nahmad: That's perfect.\nBarry Logan: It\u2019s a lot of moving pieces. A lot of moving pieces all of which have not been easy to manage the last two years and obviously become simpler to manage and obviously more critical to manage in terms of urgency over the next two years.\nDavid Manthey: Fair enough. Okay, Barry, thank you.\nBarry Logan: Robert Baird is thinking about those kind of discussions right now.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Volkman of Jeffries. Please go ahead.\nSteven Volkman: Hello. Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I'm wondering if we can just focus a little bit on kind of what you're seeing from the volume perspective, and I guess I'm sort of backing into volumes were kind of flattish this quarter, but I think maybe we started the quarter better than that. Did volume sort of decelerate through the quarter and Al you made a quick comment on October, I wasn't sure if that was a volume quarter or something specific, but we'd just love to hear what you're seeing there?\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. We haven't mentioned, I don't believe that there is a product mix going on which also elevates the pricing. I think Barry talked about that, I think that's probably the more significant \u2013 one of the more significant things that's going on. The product mix is changing and now as I think that's a plus, you only see is not unit sales as you otherwise would, but you see the sales that do occur, they occur at a higher price in the marketplace.\nBarry Logan: Right. Well, just to answer your question Steve, just on volumes, volumes were up \u2013 we're up in July. We reported that when we reported it in July. There was some moderation since then and, and pretty flat for the quarter and probably wanted the or probably would've been up a little bit if I try to account for some of the hurricane activity. But that's been kind of the way it's been now for six months. That's not a new trend. It's kind of been flattish unit growth now for really six months. What Al was speaking of is, what about everything else in terms of the business? And so obviously there's still a measure of inflation we're capturing in the market, but when we use the term heat pump and discuss that it's up 32% in a quarter and that's substituting for straight-cool units that are probably 10%, 15% less in price; that's mix, that's a price achievement in mix. And to the extent that trend simply continues, it's a permanent opportunity to have higher average selling prices. Also the SEER mix increased during the quarter and it's been going on now for about 11 years. You have contractors making recommendations, bringing solutions to the homeowner with confidence. We have technology in place that's triggering that opportunity in a much more professional way. And we're seeing another quarter of strong growth and energy efficiency mix and the government mandate next year makes that even more automatic. So when we use the word the term price and mix there's a lot of subtlety in that discussion and the heat pump discussion and this synergy mix \u2013 energy efficiency mix discussion, I think accounts for a lot of what we're talking about in price right now, not just inflation. Paul you can add color, I'm not sure there were any OEM pricing actions this quarter.\nPaul Johnston: No, there really outside of some commercial pricing actions, we didn't have any residential pricing actions that really affected the quarter. And as Barry indicates the heat pump growth was something that's been happening sequentially over the last three quarters and we saw it accelerate in Q3, expectation is for it to continue to grow as that grows, it does have a material impact on revenues and residential products.\nSteven Volkman: That's super helpful. And Al you anticipated my follow-on was on mix actually, because I've heard some channel checks sort of complaining that some of the high end units were hardest hit by supply chain issues and therefore were constrained. What's your view, does mix get even better because things normalize in 2023 or are we sort of stable?\nAlbert Nahmad: I certainly think that it gets better for us. Every trend that we see and anticipate is that many factors are contributing to consumers wanting to own higher efficiency products. And as Paul keep pointing out in a north where they were gas furnaces we expect them to be replaced by heat pumps because they're more efficient when they operate and they emit less CO2 when they're used. These are all very positive trends in the short- and the-long term. We are in the right place at the right time. I just like everything we're doing. To meet what has occurred and better yet, what's coming we just have some fabulous capabilities that no one else has, who can afford $48 million in technology investment a year than growing. Or if they can't afford if they're not committed to it as we are. And that continue \u2013 will continue our edge in terms of staying the leader in gaining share. So I can't think of anything at the moment that I would warn you that we see something negative in the early future. Everything I see is positive. Can you guys add to that A.J., Barry, Paul?\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes. We're seeing another trend that's starting to occur and that is where straight-cool units in the mid-south and the north are starting to be replaced by heat pumps as opposed to a straight-cool unit. And what that trend recognizes is a term that we call dual fuel, where the unit will operate as a heat pump down to a certain temperature, and then when the temperature drops below that point, it'll switch over to the gas furnace, not replacing the gas furnace just replacing the outdoor unit to provide non fossil fuel heating. And we've seen that growing and now it's starting to accelerate. We haven't \u2013 we have not talked about the tax credit and what impact that will have on the high efficiency product going into next year and beyond. There's still some adjustments to be made as far as what the efficiency has to be to qualify for it. Once that's clear, I think we'll have a clearer idea of what the opportunity's going to be with the \u2013 with the Inflation Recovery Act.\nSteven Volkman: All right. Thank you guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague of VRP. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Could you just remind us now just really kind of following on from the mix discussion, what percent of your sales in 2022 would've been at the prevailing minimum SEER level? And therefore is kind of subject to kind of the mandatory regulatory list in the 2023?\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul, go ahead, on the equipment sales.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. Its minimum efficiency in the quarter was approximately half on just the outdoor units.\nJeffrey Sprague: And that'd be a pretty good number for the year also, I suppose.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. It \u2013 that hasn't really changed that much. There's been a little bit of mix up in it because of the supply chain, but generally speaking that's a pretty good number.\nJeffrey Sprague: And just back to heat pumps, the numbers do seem particularly strong even before the IRA that come into play. I mean, are you proactively educating, like in many respects, I would think the average consumer doesn't know a straight air unit from a heat pump unit from air handler, right? So is there really a very proactive selling effort going on around heat pumps driving...\nAlbert Nahmad: I think there is a proactive among our contractors. Obviously it's their responsibility, they're the ones in the home. We've got on-call which assist them as far as making that presentation to the consumer. So I think that's a plus that Watsco has and Watsco's contractors have. But also there's been an awful lot of discussion. Bill Gates wrote a book on it. California now has passed the law, which states that you can have \u2013 they're going to be fossil fuel heating by the year 2030, you won't be able to buy a gas furnace and install it. There's been also motions in New York state parts of Canada that are starting to phase this out. The Department of Energy also has a, what they call a contest to come up with a low temperature heat pump and that's been led by the state of Minnesota. So I think the word is getting out to consumers. Heat pumps are not new, heat pumps have been around since the since the mid-1950s. It's just that it's taken a while for these things to really catch on for the technology to be able to provide a comfort heating situation for the consumer. And so what we're seeing is we're seeing the frost line if you will used to be the end of where you could sell a heat pump. And now we're seeing that extending up into Pennsylvania, New Jersey and even Massachusetts. And the science of these heat pumps is improving. They're doing more things that dealing with more extreme temperatures than the old ones used to.\nPaul Johnston: I was going to say that also, it's probably 10 years ago ductless was a fraction, a much smaller fraction of the market than it is now. And most every ductless residential unit or heat pumps, so if it's Mitsubishi or someone like that selling 20 SEER ductless systems, 95% of those are heat pumps.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great, Thank you, Paul.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Hey guys, how you doing?\nAlbert Nahmad: Great.\nSteve Tusa: So just on the, I guess just the forward look here; do you expect the fourth quarter to be kind of like normal seasonality for you guys on an EPS and sales basis? Just from a, I guess that would be sell through, I mean, what, you said it's up in October. How good is it in October and just how should we be thinking about the fourth quarter trend?\nAlbert Nahmad: I'll give you a general comment. I think fourth quarter is going to be very strong. Barry detailed?\nBarry Logan: Yes. Steve, I mean the same kind double-digit. Yeah, I mean you've seen double-digit growth over the last two quarters and October, there's no interruption in the double-digit trend and kind of leave it at that. I think it is a shoulder season as we get into off season and so it can be a bit more consumer oriented in the sense of that, but we also are seeing the very strong commercial volumes flowing through the business. So yes, now that looks a lot like the trends of recent months.\nSteve Tusa: I guess with all the cross currents around demand, the regulatory changes coming up and I guess your focus on destocking some, like what's the inventory trend in into 4Q? There's just a lot of moving parts here because it is a shoulder season. So I mean is that going to be kind of up, quarter-to-quarter in preparation of next year, like just maybe just a little color on the inventory?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, that's a good question. I don't think they are going to be higher; they are going to be lower. But anybody fill in the blanks on that.\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes, of course, our goal is to end up lower. A lot of it's going to depend once again, on the supply chain as far as how quickly we can restock with the new M1 product, or is the majority of that going to fall in Q1? Obviously, that's a higher price product than what we currently have. We're also seeing strong demand as a lot of the \u2013 on the new construction side, a lot of these builders have to have the system operating under the old standard. They have to have the system operating in the home, the new home that they're building before your end. So we're seeing a little bit of a rush from that sort of standpoint. And I think it's going to be \u2013 I think we're going to be down, our plan is to be down. And we're working \u2013 we've got inventory management system that allows us to have complete visibility of it. So we're not surprised at the end of the quarter by where our inventories are.\nBarry Logan: Let's just be careful of those words. We think our inventory is going to be down, not our business.\nSteve Tusa: Yes.\nA.J. Nahmad: That's what I said. Yes.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. So, inventory is a percentage of sales down a little bit. But I was just wondering from an absolute perspective. And then Barry, you mentioned these promotions or these rebates I guess, you call them. What's the expectation for that in Q4? And then just any color on the gross margin in Q4?\nBarry Logan: Again, the selling margin that I mentioned which is simply the price cost equation of selling products is we're seeing that continuing to trend better in October. Let's say it that way. And again, I don't think there should be any real disruption in the fourth quarter in that respect. The other stuff again, it's algebra on when we order products, when we receive them, when we pay for them, depending on which product line. And I think there could be a small measure of irritation just knowing the inventory is coming down but not to the same extent as what we saw in the third quarter. So net-net, I think, nothing disruptive in terms of trend of gross profit in the fourth quarter.\nSteve Tusa: Sorry, one last one for you. What's your market call on next year? What's your most up to date? You didn't have anything in the release this time around kind of the market outlook. What's your guess on the market for next year for resi units?\nBarry Logan: I don't think\u2026\nAlbert Nahmad: Resi on the overall market?\nSteve Tusa: Yes, overall resi unit market up, down, sideways.\nAlbert Nahmad: I don't think that we, unless you have industry forecast by the associations, maybe Paul, do you?\nPaul Johnston: No, I think you would have to talk to the OEMs who look at it a national basis. Our forecast that we do internally which is our proprietary system is only for the states in which we do business. So, I would look to the industry for that.\nSteve Tusa: Okay, great.\nAlbert Nahmad: Nevertheless, our planning is for another record year.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, growth. You guys are planning to grow no matter what.\nAlbert Nahmad: Oh, yes.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, Okay. All right.\nAlbert Nahmad: We've got too many advantages that are going to continue to expand our share in this business. And we're going to extend and invest more in those advantages.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, that's clear. Thanks guys.\nAlbert Nahmad: All right.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, thanks for your interest in our company. We appreciate it very much. And we welcome visitors to hear our more detailed explanation of the technology, which is obviously an important part of our future. And come to Miami or do a Zoom or whatever takes just to learn more. We're happy to do that for you. And once again, have a nice day. And see you the next quarter. Bye-bye.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Albert Nahmad",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO, and with me is A.J. Nahmad, President of the company; Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Before we start our usual cautionary statement, this conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Now on to the quarter. We delivered another record quarter. Sales grew 14% to a record $2.04 billion and operating income increased 14% to a record $236 million. This third quarter performance builds on what we believe will be a record year for our business. So far nine month sales increased 19% to a record $5.7 billion and nine months operating profits increased 37% to a record $694 million. Year-to-date cash flow also improved increasing 12% to $359 million. Now, given our earnings growth, cash flow expectations and our confidence in the business, we announced today at 11% increase in our annual dividend to $9.80 per share effective in January of 2023. Thought I might comment that we believe the last two years have been among the most challenging and also the most gratifying periods in our history. Our growth and stability speaks for the fundamental necessities of the products we sell and to the value that our industry provides homeowners and businesses. Given our long-term focus, Watsco has also invested over the past two years in people, technology and infrastructure and we do these things to build market share in our $50 billion market. As industry demand and supply chains normalized, it is the right time to expect more productivity and we have challenged our leadership to improve operation efficiencies across our network. We're also working closely with our OEM partners to develop forward-looking growth initiatives. Watsco does maintain good relationships with virtually every domestic and international industry manufacturer. We believe collaboration with the manufacturer is all the more important given the industry changes taking place in the coming years. Many views of our company fundamentals are in this morning's press release. I really do urge investors to read that release and understand why we believe we have an exciting future. We have an immense technology advantage and we're investing to grow that advantage. These technologies bring in new customers. They help our existing customers grow and they reduce attrition of customers and most important they help us gain market share. Our active technology user community has grown 21% this year to more than 45,000 users. And OnCall Air, that's a platform that reaches into homes, keeps growing. During the quarter contractors has presented quotes to approximately 66,000 households. That is a 39% increase in households over last year and generated $269 million in sales for our contractor customers. That is a 47% increase. Watsco's diversity of products and brands is an important competitive advantage that allows us to serve contractors in any economic environment. We also have a leading market share position in Sun Belt markets, where both population migration is greatest and the necessity of HVAC products is the most absolute. You got to have cooling and heating if you live in the Sun Belt. In addition, there are several important catalysts for growth that will play out in the next few years. For HVAC equipment, the minimum federal efficiency standards will increase in 2023 across the entire United States. Price points associated with these higher-efficiency products will increase and should benefit our 2023 results. Federal mandates are now in place to phase out high global warming potential refrigerants used in millions and millions of existing systems. But in 2025, we'll mark the introduction of new HVAC systems that will incorporate lower-GWP refrigerants. We also see a strong movement towards electrification of heating systems through the use of more heat pumps, which generally come at a higher price; higher margins; and in the long run, a shorter replacement cycle. Our sales of the heat pumps grew 27% in the first nine months and interesting 32% during the quarter, outpacing overall sales growth rates. The new Inflation Reduction Act, which takes effect next year, also provides tax credits and incentives for qualified efficiency upgrades and electrification. All of this provides the basis for homeowners and businesses to upgrade systems that will, over time, be more efficient and more environmentally friendly. And all of this is good for climate change and good for Watsco. We certainly believe our scale, technology and financial strength position us to capture these new market opportunities. Finally, we always concern ourselves with our balance sheet so that we are in a position of financial strength. And today's balance sheet remains in pristine condition to invest in growth opportunities in coming years. I'd like to say that we can fund almost any size of investment to grow our business. With that, let's go on to Q&A. Good morning. Of course. I think that's an excellent question, and I'm going to have Barry Logan and Paul Johnston answer that and A.J. Nahmad. You're going to get a trifecta here. A.J.? Good morning, Nigel. Those are two great questions. All I can generalize is inventory will be lower, and we hope not to have any or very few units that wouldn't qualify in the South given the efficiency mandate in the South. We're very conscious of that, but let me give you more in-depth that would be Paul. Yes, we did. Yes, we did do that. It's in the press release Nigel. Yes, I would say just add color to that, we had about 40 locations under hurricane warning that had an irritation during the quarter, another 200 under hurricane watch that I'm sure there was some distraction. As that plays out into the fourth quarter there is some short term, immediate requirements to fix systems. What we have seen in other markets where there is destruction like this is and just conceive of a $20 billion insurance claim collectively in aggregate flowing capital into a market like this. And some portion of that $20 billion is our stuff that is part of either rebuilding, remodeling, or retrenching, or new building in that case. So there is a longer tail than just one quarter, but it's one of those events where we are witnessing the old destruction. And again, to some extent that's an opportunity for those markets within our business. I'm happy to add that none, no serious injury to any of our employees, which we care a lot, quite a bit of \u2013 who were employed during the areas of the hurricane. Hey, good morning. Well I would say generally speaking the manufacturers did the best they could, but in more cases than not, they were not able to deliver either on time or a complete order they would send the out outdoor unit, but not the indoor unit. And so we had the inventory something we weren't going to be able to sell until they fulfill the second part of the order, that sort of thing. And since they are catching up, we're going to be getting complete systems, especially with the new products that are coming out towards the end of the year. And that's why, I think, that not only will the inventory come down, but the cash flow will come down because everything is going to get better in the point of view of investing in inventory, and improving the mix of what's in the inventory. Anybody want to add to that? Well, from what can see in October the numbers throw strong growth, which is another reason why I feel good about the inventory? Barry you are on? The selling margins, there you go again. That's the healthy part of our business. Good morning, Ryan. Yes. It's because of the level of purchasing activity and receipt activity a year ago versus this year. And that's where the chunk and the funkiness of inventory receipts that have kind of have been volatile play out a year later. So I would say a year ago there was a benefit in gross profit relative to the timing of receipts of inventory a year later a bit of an air pocket. We're talking about 30 basis points to put that in perspective. Good morning, Dave. Good question. Paul? Yes, I agree with that. I don't have to hazard it. I'm looking at the numbers. It is under 5%. Refrigerant, which is again, we label a commodity which has had nothing but inflationary reality was going on, is there, but as a group, that commodity group is still even with refrigerant right around 5% of sales. That's perfect. Yes. We haven't mentioned, I don't believe that there is a product mix going on which also elevates the pricing. I think Barry talked about that, I think that's probably the more significant \u2013 one of the more significant things that's going on. The product mix is changing and now as I think that's a plus, you only see is not unit sales as you otherwise would, but you see the sales that do occur, they occur at a higher price in the marketplace. I certainly think that it gets better for us. Every trend that we see and anticipate is that many factors are contributing to consumers wanting to own higher efficiency products. And as Paul keep pointing out in a north where they were gas furnaces we expect them to be replaced by heat pumps because they're more efficient when they operate and they emit less CO2 when they're used. These are all very positive trends in the short- and the-long term. We are in the right place at the right time. I just like everything we're doing. To meet what has occurred and better yet, what's coming we just have some fabulous capabilities that no one else has, who can afford $48 million in technology investment a year than growing. Or if they can't afford if they're not committed to it as we are. And that continue \u2013 will continue our edge in terms of staying the leader in gaining share. So I can't think of anything at the moment that I would warn you that we see something negative in the early future. Everything I see is positive. Can you guys add to that A.J., Barry, Paul? Paul, go ahead, on the equipment sales. I think there is a proactive among our contractors. Obviously it's their responsibility, they're the ones in the home. We've got on-call which assist them as far as making that presentation to the consumer. So I think that's a plus that Watsco has and Watsco's contractors have. But also there's been an awful lot of discussion. Bill Gates wrote a book on it. California now has passed the law, which states that you can have \u2013 they're going to be fossil fuel heating by the year 2030, you won't be able to buy a gas furnace and install it. There's been also motions in New York state parts of Canada that are starting to phase this out. The Department of Energy also has a, what they call a contest to come up with a low temperature heat pump and that's been led by the state of Minnesota. So I think the word is getting out to consumers. Heat pumps are not new, heat pumps have been around since the since the mid-1950s. It's just that it's taken a while for these things to really catch on for the technology to be able to provide a comfort heating situation for the consumer. And so what we're seeing is we're seeing the frost line if you will used to be the end of where you could sell a heat pump. And now we're seeing that extending up into Pennsylvania, New Jersey and even Massachusetts. And the science of these heat pumps is improving. They're doing more things that dealing with more extreme temperatures than the old ones used to. Good morning, Steve. Great. I'll give you a general comment. I think fourth quarter is going to be very strong. Barry detailed? Well, that's a good question. I don't think they are going to be higher; they are going to be lower. But anybody fill in the blanks on that. Resi on the overall market? I don't think that we, unless you have industry forecast by the associations, maybe Paul, do you? Nevertheless, our planning is for another record year. Oh, yes. We've got too many advantages that are going to continue to expand our share in this business. And we're going to extend and invest more in those advantages. All right. Well, thanks for your interest in our company. We appreciate it very much. And we welcome visitors to hear our more detailed explanation of the technology, which is obviously an important part of our future. And come to Miami or do a Zoom or whatever takes just to learn more. We're happy to do that for you. And once again, have a nice day. And see you the next quarter. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "The last part first, Tom, and just to give some sense of product and brand and OEM and manufacturing and general conceptual stuff. Really been two years where I can attest to you that going to OEMs and saying, how are we going to grow, was met with the response of supply chain difficulty. OEMs have capacity, but yet, they have to have supply chain constraints. And in that environment, it's almost kind of bizarre, honestly, to go to our OEMs and say, how do we grow, what do we add, what brands can we go to market with, what incrementally can we do with you to help you grow and to be told you'll have to wait. So now we have that opportunity ahead of us in the next couple of years to play offense. We think the supply chain is better. There's still more to do. We're going through a big product transition as we head into next year. But that's a very unique and important opportunity that doesn't have much to do with our discussion on efficiency. It has everything to do with how do we use our balance sheet and how do we use our presence, how do we use our structure, how do we use our technology, to go grow brands and grow our relationships beyond where they are. So I think I would put that aside as a discrete strategy. And on the efficiency side, it's again a very kind of simple story to tell. We have to go prosecute and execute the strategy, but it has been a wild two years. There has really been nothing customary, nothing that's been ordinary in dealing with both the strength of the market, the real difficulties by the supply chain, you have a lot of inflation going on, you have really a fire drill going on to serve customers. And we were at no time going to look at cost as the critical item in serving customers in this environment. We were going to do anything it took to serve customers in this environment. So we're out of season as we head into the shoulder season here in the fall, and the message is very clear to our leadership, Al has made that message extremely clear, about stepping back from the business, looking at cost, looking at cost to serve, looking at efficiency, looking at technology and challenging them to be more productive as we get into the next environment. Paul, anything? When you say quarter-over-quarter, you're talking about second quarter versus third quarter, or sequentially? Is that what you're looking at? No. I would say there is a seasonality aspect to that answer. Yes. Yes, I am. Jeff, just to give some color first in the quarter, let's speak very narrowly about the quarter, the key business, component of gross profit in the business is what we simply call selling margin. What is our price cost effectiveness during the quarter and during the third quarter that was raised about 80 basis points. So we were still seeing higher margins in that kind of raw margin aspect of us selling products that will \u2013 there is not a reason to think that will change much as we play out the rest of this year. And so that's the positive. The negative was part of gross profit also is how we pay vendors when we pay vendors to the extent there is volatility and paying vendors. And there are cash discounts, there are vendor incentives, there are rebates that flow in that equation. And that volatility in a quarter that took away some of the gross profit profitability this quarter. So that's a short term one quarter conversation. Longer term, the good news is the price cost selling margin actually increased meaningfully this quarter. Freight, inter-branch freight where we moved products around was negative in the quarter for all the reasons that we're talking about when we talk about freight and moving products around that's an inefficiency in gross profit year-over-year. Yes, it does go back to the purchasing patterns. And again, inventory as we reduce inventory seasonally, which is normal through the rest of the year versus what we did last year; there could be a small amount of volatility in that. I would have to go back and look at a year ago, but I don't think to the same extent as what we saw in the third quarter. And as far as moving inventory around, I think, that is better, but still an irritant. And it's probably one of those a year from now opportunities to actually improve margin. So, I would still stick with our target of 27% as a baseline. And some of those volatility that we're talking about this quarter flattens out or goes away as we get into next year. I would say you are a little high. Everybody announces some of these price increases but, I think, what we're going to see is it probably, and this is a guess on my part, it's probably going to settle somewhere around the 10% to 15% range. Yes, I would say David first when we talk about 400 people, it's not recently, it's over the last couple of years. So that's just giving a big picture view that during what's been a tumultuous time, we've invested heavily to not just realized today's results, but investing, some of the future results that we're expecting. So, I would say it's a pretty mature looking number at this point in terms of what you see in a quarter. There are a lot of variable costs which moderate over time in terms of just moderating to what the top line and margins are doing. Gross margins are still up, over 25% this year that means every commission salesperson that sells off of gross profit, their income is up 25% this year. I wouldn't expect, I would like it, but I wouldn't expect that level of growth rate \u2013 I wanted to, but it's not going to sustain at that level obviously. So that would be a variable cost that moderates simply by the business, in terms of the scale of the business, changing, something like freight where it's a $60 million, $70 million number that's up 40%, 50% over the last 18 months, I would expect that to moderate for all the reasons that we're talking about. But also you have 675 branch managers that decide every day, how many people do I need? How many hours are we going to spend? How much overtime do I need? How much temporary help should I add? How many trucks should I own? And so when we talk about efficiency, it's going out to, and bringing data to the equation and culturally in the shoulder season and challenge kind of the thinking on what's going on in that regard. It's a lot of moving pieces. It's a lot of moving pieces. A lot of moving pieces all of which have not been easy to manage the last two years and obviously become simpler to manage and obviously more critical to manage in terms of urgency over the next two years. Robert Baird is thinking about those kind of discussions right now. Right. Well, just to answer your question Steve, just on volumes, volumes were up \u2013 we're up in July. We reported that when we reported it in July. There was some moderation since then and, and pretty flat for the quarter and probably wanted the or probably would've been up a little bit if I try to account for some of the hurricane activity. But that's been kind of the way it's been now for six months. That's not a new trend. It's kind of been flattish unit growth now for really six months. What Al was speaking of is, what about everything else in terms of the business? And so obviously there's still a measure of inflation we're capturing in the market, but when we use the term heat pump and discuss that it's up 32% in a quarter and that's substituting for straight-cool units that are probably 10%, 15% less in price; that's mix, that's a price achievement in mix. And to the extent that trend simply continues, it's a permanent opportunity to have higher average selling prices. Also the SEER mix increased during the quarter and it's been going on now for about 11 years. You have contractors making recommendations, bringing solutions to the homeowner with confidence. We have technology in place that's triggering that opportunity in a much more professional way. And we're seeing another quarter of strong growth and energy efficiency mix and the government mandate next year makes that even more automatic. So when we use the word the term price and mix there's a lot of subtlety in that discussion and the heat pump discussion and this synergy mix \u2013 energy efficiency mix discussion, I think accounts for a lot of what we're talking about in price right now, not just inflation. Paul you can add color, I'm not sure there were any OEM pricing actions this quarter. Yes. Steve, I mean the same kind double-digit. Yeah, I mean you've seen double-digit growth over the last two quarters and October, there's no interruption in the double-digit trend and kind of leave it at that. I think it is a shoulder season as we get into off season and so it can be a bit more consumer oriented in the sense of that, but we also are seeing the very strong commercial volumes flowing through the business. So yes, now that looks a lot like the trends of recent months. Let's just be careful of those words. We think our inventory is going to be down, not our business. Again, the selling margin that I mentioned which is simply the price cost equation of selling products is we're seeing that continuing to trend better in October. Let's say it that way. And again, I don't think there should be any real disruption in the fourth quarter in that respect. The other stuff again, it's algebra on when we order products, when we receive them, when we pay for them, depending on which product line. And I think there could be a small measure of irritation just knowing the inventory is coming down but not to the same extent as what we saw in the third quarter. So net-net, I think, nothing disruptive in terms of trend of gross profit in the fourth quarter. I don't think..."

            "name": "A.J. Nahmad",
            "content": "Yes, I'll just add some figures to give you some sense of scale. We process and fulfill roughly 7 million customer orders every year. That's product going out. Product coming in, receiving of product coming in, there's also millions of receiving touches that we have to do with the products. And then we move product around our 700 or so locations with 800 or so vehicles and lots of forklifts and lots of humans and lots of touching of the product various times. And like Barry said, given the supply chain challenges and not necessarily receiving product when we hope to receive them or in the locations we hope to receive them or in the quantities have \u2013 we'd like to receive them, and the surge in demand, there's a lot of scrambling going on. And the policy \u2013 or not the policy, but the \u2013 our heart was to fill customer orders, take care of our customers. Well, now as things start to calm down, if you will, a little bit in the supply chain, and we expect them to continue to \"normalize\", we'll have more opportunity to improve our processes, improve our technologies, improve our ability to smoothly receive all those products, move products around less, because we'll have products in the right place at the right time and the right quantity, get customer orders filled accurately and on time and efficiently. So I'm just trying to give you some sense of scale of the operation and the chaos that ensued. And now as the chaos calms down, we can really drive some productivity and efficiency through the system. I don't think that last specific is accurate. Right, Barry? OnCall Air quotes? Yes. We had to look at it year-over-year because there is seasonality in the business. But I mean, starting with OnCall Air \u2013 yes, go ahead, Barry. Right. But no, OnCall Air is thriving. And the customers of ours that are using it, which is a growing number, their performance with us, I mean, their sales growth rate with us is significantly higher than non-users. They're winning more times in the marketplace and that leads to more purchases from our business units. As for technology in general, will we continue to lean in and be a technology-driven company? The answer is yes. I'd like to say maybe it's become cliche\u0301 now that we are a technology company that just happened to sell HVAC products. And technology, we really use that as an umbrella term. It really means modernizing the company, including people's skill sets, our processes, our systems, how we operate and how we are able to impact our customers as far as their experience and their ability to find the products they need, get orders delivered or fulfilled quickly and accurately. And really, technology touches all parts of who we are and what we do, and it's all customer-focused, and it's appreciated. The customers that are using our technologies are better customers. Their attrition rates are much lower and their growth rates with us are significantly higher. So those numbers continue to grow as far as customers using our tools. And we continue \u2013 we believe it's made an impact in our ability to take market share from our customer \u2013 from our competitors who don't have nearly the breadth or depth of the technology offering that we do. Yes. I think I indicated this earlier; the one good feature about the change to the higher efficiency products is a fairly large reduction in the number of SKUs that we have to handle. And what our hope is obviously is that as the number of SKUs come down, that makes it more efficient for us to be able to have the right inventory and a lower inventory at the same time, should also make it a simpler manufacturing process we hope for our manufacturers so that they will be able to provide us the products that we need. So, we're still having some problems. There still is sporadically something will go haywire at the manufacturing plants and we'll have a shortage of something. We're experiencing increasing demand as we indicated in the press release on heat pumps, we're seeing increasing demands on commercial products and we have a continuous demand increase that we've seen over the last several years on ductless products. Yes. We're seeing another trend that's starting to occur and that is where straight-cool units in the mid-south and the north are starting to be replaced by heat pumps as opposed to a straight-cool unit. And what that trend recognizes is a term that we call dual fuel, where the unit will operate as a heat pump down to a certain temperature, and then when the temperature drops below that point, it'll switch over to the gas furnace, not replacing the gas furnace just replacing the outdoor unit to provide non fossil fuel heating. And we've seen that growing and now it's starting to accelerate. We haven't \u2013 we have not talked about the tax credit and what impact that will have on the high efficiency product going into next year and beyond. There's still some adjustments to be made as far as what the efficiency has to be to qualify for it. Once that's clear, I think we'll have a clearer idea of what the opportunity's going to be with the \u2013 with the Inflation Recovery Act. Yes, of course, our goal is to end up lower. A lot of it's going to depend once again, on the supply chain as far as how quickly we can restock with the new M1 product, or is the majority of that going to fall in Q1? Obviously, that's a higher price product than what we currently have. We're also seeing strong demand as a lot of the \u2013 on the new construction side, a lot of these builders have to have the system operating under the old standard. They have to have the system operating in the home, the new home that they're building before your end. So we're seeing a little bit of a rush from that sort of standpoint. And I think it's going to be \u2013 I think we're going to be down, our plan is to be down. And we're working \u2013 we've got inventory management system that allows us to have complete visibility of it. So we're not surprised at the end of the quarter by where our inventories are. That's what I said. Yes."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Yes. It's \u2013 the supply chain disruption obviously caused a dysfunction in our productivity, and that was basically around being able to match up systems, having an outdoor unit in one warehouse and an indoor unit in another warehouse. So it did stretch our people to be able to satisfy the customer and make sure that we were able to put the pieces together so that they could complete the job that they were on. And so that did create some dysfunction, as I said, in our ability to improve the efficiency with all the tools that we provided to our people. The second thing that we're going to be going through now is, as we go through the transition to the new product line, it's obviously going to reduce the number of SKUs. It's going to hopefully simplify the supply chain. And hopefully, we'll have a long-term benefit from that going into 2023 and beyond. Yes. Nigel, we monitor the straight-cool units in the South to make sure that we have a smooth landing at year-end when those units become basically obsolete in the South. So we feel we're on the right trajectory there. We're going to beginning to receive the new products, hopefully, in late October, early November. So we'll be set up to be in business on January 1st. The new product will be more expensive than the existing products we have. But generally speaking, the inventories are a little bit restrained right now in certain product areas. And in other product areas on heat pumps, for instance, we have sufficient product to guide us through at least the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. This is Paul. I live in Fort Myers, so I'm right in the middle of the of the hurricane zone here. And I've been out visiting our branches and I was very proud to say that our branches were open within 24 to 48 hours after the hurricane passed. And taking tours of them we had one branch that was missing 160 feet of its wall, and there were 10 trucks lined up outside, and we had \u2013 our staff was there doing their job and filling orders. What did we lose in the quarter? It's an estimate, I would say, somewhere between $16 million and $18 million worth of business was probably pushed either into Q4 or perhaps is going to be lost. However, we've got a very strong market share presence in the three counties that were impacted. We've got 12 branches. It's a marketplace which is about equivalent to the size of the state of Louisiana. So, obviously as the work begins, we expect to see some upside in this marketplace. It's tragic that creates business, but we are here to help everybody get their lives normal again. Oh man, Thank you very much. Yes, it is copper tubing, it is steel. We sell a lot of steel. It's used in the production of ductwork. Refrigerant is another area that we look at, which is generally for us it's mostly 410A which, I think, is going to have upward price pressure throughout the next four to five years. And then our general parts business which is compressors and motors representing the largest portion of it. On the supply side it's everything from the ductwork that goes up there, the flex duct to insulation products, grills, registers, we've got gosh probably a couple hundred thousand SKUs when you get into that product. It would be, I would say, just hazard, I'd have to give you an exact number, but it would be south of 5%. No, there really outside of some commercial pricing actions, we didn't have any residential pricing actions that really affected the quarter. And as Barry indicates the heat pump growth was something that's been happening sequentially over the last three quarters and we saw it accelerate in Q3, expectation is for it to continue to grow as that grows, it does have a material impact on revenues and residential products. Yes. Its minimum efficiency in the quarter was approximately half on just the outdoor units. Yes. It \u2013 that hasn't really changed that much. There's been a little bit of mix up in it because of the supply chain, but generally speaking that's a pretty good number. I was going to say that also, it's probably 10 years ago ductless was a fraction, a much smaller fraction of the market than it is now. And most every ductless residential unit or heat pumps, so if it's Mitsubishi or someone like that selling 20 SEER ductless systems, 95% of those are heat pumps. No, I think you would have to talk to the OEMs who look at it a national basis. Our forecast that we do internally which is our proprietary system is only for the states in which we do business. So, I would look to the industry for that."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Albert Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.\nAlbert Nahmad: Morning, everyone. Welcome from rainy cloudy, Miami, Florida. This is our second quarter earnings call and this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. And with me is A.J. Nahmad, who is the company's President; Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Before we start our cautionary statement, this conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws, ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Onto our information. Watsco delivered another exceptional quarter. Records were set for virtually every measure of performance. Earning per share jumped 33% to a record four point -- sorry -- to a record $4.93 per share. That's a record $4.93 per share for the quarter. Sales grew 15% to a record $2.13 billion, which is our first $2 billion quarter. Operating income increased 32% to a record $287 million with margins expanding 180 basis points to a record 13.5%. We are particularly pleased with these results, given the strong comparisons against the second quarter last year. Now that was a heck of a quarter. Last year, same-store sales are up 29% and earnings per share was up 64%. That's the comparison that we're up against this last quarter, the second quarter of this year. Now for the first half of this year, earnings per share is up 53% and the record $7.83 on a 22% increase in sales. Looking at current trends so far in July, we see meaningful unit growth and additional price capture as inflation remains a reality in our industry. For the year, we expect 2022 will be another year of record performance. Then, looking to 2023, higher interest rates and perhaps an economics slow down is what we think about. We were reacting creative ways to take advantage of our scale, product diversity and technology leadership to sustain growth and build upon our growing market share no matter what comes in 2023. We have also asked our teams to focus on productivity and operating efficiencies, which have been more difficult to achieve the last two years, given the unprecedented supply chain, transportation and business disruption that have impacted all businesses, not just ours. We're also engaged with our OEM partners and working together to develop forward-looking growth initiatives. Watsco has deep relationships with virtually every domestic and internal -- international OEM. And we possess the best, most diverse brand portfolio of any distributor in our industry. More fundamentally, there are numerous reasons to be optimistic about our business and our industry in the medium and long-term. This morning's press release provides a number of additional data points that we feel support Watsco's growth trajectory. We have immense technology advantage in our marketplace, and we are investing to grow that advantage -- to grow with that advantage. Our technology investments are paying dividends in the form of higher customer engagement, reduced attrition and substantial market share gains. We have a market advantage in the breadth and diversity of products we sell across dozens of brands. Sorry, let me say that again. Our market advantage is the breadth and diversity of products we sell across dozens of brands and hundreds of product categories. This diversity allows us to offer the full variety of price points required in a market in most, any economic environment. In addition, we have a concentrated position into Sunbelt markets, where both population migration is greatest and the necessity of HVAC products is the most absolute. Now turning to something that's very important, that's the regulatory front. We have several important federal regulatory changes coming to provide opportunities for growth. The minimum federal SEER standards will increase in 2023 across the entire United States. The price points associated with these new products will be higher and should benefit 2023. Another very important regulatory change will occur in 2025 as the industry transforms or transitions to new refrigerants. Federal mandates are now in place to phase out the current high GWP, which means Global Warming Potential. Say it again. GWP, Global Warming Potential, refrigerants use millions of systems. OEMs are developing new products to incorporate the lower GWP refrigerant. To sum it up. There are significant opportunity for homeowners and businesses to upgrade systems that will over time be both efficient and environmentally friendly. We believe our scale, technology and financial strength position us extremely well to capture these new market opportunities. Finally, we're always concern ourselves with our balance sheet, so that we are in a position of financial strength. Today's balance sheet remains in pristine condition with a small amount of debt, and we can continue to funding investments to grow our business. We are fortunate to be the leader in such a key industry. As we mentioned, we feel there are and will be several important drivers as growth for company -- forward growth in our company in years ahead.  As always, we have presented only a small portion of our technology story in today's release. If you have any interest in learning more, let us know, and we will schedule time with A.J. and his team. We are always happy to share more about our progress. But with that, let's go on to questions and answers.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Morning, Tom.\nTommy Moll: Good morning and appreciate you are taking my questions.\nAlbert Nahmad: Of course.\nTommy Moll: So, maybe no surprise. I was hoping to start on gross margins this morning. So, a couple components here. I guess, maybe just to start, any update you can give us on some of the digital pricing optimization investment you've made that, that can impact that gross margin. And then, as a follow-up, any drivers you could call out, particularly from a sequential basis from first quarter to second quarter? And if anyone's willing to hazard a guess on whether that margin might be flat up or down in Q3, we'd all love to know that as well.\nAlbert Nahmad: I think the first part of your question is very well placed, because we do have technology that help us with that. And the second part of your question, that's a little more intense and we'll get some comments on that. A.J, you want to start?\nAaron Nahmad: Sure. Sure. First, to give you some context, you have to understand that we do business with about a thousand manufacturers and all of them -- I think, it's fair to say all of them have had probably multiple price increases over the last several quarters and years. So, just the administration of putting -- making sure that our systems are up to date with the latest cost basis from each of these suppliers and making sure that we have the right cost and price in the marketplace is enormous. And before we had the technology we do now in our pricing tool, I'm not sure we could do it, certainly not to the way -- not to the extent of proficiency and expertise that we did today. So, just the administrative burden has been eased by the tool itself. Land, you can start talking about the opportunity. The opportunity is to make sure that we capture the additional price in the marketplace that needs to be passed along to our customers and to their customers and to be reflecting of the inflationary environment. And our tools enable that and then enable to slice and dice and do analytics to find opportunities to maximize, or I should say optimize price by product, by category, by geography, et cetera. And the opportunities are endless. And it may just so you know it may not always be going up in price. It may also be going down in price. There are very -- there are definitely times where we are out of line with pricing and when we get in line, we can move product more efficiently and create, or I should say capture demand that's out there when we have the pricing correct. So, I'd say we're still early days with the tool, because the tool has really enables infinite opportunities. But it's an exciting and important opportunity that we have in front of us.\nAlbert Nahmad: Very good. You wanna repeat the second part of your second question please?\nTommy Moll: Sure. Any context qualitative or quantitative on the gross margin from first quarter to second quarter and to the extent you can give any insight on second quarter to third quarter.\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry, you want that?\nBarry Logan: Sure. Tommy, good morning. Well, first again, I'll answer the second part first, because it's a bit longer term and view. And last quarter, first quarter conference call, we talked about 27% as a longer term target for gross profit. And so, therefore, the amount of that target that's above historical levels is the structural and strategic and tactical progress, we believe we've made on gross profit. And we're in an inflationary environment, which we were have been in for the first half of this year, it'll -- it can be something more than the 27% and that's precisely what you see in the numbers year-to-date. Sequentially, it's noisy to be -- to give a simple thought, which I'll develop. And the noise is that in the first quarter with pricing actions by the OEMs, when we flip inventory for the first 90 days and -- in the smallest quarter of the year, the benefit of that spread is, is in gross profit and builds a gross profit that's higher, and that's where the 29% came from. It's really simply the timing and level of OEM pricing that came into the market. And when it came in, relative to our first quarter. So, the smoothing or the predictability or the projection of gross profit has to look over a longer curve of time than just one quarter. I don't -- I wouldn't want you to take every quarter that we report and try to -- get too many inferences out of it. Just listen to the long-term target, listen to the structural elements of what we've been doing. And if there's more inflation on the road, it's something that can be improved. If there's lack of inflation, then I think the target that I've mentioned is what the more likely event is long-term.\nTommy Moll: All very helpful and very much appreciated. I did also want to ask about SG&A. You highlighted that there have been some factors that -- some factors in play recently and that you may need to -- I believe the term was reevaluate to the extent that business conditions normalize. Can you give us your current thinking on the potential need to reevaluate there? And I guess ultimately what we're all trying to discern is in a -- in an environment where potentially you even see some reversal on input costs and maybe even some broader economic headwinds, can you still hold a double-digit operating income margin?\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: Yeah. Thanks Tommy. Well, first, it -- obviously, when you manage the business, you're managing all the pieces that, that end up being double-digit, either margin or not. So, it's -- if I focus on SG&A, there's been a complete lack of capability over the last probably 18 months, almost two years, lack of an ability to find efficiencies when supply chain was completely disrupted. You had exceeding demand in terms of chasing demand in the marketplace. You have competitive factors that we wanted to take advantage of. So, we hired more people brought in, in more customer service, more of everything in order to grow and our market share gains, or evidence of that accomplishment, all of that has to be built through SG&A. We also asked our vendors for programs and for benefits and economics, so that we could invest more people. We could open up more locations than we have. And obviously, the technology spinning has proliferated over the last two years for good reason, and with good results. So, now I've built that up. Needless to say, the message now is where are the efficiencies? Let's go -- let's put the nose to the grindstone, ask our teams, ask our leaders, ask our field people, ask our branch managers to take a breath. They're still very busy by the way. It's still a very busy season and business is still very good. But when we look out beyond the horizon, to some extent, SG&A has to be dealt within the creative and entrepreneurial way that that we know is possible.  Virtually every variable cost has increased in line with sales over the last two years. And remember, sales are probably up 25, 30% in the last 18 months, if I put that in perspective on a same-store basis. And so, variable costs will be dealt with, and whatever that variable picture looks like in the next 12 months. And then, you have a bunch of structural costs that have been frankly, again, built in a very inefficient environment that will become more efficient as time goes on.\nAaron Nahmad: If I can -- this is A.J. Let me give you another example of how this supply chain woes, have added to SG&A. And you can do the math of as things normalize, these SG&A costs should come out. As an example is that our vendors and our suppliers, they may be getting us high quantity of product, but it may not be the right mix of products in the right locations. For example, we may have more indoor units than outdoor units, and I'm making this up in one geography or vice versa. And so, we have spent an incremental millions of dollars simply moving product among our locations, so that we have matched systems that we can fill customer requests for. And that's a direct result of just the challenges in the supply chain. So, as things normalize, you would imagine that some of those additional costs should come out as well.\nTommy Moll: Appreciate all the insight and I'll turn it back.\nOperator: The next question will come from Ryan Merkel with WB. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Morning, Ryan.\nRyan Merkel: Hey, everyone. Good morning. First off, can you comment on sales trends exiting the quarter and into July? Just curious if there's been any slowdown in demand.\nAlbert Nahmad: You mean in the beginning of the third quarter?\nRyan Merkel: Yeah. Correct.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. We've been a -- we've seen a terrific increase in demand. Let's have Barry or Paul either one give you the numbers.\nBarry Logan: Go ahead, Paul.\nPaul Johnston: Okay. Yeah. Definitely Ryan, we've seen an uptick in the month of July, and it's been one in which we've seen different regions come to life and really give a pop. The most important two regions that are really performing well right now are in the Southeast and the Southwest, but we're seeing substantial increases, even compared to last year's July.\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry, you were going to add.\nBarry Logan: Yeah. I said from my career that I want to report in April and through September half and this quarterly dance that we get on with volatility would go away and that's I think what we're seeing. We're seeing very strong comps that were up against in the second quarter. We're seeing now very strong growth in July, which is the biggest month of the year, by the way, for our company. And the question is, is it some type of wall we've hit or is it simply a volatility discussion? And I believe it's more a volatility discussion versus what last year's performance was in the short analysis. The long analysis is that pricing and units are very strong as we're getting into the later part of -- getting into the third quarter.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Thanks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah. I think we commented the units are up mid single dig -- high -- mid single digit in the beginning of July.\nRyan Merkel: Beginning of July unit sales up mid single digits to high single digits?\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. Correct.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. That is very strong. And then, my second question is looking out to 2023 with the SEER change. I think there's some misunderstanding about sort of the impact. If you guys could unpack it, it would be very helpful. So, my understanding is you're going to see an increase on the base units, but you're also going to see an increase on SEER 16 and 17 because of the SEER 2 testing. So, my question is what could be the price mix benefit in 2023 when you put all that together with price carryover?\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul?\nPaul Johnston: I would say, right now, everybody is kind of scrambling looking at that number, trying to figure out exactly what the market price will be for the 16, 17. As far as the baseline products, the old 15 SEER, the new 14.3 SEER products is coming in. I would say that that's going to start in the mid teens up from what we currently have today at the 14 SEER level.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. So, asking in a different way, could roughly 75%, 80% of your equipment sales be up mid teens and price in 2023, or do we not have enough information to answer that at this point?\nAlbert Nahmad: Ryan, if you look at where we are today with -- the base products today represent about 75% to 80% of the sales volume for the industry market. And if you assume that that carries over into 2023, then yes, you would see a mid teen growth.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Okay. So punchline is price mix in 2023 is going to be pretty meaningful.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes, it is.\nRyan Merkel: Perfect. I'll pass it on. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question will come from Stephen Volkman with Jeffries. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Morning, Steven.\nStephen Volkman: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Can I just follow-up on that one? Because it feels like one risk might be that people who were choosing very high SEER product when they felt flush and 401ks were big and all that might choose sort of closer down to the minimum. And so, there could be like a negative mix shift on that. I gather you're not seeing that yet, but do you have any views on that?\nAlbert Nahmad: Go ahead, Paul.\nPaul Johnston: Okay. Steven, yeah, we have views. We have opinions. But obviously, it's very hard to predict what the consumer's going to do in the elasticity of it. There are definite differences between the high SEER and the standard SEER in the areas of comfort, reliability, warranty. There's a lot of soft differentiators besides the energy savings that they accrue. There's also a second element to it, which gets into both local and state rebates to the consumer. Also, we're getting into a situation where utilities become more aggressive in their rebate. As we -- we have disruptions in electric supply in the marketplace. So, if you did just a straight calculation and said, would there be a compression? I think we'd have to go back in history and say, and in the past, there has been a compression to the minimum SEER when we went from 10 SEER to 12 SEER and from 12 to 14 in the south. So, if that were to occur, I think you probably could lay out some historical numbers and see if that happens. But that would be just an estimate at this time.\nAaron Nahmad: Yeah. I think, it's also interesting to note -- it's interesting enough too -- sorry to interrupt -- is that part of the, I should say, a victim of the supply chain lows have been high efficiency systems. There's simply just not as many available for us to sell. So, our mix is at least somewhat affected by our inability to get those products from our OEMs and sell into the marketplace today.\nStephen Volkman: Great. And I think feels like you're reading my mind A.J. because my follow up was actually about supply chain. And I was wondering if you could just kind of comment, are we kind of back to normal, or is that overstating it and how do you see that playing out?\nAaron Nahmad: Well, I think, I think we're -- yeah, I think we're getting back to normal. The supply chain is good. However, there's -- there are disruptions in certain product areas, commercial unitary right now, very difficult to get any product in that. The large commercial products, very difficult, very long lead times. When you get to just the standard bread and butter product, we're seeing a pretty good supply chain right now where we're bringing in the indoor and the outdoor are actually coming together for a change. When we look into the future, all these manufacturers, all these OEMs are going to be changing over to a new product. Some of them completely redesign, some of the modifications of what they currently sell. So, I guess, in my heart, I think that we'll probably have some moderate disruptions as they go through the changeover to the new product line for 2023. And each one of them are going to perform in different manners. And that's the good news about Watsco. We have -- we represent just about everybody in the industry.\nStephen Volkman: Super. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Morning, Nigel,\nOperator: Perhaps you're muted. Mr. Coe.\nNigel Coe: Yes, I am. Thank you very much. Sorry about that everyone. Good. I'll say good morning again. Just on the 15% kind of mix up on the new sort of minimum SEER of units. Do you think that's going to wash with customers, because there's obviously a lot of inflation pressures right now. Are you seeing any signs of increasing pushback from the channel on pricing? \nPaul Johnston: Well, to date, we have not really seen any pushback on pricing. Obviously, demand remains strong. If you look at the industry itself, we're performing at record levels over the last two years with ever increasing prices. And I think as we moved in -- move into the new product, it's going to have higher efficiency. It's going to have other attributes which should be beneficial to the consumer. I wish I could read into what the consumer's mind is when it comes to the cost of a replacement of an air conditioning unit. It's unlike a car or any other staple that a consumer buys. It's something that -- there isn't a list price out there that they can go ahead and match. There's not a consumer report that tells them what a price should be. And each job as you recognize is custom. And so, it has different attributes and different issues that would affect the price to the consumer.  I think, particularly in the Sunbelt area, when it comes to the new products that we're going to be selling on the air conditioning side, it is a necessity. You're not going to live without it. So, if you have to replace a unit, I think most consumers going to find a way to be able to afford it and to do it. And the same holds true with gas furnaces and heat pumps in the north and in the Mid-Atlantic. Once again, if it's 20 below zero in Alberta, Canada, you're going to be changing out your gas furnace in that market. So, kind of an iffy question. I really don't know how the consumer's going to react. I don't think there's any good tests that we can put on it analytically to be able to determine what the analytics are or what the elasticity is for the consumer.\nBarry Logan: I think, Paul, just -- Paul, I just think to add to that, and this just adds a layer of another thought to that is the cost of repair today is probably escalated at even a faster rate than the inflation rate of new equipment. First, labor and materials that the contractor might prescribe for a repair has gone up, obviously materially. Refrigerant, which is used in most repair situations, either a compressor change out or a coil change out or something like that, that's multiplied in price over the last a couple years. And it's only going to get more expensive with the full teeth of the phase out of that refrigerant occurring. So, the cost of repair is no cakewalk and not a party. It's something that's become much more expensive as well. And contractors despise repair if they see a replacement opportunity. So, I think it's -- still it'll be interesting times, but I don't think the volatility is as great as other consumer products let's say.\nAlbert Nahmad: And touch consumer financing, Barry.\nBarry Logan: Yeah. And the root of how do people pay for these things historically has been cash and credit cards and potentially a small home equity line, but financing has really only -- explicit financing for these products has only been for elite homeowners and elite contractors that offer the -- that financing and versus broad based programs and so on. So, that's something that we are working on, on building on our invention, which is just called CreditForComfort, which becomes available to all of our customers and a much broader group of consumer capability, because it's not one finance company, it's a cascade of finance companies. So that's training, that's effort, that's launched, that's adoption. That's a curve that we're very early on. The long-term, this consumer financing side of things will become a component of -- will become a component of these calls and part of the backbone of what we're doing with technology.\nNigel Coe: Great. That's great perspective. Thanks Barry. Thanks Paul. And then, just my follow-on is really the perspective around 2023. And I know it's a long way away, but just curious why now, because it doesn't feel like you've seen a real break in the trend into July. No big repair versus replace changes. So, just wondering why now. And what do you think normal looks like? Whatever that means.\nAlbert Nahmad: I'm not sure I understood the question. Can you clarify that?\nNigel Coe: Yeah. I'm just -- sorry, I'm just wondering why the perspective today on 2023 just given it's some ways away.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, because we see the federal government changing the industry and changing what we'll be selling and changing what consumers will be faced to buy. And it's a big thing, is the regulatory environment, plus the ability to move to higher efficiency systems and reduce costs to the homeowner and contribute to the -- to our ability to help with the environment with emissions. Every time you move to a high efficiency unit, you're removing emissions from the planet because we're producing more cooling with less electricity. And if you produce less electricity, you're producing less emission. There are a lot of factors here. None of them are negative other than the earlier question was, how can a consumer afford this? And we're very motivated to help with that -- with our consumer financing. And I believe we have the best offer now to help the contractor bring the homeowner or the business owner onto a finance program. Now, we're not doing the financing. We lay that off to a series of different finance companies depending on the credit rating of the consumer. And that's just the beginning. So, it's hopefully, I gave you some answers, but wouldn't keep asking.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Well, that's very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hi, Jeff.\nJeffrey Hammond: Hey, good morning guys. Hey, so I just want to come back to this gross dynamic margin. I appreciate the color around the 27%. And it looks like versus a few years ago that's a nice 250 basis point benefit through kind of structural changes. But just as we look into the second half and 2023, it seems like this inflationary environment, whether it be regulatory or just carryon pricing, it seems like it's with us. So, just -- I guess, is the assumption as long as we stay ahead on where we see inflation, we run ahead of that number? And as inflation settles, we get back to that 27%.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, that's a good accounting question. Barry, do you want to deal with that?\nBarryLogan: Yeah. Jeff, I think, in general, I think if we all had a crystal ball and said what will inflation be a year from now, and yes, there's some unique things to our industry. But just general economic inflation, it will be less than today. I mean, we have a pretty huge federal government exacting monetary policy that sees to that, correct? So, just in our own kind of conservative way, we want to say that as inflation also comes back down to some reasonable level, the benefit of that in the distribution gross profit will also moderate. And that's a little bit of, I think, conservatism that we need to have and that's why the 27% is there. I don't think that -- the pricing actions are -- hit a wall instantly. They won't. There will still be pricing decisions being made across the market, across product lines, across OEMs. That will be a reality for probably the next 12 months. We're just trying to give a little bit of insight and level set the thinking beyond just the current year.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay.\nAlbert Nahmad: You have to remember also half our revenues in that approximate amount is not equipment. It's all the other stuff that keeps us -- that you need to install the air conditioner, to maintain the air conditioners, there are a lot of supplies, a lot of different things. And that's a solid business. The demand of that is more reliable to demand on the equipment. And that's generally at a higher margin.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. Great. And then, just back on commercial, it looks like maybe flattish in the quarter and maybe down on volume. But is that just simply a function of supply constraint? Or what are you seeing on the demand side?\nAlbert Nahmad: Certainly, we know the supply constraint is a big player. Anyone else have any comments on that?\nPaul Johnston: Yeah. It's been the worst nightmare. Demand on commercial is up. Supply is down. And lead times for unitary product and applied product, both have been extended out beyond what I've ever seen in my history in the industry. So, I think that's going to be just latent demand that we're going to pick up as supply picks up. I think those shops will be filled, but probably at a later date, not now.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. Appreciate it guys.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Morning, David.\nDavid Manthey: Hey. Good morning, everyone. And yes, Al, could you explain to us your cautious outlook here? Is this based purely on the macroeconomic data? Or are you seeing some kind of forward-looking indicators that indicate slowing demand, because I agree with the 2023 outlook? But when we're talking about pricing, it sounds like that's going to be up. We talked about the inelasticity of replacement demand. Really, all that's left is the minority of your business, which is new construction demand. Is that the piece that you're focusing on as it relates to the 2023 outlook?\nAlbert Nahmad: I don't believe we're trying to be negative on 2023. We're very positive about 2023. But you did put your finger on a small part of our business as sales to new construction. It's in the newspapers that startups are down, but that is a small part, and it's certainly a small part of our margins. That business is got a small margin for us. But I think we're pretty positive about 2023. Did you think that we were not?\nDavid Manthey: No. I just think that the way the press release read and talking about normalizing conditions and things, I think people automatically jump to that means slowing or negative growth. But if it didn't, that's fine, too.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, Barry wrote that thing. Barry, why you wrote that thing?\nBarry Logan: I glanced at something before the call which is interesting. And that's that if you look at six-month operating profit two years ago versus today, it's almost 2.5 times greater today. Put that in perspective. Two years ago, six-month operating profit versus this year's operating profit, it's almost 2.5 times greater. So, the messaging is, we love the growth rates, we love the structural profitability gains. But in terms of slower -- slower is not a bad thing. Slower can mean growth that's in -- and more in line with the historical trend, not 2.5 times the current thing two years from now. So, it's trying to pull the reins a bit on reality and expectations and also in the backdrop of the macro economy that we're in.\nAlbert Nahmad: Let me ask it this way. Do you think we're going to be in record territories in 2023?\nBarry Logan: I think we'll be in record territory in 2023.\nDavid Manthey: It's good to hear. Okay.\nAlbert Nahmad: For the year, yeah.\nDavid Manthey: All right.\nAlbert Nahmad: I mean, we're selling out all the things we think are going to drive demand. I mean, the regulatory thing is a big deal. Barry is saying that the growth rate of the industry is going to slow, because we were in an extraordinary period for the last two years, but that doesn't mean it's going to slow. It's going to go to normal. It's not going to go -- we don't expect some decrease in demand for all the factors that we've mentioned in terms of normality. No, we're very positive about 2023.\nBarry Logan: If I could throw one more thing in there. The same dynamics that create demand in our industry are still going to be in effect. And that is we still have an aging population that's -- looking at myself, I know I'm going to continue aging. We've still got migration and urbanization. Urbanization continues to grow as people move more and more to the cities and move more and more, frankly, to the cities that we like, in Texas, in Florida, in the Mid-Atlantic. We also see climate change and things happening in that area, which is going to impact and help our business, as well as a drive for more efficiencies. So, those are the four demand creators that we've had for the last 30, 40 years that I've been around, and they're going to continue in 2023.\nDavid Manthey: Great. That\u2019s helpful color.\nAaron Nahmad: I have to summarize it my way, which is this, this extreme growth market environment can't last forever, because it's too extreme. But no matter what the market conditions are, we expect to grow. We think there's a lot of tailwinds behind our industry. And then, as a company, we think we've made investments that will ensure growth for many years to come in the long-term.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, thanks for clarifying Barry's comment there A.J.\nAaron Nahmad: We should edit that one.\nDavid Manthey: Yeah. Great. Thank you for that.\nAlbert Nahmad: We're very positive. We're not negative for 2023 or beyond.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Got it. Okay. And second one, hopefully, see I can sneak this in here. As it relates to Barry's comment about SG&A growing in line with sales growth over the past couple of years, given how much of that revenue growth is due to price, is that seen as disappointing at all? Or maybe are there some expenses in there that were front end loaded that will easily come out of the SG&A operating expenses as things would normalize?\nAlbert Nahmad: That's a very good question. Why don't we try A.J., somebody that can comment on that or all three of you, Barry, A.J. and Rick?\nAaron Nahmad: Rick? How about Rick? Yeah. Why don\u2019t Rick?\nAlbert Nahmad: Yeah. Rick?\nRick Gomez: Morning, Dave.\nDavid Manthey: Good morning.\nRick Gomez: Well, yeah, I do think that there is a -- there are multi -- multiple facets to the SG&A question. First, just to give you some context on the year-to-date picture. When you look at the increment in year-to-date SG&A organically, a big, big chunk of that, almost half of it came in variable categories. We've already talked about freight and inter-branch freight. We've mentioned things like commissions and incentive comp in prior press releases. And in our minds, those are things that are largely self regulating in a slower growth environment, if that's, in fact, what we have in 2023, or a more normal growth environment. And so, there is a good understanding of what's variable? How does it moderate? And how do we expect it to behave in future periods based on different growth algorithms. The trickier question is on the fixed cost. And as we've said, we've made investments to sustain a higher business and to propel the market share gains that we've seen in the last two to three years. And so, we need to now look at some of those investments and figure out where they make sense, figure out what we can do to make them more profitable and more efficient. And, of course, we look at things internally, not just in terms of volume and price, but we look at it in terms of just what I referred to as the stock, right? It's branches. It's people. It\u2019s trucks. It's things that -- it's square footage, those things that we can measure almost independent of the inflationary environment. And that's what we said in the press release, we've challenged our leaders to make all those categories more productive going forward.\nDavid Manthey: All right. Thanks Rick. Thanks everyone.\nAlbert Nahmad: In other words, we have a lot of opportunity to get more efficient, and we know it. Because what's happened in the last two years, we were all scrambling, and scrambling costs us a lot. But that scrambling is going to decrease as the OEMs catch up. We still are short and high efficiency. And it's going to normalize. As things normalize, the SG&A will normalize to something that's -- as a percentage of sales, lower than what it is today, is our expectation.\nRick Gomez: Right. I would also add one more thing, which is that, on the technology front, we are still a young company as it relates to some of our internal facing technologies. So, we've talked about the pricing technology that's more margin-oriented. That's really only been in the hands of the masses in the company over the last 12, 18 months. And there is additional technology now being deployed to further that warehouse optimization. So, it is still very -- we are earlier in our journey on the technology front for some of that internal technology that's really aimed at productivity.\nDavid Manthey: Terrific. Thank you all.\nOperator: The next question will come from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nStephen Tusa: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nAlbert Nahmad: Morning, Steve.\nAaron Nahmad: Morning.\nStephen Tusa: And I guess, A.J. needs to help Barry write these press releases from here on out.\nAaron Nahmad: Yeah. But it actually works. Now we get the tease Barry for the next several weeks.\nBarry Logan: Right. That\u2019s right.\nStephen Tusa: That's worth it. That's definitely worth it.\nAlbert Nahmad: Very good. Steve. I didn't know you had that kind of humor.\nStephen Tusa: Seriously? I just stated it's a sign of a good CEO to point the finger at the guys that work for you, like Barry, you know that wasn't your press release.\nAlbert Nahmad: That's right. You're right.\nStephen Tusa: You guys mentioned July and you mentioned volatility. I mean, what did June look like? Because we've seen the HARDI data, we've seen the AHRI data. What did June look like for units for you guys?\nAlbert Nahmad: Mr. Logan?\nBarryLogan: June units -- I would say June dollars was a bit better than the quarter June units. I don't have, Steve, and that's getting a little bit granular. But I would say June was a better month than the others, and that momentum is even that much greater in July.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. So -- but the July comment was a unit comment or a dollar comment?\nBarry Logan: Both.\nStephen Tusa: So, the units up mid single -- so what are you saying on units and dollars for July again?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, he doesn't know what it was, units in July. He just knows the dollars.\nBarry Logan: I'll say carefully. Yeah. Units were up in June. And Al commented earlier, July units were up mid to high single digits.\nStephen Tusa: Yeah. Okay. Got it. All right. That's helpful. And so, on this kind of the great gross margin commentary, you guys have talked about what's normalized. We can see what happened in the first half and the second quarter. So, if that's kind of a normalized number that you should trend along, is there a quarter here where as the inflationary dynamics change, that you would go below that number for a period of time and then obviously, bounce back as things \"normalize\". Will there be -- because 1Q to 2Q, there's some volatility there. Is there a continued volatility as we move forward in the next couple of quarters on that? Would that go below the 27% normalized at some point?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, who wants that one?\nPaul Johnston: I'm pointing to Barry.\nStephen Tusa: Al is going to come back around you, if you're not careful. He is going to come right back around you.\nBarry Logan: I think it's my 128th press release, by the way, just for the sign of the math, and I'll stand by my long-term track record.\nPaul Johnston: The obvious answer is we're very focused on gross profit. We have tools that are helping us. And we want to do 27%. We want to do better. Can we predict it? I'm not sure we can, but we feel pretty comfortable on that number going forward or better.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. Okay.\nPaul Johnston: I mean, there could be ups and downs, but we're very focused on margins. I would like to if I want to speculate -- and this is pure speculation -- my goal is to get it to 15% EBIT margin eventually.\nStephen Tusa: Got it. Okay. And then one last one. Are we close to the end of the OEM's residential equipment price increases?\nPaul Johnston: No.\nBarry Logan: Yeah. I think we're very close to the end of that as we reach forward and introduce the new products that are going to be coming in. Probably in the fourth quarter, we'll see a price increase then.\nStephen Tusa: Right on those -- on the new ones, but not a like-for-like on the existing ones?\nBarry Logan: No, no.\nStephen Tusa: Yeah.\nAlbert Nahmad: Don't forget, Steve, that a lot of -- half the United States will be unable to sell lower efficiency air conditioners.\nStephen Tusa: Yeah. Yeah.\nAlbert Nahmad: So, that's an inventory trick. But the stuff that we will be selling is the new stuff, and they're coming at higher prices. We already know that.\nStephen Tusa: Right. Right. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it.\nAlbert Nahmad: All right.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, thanks very much for your continued interest in Watsco. We try to keep it light -- our conversations. But this is a serious leadership team. And we hope you have enjoyed our story. And we hope to continue giving you good news as the quarters go on. So, thanks again for your interest. Bye-Bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "Sure. Tommy, good morning. Well, first again, I'll answer the second part first, because it's a bit longer term and view. And last quarter, first quarter conference call, we talked about 27% as a longer term target for gross profit. And so, therefore, the amount of that target that's above historical levels is the structural and strategic and tactical progress, we believe we've made on gross profit. And we're in an inflationary environment, which we were have been in for the first half of this year, it'll -- it can be something more than the 27% and that's precisely what you see in the numbers year-to-date. Sequentially, it's noisy to be -- to give a simple thought, which I'll develop. And the noise is that in the first quarter with pricing actions by the OEMs, when we flip inventory for the first 90 days and -- in the smallest quarter of the year, the benefit of that spread is, is in gross profit and builds a gross profit that's higher, and that's where the 29% came from. It's really simply the timing and level of OEM pricing that came into the market. And when it came in, relative to our first quarter. So, the smoothing or the predictability or the projection of gross profit has to look over a longer curve of time than just one quarter. I don't -- I wouldn't want you to take every quarter that we report and try to -- get too many inferences out of it. Just listen to the long-term target, listen to the structural elements of what we've been doing. And if there's more inflation on the road, it's something that can be improved. If there's lack of inflation, then I think the target that I've mentioned is what the more likely event is long-term. Yeah. Thanks Tommy. Well, first, it -- obviously, when you manage the business, you're managing all the pieces that, that end up being double-digit, either margin or not. So, it's -- if I focus on SG&A, there's been a complete lack of capability over the last probably 18 months, almost two years, lack of an ability to find efficiencies when supply chain was completely disrupted. You had exceeding demand in terms of chasing demand in the marketplace. You have competitive factors that we wanted to take advantage of. So, we hired more people brought in, in more customer service, more of everything in order to grow and our market share gains, or evidence of that accomplishment, all of that has to be built through SG&A. We also asked our vendors for programs and for benefits and economics, so that we could invest more people. We could open up more locations than we have. And obviously, the technology spinning has proliferated over the last two years for good reason, and with good results. So, now I've built that up. Needless to say, the message now is where are the efficiencies? Let's go -- let's put the nose to the grindstone, ask our teams, ask our leaders, ask our field people, ask our branch managers to take a breath. They're still very busy by the way. It's still a very busy season and business is still very good. But when we look out beyond the horizon, to some extent, SG&A has to be dealt within the creative and entrepreneurial way that that we know is possible.  Virtually every variable cost has increased in line with sales over the last two years. And remember, sales are probably up 25, 30% in the last 18 months, if I put that in perspective on a same-store basis. And so, variable costs will be dealt with, and whatever that variable picture looks like in the next 12 months. And then, you have a bunch of structural costs that have been frankly, again, built in a very inefficient environment that will become more efficient as time goes on. Go ahead, Paul. Yeah. I said from my career that I want to report in April and through September half and this quarterly dance that we get on with volatility would go away and that's I think what we're seeing. We're seeing very strong comps that were up against in the second quarter. We're seeing now very strong growth in July, which is the biggest month of the year, by the way, for our company. And the question is, is it some type of wall we've hit or is it simply a volatility discussion? And I believe it's more a volatility discussion versus what last year's performance was in the short analysis. The long analysis is that pricing and units are very strong as we're getting into the later part of -- getting into the third quarter. I think, Paul, just -- Paul, I just think to add to that, and this just adds a layer of another thought to that is the cost of repair today is probably escalated at even a faster rate than the inflation rate of new equipment. First, labor and materials that the contractor might prescribe for a repair has gone up, obviously materially. Refrigerant, which is used in most repair situations, either a compressor change out or a coil change out or something like that, that's multiplied in price over the last a couple years. And it's only going to get more expensive with the full teeth of the phase out of that refrigerant occurring. So, the cost of repair is no cakewalk and not a party. It's something that's become much more expensive as well. And contractors despise repair if they see a replacement opportunity. So, I think it's -- still it'll be interesting times, but I don't think the volatility is as great as other consumer products let's say. Yeah. And the root of how do people pay for these things historically has been cash and credit cards and potentially a small home equity line, but financing has really only -- explicit financing for these products has only been for elite homeowners and elite contractors that offer the -- that financing and versus broad based programs and so on. So, that's something that we are working on, on building on our invention, which is just called CreditForComfort, which becomes available to all of our customers and a much broader group of consumer capability, because it's not one finance company, it's a cascade of finance companies. So that's training, that's effort, that's launched, that's adoption. That's a curve that we're very early on. The long-term, this consumer financing side of things will become a component of -- will become a component of these calls and part of the backbone of what we're doing with technology. Yeah. Jeff, I think, in general, I think if we all had a crystal ball and said what will inflation be a year from now, and yes, there's some unique things to our industry. But just general economic inflation, it will be less than today. I mean, we have a pretty huge federal government exacting monetary policy that sees to that, correct? So, just in our own kind of conservative way, we want to say that as inflation also comes back down to some reasonable level, the benefit of that in the distribution gross profit will also moderate. And that's a little bit of, I think, conservatism that we need to have and that's why the 27% is there. I don't think that -- the pricing actions are -- hit a wall instantly. They won't. There will still be pricing decisions being made across the market, across product lines, across OEMs. That will be a reality for probably the next 12 months. We're just trying to give a little bit of insight and level set the thinking beyond just the current year. I glanced at something before the call which is interesting. And that's that if you look at six-month operating profit two years ago versus today, it's almost 2.5 times greater today. Put that in perspective. Two years ago, six-month operating profit versus this year's operating profit, it's almost 2.5 times greater. So, the messaging is, we love the growth rates, we love the structural profitability gains. But in terms of slower -- slower is not a bad thing. Slower can mean growth that's in -- and more in line with the historical trend, not 2.5 times the current thing two years from now. So, it's trying to pull the reins a bit on reality and expectations and also in the backdrop of the macro economy that we're in. I think we'll be in record territory in 2023. If I could throw one more thing in there. The same dynamics that create demand in our industry are still going to be in effect. And that is we still have an aging population that's -- looking at myself, I know I'm going to continue aging. We've still got migration and urbanization. Urbanization continues to grow as people move more and more to the cities and move more and more, frankly, to the cities that we like, in Texas, in Florida, in the Mid-Atlantic. We also see climate change and things happening in that area, which is going to impact and help our business, as well as a drive for more efficiencies. So, those are the four demand creators that we've had for the last 30, 40 years that I've been around, and they're going to continue in 2023. Right. That's right. June units -- I would say June dollars was a bit better than the quarter June units. I don't have, Steve, and that's getting a little bit granular. But I would say June was a better month than the others, and that momentum is even that much greater in July. Both. I'll say carefully. Yeah. Units were up in June. And Al commented earlier, July units were up mid to high single digits. I think it's my 128th press release, by the way, just for the sign of the math, and I'll stand by my long-term track record. Yeah. I think we're very close to the end of that as we reach forward and introduce the new products that are going to be coming in. Probably in the fourth quarter, we'll see a price increase then. No, no."

            "name": "Albert Nahmad",
            "content": "Morning, everyone. Welcome from rainy cloudy, Miami, Florida. This is our second quarter earnings call and this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. And with me is A.J. Nahmad, who is the company's President; Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Before we start our cautionary statement, this conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws, ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Onto our information. Watsco delivered another exceptional quarter. Records were set for virtually every measure of performance. Earning per share jumped 33% to a record four point -- sorry -- to a record $4.93 per share. That's a record $4.93 per share for the quarter. Sales grew 15% to a record $2.13 billion, which is our first $2 billion quarter. Operating income increased 32% to a record $287 million with margins expanding 180 basis points to a record 13.5%. We are particularly pleased with these results, given the strong comparisons against the second quarter last year. Now that was a heck of a quarter. Last year, same-store sales are up 29% and earnings per share was up 64%. That's the comparison that we're up against this last quarter, the second quarter of this year. Now for the first half of this year, earnings per share is up 53% and the record $7.83 on a 22% increase in sales. Looking at current trends so far in July, we see meaningful unit growth and additional price capture as inflation remains a reality in our industry. For the year, we expect 2022 will be another year of record performance. Then, looking to 2023, higher interest rates and perhaps an economics slow down is what we think about. We were reacting creative ways to take advantage of our scale, product diversity and technology leadership to sustain growth and build upon our growing market share no matter what comes in 2023. We have also asked our teams to focus on productivity and operating efficiencies, which have been more difficult to achieve the last two years, given the unprecedented supply chain, transportation and business disruption that have impacted all businesses, not just ours. We're also engaged with our OEM partners and working together to develop forward-looking growth initiatives. Watsco has deep relationships with virtually every domestic and internal -- international OEM. And we possess the best, most diverse brand portfolio of any distributor in our industry. More fundamentally, there are numerous reasons to be optimistic about our business and our industry in the medium and long-term. This morning's press release provides a number of additional data points that we feel support Watsco's growth trajectory. We have immense technology advantage in our marketplace, and we are investing to grow that advantage -- to grow with that advantage. Our technology investments are paying dividends in the form of higher customer engagement, reduced attrition and substantial market share gains. We have a market advantage in the breadth and diversity of products we sell across dozens of brands. Sorry, let me say that again. Our market advantage is the breadth and diversity of products we sell across dozens of brands and hundreds of product categories. This diversity allows us to offer the full variety of price points required in a market in most, any economic environment. In addition, we have a concentrated position into Sunbelt markets, where both population migration is greatest and the necessity of HVAC products is the most absolute. Now turning to something that's very important, that's the regulatory front. We have several important federal regulatory changes coming to provide opportunities for growth. The minimum federal SEER standards will increase in 2023 across the entire United States. The price points associated with these new products will be higher and should benefit 2023. Another very important regulatory change will occur in 2025 as the industry transforms or transitions to new refrigerants. Federal mandates are now in place to phase out the current high GWP, which means Global Warming Potential. Say it again. GWP, Global Warming Potential, refrigerants use millions of systems. OEMs are developing new products to incorporate the lower GWP refrigerant. To sum it up. There are significant opportunity for homeowners and businesses to upgrade systems that will over time be both efficient and environmentally friendly. We believe our scale, technology and financial strength position us extremely well to capture these new market opportunities. Finally, we're always concern ourselves with our balance sheet, so that we are in a position of financial strength. Today's balance sheet remains in pristine condition with a small amount of debt, and we can continue to funding investments to grow our business. We are fortunate to be the leader in such a key industry. As we mentioned, we feel there are and will be several important drivers as growth for company -- forward growth in our company in years ahead.  As always, we have presented only a small portion of our technology story in today's release. If you have any interest in learning more, let us know, and we will schedule time with A.J. and his team. We are always happy to share more about our progress. But with that, let's go on to questions and answers. Morning, Tom. Of course. I think the first part of your question is very well placed, because we do have technology that help us with that. And the second part of your question, that's a little more intense and we'll get some comments on that. A.J, you want to start? Very good. You wanna repeat the second part of your second question please? Barry, you want that? Barry? Morning, Ryan. You mean in the beginning of the third quarter? Yes. We've been a -- we've seen a terrific increase in demand. Let's have Barry or Paul either one give you the numbers. Barry, you were going to add. Yeah. I think we commented the units are up mid single dig -- high -- mid single digit in the beginning of July. Yes. Correct. Paul? Ryan, if you look at where we are today with -- the base products today represent about 75% to 80% of the sales volume for the industry market. And if you assume that that carries over into 2023, then yes, you would see a mid teen growth. Yes, it is. Morning, Steven. Go ahead, Paul. Morning, Nigel, And touch consumer financing, Barry. I'm not sure I understood the question. Can you clarify that? Well, because we see the federal government changing the industry and changing what we'll be selling and changing what consumers will be faced to buy. And it's a big thing, is the regulatory environment, plus the ability to move to higher efficiency systems and reduce costs to the homeowner and contribute to the -- to our ability to help with the environment with emissions. Every time you move to a high efficiency unit, you're removing emissions from the planet because we're producing more cooling with less electricity. And if you produce less electricity, you're producing less emission. There are a lot of factors here. None of them are negative other than the earlier question was, how can a consumer afford this? And we're very motivated to help with that -- with our consumer financing. And I believe we have the best offer now to help the contractor bring the homeowner or the business owner onto a finance program. Now, we're not doing the financing. We lay that off to a series of different finance companies depending on the credit rating of the consumer. And that's just the beginning. So, it's hopefully, I gave you some answers, but wouldn't keep asking. Hi, Jeff. Well, that's a good accounting question. Barry, do you want to deal with that? You have to remember also half our revenues in that approximate amount is not equipment. It's all the other stuff that keeps us -- that you need to install the air conditioner, to maintain the air conditioners, there are a lot of supplies, a lot of different things. And that's a solid business. The demand of that is more reliable to demand on the equipment. And that's generally at a higher margin. Certainly, we know the supply constraint is a big player. Anyone else have any comments on that? Morning, David. I don't believe we're trying to be negative on 2023. We're very positive about 2023. But you did put your finger on a small part of our business as sales to new construction. It's in the newspapers that startups are down, but that is a small part, and it's certainly a small part of our margins. That business is got a small margin for us. But I think we're pretty positive about 2023. Did you think that we were not? Well, Barry wrote that thing. Barry, why you wrote that thing? Let me ask it this way. Do you think we're going to be in record territories in 2023? For the year, yeah. I mean, we're selling out all the things we think are going to drive demand. I mean, the regulatory thing is a big deal. Barry is saying that the growth rate of the industry is going to slow, because we were in an extraordinary period for the last two years, but that doesn't mean it's going to slow. It's going to go to normal. It's not going to go -- we don't expect some decrease in demand for all the factors that we've mentioned in terms of normality. No, we're very positive about 2023. Well, thanks for clarifying Barry's comment there A.J. We're very positive. We're not negative for 2023 or beyond. That's a very good question. Why don't we try A.J., somebody that can comment on that or all three of you, Barry, A.J. and Rick? Yeah. Rick? In other words, we have a lot of opportunity to get more efficient, and we know it. Because what's happened in the last two years, we were all scrambling, and scrambling costs us a lot. But that scrambling is going to decrease as the OEMs catch up. We still are short and high efficiency. And it's going to normalize. As things normalize, the SG&A will normalize to something that's -- as a percentage of sales, lower than what it is today, is our expectation. Morning, Steve. Very good. Steve. I didn't know you had that kind of humor. That's right. You're right. Mr. Logan? Well, he doesn't know what it was, units in July. He just knows the dollars. Well, who wants that one? Don't forget, Steve, that a lot of -- half the United States will be unable to sell lower efficiency air conditioners. So, that's an inventory trick. But the stuff that we will be selling is the new stuff, and they're coming at higher prices. We already know that. All right. Well, thanks very much for your continued interest in Watsco. We try to keep it light -- our conversations. But this is a serious leadership team. And we hope you have enjoyed our story. And we hope to continue giving you good news as the quarters go on. So, thanks again for your interest. Bye-Bye."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Aaron Nahmad",
            "content": "Sure. Sure. First, to give you some context, you have to understand that we do business with about a thousand manufacturers and all of them -- I think, it's fair to say all of them have had probably multiple price increases over the last several quarters and years. So, just the administration of putting -- making sure that our systems are up to date with the latest cost basis from each of these suppliers and making sure that we have the right cost and price in the marketplace is enormous. And before we had the technology we do now in our pricing tool, I'm not sure we could do it, certainly not to the way -- not to the extent of proficiency and expertise that we did today. So, just the administrative burden has been eased by the tool itself. Land, you can start talking about the opportunity. The opportunity is to make sure that we capture the additional price in the marketplace that needs to be passed along to our customers and to their customers and to be reflecting of the inflationary environment. And our tools enable that and then enable to slice and dice and do analytics to find opportunities to maximize, or I should say optimize price by product, by category, by geography, et cetera. And the opportunities are endless. And it may just so you know it may not always be going up in price. It may also be going down in price. There are very -- there are definitely times where we are out of line with pricing and when we get in line, we can move product more efficiently and create, or I should say capture demand that's out there when we have the pricing correct. So, I'd say we're still early days with the tool, because the tool has really enables infinite opportunities. But it's an exciting and important opportunity that we have in front of us. If I can -- this is A.J. Let me give you another example of how this supply chain woes, have added to SG&A. And you can do the math of as things normalize, these SG&A costs should come out. As an example is that our vendors and our suppliers, they may be getting us high quantity of product, but it may not be the right mix of products in the right locations. For example, we may have more indoor units than outdoor units, and I'm making this up in one geography or vice versa. And so, we have spent an incremental millions of dollars simply moving product among our locations, so that we have matched systems that we can fill customer requests for. And that's a direct result of just the challenges in the supply chain. So, as things normalize, you would imagine that some of those additional costs should come out as well. Yeah. I think, it's also interesting to note -- it's interesting enough too -- sorry to interrupt -- is that part of the, I should say, a victim of the supply chain lows have been high efficiency systems. There's simply just not as many available for us to sell. So, our mix is at least somewhat affected by our inability to get those products from our OEMs and sell into the marketplace today. Well, I think, I think we're -- yeah, I think we're getting back to normal. The supply chain is good. However, there's -- there are disruptions in certain product areas, commercial unitary right now, very difficult to get any product in that. The large commercial products, very difficult, very long lead times. When you get to just the standard bread and butter product, we're seeing a pretty good supply chain right now where we're bringing in the indoor and the outdoor are actually coming together for a change. When we look into the future, all these manufacturers, all these OEMs are going to be changing over to a new product. Some of them completely redesign, some of the modifications of what they currently sell. So, I guess, in my heart, I think that we'll probably have some moderate disruptions as they go through the changeover to the new product line for 2023. And each one of them are going to perform in different manners. And that's the good news about Watsco. We have -- we represent just about everybody in the industry. I have to summarize it my way, which is this, this extreme growth market environment can't last forever, because it's too extreme. But no matter what the market conditions are, we expect to grow. We think there's a lot of tailwinds behind our industry. And then, as a company, we think we've made investments that will ensure growth for many years to come in the long-term. We should edit that one. Rick? How about Rick? Yeah. Why don't Rick? Morning. Yeah. But it actually works. Now we get the tease Barry for the next several weeks."

            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Okay. Yeah. Definitely Ryan, we've seen an uptick in the month of July, and it's been one in which we've seen different regions come to life and really give a pop. The most important two regions that are really performing well right now are in the Southeast and the Southwest, but we're seeing substantial increases, even compared to last year's July. I would say, right now, everybody is kind of scrambling looking at that number, trying to figure out exactly what the market price will be for the 16, 17. As far as the baseline products, the old 15 SEER, the new 14.3 SEER products is coming in. I would say that that's going to start in the mid teens up from what we currently have today at the 14 SEER level. Okay. Steven, yeah, we have views. We have opinions. But obviously, it's very hard to predict what the consumer's going to do in the elasticity of it. There are definite differences between the high SEER and the standard SEER in the areas of comfort, reliability, warranty. There's a lot of soft differentiators besides the energy savings that they accrue. There's also a second element to it, which gets into both local and state rebates to the consumer. Also, we're getting into a situation where utilities become more aggressive in their rebate. As we -- we have disruptions in electric supply in the marketplace. So, if you did just a straight calculation and said, would there be a compression? I think we'd have to go back in history and say, and in the past, there has been a compression to the minimum SEER when we went from 10 SEER to 12 SEER and from 12 to 14 in the south. So, if that were to occur, I think you probably could lay out some historical numbers and see if that happens. But that would be just an estimate at this time. Well, to date, we have not really seen any pushback on pricing. Obviously, demand remains strong. If you look at the industry itself, we're performing at record levels over the last two years with ever increasing prices. And I think as we moved in -- move into the new product, it's going to have higher efficiency. It's going to have other attributes which should be beneficial to the consumer. I wish I could read into what the consumer's mind is when it comes to the cost of a replacement of an air conditioning unit. It's unlike a car or any other staple that a consumer buys. It's something that -- there isn't a list price out there that they can go ahead and match. There's not a consumer report that tells them what a price should be. And each job as you recognize is custom. And so, it has different attributes and different issues that would affect the price to the consumer.  I think, particularly in the Sunbelt area, when it comes to the new products that we're going to be selling on the air conditioning side, it is a necessity. You're not going to live without it. So, if you have to replace a unit, I think most consumers going to find a way to be able to afford it and to do it. And the same holds true with gas furnaces and heat pumps in the north and in the Mid-Atlantic. Once again, if it's 20 below zero in Alberta, Canada, you're going to be changing out your gas furnace in that market. So, kind of an iffy question. I really don't know how the consumer's going to react. I don't think there's any good tests that we can put on it analytically to be able to determine what the analytics are or what the elasticity is for the consumer. Yeah. It's been the worst nightmare. Demand on commercial is up. Supply is down. And lead times for unitary product and applied product, both have been extended out beyond what I've ever seen in my history in the industry. So, I think that's going to be just latent demand that we're going to pick up as supply picks up. I think those shops will be filled, but probably at a later date, not now. I'm pointing to Barry. The obvious answer is we're very focused on gross profit. We have tools that are helping us. And we want to do 27%. We want to do better. Can we predict it? I'm not sure we can, but we feel pretty comfortable on that number going forward or better. I mean, there could be ups and downs, but we're very focused on margins. I would like to if I want to speculate -- and this is pure speculation -- my goal is to get it to 15% EBIT margin eventually. No."

            "name": "Rick Gomez",
            "content": "Morning, Dave. Well, yeah, I do think that there is a -- there are multi -- multiple facets to the SG&A question. First, just to give you some context on the year-to-date picture. When you look at the increment in year-to-date SG&A organically, a big, big chunk of that, almost half of it came in variable categories. We've already talked about freight and inter-branch freight. We've mentioned things like commissions and incentive comp in prior press releases. And in our minds, those are things that are largely self regulating in a slower growth environment, if that's, in fact, what we have in 2023, or a more normal growth environment. And so, there is a good understanding of what's variable? How does it moderate? And how do we expect it to behave in future periods based on different growth algorithms. The trickier question is on the fixed cost. And as we've said, we've made investments to sustain a higher business and to propel the market share gains that we've seen in the last two to three years. And so, we need to now look at some of those investments and figure out where they make sense, figure out what we can do to make them more profitable and more efficient. And, of course, we look at things internally, not just in terms of volume and price, but we look at it in terms of just what I referred to as the stock, right? It's branches. It's people. It's trucks. It's things that -- it's square footage, those things that we can measure almost independent of the inflationary environment. And that's what we said in the press release, we've challenged our leaders to make all those categories more productive going forward. Right. I would also add one more thing, which is that, on the technology front, we are still a young company as it relates to some of our internal facing technologies. So, we've talked about the pricing technology that's more margin-oriented. That's really only been in the hands of the masses in the company over the last 12, 18 months. And there is additional technology now being deployed to further that warehouse optimization. So, it is still very -- we are earlier in our journey on the technology front for some of that internal technology that's really aimed at productivity."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Albert Nahmad, CEO and Chairman. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. And as she said, this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. With me is A.J. Nahmad, who is the President and Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Now, before we start our cautionary statement as usual, this conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws, ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Well, now that that's over. Let me report that we had another exceptional quarter. New records were set on virtually every measurement of performance. Earnings per share jumped 109% to a record $2.90 per share. Sales grew 34% to a record $1.52 billion and operating income increased 109% to a record $171 million. Gross margins expanded, and that along with improved operating efficiencies, led to record operating profit as well as operating margins, which expanded 400 basis points to a record 11.2%. Now this is important. The sales growth was strong and consistent across all markets and product groups. Also, noted is the companies that we acquired during the past year also performed at record levels. The reason we like that is that we believe that shows once again, that Watsco is a great home for family-owned businesses. We sustain their culture, invest in people and provide technology to secure and build upon their very great legends. Also, please note that the quarter\u2019s results are all the more impressive giving the strong comparison from a year-ago. Year-ago was very strong and this year is even stronger. While it's early in the year, we are encouraged by this terrific start and by current demand trends. Let me say that again, we are encouraged by terrific start and by current demands trends. And we think that 2022 should be another record year for Watsco. Looking beyond sales and profits is important to highlight some of the important catalysts going on both in the short-term and the long-term and we emphasize as we always do with the long-term. The industry is still experiencing inflationary pressures and OEMs have recently announced additional price increases. As you can see from our results, we are capturing price in the marketplace, given the reliance and necessity of HVAC products in homes and businesses. Looking forward to next year, energy efficiency mandates enacted a few years ago are now in effect and they will raise the minimum standard for base efficiency systems beginning in 2023. So the government is very involved in raising efficiency mandates or efficiency of ratings through mandates. Now we are working closely with our OEM partners to transition inventory ahead of next year. Historically, energy efficiency mandates provides us the opportunity for a richer sales mix of high-efficiency systems. And importantly, our customers have greater value to offer and \u2013 to end users in replacing and upgrading older systems. We have the same expectations going forward. Federal mandates are also in place that would ultimately phase-out the current high GWP refrigerants used in millions of systems throughout the country. 10% reduction in these refrigerants is in effect now that's mandated by the government. A 30% reduction is scheduled for 2025 with a further reduction in 2030 \u2013 a further 30% reduction in 2030. OEMs are actively developing new products to incorporate the lower GWP refrigerants, and those products are expected to be launched in the next couple of years. And as a result of that, today's cost of refrigerants used to repair older systems has risen sharply and so to as a cost of repairing and maintaining older system. Forgive my slight cold, please. Working with our contractor customers, we see the opportunity for homeowners and businesses to upgrade systems that will cover over time more efficient \u2013 I should say that over time will be both more efficient and environmentally friendly. That's a nice thing that's coming to our industry. In terms of our commercial markets, we believe there is potential for greater infrastructure upgrades and climate change capital spending along with an increased focus on indoor air quality. Although it is likely that this trend will take years to play out, Watsco\u2019s organic sales growth rate for commercial products accelerated during the first quarter to 29%. That's 29% growth in commercial products in the first quarter. Longer-term, there are other potential catalysts, expansion of federal state, or local programs to help fund the purchase of high-efficiency systems, we see that happening. The trend towards electrification and the adoption of heat pump systems to replace fossil-fuel powered heating systems that like gas furnaces. And the second half \u2013 and the second phase-out to even lower GWP refrigerants is on the books in 2029. This information emphasizes Watsco's significant role in the drive to lower CO2 emissions. According to the Department of Energy, heating and air conditioning accounts for roughly half of U.S. household energy consumption. As such, replacing HVAC systems at a higher efficiency is a meaningful action that a homeowner can take to reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint over time. We offer a broad variety of systems to go well beyond the minimum standards that can exceed 20 SEER. First quarter sales of high-efficiency systems rose above the minimum standard through 31%, outpacing the 26% growth rate for the residential equipment. Based on estimates validated by independent sources, Watsco averted 11.4 million metric tons of CO2e emissions since January 1, 2020 through the sale of high-efficiency HVAC systems. This kind of information and more information is available on our website, including sources and assumptions used to support the estimates. Simply put, there is a lot going on and we love our industry. But again, we believe entrepreneurial culture, custom-focused technologies, scale, access to capital and leadership positions provide unique advantages in our industry. We are fortunate to serve a large and growing population of contractors and technicians with the industry's most innovative technology. Our annual run rate for e-commerce sales now exceeds $2 billion, and we can see that our active technology users continue to grow at a faster rate. Let me say that again, e-commerce users of Watsco technology, at least the e-commerce platform are growing at a faster rate than those that do not do e-commerce with us. OnCall Air, that\u2019s one of our tech developments, a Watsco digital sales platform used by contractors and CreditForComfort, which extends credit to the end user continues to expand. Contractors presented quotes to approximately 45,000 households during the quarter, a 40% increase and generated $160 million worth of sales for our customer, a 59% increase over last year. The information presented today is only some of what is going on in terms of technology initiatives. As we said before, if you have any interest on learning more, let us know. We will schedule time with A.J. and his team. We believe we are transforming the industry, and we are always happy to share more about our progress. With that, let's now go on to Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Tommy Moll of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Tom.\nThomas Moll: Good morning, Al, and thanks for taking my questions.\nAlbert Nahmad: Of course.\nThomas Moll: So an 18% increase in residential average unit selling prices. You called out that's a combination of pure price plus beneficial mix. And I think on both of those points, there's a nexus to some of the technology investments you've made. Can you help us understand that nexus?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, that's a very good question. Barry, A.J.?\nBarry Logan: Hey. Good morning, Tom. Well, first, the pricing actions are always built on the costs that's coming in the door. As we receive a higher cost, we pass on higher prices. And that's elementary school stuff that's gone on for 25 years, of course, cause and effect. The technology discussion is on the pricing \u2013 is a pricing system that's been in place now for a couple of years and is more mature today than two years ago and more useful today than two years ago. When you start to see the pricing actions play out with all the movement that's going on across really all product lines, not just equipment, 18% is just equipment. This has been a discussion across 150 product lines, 600 vendors, and the administration of pricing is much different today than again, it was two years ago. So not quite answering your question maybe, but just get a sense that this is not business as usual with this added layer of pricing technology that we have in place.\nThomas Moll: And on the mix side. Sorry, go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Is that you, Rick?\nAaron Nahmad: No, it\u2019s A.J. I'll say what Barry is saying slightly differently is you have to think about the scale of what we're talking about with these price increases and the number of customers would deal with and the number of products it touches and the number of geographies. We have received hundreds of different pricing actions from our 1,000 plus manufacturers, and we sell those products to 100,000 contractors across 671 locations. The administration of that those changes and nearly every contractor by the way, buys products from us at different prices. The administration of that can be overwhelming. And what we have now with our technology tools allows us not only to administer that quickly, efficiently and accurately, but it also provide \u2013 we can get that done so quickly that it gives us time to put intelligence and analytics to work to optimize pricing by customer, by geography, by product, et cetera, so that we can really make a difference in the market as well.\nThomas Moll: Thank you. That's all helpful context. I guess to consider the other side here, demand destruction, I'm curious for any insight on, so in an environment where you have realized substantial price and looking at your numbers, I don't think there's any sign today of significant or any demand destruction on the end user side, but it's got to be something that's on everyone's minds. And so I'm just curious for any insight or opinions you might offer there?\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: Yes. Sure. Well, again, this is not unprecedented. Several years ago, when products went from 10 SEER to 13 SEER, there were probably 15%, 20% price increases then just because the products. We didn't see the demand destruction then. As you suggest, I don't think we're seeing it now. I think the fundamentals are simple to understand, which is people don't live without our products. They won't live without our products. There's a health quotient. There's a comfort. If it's a business, it has to be in business. So I think the necessity of our products has always been a great fundamental for the industry. The other is that it's really a product with 10, 15, 20-year life. You don't buy these things twice a week. You buy them once every 10 or 15 years. And when you do, you're upgrading the efficiency of your dinosaur that you do own in your home. And contractor collaboration and contractor skill, I think has improved to a point where the recommendation and the installation, and really the overall aptitude for high-efficiency is playing out. Obviously, we're helping that with some of our technology as well, but I think that's the life cycle that has been in place now for a long time. And I think if your real question is at what point does consumer sensitivity matter on price? You'll notice in the press release, we talked about selling 29 different brands of equipment. So the diversity and the price points and the features and benefits, and the waterfront that we cover is very comforting because that's part of \u2013 it's ultimately part of an equation, right, is how well the consumer spends money on these things. And I'm glad we're the most diverse player in the industry to be in that position.\nAlbert Nahmad: And there is an ROI, the consumer that buys high-efficiency equipment saves electricity costs 10 to 15 years, if there is a return on that investment.\nThomas Moll: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it, and I'll turn it back.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Hey, good morning, everyone. Addition to the revenues, the margins pop-out here. I wonder if we could just kind of dig into that a little bit more and obviously you get leverage on the year-over-year growth. But kind of looking at the sequentials, right, your revenue in Q1 is similar to Q4 as it usually is. And really prior to last year, we tended to see gross margins in Q4 and Q1 being quite similar, but we've got half the step function change happening here. So maybe you could just unpack that for us. I'm guessing, it's price on top of price would be my initial guess, but maybe you could provide a little bit of perspective on how to think about the gross margins here in the quarter and what it pretends for the year?\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul?\nPaul Johnston: Well, yes, it is a little bit of price upon price increase. We had price increases at the end of the fourth quarter that range from 8% to 12%. And then we've had a secondary announcement of price increases that are coming in April and May. So I think the prices have continued to move up. And as the prices continue to move up, obviously, our gross margin goes up with it.\nJeffrey Sprague: And could we just touch on inventories a little bit here? Obviously, there's a lot of price and mix I would assume going on in the inventories as you report them. Is there any particular disconnect there in inventories relative to what you see playing out in Q2, and there was a comment about transitioning inventory with the OEMs. I just wonder if you could elaborate on what you meant there and how you see that playing out over the balance of the year?\nPaul Johnston: Okay. If you take the first question, obviously the inventory dollars are up and we look at a reflection of how many units do we have and are we set for these season. And the answer to that right now is we're in very good shape on the inventory to be able to carry us through it to the second quarter and obviously the stronger third quarter. What we're facing is a transition of pretty much all of our SKU as they relate to outdoor heating \u2013 outdoor heat pumps and cooling products that will go into effect January 1, 2023, as we indicated. However, we're going to be doing a transition earlier than that. We're going to try to start moving the new products in late third quarter, early fourth quarter, so that we will have a smooth transition into 2023. Obviously when that occurs, we're going to see another step up in cost and price because the price of the new products at the higher efficiency ratings is going to be higher.\nJeffrey Sprague: But you're anticipating selling the newer equipment also in the back half of the year, not just stocking it in preparation for 2023, is that right?\nPaul Johnston: No. We definitely look forward to selling it in the back half of the year.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeffrey Hammond: Hey, good morning. So I just wanted to get on back on gross margins. I mean, you guys have had a huge step up from kind of three, four years and 24.5. And then we step up again. And I'm just wondering, any anomalies in this 1Q. And if we start to see this inflation kind of normalize, which doesn't seem to be, but where you think you ultimately fall out, given the combination of kind of price cost arbitrage versus your structural changes?\nAlbert Nahmad: That's a very good question. I think both Barry and Paul should answer them.\nBarry Logan: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Yes. I mean, first there were price increases in the first quarter \u2013 effective in the first quarter, as Paul mentioned. There is a benefit as we turn that inventory and what is a small \u2013 relatively small quarter. So just to balance the discussions, if we look back sequentially in the fourth quarter, 27.3 I think was the margin and this quarter, 29 and change. So there is a benefit that showed up this quarter really, and what is a slight quarter for that, that the benefit of that. It doesn't account for the entire increase, but I'll say a good part of it. So that's something that is, I wouldn't call it anomalies, not the right word. That is something that is more material in early first quarter. And as Paul mentioned, there are more price increases on the horizon. They won't have the same level of benefit and basis points, but they will have a benefit, that trend will continue we think for the rest of the year. But again, don't just fall in love with the algebra that this is a structural change in how we manage pricing. First of all, you've heard that story. Second of all, we absolutely work with our OEMs to invest in our business. And when we invest in our business, the economics between us and the OEM is something that improves, and you can see that in the SG&A by the way. Part of the counterbalance to higher gross profit is sitting in our SG&A expenses through investments we're making to grow the business long-term. And our parts and supplies business, which we don't talk a lot about because we're not asked about it very much, that is where we see the disproportionate level of gross profit improvement along the lines of the technology gains that we're seeing with pricing.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. That's real helpful. Oh, go ahead.\nPaul Johnston: And as we said, we've got a price increase dropping into this quarter, and I reasonably assured that we're going to have another price increase with the introduction of the new product in Q4. And some of the products that we sell that Barry mentioned, when we get into the supply side and all the accessories, some of those have got some long-term price advantages, which are going to continue to repeat. Refrigerant is going to become short as the government has restricted the amount of GWP type refrigerants that can be produced, it's created a supply issue, which is going to be long-term at least for the next 10 years. So there's a lot of things out there, a lot of pieces, as Barry always puts a lot of moving parts out there. But I think from a price standpoint, I think it's going to be pretty much sustainable for the rest of the year.\nAlbert Nahmad: Then I think a direct consequence to gross profit margin is product mix. As we move to higher efficiency, that does bring a higher gross profit margin. As we expand our parts and supplies business that does increase our gross profit margin in addition to what Paul and Barry has already said.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. Very helpful guys. Just kind of a housekeeping. One, I'll ask on non-equipment, what price was relative to what you said on equipment? And then just any color on growth rates in the international and commercial piece?\nPaul Johnston: Well, on the non-equipment side, yes, we've seen price increases less on the part side than we have on some of the supplies. Some of the supplies as I indicated with the refrigerant, refrigerant is moving rapidly upwards. However, on the parts side, what we're seeing is, we're seeing a strong demand. At the same time, as we're seeing a strong demand for the equipment side and pricing actions there are lower than they are on the equipment.\nBarry Logan: And Jeffrey, to answer your question, I've said this now for a few quarters. I think the overall same-store growth rate of 25% is within 1% be it commercial, or I'm sorry, be it domestic or international.\nJeffrey Hammond: And how about the\u2026\nBarry Logan: The geographic markets are very consistent.\nJeffrey Hammond: And how about commercial growth?\nBarry Logan: Yes. We mentioned that on a call, 29%.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. Sorry about that. Okay. Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. I hope you're feeling \u2013 you feel better. Sounds like you are suffering with a cold. So on the mix side, I'm not sure you called out the \u2013 broke out the 18% on residential between pure price and a mix. So just wondering if you just maybe just flesh that out a little bit. And really the context of the question is consumers get hit with a lot of inflationary pressures across the board. And at these times you sometimes see a mix down towards more value brands, value products and then maybe a bit more of a pair. Doesn't seem like that's [indiscernible], but I'm just wondering, number one, what was mix in the quarter? And secondly, are you seeing any signs of that kind of behavior coming through?\nAlbert Nahmad: Not really, we're not really seeing any real change in the way we're \u2013 way the brands are reacting to it, all of the brands, all the OEMs we represent are experiencing up sales, up sales which pretty much are normal across the board. As Barry indicated, when we started the call, most consumers only make this purchase every 10 to 15 years. So there isn't really a recognition on their part as far as what is the manufactured suggested list price of a carrier versus a goodman versus a train. So it really hasn't impacted that at all.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And then what would you say is the mix component of that 18%?\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. Nigel, it\u2019s not something we break out in that sense.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's fair. And then on the inventory side, I think the message from Jeff's question was that there is a bit of 14 SEER kind of stocking up preps ahead of the deadline. Would you expect to continue to build inventory kind of ahead of seasonality into the mid part of the year and then set us through, I mean, how should we think about that?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, first let me say that the OEMs are still supply challenged and we do have more orders because the demand is still very high. Barry or Paul on that?\nPaul Johnston: Yes. We're not going to build up inventory. This is not a traditional change over that we had when we went from 10 SEER to 12 SEER and then to 14 SEER. So we're going to be tailing off very quickly on the straight cool units. We're going to be bringing those down, focusing once again on what is environmentally good and also can be sold through and is grandfathered and that is the heat pumps. So this is not going to be a situation where the industry will be building up low efficiency or standard efficiency 14 SEER products in anticipation of some sort of a bridge where they can undercut the price of the new product when it's introduced in the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Merkel: Good morning, guys. Great quarter. I was hoping we could start high level. What is the outlook that you guys have for resi unit growth in 2022? I know the guys over at [Hardy] are thinking flattish, but after this quarter, it feels like that might be a little conservative?\nAlbert Nahmad: Go ahead, Paul.\nPaul Johnston: We normally don't get into what we forecast for the marketplace, but the marketplace obviously right now is very strong and we're adapting to that, new construction, which is a small piece of our business, but it's still an important piece of our business, continues to be very, very strong. Don't see that tailing off. But the replacement demand, we feel pretty good about it right now, but a lot of the elements trying to predict replacement demand are tied to things that we don't control, the weather and all those things.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. But we still see very strong demand.\nPaul Johnston: Yes.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. We haven't seen a change yet in the demand equation.\nBarry Logan: And some of it, if you look through it, we disclosed in the press release a bit of a discussion on ductless systems for example, both residential, commercial. The growth rate of that product group was up 45% in the quarter. And if I strung together three or four years, the compound growth rate is well in excess of any overall industry growth rate. So what's the story of ductless for example, and part of it is our own investment and skill and capability and \u2013 of growing those product lines, a big part of it also is the acceptance of those products in homes and businesses. So we're competing today with VRF products in a way that we didn't probably even three or four years ago, to mention 10 years ago. So they're always more going on than just what's the market doing, and that would be an example of something that's becoming more material that's important and interesting and gets beyond just what is the market doing?\nRyan Merkel: Yes. Got it. Okay. As a follow-up, I'm getting asked about inflation and rising interest rates and how that might impact replacement rates. What's been the history there during a period of rising rates? Should we be thinking about replacement rates falling at some point in the coming quarters? Or is that not in the \u2013 you're not pretty \u2013 just quite yet?\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. I think Barry says it best. Yes.\nBarry Logan: Yes. Well, first I think again, you have consumers that won\u2019t live without the products. And then the question is what do they spend when they're faced with a replacement? And contractor \u2013 the contractor relationship is what matters most in that regard, right. So again, having access to the brands and the products and efficiencies that may solve any equation is what we're after. If you were a factory operated location with a single brand in your warehouse, you have a different feeling that day than I think what we have where we're servicing a broad group of price points and contractor types and so on. Just my pitch for independent distribution. But I think at the end of the day, the consumer is going to figure it out. Our job is to help them figure it out. And contractor relationships are integral to that. Financing becomes integral to that. That's something that we're investing in and ramping up and long-term we'll have the most elegant solution we believe in the industry for financing. And again, in past events, past recessions, let's say if we saw a trade between a 20 SEER unit and a 16 SEER unit, yes, there's price sensitivity, but it's really not material at the end of the day. These are not discretionary purchases.\nRyan Merkel: Very helpful guys. I'll pass it on. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Manthey of Baird. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, David.\nDavid Manthey: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Question on the price differential as it relates to SEER ratings. I think in the past, it's been fairly linear with efficiency. Is the price differential between 14 SEER to 15 SEER or something in that mid single-digit range today?\nBarry Logan: It\u2019s actually \u2013 the 15 SEER is not \u2013 is a product line, but is not a material seller in the industry. So it actually jumps from a 14 SEER to 16 SEER. So the 14 SEER and 16 SEER would be the largest segments of the market today. And it's a double-digit difference between 14 SEER to 16 SEER.\nDavid Manthey: Yes. Okay. That's helpful. And then, I know we've talked about this on past calls, the success that you're having in selling other HVAC products, that segment used to lag equipment, and lately you've been seeing similar even better growth in a lot of cases. Are you ready at this point to talk about what's driving that? I mean, is it incentives? Is it training, technology? What are the key drivers behind the better results you've seen there lately?\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul?\nPaul Johnston: I guess, I'm not understanding exactly what products you're talking about.\nDavid Manthey: Well, I'm talking about \u2013 so you've got your report equipment, and then there's other HVAC products, and I'm saying other as a segment historically used to lag the equipment because you sort of swung between the new construction related stuff, the duct work, and the thermostats and things, and then the repair parts. So it used to always lag equipment. Lately, it's been growing much better. And I'm just trying to understand what the drivers there? Is it something you're doing or is it just consumer demand? What's the issue there?\nPaul Johnston: I would say it's a combination of two things. One, yes, we are driving that business that has been a business, which has to your point lagged. And now we're driving that business with better availability, better arrays of products in the branches. So we have the right availability at the right spot and that's been a technology drive that we've had with our inventory management systems. Secondly, we've actually put people in place, who are in that supply type business, who are in that non-equipment business, who know it and have done it successfully for other people, and they're doing it for us now. So I think we're gaining our fair share of that. We're looking at attachment rates as far as how many units, how many pieces of equipment we sell and with that, how much of the other products should be going with them. So I think it's a great effort and something that we're very focused on.\nBarry Logan: I would add. That\u2019s getting the pricing right too, that's another extension of our pricing optimization is that in many cases, we\u2019ve been \u2013 we\u2019re so focused on selling equipment to our customers, selling non-equipment was not their thought. Well now, with the tools, we think that the pricing, right and pricing profile is right for the customers, and then market digitally through our e-commerce and e-mails and mobile push notifications making customers aware that we sell these products, they're well priced competitively. And also we have a private label offering and non-equipment parts and supplies that is also an effective tool to take some share in the market with those products.\nRick Gomez: Dave, this is Rick. I would add just a fourth or fifth layer to that, which is that, three years ago, if you want to use that as a benchmark, we did not have the number of users today on our mobile apps and in our e-commerce platform that we do today. And we've said for a long time, that line items per order through that channel are higher. The incremental line items are not equipment. They tend not to be big ticket stuff, they tend to be accessories. So for instance, this quarter we grew supplies 34% and the more contractors we aggregate on our mobile apps and through our e-commerce channel, the more we kind of have better start going forward.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good point.\nDavid Manthey: All right. Thanks everyone. Appreciate the detail.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Hi. Close enough. We all know \u2013 we all know what's going on.\nAlbert Nahmad: You must feel for that Josh.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Yes. And it never gets old. Good morning, guys. So just on the gross margin commentary, I understand there's kind of a lot of factors there, but I guess conversely also an awful lot of daylight between 24% and I guess nearly 30%. Maybe to ask it a little differently, if you guys were in this kind of like 26% to 27% type range where you were at last year, if I said you were there two years from now, would you be happy with that, would you be disappointed because it didn't go up further and like 1Q was a little bit more anomalous, like how would that fit with you?\nAlbert Nahmad: I don't understand the question. What do we think about our gross profit margin?\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Gross margins grow 26% to 27% long-term, is that good or bad?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, we hope to do better than that. We haven't expressed that before, but what we think is with the investments that we're making, we should be able to do considerably better than what we've done in the past with the gross profit margin considerably better. And for all the reasons you're starting to hear, the wave of higher efficiency, the government is stimulating it. We had a peak at some bill. I don't know if it's going to actually pass, but they're going to incentivize consumers to buy higher efficiency systems. Our own ability to merchandise parts and supplies is growing, by the time our e-commerce is booming. I mean, there are a lot of things that we're doing in order to raise that gross profit margin.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Okay.\nAlbert Nahmad: I am not stuck to the 24% of the past. I am stuck. There's something that's going up, absolutely.\nBarry Logan: I completely agree. And Josh, if you know us, we are never satisfied, right? The whole mission of the company is to always continuously improve on everything we do in all of our results. So there is no level at which we're satisfied. We're always shooting for more.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Okay. And then just thinking about 1Q, I think seasonally has a lot of things that can move around and maybe not a massive barometer for the year. But the levels of activity that contractors are seeing today is that an early start to the season, is it catch up on stuff that couldn't get done last year because either labor or equipment itself was less available. Like, how should we think about what's going on today relative to kind of when you get into the real bulk of the season, like, is this 2021 kind of deferral activity that you've made up here?\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul?\nBarry Logan: I don't think there's any real way of knowing Josh. I would say this, no one tends to replace their system ahead of time. They think it's going to break in April. So let's go ahead and get it done in February. I just don't think that's ever a consequence. I think in our experience, the shoulder season is a very good indicator of how the consumer is behaving. It's a time where there is maybe more discussion going on instead of an emergency situation like in July. So if price and margin and yield in terms of gross profit has improved over the last six months and they have. Let's look at things over six months in the shoulder season. I think that speaks well to what the consumer is doing.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. I agree with that Barry. I don't think we have any way of knowing, what motivates the consumer at this time. Historically, what we've looked at is about 80% of the units are replaced because of an emergency situation. The units down and I need hot or cold air. About 20% of the consumers buy because they plan the purchase ahead of time to what Barry is talking right now. And I don't \u2013 I really can't foresee if there's been a real major change in that dynamic.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Great. Helpful detail guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Steve.\nStephen Tusa: Hey, good morning. Sorry, what did you mean when you said the heat pumps are grandfathered in?\nPaul Johnston: The heat pumps, you can continue selling the current heat pump into next year.\nStephen Tusa: And that doesn't change going forward or is that just you can sell them, you can take them in inventory and sell them out that there's still a step up required on the heat pumps?\nPaul Johnston: There will be a step up required on the heat pumps, but any inventory that you have is grandfathered and can continue to be sold for the next year.\nStephen Tusa: Got it. Even in the south?\nPaul Johnston: Even in the south.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. Steve [indiscernible]. The government is very interested in moving away from gas furnaces because of the emissions, so heat pumps solves \u2013 the electrification through heat pumps solves a lot of those issues.\nStephen Tusa: Right. I feel, I recall in the past, you guys talking about targeting a 10% operating margin at one point, I don't know if you ever kind of put in print, but you had talked about that. Obviously you're kind of blowing through that today. I mean is this \u2013 is there a time where you'll say you guys can do low double-digit, 15%. I mean is that kind of what this trajectory looks like for the next couple years?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, that's our goal to increase the EBIT margin for sure.\nStephen Tusa: Okay.\nAlbert Nahmad: We work tirelessly at that, our profitability, and yes, I think those numbers are possible.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. And then just one last one, what is total \u2013 what was total price capture for the total company for the quarter?\nAlbert Nahmad: See, we only report on the equipment, so at 18%.\nStephen Tusa: Okay. I had to try. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Chris Dankert of Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning.\nChristopher Dankert: Hey. Good morning, guys. Again, to circle back to gross margin because it was just kind of such an impressive number here, I guess it would be fair to characterize, you guys finally hitting whether it's critical mass in kind of the adoption of the business intelligence tools and the operational efficiency tools, is that part of what's really driving this uptake, obviously price-on-price goes a long way. But it sounds like your commentary really is pointing to, hey, these efficiency tools have finally hit a point where it is at least a substantial driver of that gross margin improvement and thus is durable, is that the fair way to characterize it?\nAlbert Nahmad: All right. Who is going to volunteer for that one? Barry, Paul, A.J.\nAaron Nahmad: This is A.J. I mean, Barry said it early in the call is that some portion of this is structural. There is price-on-price, like you said, but there is structural as well and business intelligence and moving our customers purchasing to online and all the other things that are happening in terms of our analytics and our process improvements and so forth. Those are structural and again, we're never satisfied. We are always seeking to continuously improve on these dimensions and they should result in higher gross margins and higher EBIT margins over time. That's been the plan and yes, I think we are absolutely seeing some of that today.\nAlbert Nahmad: And you'd have to say A.J., we still have a lot of runway on.\nAaron Nahmad: Oh my gosh.\nAlbert Nahmad: And being able to implement these all the way through, so that's where I get excited.\nAaron Nahmad: Maybe we're in the second inning now out of the first inning.\nChristopher Dankert: Okay. That makes sense. Again, like I said, it seems like it has been, since 2017 for a lot of these programs, it seems like all of a sudden you're certainly hitting a stride on some of them. So I mean, maybe you said there's a lot of runway, where do you see the most runway going forward? Is there a particular program? Is it just integration? Is it just driving adoption? How do we think about these tools going forward and what they can do?\nAlbert Nahmad: You mean to quantify that?\nChristopher Dankert: I mean, if you want to \u2013 that'd be great. I was more thinking qualitative.\nAaron Nahmad: We always invite you and others to spend some time with us and really understand or start to understand the scope and the scale of what we're talking about with all these programs. And we'll spend three hours together and maybe scratch the surface and you can understand the breadth of it. That might be a way to answer your question though.\nAlbert Nahmad: That's a very good answer. \nPaul Johnston: Yes. And I would say that the tease of that is this that, the e-commerce [indiscernible] any customer anywhere period, not large or small, not north or south, but any customer we believe should be on the platform. And so to the extent we have, let's say $100,000 customer that somebody else's $1 million customer. How do we get access to that book of business through the technology? How do we get that adoption going? How do we make a material dent and what is a smaller customer and make them larger customers? So that's my tease is if you spend the two or three hours with A.J. and team, you'll understand how that's being done.\nAlbert Nahmad: And I could add one more thing. And that is with all the labor shortages that everybody's experiencing, including in the HVAC industry, we also forget that our technology improves the efficiency of the mechanic in the field, improves his productivity so that he can perform more jobs. So it becomes more and more relevant that we're able to improve the performance of our customer. That's a benefit that you can't just get from any location except for a Watsco location.\nChristopher Dankert: That's an excellent segue, I guess, to my follow-up here. I mean, adding 600 heads in the past year, I guess, how do we think about hiring going forward? Are you finding decent availability of labor? Just any comments on kind of how we think about headcount from here would be great?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, we're very decentralized and very entrepreneurial. Those decisions are made locally. Of course, if we open a new branch, which we are constantly doing, we'll add to the headcount. So that's a \u2013 and something that's always in motion. We can't quantify to you what \u2013 whether we're going to have 50 new employees because we don't decide that at the corporate level, we let the people know what's going on in the field beside that, but we certainly are growing branches and employees.\nChristopher Dankert: It's not something that your regional managers have been saying, hey, this is really an impediment to growth at this point, clearly. You're finding the people you need?\nAlbert Nahmad: No, I wouldn't go that far. We do have issues with sufficient help, but as I said, we're very decentralized and local leaders do what they have to do with compensation. We have a pretty good corporate program for health insurance and retirement we think. Those are things that we can do at our level, but at the local level that's done because they understand what they need to do. And they do it. We do have people leave, but it's not yet become as you can tell by the performance something that's hurting us.\nChristopher Dankert: Yes. Absolutely.\nAlbert Nahmad: We like that. Yes.\nChristopher Dankert: Yes. Clearly not that big an issue, but glad to hear that, I mean, it sounds like you're \u2013 the guys in the field are making the choices they need to, so we'll listen. Thanks so much for the color guys and really congrats on the quarter.\nAlbert Nahmad: Thanks. Come visit us. I mean, just imagine, just to finish that thought, can you imagine what a factory branch does in order to beat the question that you've just raised? How do they going to decide what to pay and how are they going to decide who to hire and how many to hire that's coming from somebody in as corporate? What's a better model?\nChristopher Dankert: Good question. Thanks again, guys.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, thanks guys. I really appreciate your interest in our company. I think we have shown you that we can perform well and we believe very strongly we're going to continue to perform well. So I'll see at the next conference call. Bye now.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Albert Nahmad",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. And as she said, this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. With me is A.J. Nahmad, who is the President and Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Now, before we start our cautionary statement as usual, this conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws, ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Well, now that that's over. Let me report that we had another exceptional quarter. New records were set on virtually every measurement of performance. Earnings per share jumped 109% to a record $2.90 per share. Sales grew 34% to a record $1.52 billion and operating income increased 109% to a record $171 million. Gross margins expanded, and that along with improved operating efficiencies, led to record operating profit as well as operating margins, which expanded 400 basis points to a record 11.2%. Now this is important. The sales growth was strong and consistent across all markets and product groups. Also, noted is the companies that we acquired during the past year also performed at record levels. The reason we like that is that we believe that shows once again, that Watsco is a great home for family-owned businesses. We sustain their culture, invest in people and provide technology to secure and build upon their very great legends. Also, please note that the quarter's results are all the more impressive giving the strong comparison from a year-ago. Year-ago was very strong and this year is even stronger. While it's early in the year, we are encouraged by this terrific start and by current demand trends. Let me say that again, we are encouraged by terrific start and by current demands trends. And we think that 2022 should be another record year for Watsco. Looking beyond sales and profits is important to highlight some of the important catalysts going on both in the short-term and the long-term and we emphasize as we always do with the long-term. The industry is still experiencing inflationary pressures and OEMs have recently announced additional price increases. As you can see from our results, we are capturing price in the marketplace, given the reliance and necessity of HVAC products in homes and businesses. Looking forward to next year, energy efficiency mandates enacted a few years ago are now in effect and they will raise the minimum standard for base efficiency systems beginning in 2023. So the government is very involved in raising efficiency mandates or efficiency of ratings through mandates. Now we are working closely with our OEM partners to transition inventory ahead of next year. Historically, energy efficiency mandates provides us the opportunity for a richer sales mix of high-efficiency systems. And importantly, our customers have greater value to offer and \u2013 to end users in replacing and upgrading older systems. We have the same expectations going forward. Federal mandates are also in place that would ultimately phase-out the current high GWP refrigerants used in millions of systems throughout the country. 10% reduction in these refrigerants is in effect now that's mandated by the government. A 30% reduction is scheduled for 2025 with a further reduction in 2030 \u2013 a further 30% reduction in 2030. OEMs are actively developing new products to incorporate the lower GWP refrigerants, and those products are expected to be launched in the next couple of years. And as a result of that, today's cost of refrigerants used to repair older systems has risen sharply and so to as a cost of repairing and maintaining older system. Forgive my slight cold, please. Working with our contractor customers, we see the opportunity for homeowners and businesses to upgrade systems that will cover over time more efficient \u2013 I should say that over time will be both more efficient and environmentally friendly. That's a nice thing that's coming to our industry. In terms of our commercial markets, we believe there is potential for greater infrastructure upgrades and climate change capital spending along with an increased focus on indoor air quality. Although it is likely that this trend will take years to play out, Watsco's organic sales growth rate for commercial products accelerated during the first quarter to 29%. That's 29% growth in commercial products in the first quarter. Longer-term, there are other potential catalysts, expansion of federal state, or local programs to help fund the purchase of high-efficiency systems, we see that happening. The trend towards electrification and the adoption of heat pump systems to replace fossil-fuel powered heating systems that like gas furnaces. And the second half \u2013 and the second phase-out to even lower GWP refrigerants is on the books in 2029. This information emphasizes Watsco's significant role in the drive to lower CO2 emissions. According to the Department of Energy, heating and air conditioning accounts for roughly half of U.S. household energy consumption. As such, replacing HVAC systems at a higher efficiency is a meaningful action that a homeowner can take to reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint over time. We offer a broad variety of systems to go well beyond the minimum standards that can exceed 20 SEER. First quarter sales of high-efficiency systems rose above the minimum standard through 31%, outpacing the 26% growth rate for the residential equipment. Based on estimates validated by independent sources, Watsco averted 11.4 million metric tons of CO2e emissions since January 1, 2020 through the sale of high-efficiency HVAC systems. This kind of information and more information is available on our website, including sources and assumptions used to support the estimates. Simply put, there is a lot going on and we love our industry. But again, we believe entrepreneurial culture, custom-focused technologies, scale, access to capital and leadership positions provide unique advantages in our industry. We are fortunate to serve a large and growing population of contractors and technicians with the industry's most innovative technology. Our annual run rate for e-commerce sales now exceeds $2 billion, and we can see that our active technology users continue to grow at a faster rate. Let me say that again, e-commerce users of Watsco technology, at least the e-commerce platform are growing at a faster rate than those that do not do e-commerce with us. OnCall Air, that's one of our tech developments, a Watsco digital sales platform used by contractors and CreditForComfort, which extends credit to the end user continues to expand. Contractors presented quotes to approximately 45,000 households during the quarter, a 40% increase and generated $160 million worth of sales for our customer, a 59% increase over last year. The information presented today is only some of what is going on in terms of technology initiatives. As we said before, if you have any interest on learning more, let us know. We will schedule time with A.J. and his team. We believe we are transforming the industry, and we are always happy to share more about our progress. With that, let's now go on to Q&A. Good morning, Tom. Of course. Well, that's a very good question. Barry, A.J.? Is that you, Rick? Barry? And there is an ROI, the consumer that buys high-efficiency equipment saves electricity costs 10 to 15 years, if there is a return on that investment. Good morning, Jeff. Paul? Good morning, Jeff. That's a very good question. I think both Barry and Paul should answer them. Then I think a direct consequence to gross profit margin is product mix. As we move to higher efficiency, that does bring a higher gross profit margin. As we expand our parts and supplies business that does increase our gross profit margin in addition to what Paul and Barry has already said. Good morning, Nigel. Not really, we're not really seeing any real change in the way we're \u2013 way the brands are reacting to it, all of the brands, all the OEMs we represent are experiencing up sales, up sales which pretty much are normal across the board. As Barry indicated, when we started the call, most consumers only make this purchase every 10 to 15 years. So there isn't really a recognition on their part as far as what is the manufactured suggested list price of a carrier versus a goodman versus a train. So it really hasn't impacted that at all. Yes. Nigel, it's not something we break out in that sense. Well, first let me say that the OEMs are still supply challenged and we do have more orders because the demand is still very high. Barry or Paul on that? Good morning, Ryan. Go ahead, Paul. Yes. But we still see very strong demand. Yes. We haven't seen a change yet in the demand equation. Yes. I think Barry says it best. Yes. Good morning, David. Paul? Good point. You must feel for that Josh. I don't understand the question. What do we think about our gross profit margin? Well, we hope to do better than that. We haven't expressed that before, but what we think is with the investments that we're making, we should be able to do considerably better than what we've done in the past with the gross profit margin considerably better. And for all the reasons you're starting to hear, the wave of higher efficiency, the government is stimulating it. We had a peak at some bill. I don't know if it's going to actually pass, but they're going to incentivize consumers to buy higher efficiency systems. Our own ability to merchandise parts and supplies is growing, by the time our e-commerce is booming. I mean, there are a lot of things that we're doing in order to raise that gross profit margin. I am not stuck to the 24% of the past. I am stuck. There's something that's going up, absolutely. Paul? Yes. I agree with that Barry. I don't think we have any way of knowing, what motivates the consumer at this time. Historically, what we've looked at is about 80% of the units are replaced because of an emergency situation. The units down and I need hot or cold air. About 20% of the consumers buy because they plan the purchase ahead of time to what Barry is talking right now. And I don't \u2013 I really can't foresee if there's been a real major change in that dynamic. Good morning, Steve. Yes. Steve [indiscernible]. The government is very interested in moving away from gas furnaces because of the emissions, so heat pumps solves \u2013 the electrification through heat pumps solves a lot of those issues. Well, that's our goal to increase the EBIT margin for sure. We work tirelessly at that, our profitability, and yes, I think those numbers are possible. See, we only report on the equipment, so at 18%. Good morning. All right. Who is going to volunteer for that one? Barry, Paul, A.J. And you'd have to say A.J., we still have a lot of runway on. And being able to implement these all the way through, so that's where I get excited. You mean to quantify that? That's a very good answer. And I could add one more thing. And that is with all the labor shortages that everybody's experiencing, including in the HVAC industry, we also forget that our technology improves the efficiency of the mechanic in the field, improves his productivity so that he can perform more jobs.

No, I wouldn't go that far. We do have issues with sufficient help, but as I said, we're very decentralized and local leaders do what they have to do with compensation.

So I'll see at the next conference call. Bye now."

            "content": "Hey. Good morning, Tom. Well, first, the pricing actions are always built on the costs that's coming in the door. As we receive a higher cost, we pass on higher prices. And that's elementary school stuff that's gone on for 25 years, of course, cause and effect. The technology discussion is on the pricing \u2013 is a pricing system that's been in place now for a couple of years and is more mature today than two years ago and more useful today than two years ago. When you start to see the pricing actions play out with all the movement that's going on across really all product lines, not just equipment, 18% is just equipment. This has been a discussion across 150 product lines, 600 vendors, and the administration of pricing is much different today than again, it was two years ago. So not quite answering your question maybe, but just get a sense that this is not business as usual with this added layer of pricing technology that we have in place. Yes. Sure. Well, again, this is not unprecedented. Several years ago, when products went from 10 SEER to 13 SEER, there were probably 15%, 20% price increases then just because the products. We didn't see the demand destruction then. As you suggest, I don't think we're seeing it now. I think the fundamentals are simple to understand, which is people don't live without our products. They won't live without our products. There's a health quotient. There's a comfort. If it's a business, it has to be in business. So I think the necessity of our products has always been a great fundamental for the industry. The other is that it's really a product with 10, 15, 20-year life. You don't buy these things twice a week. You buy them once every 10 or 15 years. And when you do, you're upgrading the efficiency of your dinosaur that you do own in your home. And contractor collaboration and contractor skill, I think has improved to a point where the recommendation and the installation, and really the overall aptitude for high-efficiency is playing out. Obviously, we're helping that with some of our technology as well, but I think that's the life cycle that has been in place now for a long time. And I think if your real question is at what point does consumer sensitivity matter on price? You'll notice in the press release, we talked about selling 29 different brands of equipment. So the diversity and the price points and the features and benefits, and the waterfront that we cover is very comforting because that's part of \u2013 it's ultimately part of an equation, right, is how well the consumer spends money on these things. And I'm glad we're the most diverse player in the industry to be in that position. Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Jeff. Yes. I mean, first there were price increases in the first quarter \u2013 effective in the first quarter, as Paul mentioned. There is a benefit as we turn that inventory and what is a small \u2013 relatively small quarter. So just to balance the discussions, if we look back sequentially in the fourth quarter, 27.3 I think was the margin and this quarter, 29 and change. So there is a benefit that showed up this quarter really, and what is a slight quarter for that, that the benefit of that. It doesn't account for the entire increase, but I'll say a good part of it. So that's something that is, I wouldn't call it anomalies, not the right word. That is something that is more material in early first quarter. And as Paul mentioned, there are more price increases on the horizon. They won't have the same level of benefit and basis points, but they will have a benefit, that trend will continue we think for the rest of the year. But again, don't just fall in love with the algebra that this is a structural change in how we manage pricing. First of all, you've heard that story. Second of all, we absolutely work with our OEMs to invest in our business. And when we invest in our business, the economics between us and the OEM is something that improves, and you can see that in the SG&A by the way. Part of the counterbalance to higher gross profit is sitting in our SG&A expenses through investments we're making to grow the business long-term. And our parts and supplies business, which we don't talk a lot about because we're not asked about it very much, that is where we see the disproportionate level of gross profit improvement along the lines of the technology gains that we're seeing with pricing. And Jeffrey, to answer your question, I've said this now for a few quarters. I think the overall same-store growth rate of 25% is within 1% be it commercial, or I'm sorry, be it domestic or international. The geographic markets are very consistent. Yes. We mentioned that on a call, 29%. And some of it, if you look through it, we disclosed in the press release a bit of a discussion on ductless systems for example, both residential, commercial. The growth rate of that product group was up 45% in the quarter. And if I strung together three or four years, the compound growth rate is well in excess of any overall industry growth rate. So what's the story of ductless for example, and part of it is our own investment and skill and capability and \u2013 of growing those product lines, a big part of it also is the acceptance of those products in homes and businesses. So we're competing today with VRF products in a way that we didn't probably even three or four years ago, to mention 10 years ago. So they're always more going on than just what's the market doing, and that would be an example of something that's becoming more material that's important and interesting and gets beyond just what is the market doing? Yes. Well, first I think again, you have consumers that won't live without the products. And then the question is what do they spend when they're faced with a replacement? And contractor \u2013 the contractor relationship is what matters most in that regard, right. So again, having access to the brands and the products and efficiencies that may solve any equation is what we're after. If you were a factory operated location with a single brand in your warehouse, you have a different feeling that day than I think what we have where we're servicing a broad group of price points and contractor types and so on. Just my pitch for independent distribution. But I think at the end of the day, the consumer is going to figure it out. Our job is to help them figure it out. And contractor relationships are integral to that. Financing becomes integral to that. That's something that we're investing in and ramping up and long-term we'll have the most elegant solution we believe in the industry for financing. And again, in past events, past recessions, let's say if we saw a trade between a 20 SEER unit and a 16 SEER unit, yes, there's price sensitivity, but it's really not material at the end of the day. These are not discretionary purchases. It's actually \u2013 the 15 SEER is not \u2013 is a product line, but is not a material seller in the industry. So it actually jumps from a 14 SEER to 16 SEER. So the 14 SEER and 16 SEER would be the largest segments of the market today. And it's a double-digit difference between 14 SEER to 16 SEER. I would add. That's getting the pricing right too, that's another extension of our pricing optimization is that in many cases, we've been \u2013 we're so focused on selling equipment to our customers, selling non-equipment was not their thought. Well now, with the tools, we think that the pricing, right and pricing profile is right for the customers, and then market digitally through our e-commerce and e-mails and mobile push notifications making customers aware that we sell these products, they're well priced competitively. And also we have a private label offering and non-equipment parts and supplies that is also an effective tool to take some share in the market with those products. I completely agree. And Josh, if you know us, we are never satisfied, right? The whole mission of the company is to always continuously improve on everything we do in all of our results. So there is no level at which we're satisfied. We're always shooting for more. I don't think there's any real way of knowing Josh. I would say this, no one tends to replace their system ahead of time. They think it's going to break in April. So let's go ahead and get it done in February. I just don't think that's ever a consequence. I think in our experience, the shoulder season is a very good indicator of how the consumer is behaving. It's a time where there is maybe more discussion going on instead of an emergency situation like in July. So if price and margin and yield in terms of gross profit has improved over the last six months and they have. Let's look at things over six months in the shoulder season. I think that speaks well to what the consumer is doing."

            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Well, yes, it is a little bit of price upon price increase. We had price increases at the end of the fourth quarter that range from 8% to 12%. And then we've had a secondary announcement of price increases that are coming in April and May. So I think the prices have continued to move up. And as the prices continue to move up, obviously, our gross margin goes up with it. Okay. If you take the first question, obviously the inventory dollars are up and we look at a reflection of how many units do we have and are we set for these season. And the answer to that right now is we're in very good shape on the inventory to be able to carry us through it to the second quarter and obviously the stronger third quarter. What we're facing is a transition of pretty much all of our SKU as they relate to outdoor heating \u2013 outdoor heat pumps and cooling products that will go into effect January 1, 2023, as we indicated. However, we're going to be doing a transition earlier than that. We're going to try to start moving the new products in late third quarter, early fourth quarter, so that we will have a smooth transition into 2023. Obviously when that occurs, we're going to see another step up in cost and price because the price of the new products at the higher efficiency ratings is going to be higher. No. We definitely look forward to selling it in the back half of the year. And as we said, we've got a price increase dropping into this quarter, and I reasonably assured that we're going to have another price increase with the introduction of the new product in Q4. And some of the products that we sell that Barry mentioned, when we get into the supply side and all the accessories, some of those have got some long-term price advantages, which are going to continue to repeat. Refrigerant is going to become short as the government has restricted the amount of GWP type refrigerants that can be produced, it's created a supply issue, which is going to be long-term at least for the next 10 years. So there's a lot of things out there, a lot of pieces, as Barry always puts a lot of moving parts out there. But I think from a price standpoint, I think it's going to be pretty much sustainable for the rest of the year. Well, on the non-equipment side, yes, we've seen price increases less on the part side than we have on some of the supplies. Some of the supplies as I indicated with the refrigerant, refrigerant is moving rapidly upwards. However, on the parts side, what we're seeing is, we're seeing a strong demand. At the same time, as we're seeing a strong demand for the equipment side and pricing actions there are lower than they are on the equipment. Yes. We're not going to build up inventory. This is not a traditional change over that we had when we went from 10 SEER to 12 SEER and then to 14 SEER. So we're going to be tailing off very quickly on the straight cool units. We're going to be bringing those down, focusing once again on what is environmentally good and also can be sold through and is grandfathered and that is the heat pumps. So this is not going to be a situation where the industry will be building up low efficiency or standard efficiency 14 SEER products in anticipation of some sort of a bridge where they can undercut the price of the new product when it's introduced in the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year. We normally don't get into what we forecast for the marketplace, but the marketplace obviously right now is very strong and we're adapting to that, new construction, which is a small piece of our business, but it's still an important piece of our business, continues to be very, very strong. Don't see that tailing off. But the replacement demand, we feel pretty good about it right now, but a lot of the elements trying to predict replacement demand are tied to things that we don't control, the weather and all those things. Yes. I guess, I'm not understanding exactly what products you're talking about. I would say it's a combination of two things. One, yes, we are driving that business that has been a business, which has to your point lagged. And now we're driving that business with better availability, better arrays of products in the branches. So we have the right availability at the right spot and that's been a technology drive that we've had with our inventory management systems. Secondly, we've actually put people in place, who are in that supply type business, who are in that non-equipment business, who know it and have done it successfully for other people, and they're doing it for us now. So I think we're gaining our fair share of that. We're looking at attachment rates as far as how many units, how many pieces of equipment we sell and with that, how much of the other products should be going with them. So I think it's a great effort and something that we're very focused on. The heat pumps, you can continue selling the current heat pump into next year. There will be a step up required on the heat pumps, but any inventory that you have is grandfathered and can continue to be sold for the next year. Even in the south. Yes. And I would say that the tease of that is this that, the e-commerce [indiscernible] any customer anywhere period, not large or small, not north or south, but any customer we believe should be on the platform. And so to the extent we have, let's say $100,000 customer that somebody else's $1 million customer. How do we get access to that book of business through the technology? How do we get that adoption going? How do we make a material dent and what is a smaller customer and make them larger customers? So that's my tease is if you spend the two or three hours with A.J. and team, you'll understand how that's being done."

            "name": "Aaron Nahmad",
            "content": "No, it's A.J. I'll say what Barry is saying slightly differently is you have to think about the scale of what we're talking about with these price increases and the number of customers would deal with and the number of products it touches and the number of geographies. We have received hundreds of different pricing actions from our 1,000 plus manufacturers, and we sell those products to 100,000 contractors across 671 locations. The administration of that those changes and nearly every contractor by the way, buys products from us at different prices. The administration of that can be overwhelming. And what we have now with our technology tools allows us not only to administer that quickly, efficiently and accurately, but it also provide \u2013 we can get that done so quickly that it gives us time to put intelligence and analytics to work to optimize pricing by customer, by geography, by product, et cetera, so that we can really make a difference in the market as well. This is A.J. I mean, Barry said it early in the call is that some portion of this is structural. There is price-on-price, like you said, but there is structural as well and business intelligence and moving our customers purchasing to online and all the other things that are happening in terms of our analytics and our process improvements and so forth. Those are structural and again, we're never satisfied. We are always seeking to continuously improve on these dimensions and they should result in higher gross margins and higher EBIT margins over time. That's been the plan and yes, I think we are absolutely seeing some of that today. Oh my gosh. Maybe we're in the second inning now out of the first inning. We always invite you and others to spend some time with us and really understand or start to understand the scope and the scale of what we're talking about with all these programs. And we'll spend three hours together and maybe scratch the surface and you can understand the breadth of it. That might be a way to answer your question though."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Albert Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. With me is A.J. Nahmad, Watsco's President; and Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Now before we start, our cautionary statement, as always, this conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by the SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to safe harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from forward-looking statements. Now, Watsco delivered strong results in 2023 despite some market conditions which were somewhat inevitable after two extraordinary years in 2021 and 2022. While reflecting in the year's results, I am proud of the accomplishments we delivered. We achieved market share gain in markets we serve. We further scaled Watsco's industry-leading technology platforms. We had a successful start driving down long-term productivity gains. I should say, we had a successful start driving long-term productivity gains. We expanded our network and product offerings by acquiring great businesses through our scale, and we fortified our balance sheet through inventory reduction and generated record fourth quarter cash flow. And once again, shareholders will receive a meaningful dividend increase in 2024, which is in April 2024. This is Watsco's 50th consecutive year of paying dividends. 2023 was also a year of immense change in virtually all equipment products transition to new [indiscernible] systems. In collaboration with our OEM partners, Watsco introduced new products and SKUs for over 25 brands of HVAC systems. Our teams executed well, and thanks to our scale and speed to market. We are confident that we gained share. We also trained thousands of customers on new products and our digital pilot library was updated with approximately 500,000 new SKUs. In this spring we will begin the next regulatory transition to new A2L products with lower GWP refrigerants. These regulatory transitions are positive for our industry and are good for Watsco's business. They offer meaningful value to homeowners and businesses to upgrade systems that are more efficient and better for the environment. Watsco's residential unit volumes, although still down, stabilized during the second half of 2023. Commercial end markets remain strong across all markets. Our commercial business continued to grow at a healthy rate, and our backlog of products extends well into next year. Sales of ductless systems, an increasingly important component of our business grew double digits in the year, and offset declines in conventional residential business. SG&A as a percentage of sales on a same-store basis decreased for the year, indicating progress in driving more productivity across the company. We believe we are in early innings of a long-term opportunity to meaningfully improve productivity and overall efficiencies. We have challenged our leaders and provided them with tools and data to implement change. And most importantly, we possess an entrepreneurial culture to execute change in a responsible way. Over the past year, we expanded our network through acquisitions with three terrific business joining the Watsco family, collectively their annual sales are around $200 million. These businesses will retain their culture, leadership teams and uniqueness in the market, consistent with our long-term practice of honoring and sustaining great legacies. Our industry remains highly fragmented, and we will continue to pursue other great companies to grow scale in our $60 billion North American market. We believe Watsco's technology advantage, market-leading scale and the strength of our balance sheet are all great reasons to join the Watsco family. Now before getting to Q&A, as always, I want to emphasize that our core focus remains on the long term. We believe our scale, the quality of our balance sheet and unique culture will continue to drive long-term growth and performance. We have an immense technology advantage, and we invested -- investing to grow that advantage. Watsco's broad array of products and brands is also a competitive advantage that allows us to serve contractors in any environment. And finally, our industry is fortunate to benefit from important regulatory and industry catalysts that should positively influence Watsco's performers in the years ahead. With that, let's go on to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning, Al. Thank you for taking my questions.\nAlbert Nahmad: You bet.\nTommy Moll: I wanted to start on gross margins, no big surprise there. Your fourth quarter -- your fourth quarter gross margin percentage was a little bit below the long-term aspirations that have been discussed recently. So it's a two part question really. One is just if you could unpack any of the factors there for us in the fourth quarter? And then if we think about the art of the possible going forward to start this year, is there a pathway near term, you can define that how you want, near term to recovering and moving back towards those longer-term aspirations in the high 20s or maybe 30?\nAlbert Nahmad: Very good question. As you know, I've stated earlier that eventually, our aspiration is 30%, and we have a ways to go. So I'm going to ask Barry Logan and Paul Johnston to deal with current events.\nBarry Logan: Yes. Thanks, Al. good morning, Tommy. We've said all year long with some of the moving pieces with gross profit and also said two years ago or so now, the aspiration -- short-term aspiration was 27%. And so, if I just focus on the year for a second, Tommy, just some important things to be grounded in looking at the year's performance and then I'll address the quarter and the shorter-term perspective. But for the year, the 27.4% million is what was achieved. And it's -- obviously, it's better than it was two years ago, two years ago, historically, and a lot of the moving pieces that we've talked about to drive and sustain that higher margin, obviously, are in place as we look at the year's perspective. If we look at a 60 business day perspective, which is the fourth quarter, in the off season, some of those variables have a greater impact in the short term. So that would be my first bias I would try to talk about is we're talking about 60 business days in the off-season in the fourth quarter and some of the moving pieces are more acute because of benefits of a year ago, not so much what's happening short term. So if I unpack that a bit and not be quite as abstract about it, we have about $16 million of benefit in the prior year from pricing gains, from weighted average cost gains, from inflationary gains, however you want to define it, which is roughly 100 basis points in the year ago quarter. Some of that is equipment, a greater proportion is not equipment as there was a lot of inflation going on in some of our non-equipment products a year ago like refrigerant, like copper tubing, like steel products and probably 40 other product lines where an year later, those benefits are not there. So that's 100 basis points. That's $16 million of consequence. And if I look forward to 12 months, instead of back 12 months, if I look forward 12 months, I don't expect there to be that kind of headwind in those products, let's say, a year from now. And it's just one of those things that as the numbers are larger in the fourth quarter, the acuteness is higher, $16 million would not be as material to a second or third quarter. It's more material to a fourth quarter. So that's probably the biggest impact in the quarter if you look at things on a year-over-year basis. There are some other moving pieces, which we've talked about. One is that equipment products in fact, have a lower gross margin than non-equipment products. So in the quarter, you see a mix difference between the growth rate of equipment, which was pretty flat. Non-equipment, which was down. So that's algebra that affects the margins in the quarter by 20, 30 basis points, I would say. And there are some other smaller things that aren't worth kind of going through. The bigger picture is this idea of inflationary gains that occurred a year ago. With less inflation, there's less inventory gains to come by. And if we look in the next 12 months, I would expect a much smoother water, much more -- less volatility in terms of this dynamic. I think we need to get beyond the first quarter to clearly see that if I look forward the next 12 months. But I would say a greater feeling of stability versus the volatility that you've been seeing this year. Paul, anything you would add to that?\nPaul Johnston: Barry, you've really covered a lot of ground there, yes. Obviously, there's going to be some price changes that we're going to see in some of the commodities, especially refrigerant. We should start seeing some uptick in refrigerant pricing as we -- as we've got the 30% reduction in allocations coming into effect January 1. Too early in the season to have really seen those yet in the first quarter, but obviously, those are expected. Secondly, we're also seeing some recovery in steel. We're seeing some recovery in some of the other products that we sell. So price increases are still occurring in the non-equipment side of the business, and we expect those to stabilize and perhaps grow as the year -- as the demand picks up during the year.\nTommy Moll: Thank you both for those helpful answers. As a follow-up, I wanted to pivot to a volume conversation and knowing that you won't give guidance, I'll try to frame it in a way that provides for a constructive discussion. If we look at the trends for unitary HVAC systems in the year you just concluded, down, I think it was 8% in your material this morning that you provided. I think we would agree that's an abnormal type trend. And so I'm just curious, if you look to 2024, is there anything abnormal that you see anything worth calling out now? Or does it feel more like a normal kind of environment off that lower base from last year?\nAlbert Nahmad: And it's a great question. By the way, some of the OEMs, particularly large ones -- now 30% unit volume drop in the fourth quarter. And we're pleased that we're doing a hell of a lot better than that. Paul, do you want to take a shot?\nPaul Johnston: Yes. The obvious elephant in the room is going to be the -- how fast the transition goes to the A2L product, which is being discussed in -- among the OEMs is a perhaps a 10% to 15% increase or a lift in price and each one of the OEMs, obviously, has a different implementation schedule. So it's not going to be a full year implementation that we're going to see on that. We're going to see some start coming in, in the second quarter and beyond. So I think that's going to be one of the things that's going to drive an increase. Secondly, obviously, a reduction in mortgage rates always helps. People buying existing homes although they don't intend to replace the air conditioning system, that's really when they're at the prime period where they would do a replacement is within the first 90 to 180 days after acquiring an existing home. So I think there's some good news out there. We don't -- I can't forecast out exactly how that's going to overlay into the entire year. But I think there's some positive things that we're going to be seeing as the year goes on.\nAlbert Nahmad: Generally. Let me just say generally that if -- I've obviously seen industry weakness as an opportunity for us. there are highly leveraged distributors in the business, and there are distributors that don't have the -- perhaps the balance sheet to deal with tougher times. We see that as an opportunity to join -- have them join us with their culture. We provide capital, we insisted they keep their culture and their organization and we provide tools that no one else has -- so I'm sort of well, I don't -- would not be very excited to have market industry data decline. If it happens, I'm also looking at opportunity to bring more wonderful companies to do partnership with us. Go ahead, Paul.\nPaul Johnston: I was just going to add about the unit data. I listened to the question, and I asked myself the question about units. Do we feel better or worse? That would be my simple way of asking that question. And so the first half of 2023 units were down, I think, in the teens. And second half of the year, I think it's -- units are down 2% or 3%. So I think we feel better about units than worse. Of course, the crystal ball is -- needs to play out next selling season in April to September when our business multiplies in size. But I think generally speaking, things again seem more stable as opposed to being volatile.\nTommy Moll: Thank you all. I appreciate the insight. And I will turn it back.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: Hi everyone. Good morning. My first question was on price and the outlook for '24. What do you think in price will contribute given what you've seen from the OEMs?\nAlbert Nahmad: We have that information. Barry, Paul?\nPaul Johnston: Yes, we've seen price increases announced already in the year on the existing equipment, and they range basically from 4% to 6%. So the equipment prices have already been announced. They're going to be further supplemented again by the introduction, as I indicated in the last question, with the A2L introduction. And so we're going to probably see some additional lift there. A lot of speculation around how big of a lift that's going to be, so nobody has really disclosed anything on their anticipated price outside of that wide range that I think you all have heard 10% to 15%. On the other products that we sell, we're also seeing, as I indicated, increased prices pretty much all of the copper products and all of the metal products that we sell and we experienced some softness on some of the insulation products last year. Those appear to be stabilized now and we should start seeing those products not have any sort of price degradation in 2024. How much all that is going to add up to? I think it's still a little bit of a question mark as far as being able to put a percentage against that against total sales, I think it will be clear in the second quarter as we start seeing what the rollout prices are going to look like for the A2L.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. Got it. And then I wanted to ask on SG&A. You've taken some actions there. Anything you can quantify for us in terms of how much is coming out in '24 or what your kind of aspiration is for SG&A growth in '24 either way?\nAlbert Nahmad: Mr. Logan?\nBarry Logan: Good morning Ryan. Well, first, again, there's two sides to that equation. And they're all -- it's all being driven again through the field, through our stores, through our regions, through our business unit leaders in terms of -- in their 2024 plans, reducing SG&A. And when I say reduced SG&A, it's not just cutting SG&A, it's finding out the opportunities for productivity after what had been also two years of wildness in terms of SG&A growth. Talk about the business performance of 2021 and 2022. It was also a very unproductive period of adding SG&A to serve what was going on. So that's what we're looking to improve and to some extent, simply get back to a little bit more normalized conditions in terms of how the branches operate and so on. So this kind of single-digit declines that you're seeing, Ryan, is a composite of two things. In recent quarters, it's variable expenses coming down 10%, 15% fixed cost inflation moderating, but still there's inflation in fixed costs like rent, for example. So it's probably a slow grind or better improvement from what you've been seeing in the last few quarters? This is, again, not restructuring the corporation. This is improving the daily expenses, the daily productivity. But in that kind of better progress from what we've been seeing in the last few quarters is our expectation. I'll have to leave it at that.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning David?\nOperator: Mr. Manthey, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question. Is it muted accidentally?\nDave Manthey: Got it. Yeah, hey. Good morning Al, good morning everyone. Can you hear me now?\nOperator: Yes. Please go ahead, sir.\nDave Manthey: So I'm going to stay on the gross margin topic, if I can here. Were there adjustments in the fourth quarter that hit gross margin disproportionately hard. Barry, you're kind of saying the year-over-year comparison looking back and then looking forward, are you implying that the gross margin a year from now, give or take, will be in the range that it was this year? Or was there something unusual in this fourth quarter that might affect that comparison?\nBarry Logan: Yes, good question. Well, a year from now, again, we'll have a completely different blend of new products a year from now. I would expect that to be a margin opportunity a year from now. There are no adjustments or funk that had hit this quarter that I would call out as being material or even important to talk about or even immaterial to talk about, really nothing that stands out. So yes, I think going back to the algebra of price and inflation and the seasonality and so on, again, I would expect as we get into season, we have pricing actions in our pocket. We have new products being introduced. And I would say, a continuance of the technology that we've been using to improve margin. And as far as a year from now and next fourth quarter, again, I think there's an opportunity to improve margin, but nothing that penalized this quarter in a particular way that would be important.\nDave Manthey: Okay. And yes, I appreciate you indulging us on all this quarterly conversation, which I don't think historically we would have done here. But Barry, you also said we need to get through the first quarter and you were kind of talking again about that year-to-year comparison, if you were down a couple of hundred basis points in the fourth quarter year-to-year because of all the items you mentioned, and then we look to the first quarter, that would put us in a range in the what, the 26.5%, 27% range. Just trying to understand the cadence, again, knowing there's a lot of moving parts there. Is there anything in the first quarter unusual that we should think about their relative to your comments, Barry?\nBarry Logan: Yeah, I think the pricing actions of the OEMs are pushed out a little bit into the late first quarter, early second quarter, if I look at things comparatively to last year. So you can read into that comment and in terms of modeling, you can consider the comment. So sequentially, I think, again, there're going to be certainly better margin in the first quarter versus a year ago, you have to consider my comment about the timing of some of the pricing actions that we're describing.\nPaul Johnston: That's a good point, Barry, because instead of a January 1 price increase, most everybody went February 1, March 1. So it's a little bit of a lag to Barry's point.\nBarry Logan: A top 10 vendor that went April 1 instead of January 1. So some of this -- the benefit will push a little bit later into 2024 than simply January 1.\nDave Manthey: Great. Thanks very much guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nBrett Linzey: [Multiple Speakers] Just want to come back to the inventory. So you took another $208 million out of the system. I believe that was a little bit ahead of your initial plan. But maybe you could just speak to your assessment of inventory levels as we begin to move into the selling season? Are there more actions that need to be taken, largely complete? How are you thinking about that?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I'll give you a big picture of it is that we do want and we'll work on higher inventory turns. So I do expect to have our inventory produce more cash flow as it turns. And the science that we use is to do that, is being implemented. It's a very long process, longer than I expected. But eventually, what you'll see is lower investment in inventory and higher returns when compared to sales.\nPaul Johnston: Yes, absolutely. This is Paul. Historically, it's been a four plus turn industry. And obviously, during the pandemic and the supply team is disruption, everybody got lost in the mid- to low 3s. And so now as we strive to get back to the four turns, obviously, we're going to have a reduction in inventory. Right now, we're seeing better cooperation and better lead times coming out of our OEMs pretty much across the board. And as those lead times improve, obviously, that gives us a better position to not have to stock as much inventory. So that's one thing that's happening. Secondly, Watsco has got an unusual position on inventory in each one of our operating units manages inventory. So there's not one big central headquarter directive that gets into the inventory. We manage it in much smaller blocks with each one of the operating units actually functioning against their vendors, what they need to have in stock and inventory. Plus Watsco invested during -- before the pandemic. We invested heavily in the technology it takes to manage inventory, putting in new inventory management systems. It gives us daily management reviews so that we can identify what we have on hand, what we have on order, by region, by district, by branch. So a lot more visibility than you'd find in a normal distribution company.\nBrett Linzey: Yes, that's great. And then just shifting to the non-equipment versus equipment trends as well as in the second half being a little better than first half. I guess it doesn't suggest there's a meaningful retrenchment in the consumer on the replacement side. Is there anything in terms of high efficiency mix or credit metrics or things that you're watching internally that would suggest there's a step down here in 2024 early in the year?\nPaul Johnston: Take a stab on the equipment side. The -- as we indicated a year ago, and we went to the higher efficiency minimums that were regulated by the government, we expected there to be a compression around the entry-level product. And we went from around 65% of the minimum efficiency products up to around 85%. So we've definitely seen more product coming out. It's higher-efficient product than what we had before, but it has distorted the industry a little bit towards the minimum efficiency as opposed to high efficiency.\nBarry Logan: And it's a good question on credit. It's not asked often enough, frankly. So we -- obviously, our accounts receivable represents contractor credit giving the average contractor about $10,000 a month and a credit line essentially. And so if you look at our cash flow statement, which is published in the press release, you'll see bad debt is actually down about 20% this year. So there's no obvious indication of change in the quality of the portfolio. It's roughly 10, 11 basis points of bad debt and again, compare that against any peer or any kind of other distribution model you can find, it's in a very favorable position. So credit is not something we're seeing a risk. It's how we serve customers and again, so far, so good from an economic point of view.\nBrett Linzey: All right. Appreciate the color. I will pass along.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Jeffrey.\nJeffrey Sprague: Good morning, Al. Good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. Hey just kind of back on price. Just wonder what, if anything, you make of the OEMs kind of going later and kind of not at the same time. Is there sort of a message here of kind of price fatigue in the market do you think? Is there a game theory or something we should be thinking about?\nPaul Johnston: I don't think it's that diabolical. I think it's just a natural progression of how they intend to roll out their new product introduction on the A2L and if you listen to each one of the OEMs on their public broadcast, you find that they each are putting out a different variety of products at different times during the year. And I think it has more to do with their engineering and their manufacturing plants and all that, that goes into rolling out the product.\nJeffrey Sprague: Yes, interesting. Makes sense. And then just kind of back to the replacement question I was asked kind of at least obliquely a couple of different ways. Al, in your opening, you kind of talked about the inevitability of after a year like 2023 here. If we do go back to just that kind of old school demographic replacement [indiscernible] into the whole 15-year life and all that argument. We're echoing against 2009 right now, right? So that math could argue for another soft replacement year. I just wonder your thoughts on that and kind of what you're seeing in repair versus replace?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, our guru and that is Paul Johnson.\nPaul Johnston: Oh my God. Start with the repair versus replace. It's is fourth quarter, first quarter, which is not the time when you're going to see a lot of repair going on out there. You don't have your air conditioners working, you have your heat pumps and your gas furnaces, which your gas furnaces are generally a lower repair item. So to date, we're not declaring that there's any trends that we've been able to identify and repair versus replace. Will it occur when the temperature goes up, we'll wait and see and find out. The other part of your question was what?\nJeffrey Sprague: Just the underlying health of replacement demand based on kind of where the installed base is and sort of the age of the installed base.\nPaul Johnston: The age of the installed base is newer than it's probably ever been since I've been around, which is a long time. But obviously, the mix of the installed base is changing. Gas furnaces generally have a lifetime. You can make a gas furnace last 25, 30 years, whereas a straight cool unit, I think the industry has said, it's around 15, 16 years. Heat pumps are something that are growing as a percentage of the total business. And those generally don't have as long a lifetime. Remember, they're not just operating in the wintertime, they're operating in the summertime also. So you've got more hours being packed on to that piece of equipment. What that's going to do to the overall mix of installed base out there right now. I think that's going to be one of the questions that we'll be able to look at probably in the next year or so. But replacement pull up, I figured that we probably had 2.5 million to 3 million units were pulled up troughing the pandemic. They were installed perhaps prematurely, perhaps not. Trying to get some data around that to see what the geography was of those replacements? Was it North or was it south? Where people were actually replacing equipment. A lot of data coming in, a lot of data that needs to be analyzed to answer that question properly.\nA.J. Nahmad: Paul, I think you said something [indiscernible] This is A.J. In your 40 years in this industry, this is probably a dynamic period for the space as there's ever been between -- I mean all these questions are pointing to all the different in outs and change in paradigm between the supply chain, changing again the OEMs going with different pricing, different times, the change of rates of pricing going up and inflation, the inventory and the change to the A2L products coming out. There's so many different things going on in the industry today, which creates a lot of noise. But I have to say that I think Watsco is very well positioned. Our inventory has come down. The quality of our inventory has gone up as far as lower excess and slow and damaged inventory. Pricing, Barry, you covered a lot of it. What I think you left out was the key fundamental block there is that our transaction margin or as I think it's been written structural margin going in the right direction for 2023. I think there's more momentum around that in 2024. I think we're doing a good job. Our leaders and our teams in the field are doing a good job managing expenses given all the craziness in the space and the balance sheet. The balance sheet being without any debt well positioned for any opportunity that comes our way. So I guess my point is then in a crazy industry in a crazy time, I like where we sit and I like our performance, and I remain very optimistic about the year and the future.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you for the perspective.\nAlbert Nahmad: And I think that's well said.\nBarry Logan: I agree.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Hi, everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. I think right after your last call. There was a rule by the EPA interpreting the AIM Act, just wondering if you have any thoughts on the impact of that rule as it relates to the dates around the transition?\nPaul Johnston: Yes, it doesn't change the dates of the transition. All it really did was change the sell-through process. Originally, the AIM Act out and indicated that you had to see selling any 410A product at the end of the year. The EPA came out with that with what you're talking about and has a one year sell-through now. The units have to be manufactured and produced in 2024. The date for building anymore is December 31 of this year, and then there's a 12-month sell-through.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Understood. And I think there was also some consternation around what constituted manufacturing and if that could actually apply to things that were charged in the field, wondered if you had any thoughts on that? And then over -- like bigger picture, though, does this actually change the time frame over which the OEMs are taking the actions that they're taking. Just any thoughts there?\nPaul Johnston: No, it doesn't really change. The manufacturers have had to plan for this transition for the last several years. So it did not change the way that they're going to flow this through. They had to get their manufacturing processes in order. They had to change their plant, get their vendors lined up. There was no real change in direction based upon that ruling. They still have to stop manufacturing all 410A units at the end of the year. I think what you were referring to had more to do with what was a component? Was the outdoor unit a component and hence, it could be replaced. That question is still a little bit up in the air. There's still some fuzziness around that so that subsequent to the sell-through period, can you still install a 410 outdoor unit or indoor unit as a repair component? That has not been clarified yet.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Okay. Understood. And if I may, I don't think I heard earlier what your commercial HVAC sales were year-over-year relative to residential -- and if you have any thoughts on where commercial can go in the year ahead?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well I did comment that commercial is very strong, and then we have backlog for at least a year. Can you add anything more to that, Barry or Paul?\nBarry Logan: I mean for the year, commercial was up in the teens. So I think that's been the trend all year long. The fourth quarter was near double digits and leave it at that, residential down a little bit.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: And looking forward?\nBarry Logan: And I was going to say, and for the quarter, for the sake of the algebra, we had one less selling day in the quarter, so you can adjust for that if you choose to. Sorry, what was your question?\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Just the outlook for commercial?\nBarry Logan: Again, we don't measure backlog in the same proportions as the OEM to make large quantities of large commercial but like we said, I think, in the release or in the commentary, the backlog is still strong. We haven't seen much variation in trend. And so not a reason to think that there will be.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. And most of our commercial unitary products go at once. It's a replacement demand. So there is no backlog.\nBarry Logan: I always remember to put it in perspective, commercial for us is about 15% of what we do. Between 15% and 20% of what we do\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Hammond: Hey, good morning guys. So I heard a bunch of different things on gross margin. I wanted to come back to that. It sounds like transaction margin moving in the right direction. You got these kind of headwinds that carry over maybe 1Q, 2Q. Just mean maybe level set us on how you think about gross margins for 2024. Is that kind of 27% margin doable or do we kind of run a little bit below that given some of the moving pieces?\nAlbert Nahmad: You better take that Barry. Barry and Paul, do you want to deal with that?\nBarry Logan: Yes, I'll handle it. Well, first, I want to go back to the transaction margin. A.J. mentioned that, and it's important to emphasize that I think so for the year, which I really want to speak about the year. In the year, the headwind in terms of all this noise about weighted average cost gains and inflation and so on. That headwind in 2023 was about 120 basis points. And that's what we expect that to diminish greatly, importantly as we get into 2024. The margin gain, the selling margin gain in the year was 70 basis points. So the -- that transactional margin that we make by improving pricing, improving everything we do relative to price and margin did improve in 2023. So the question for 2024 is can that continue? Can that trend continue? And then some of the other noise diminishes, I would say, has largely diminished. So to answer your question, we're going to stick with 27% of the goal for next -- for 2024. And there's some good momentum in the selling margin and some of these other pricing action discussions we're having will have to play out as we think in the second, third quarter, especially for that to play out. But I think it's where we stand today.\nA.J. Nahmad: Including the transition to the A2L products, that will be -- have to see how that plays out in the market as well.\nJeffrey Hammond: And just to clarify, the non-equipment down six, did you have negative price in there where there were some actually real disinflation around whether it be refrigerant or copper steel?\nPaul Johnston: I don't -- go ahead Barry.\nBarry Logan: Go ahead, Paul. You got it.\nPaul Johnston: I don't think there was much of the way of a deflation that was really occurring there. Yes, we had a couple of product areas where -- we did see some price degradation, but it stabilized and came back. But I just think it was overall demand. And we just saw a slowdown in demand on those products.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. And then just last one. On the -- Barry, you talked about kind of being a merchant and you've got pricing kind of a little bit later but you're also kind of managing dry down inventory. So how should we think about kind of buying ahead of price increases to be a merchant versus managing inventories lower as you go into the selling season? Thanks.\nBarry Logan: Yes, I mean is it more direct question whether we're buying Ford in some way and beating the price increase and so on. I'm not going to, again, publicly say what we do in terms of competing for -- but it's not a practice that we entertain on scale. I think we look at it here and there. We look at it market by market. At no time do we look at Watsco as a scaled company and say, let's buy Ford. And it's not something that really is a responsible thing to do in that sense. So I think in markets we consider it and certain brands we consider it, but nothing on scale that would be remarkable, Jeff.\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes, I would say we are emerging, but we don't bet the ranch, and we take a risk-adjusted approach to [indiscernible].\nPaul Johnston: Plus, Jeff, I think you've got the phase-in, phase-out of we're going to be phasing out of 410, phasing into the A2L product. So I think right now, we'll buy we'll buy a product that we need when we need it.\nOperator: Was there a follow-up, Mr. Hammond?\nJeffrey Hammond: No. I'm all set. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Good morning. How are you? So just to get the math down on the kind of resi unit sell-through, it looks like if we kind of parse that between light commercial and resi, that was down roughly 10% for the year, the resi stuff -- on units? It was down 8%, including commercial?\nBarry Logan: We don't really -- I mean, we don't include commercial in our unit volume discussion, Steve, [Multiple Speakers].\nSteve Tusa: Okay. That's great. And I guess, just thinking about the gross margin, I mean, there's just such a wide gulf between what you did this quarter and what you did last first quarter. Can you just give us -- and you mentioned the price increases are coming a little bit later. Can you just give us any flavor for like where that 1Q might land in this whole construct on gross margin?\nBarry Logan: I would say without constituting official guidance, I think I tried to say it earlier, which is something sequentially better than the fourth quarter, start looking at things more sequentially than year-over-year. It takes some of the year ago volatility out. So an improvement sequentially from what you saw this quarter into the first quarter.\nSteve Tusa: Right. So not up year-over-year, but something better than the fourth quarter?\nBarry Logan: That's correct.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, okay. That's helpful. And I guess this whole discussion on pricing, are you assuming that the non-A2L products that you get price on those? I mean you're making it sound like the degree of price you get will depend on what kind of A2L product you sell. Are you assuming some lift on the non-A2L equipment? And then secondarily, if like there is some pushback in the channel, are you kind of prepared to ask your OEMs to kind of help you guys maintain or gain share in this market with price?\nPaul Johnston: Those are all great questions of what if. Obviously, we keep in mind of some contact with our OEMs, and we'll be -- we'll be ready to make any sort of a judgment that is required to be competitive in the marketplace. We're not going to lose our competitiveness. And our OEMs certainly are not of that vein either. So yeah, we'll be working with them on that. One thing that makes the A2L introduction unusual, if you remember when we went from the 410A to the R-22, 410A was introduced five or six years before we transitioned over to -- transition out of the R-22. So you had a price basis that gradually was inserted over that six year period before we actually implemented the transition. This time, we're not going to have that. So I think there's a lot of question marks around exactly how this price can be set. And will the price go up or will be said too low, will it be so too high. And so that's a what if that -- I guess I'm not smart enough to answer.\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes, I think it's more of a when, not if because I think different customer segments will adopt the new products sooner and then others and the prices will shake out as all this transpires and it's not going to happen in Q1. We know that. And so really the summer that we'll see how it works out in the market.\nSteve Tusa: But -- are you assuming capture on the older -- are you assuming price capture on the non-A2L? Or is most of the price lift from the A2Ls?\nPaul Johnston: We have not assumed the price that there's going to be captured on the 410. [indiscernible] We've got the price increase so far for the 410. It's not anticipated that we're going to be able to price that up against the A2L. I don't think anybody is assuming that.\nSteve Tusa: Against the A2L. I'm just saying like-for-like relative to where the price was in '23 for the non-A2L, like do you assume year-over-year capture if A2L wasn't happening would you assume year-over-year capture on the 410A type product?\nPaul Johnston: Certainly. With the price increases that we have, yes, of course. [Multiple Speakers]\nBarry Logan: Yes, I want to be really clear about that. So Paul mentioned earlier, if we range it out across really -- we sell six OEMs products on the ductive side, probably another six on the ductless side and the range of price consistently across the group is between 4% and 6% as we said earlier. Your question is, do you expect to yield any of that in 2024? And the answer is yes. To what extent time will tell, but we certainly do not see outliers and if there's a competitive need in the market or customer type or an application, OEMs will always be asked to participate and react to what's going on in the market. But on whole, on scale, we do expect price capture 410A.\nSteve Tusa: And then sorry, I just got one more. The call usually ends early, so hopefully, I'm not taking up anybody's time here. But the 2.5 million to 3 million units you mentioned, what's kind of the math on that? And can you just explain that, what you meant by that, the 2.5 million to 3 million units that you're calculating is being installed at the peak?\nPaul Johnston: Well, if you look at 2019 as your baseline at roughly 8.5 million units. And then we zoomed up to [indiscernible] we stayed above 10 million in 2023, the industry shipments fell back down to 2019 a little bit ahead. So if you take a normal, let's say, 2% or 3% growth rate that the industry historically has had put that against where we were in 2019 and take the delta.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Okay. Great. So that pull forward, you're saying like kind of the opposite end?\nPaul Johnston: Yes, that looked like a pull forward to me. Like I indicated to you, one, we've got to look at it geographically because you have longer life spans, obviously, in Michigan than you do in Miami, Florida.\nSteve Tusa: Right, right. Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, Damian.\nDamian Karas: Hey, good morning, everyone. I have a follow-up question on inventory. I know you talked about normalizing back to kind of four to five turns over time. Just curious if you're anticipating though, later this year, maybe having to go in a restocking mode as the 454B equipment becomes available and then basically, you kind of get your last call on getting that 410A? And related to that, I'm just curious if there's any incremental cost that you might expect just as you're kind of managing the legacy versus the A2L inventory buckets? Or can you do that pretty efficiently?\nPaul Johnston: I think we -- each one of our operating units is developing plans for what we call phase in phasing in the A2L products and phasing out the 410 products. We have -- and obviously, we have a safeguard that we mentioned earlier with the AIM Act where we can sell the 410A all the way through next year. But each one of our operating units is working on that plan so that -- we want to be able to hit our inventory targets. We want to be able to hit the demands of the marketplace and our contractors. And we want to be able to do it in a very logical format so that it's not disruptive to the business and it's not creating additional overhead for us.\nDamian Karas: Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then kind of a follow-up question to a comment you made, Barry, about you sell six OEM products on the ductive side, six on the ductless side, I mean it does [indiscernible] there's a lot of kind of newer players trying to make moves in the US market, particularly in key pumps and some of these alternative electric high-efficiency solutions. Would you guys foresee working with more equipment vendors over time or you pretty kind of satisfied and set in your existing relationships and product breadth?\nA.J. Nahmad: Are you satisfied?\nBarry Logan: It's like a -- I want to give like a half hour answer to that honestly. I mean I don't think we look at our portfolio of brands and say, do we have enough or too much. I don't think we can even consider that kind of notion. We look at the markets themselves. So where we've acquired great businesses, we've acquired a great carrier distributor in Chicago three years ago. We acquired a great green distributor in Louisiana a few years ago. the acquisition campaign is somewhat indifferent to brand. It's focused on who are the dominant players in markets and over time, building incredible franchises on top of the credible franchise that owners have built, so I would say that from that growth perspective and if you ask me, can Watsco double in size, the answer is yes, and we would do it that way. And oddly enough, ironically enough, the brands are relatively indifferent to that strategy. because we're trying to grow share in markets and legacies and that's what we've done, right? I mean we were a $1 billion company 20 years ago. We're a $7 billion company now, and we know we can double the size of Watsco in that same kind of way of growing over the long term. Now if your question is very short term and kind of the puzzle pieces that we operate today, we're not going to be satisfied unless market share is well above average end markets. And we're going to find either build on relationships we have and add brands, with carrier, I don't think people really appreciate it, but we sell seven, eight different brands that carrier makes and we don't have all of carrier brands in all of our carrier locations, and that's an opportunity that we talk about in terms of how to bring more density to those brands and those stores. And we've added -- there are niche products and manufacturers that operate in niches that we've added to our network. This ductless that we've added to our network. We have a private label that's grown over time. So very interesting question with a very long-tailed answer\nA.J. Nahmad: I'll say this is that we're never satisfied. That's part of our culture. We're very ambitious. We're always wanting to grow, always want to move up and to the right. It's an exciting time in the industry as key pumps have gained traction and regulation, frankly, and the changing markets are creating product innovation for the first time I think in a long time, and it's exciting. And that innovation is not only coming from new entrants, but it's also coming from our OEM partners with products that they've brought to market or that they will bring to market it's fun and exciting with the improvement and enhancements in the technology that's coming into the product and it will be fun to take in the market as well.\nDamian Karas: Really appreciate the color. Best of luck, guys. And Barry, I'll make sure I follow up, so you can give you the full 30-minute response.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Thanks for your interest in our company. We much appreciate it. And we believe that we have an enormous future ahead of us, and we hope you'll be with us along the way. Bye-bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

            "name": "Albert Nahmad",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. With me is A.J. Nahmad, Watsco's President; and Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Now before we start, our cautionary statement, as always, this conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by the SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to safe harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from forward-looking statements. Now, Watsco delivered strong results in 2023 despite some market conditions which were somewhat inevitable after two extraordinary years in 2021 and 2022. While reflecting in the year's results, I am proud of the accomplishments we delivered. We achieved market share gain in markets we serve. We further scaled Watsco's industry-leading technology platforms. We had a successful start driving down long-term productivity gains. I should say, we had a successful start driving long-term productivity gains. We expanded our network and product offerings by acquiring great businesses through our scale, and we fortified our balance sheet through inventory reduction and generated record fourth quarter cash flow. And once again, shareholders will receive a meaningful dividend increase in 2024, which is in April 2024. This is Watsco's 50th consecutive year of paying dividends. 2023 was also a year of immense change in virtually all equipment products transition to new [indiscernible] systems. In collaboration with our OEM partners, Watsco introduced new products and SKUs for over 25 brands of HVAC systems. Our teams executed well, and thanks to our scale and speed to market. We are confident that we gained share. We also trained thousands of customers on new products and our digital pilot library was updated with approximately 500,000 new SKUs. In this spring we will begin the next regulatory transition to new A2L products with lower GWP refrigerants. These regulatory transitions are positive for our industry and are good for Watsco's business. They offer meaningful value to homeowners and businesses to upgrade systems that are more efficient and better for the environment. Watsco's residential unit volumes, although still down, stabilized during the second half of 2023. Commercial end markets remain strong across all markets. Our commercial business continued to grow at a healthy rate, and our backlog of products extends well into next year. Sales of ductless systems, an increasingly important component of our business grew double digits in the year, and offset declines in conventional residential business. SG&A as a percentage of sales on a same-store basis decreased for the year, indicating progress in driving more productivity across the company. We believe we are in early innings of a long-term opportunity to meaningfully improve productivity and overall efficiencies. We have challenged our leaders and provided them with tools and data to implement change. And most importantly, we possess an entrepreneurial culture to execute change in a responsible way. Over the past year, we expanded our network through acquisitions with three terrific business joining the Watsco family, collectively their annual sales are around $200 million. These businesses will retain their culture, leadership teams and uniqueness in the market, consistent with our long-term practice of honoring and sustaining great legacies. Our industry remains highly fragmented, and we will continue to pursue other great companies to grow scale in our $60 billion North American market. We believe Watsco's technology advantage, market-leading scale and the strength of our balance sheet are all great reasons to join the Watsco family. Now before getting to Q&A, as always, I want to emphasize that our core focus remains on the long term. We believe our scale, the quality of our balance sheet and unique culture will continue to drive long-term growth and performance. We have an immense technology advantage, and we invested -- investing to grow that advantage. Watsco's broad array of products and brands is also a competitive advantage that allows us to serve contractors in any environment. And finally, our industry is fortunate to benefit from important regulatory and industry catalysts that should positively influence Watsco's performers in the years ahead. With that, let's go on to Q&A. You bet. Very good question. As you know, I've stated earlier that eventually, our aspiration is 30%, and we have a ways to go. So I'm going to ask Barry Logan and Paul Johnston to deal with current events. And it's a great question. By the way, some of the OEMs, particularly large ones -- now 30% unit volume drop in the fourth quarter. And we're pleased that we're doing a hell of a lot better than that. Paul, do you want to take a shot? Generally. Let me just say generally that if -- I've obviously seen industry weakness as an opportunity for us. there are highly leveraged distributors in the business, and there are distributors that don't have the -- perhaps the balance sheet to deal with tougher times. We see that as an opportunity to join -- have them join us with their culture. We provide capital, we insisted they keep their culture and their organization and we provide tools that no one else has -- so I'm sort of well, I don't -- would not be very excited to have market industry data decline. If it happens, I'm also looking at opportunity to bring more wonderful companies to do partnership with us. Go ahead, Paul. We have that information. Barry, Paul? Mr. Logan? Good morning David? Well, I'll give you a big picture of it is that we do want and we'll work on higher inventory turns. So I do expect to have our inventory produce more cash flow as it turns. And the science that we use is to do that, is being implemented. It's a very long process, longer than I expected. But eventually, what you'll see is lower investment in inventory and higher returns when compared to sales. Good morning, Jeffrey. Well, our guru and that is Paul Johnson. And I think that's well said. Good morning, Joe. Well I did comment that commercial is very strong, and then we have backlog for at least a year. Can you add anything more to that, Barry or Paul? You better take that Barry. Barry and Paul, do you want to deal with that? Good morning, Damian. Thanks for your interest in our company. We much appreciate it. And we believe that we have an enormous future ahead of us, and we hope you'll be with us along the way. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Al. good morning, Tommy. We've said all year long with some of the moving pieces with gross profit and also said two years ago or so now, the aspiration -- short-term aspiration was 27%. And so, if I just focus on the year for a second, Tommy, just some important things to be grounded in looking at the year's performance and then I'll address the quarter and the shorter-term perspective. But for the year, the 27.4% million is what was achieved. And it's -- obviously, it's better than it was two years ago, two years ago, historically, and a lot of the moving pieces that we've talked about to drive and sustain that higher margin, obviously, are in place as we look at the year's perspective. If we look at a 60 business day perspective, which is the fourth quarter, in the off season, some of those variables have a greater impact in the short term. So that would be my first bias I would try to talk about is we're talking about 60 business days in the off-season in the fourth quarter and some of the moving pieces are more acute because of benefits of a year ago, not so much what's happening short term. So if I unpack that a bit and not be quite as abstract about it, we have about $16 million of benefit in the prior year from pricing gains, from weighted average cost gains, from inflationary gains, however you want to define it, which is roughly 100 basis points in the year ago quarter. Some of that is equipment, a greater proportion is not equipment as there was a lot of inflation going on in some of our non-equipment products a year ago like refrigerant, like copper tubing, like steel products and probably 40 other product lines where an year later, those benefits are not there. So that's 100 basis points. That's $16 million of consequence. And if I look forward to 12 months, instead of back 12 months, if I look forward 12 months, I don't expect there to be that kind of headwind in those products, let's say, a year from now. And it's just one of those things that as the numbers are larger in the fourth quarter, the acuteness is higher, $16 million would not be as material to a second or third quarter. It's more material to a fourth quarter. So that's probably the biggest impact in the quarter if you look at things on a year-over-year basis. There are some other moving pieces, which we've talked about. One is that equipment products in fact, have a lower gross margin than non-equipment products. So in the quarter, you see a mix difference between the growth rate of equipment, which was pretty flat. Non-equipment, which was down. So that's algebra that affects the margins in the quarter by 20, 30 basis points, I would say. And there are some other smaller things that aren't worth kind of going through. The bigger picture is this idea of inflationary gains that occurred a year ago. With less inflation, there's less inventory gains to come by. And if we look in the next 12 months, I would expect a much smoother water, much more -- less volatility in terms of this dynamic. I think we need to get beyond the first quarter to clearly see that if I look forward the next 12 months. But I would say a greater feeling of stability versus the volatility that you've been seeing this year. Paul, anything you would add to that? Good morning Ryan. Well, first, again, there's two sides to that equation. And they're all -- it's all being driven again through the field, through our stores, through our regions, through our business unit leaders in terms of -- in their 2024 plans, reducing SG&A. And when I say reduced SG&A, it's not just cutting SG&A, it's finding out the opportunities for productivity after what had been also two years of wildness in terms of SG&A growth. Talk about the business performance of 2021 and 2022. It was also a very unproductive period of adding SG&A to serve what was going on. So that's what we're looking to improve and to some extent, simply get back to a little bit more normalized conditions in terms of how the branches operate and so on. So this kind of single-digit declines that you're seeing, Ryan, is a composite of two things. In recent quarters, it's variable expenses coming down 10%, 15% fixed cost inflation moderating, but still there's inflation in fixed costs like rent, for example. So it's probably a slow grind or better improvement from what you've been seeing in the last few quarters? This is, again, not restructuring the corporation. This is improving the daily expenses, the daily productivity. But in that kind of better progress from what we've been seeing in the last few quarters is our expectation. I'll have to leave it at that. Yes, good question. Well, a year from now, again, we'll have a completely different blend of new products a year from now. I would expect that to be a margin opportunity a year from now. There are no adjustments or funk that had hit this quarter that I would call out as being material or even important to talk about or even immaterial to talk about, really nothing that stands out. So yes, I think going back to the algebra of price and inflation and the seasonality and so on, again, I would expect as we get into season, we have pricing actions in our pocket. We have new products being introduced. And I would say, a continuance of the technology that we've been using to improve margin. And as far as a year from now and next fourth quarter, again, I think there's an opportunity to improve margin, but nothing that penalized this quarter in a particular way that would be important. Yeah, I think the pricing actions of the OEMs are pushed out a little bit into the late first quarter, early second quarter, if I look at things comparatively to last year. So you can read into that comment and in terms of modeling, you can consider the comment. So sequentially, I think, again, there're going to be certainly better margin in the first quarter versus a year ago, you have to consider my comment about the timing of some of the pricing actions that we're describing. A top 10 vendor that went April 1 instead of January 1. So some of this -- the benefit will push a little bit later into 2024 than simply January 1. And it's a good question on credit. It's not asked often enough, frankly. So we -- obviously, our accounts receivable represents contractor credit giving the average contractor about $10,000 a month and a credit line essentially. And so if you look at our cash flow statement, which is published in the press release, you'll see bad debt is actually down about 20% this year. So there's no obvious indication of change in the quality of the portfolio. It's roughly 10, 11 basis points of bad debt and again, compare that against any peer or any kind of other distribution model you can find, it's in a very favorable position. So credit is not something we're seeing a risk. It's how we serve customers and again, so far, so good from an economic point of view. I agree. I mean for the year, commercial was up in the teens. So I think that's been the trend all year long. The fourth quarter was near double digits and leave it at that, residential down a little bit. And I was going to say, and for the quarter, for the sake of the algebra, we had one less selling day in the quarter, so you can adjust for that if you choose to. Sorry, what was your question? Again, we don't measure backlog in the same proportions as the OEM to make large quantities of large commercial but like we said, I think, in the release or in the commentary, the backlog is still strong. We haven't seen much variation in trend. And so not a reason to think that there will be. I always remember to put it in perspective, commercial for us is about 15% of what we do. Between 15% and 20% of what we do Yes, I'll handle it. Well, first, I want to go back to the transaction margin. A.J. mentioned that, and it's important to emphasize that I think so for the year, which I really want to speak about the year. In the year, the headwind in terms of all this noise about weighted average cost gains and inflation and so on. That headwind in 2023 was about 120 basis points. And that's what we expect that to diminish greatly, importantly as we get into 2024. The margin gain, the selling margin gain in the year was 70 basis points. So the -- that transactional margin that we make by improving pricing, improving everything we do relative to price and margin did improve in 2023. So the question for 2024 is can that continue? Can that trend continue? And then some of the other noise diminishes, I would say, has largely diminished. So to answer your question, we're going to stick with 27% of the goal for next -- for 2024. And there's some good momentum in the selling margin and some of these other pricing action discussions we're having will have to play out as we think in the second, third quarter, especially for that to play out. But I think it's where we stand today. Go ahead, Paul. You got it. Yes, I mean is it more direct question whether we're buying Ford in some way and beating the price increase and so on. I'm not going to, again, publicly say what we do in terms of competing for -- but it's not a practice that we entertain on scale. I think we look at it here and there. We look at it market by market. At no time do we look at Watsco as a scaled company and say, let's buy Ford. And it's not something that really is a responsible thing to do in that sense. So I think in markets we consider it and certain brands we consider it, but nothing on scale that would be remarkable, Jeff. We don't really -- I mean, we don't include commercial in our unit volume discussion, Steve, [Multiple Speakers]. I would say without constituting official guidance, I think I tried to say it earlier, which is something sequentially better than the fourth quarter, start looking at things more sequentially than year-over-year. It takes some of the year ago volatility out. So an improvement sequentially from what you saw this quarter into the first quarter. That's correct. Yes, I want to be really clear about that. So Paul mentioned earlier, if we range it out across really -- we sell six OEMs products on the ductive side, probably another six on the ductless side and the range of price consistently across the group is between 4% and 6% as we said earlier. Your question is, do you expect to yield any of that in 2024? And the answer is yes. To what extent time will tell, but we certainly do not see outliers and if there's a competitive need in the market or customer type or an application, OEMs will always be asked to participate and react to what's going on in the market. But on whole, on scale, we do expect price capture 410A. It's like a -- I want to give like a half hour answer to that honestly. I mean I don't think we look at our portfolio of brands and say, do we have enough or too much. I don't think we can even consider that kind of notion. We look at the markets themselves. So where we've acquired great businesses, we've acquired a great carrier distributor in Chicago three years ago. We acquired a great green distributor in Louisiana a few years ago. the acquisition campaign is somewhat indifferent to brand. It's focused on who are the dominant players in markets and over time, building incredible franchises on top of the credible franchise that owners have built, so I would say that from that growth perspective and if you ask me, can Watsco double in size, the answer is yes, and we would do it that way. And oddly enough, ironically enough, the brands are relatively indifferent to that strategy. because we're trying to grow share in markets and legacies and that's what we've done, right? I mean we were a $1 billion company 20 years ago. We're a $7 billion company now, and we know we can double the size of Watsco in that same kind of way of growing over the long term. Now if your question is very short term and kind of the puzzle pieces that we operate today, we're not going to be satisfied unless market share is well above average end markets. And we're going to find either build on relationships we have and add brands, with carrier, I don't think people really appreciate it, but we sell seven, eight different brands that carrier makes and we don't have all of carrier brands in all of our carrier locations, and that's an opportunity that we talk about in terms of how to bring more density to those brands and those stores. And we've added -- there are niche products and manufacturers that operate in niches that we've added to our network. This ductless that we've added to our network. We have a private label that's grown over time. So very interesting question with a very long-tailed answer"

            "content": "Paul, I think you said something [indiscernible] This is A.J. In your 40 years in this industry, this is probably a dynamic period for the space as there's ever been between -- I mean all these questions are pointing to all the different in outs and change in paradigm between the supply chain, changing again the OEMs going with different pricing, different times, the change of rates of pricing going up and inflation, the inventory and the change to the A2L products coming out. There's so many different things going on in the industry today, which creates a lot of noise. But I have to say that I think Watsco is very well positioned. Our inventory has come down. The quality of our inventory has gone up as far as lower excess and slow and damaged inventory. Pricing, Barry, you covered a lot of it. What I think you left out was the key fundamental block there is that our transaction margin or as I think it's been written structural margin going in the right direction for 2023. I think there's more momentum around that in 2024. I think we're doing a good job. Our leaders and our teams in the field are doing a good job managing expenses given all the craziness in the space and the balance sheet. The balance sheet being without any debt well positioned for any opportunity that comes our way. So I guess my point is then in a crazy industry in a crazy time, I like where we sit and I like our performance, and I remain very optimistic about the year and the future. Including the transition to the A2L products, that will be -- have to see how that plays out in the market as well. Yes, I would say we are emerging, but we don't bet the ranch, and we take a risk-adjusted approach to [indiscernible]. Yes, I think it's more of a when, not if because I think different customer segments will adopt the new products sooner and then others and the prices will shake out as all this transpires and it's not going to happen in Q1. We know that. And so really the summer that we'll see how it works out in the market. Are you satisfied? I'll say this is that we're never satisfied. That's part of our culture. We're very ambitious. We're always wanting to grow, always want to move up and to the right. It's an exciting time in the industry as key pumps have gained traction and regulation, frankly, and the changing markets are creating product innovation for the first time I think in a long time, and it's exciting. And that innovation is not only coming from new entrants, but it's also coming from our OEM partners with products that they've brought to market or that they will bring to market it's fun and exciting with the improvement and enhancements in the technology that's coming into the product and it will be fun to take in the market as well."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Barry, you've really covered a lot of ground there, yes. Obviously, there's going to be some price changes that we're going to see in some of the commodities, especially refrigerant. We should start seeing some uptick in refrigerant pricing as we -- as we've got the 30% reduction in allocations coming into effect January 1. Too early in the season to have really seen those yet in the first quarter, but obviously, those are expected. Secondly, we're also seeing some recovery in steel. We're seeing some recovery in some of the other products that we sell. So price increases are still occurring in the non-equipment side of the business, and we expect those to stabilize and perhaps grow as the year -- as the demand picks up during the year. Yes. The obvious elephant in the room is going to be the -- how fast the transition goes to the A2L product, which is being discussed in -- among the OEMs is a perhaps a 10% to 15% increase or a lift in price and each one of the OEMs, obviously, has a different implementation schedule. So it's not going to be a full year implementation that we're going to see on that. We're going to see some start coming in, in the second quarter and beyond. So I think that's going to be one of the things that's going to drive an increase. Secondly, obviously, a reduction in mortgage rates always helps. People buying existing homes although they don't intend to replace the air conditioning system, that's really when they're at the prime period where they would do a replacement is within the first 90 to 180 days after acquiring an existing home. So I think there's some good news out there. We don't -- I can't forecast out exactly how that's going to overlay into the entire year. But I think there's some positive things that we're going to be seeing as the year goes on. I was just going to add about the unit data. I listened to the question, and I asked myself the question about units. Do we feel better or worse? That would be my simple way of asking that question. And so the first half of 2023 units were down, I think, in the teens. And second half of the year, I think it's -- units are down 2% or 3%. So I think we feel better about units than worse. Of course, the crystal ball is -- needs to play out next selling season in April to September when our business multiplies in size. But I think generally speaking, things again seem more stable as opposed to being volatile. Yes, we've seen price increases announced already in the year on the existing equipment, and they range basically from 4% to 6%. So the equipment prices have already been announced. They're going to be further supplemented again by the introduction, as I indicated in the last question, with the A2L introduction. And so we're going to probably see some additional lift there. A lot of speculation around how big of a lift that's going to be, so nobody has really disclosed anything on their anticipated price outside of that wide range that I think you all have heard 10% to 15%. On the other products that we sell, we're also seeing, as I indicated, increased prices pretty much all of the copper products and all of the metal products that we sell and we experienced some softness on some of the insulation products last year. Those appear to be stabilized now and we should start seeing those products not have any sort of price degradation in 2024. How much all that is going to add up to? I think it's still a little bit of a question mark as far as being able to put a percentage against that against total sales, I think it will be clear in the second quarter as we start seeing what the rollout prices are going to look like for the A2L. That's a good point, Barry, because instead of a January 1 price increase, most everybody went February 1, March 1. So it's a little bit of a lag to Barry's point. Yes, absolutely. This is Paul. Historically, it's been a four plus turn industry. And obviously, during the pandemic and the supply team is disruption, everybody got lost in the mid- to low 3s. And so now as we strive to get back to the four turns, obviously, we're going to have a reduction in inventory. Right now, we're seeing better cooperation and better lead times coming out of our OEMs pretty much across the board. And as those lead times improve, obviously, that gives us a better position to not have to stock as much inventory. So that's one thing that's happening. Secondly, Watsco has got an unusual position on inventory in each one of our operating units manages inventory. So there's not one big central headquarter directive that gets into the inventory. We manage it in much smaller blocks with each one of the operating units actually functioning against their vendors, what they need to have in stock and inventory. Plus Watsco invested during -- before the pandemic. We invested heavily in the technology it takes to manage inventory, putting in new inventory management systems. It gives us daily management reviews so that we can identify what we have on hand, what we have on order, by region, by district, by branch. So a lot more visibility than you'd find in a normal distribution company. Take a stab on the equipment side. The -- as we indicated a year ago, and we went to the higher efficiency minimums that were regulated by the government, we expected there to be a compression around the entry-level product. And we went from around 65% of the minimum efficiency products up to around 85%. So we've definitely seen more product coming out. It's higher-efficient product than what we had before, but it has distorted the industry a little bit towards the minimum efficiency as opposed to high efficiency. I don't think it's that diabolical. I think it's just a natural progression of how they intend to roll out their new product introduction on the A2L and if you listen to each one of the OEMs on their public broadcast, you find that they each are putting out a different variety of products at different times during the year. And I think it has more to do with their engineering and their manufacturing plants and all that, that goes into rolling out the product. Oh my God. Start with the repair versus replace. It's is fourth quarter, first quarter, which is not the time when you're going to see a lot of repair going on out there. You don't have your air conditioners working, you have your heat pumps and your gas furnaces, which your gas furnaces are generally a lower repair item. So to date, we're not declaring that there's any trends that we've been able to identify and repair versus replace. Will it occur when the temperature goes up, we'll wait and see and find out. The other part of your question was what? The age of the installed base is newer than it's probably ever been since I've been around, which is a long time. But obviously, the mix of the installed base is changing. Gas furnaces generally have a lifetime. You can make a gas furnace last 25, 30 years, whereas a straight cool unit, I think the industry has said, it's around 15, 16 years. Heat pumps are something that are growing as a percentage of the total business. And those generally don't have as long a lifetime. Remember, they're not just operating in the wintertime, they're operating in the summertime also. So you've got more hours being packed on to that piece of equipment. What that's going to do to the overall mix of installed base out there right now. I think that's going to be one of the questions that we'll be able to look at probably in the next year or so. But replacement pull up, I figured that we probably had 2.5 million to 3 million units were pulled up troughing the pandemic. They were installed perhaps prematurely, perhaps not. Trying to get some data around that to see what the geography was of those replacements? Was it North or was it south? Where people were actually replacing equipment. A lot of data coming in, a lot of data that needs to be analyzed to answer that question properly. Yes, it doesn't change the dates of the transition. All it really did was change the sell-through process. Originally, the AIM Act out and indicated that you had to see selling any 410A product at the end of the year. The EPA came out with that with what you're talking about and has a one year sell-through now. The units have to be manufactured and produced in 2024. The date for building anymore is December 31 of this year, and then there's a 12-month sell-through. No, it doesn't really change. The manufacturers have had to plan for this transition for the last several years. So it did not change the way that they're going to flow this through. They had to get their manufacturing processes in order. They had to change their plant, get their vendors lined up. There was no real change in direction based upon that ruling. They still have to stop manufacturing all 410A units at the end of the year. I think what you were referring to had more to do with what was a component? Was the outdoor unit a component and hence, it could be replaced. That question is still a little bit up in the air. There's still some fuzziness around that so that subsequent to the sell-through period, can you still install a 410 outdoor unit or indoor unit as a repair component? That has not been clarified yet. Yes. And most of our commercial unitary products go at once. It's a replacement demand. So there is no backlog. I don't -- go ahead Barry. I don't think there was much of the way of a deflation that was really occurring there. Yes, we had a couple of product areas where -- we did see some price degradation, but it stabilized and came back. But I just think it was overall demand. And we just saw a slowdown in demand on those products. Plus, Jeff, I think you've got the phase-in, phase-out of we're going to be phasing out of 410, phasing into the A2L product. So I think right now, we'll buy we'll buy a product that we need when we need it. Those are all great questions of what if. Obviously, we keep in mind of some contact with our OEMs, and we'll be -- we'll be ready to make any sort of a judgment that is required to be competitive in the marketplace. We're not going to lose our competitiveness. And our OEMs certainly are not of that vein either. So yeah, we'll be working with them on that. One thing that makes the A2L introduction unusual, if you remember when we went from the 410A to the R-22, 410A was introduced five or six years before we transitioned over to -- transition out of the R-22. So you had a price basis that gradually was inserted over that six year period before we actually implemented the transition. This time, we're not going to have that. So I think there's a lot of question marks around exactly how this price can be set. And will the price go up or will be said too low, will it be so too high. And so that's a what if that -- I guess I'm not smart enough to answer. We have not assumed the price that there's going to be captured on the 410. [indiscernible] We've got the price increase so far for the 410. It's not anticipated that we're going to be able to price that up against the A2L. I don't think anybody is assuming that. Certainly. With the price increases that we have, yes, of course. [Multiple Speakers] Well, if you look at 2019 as your baseline at roughly 8.5 million units. And then we zoomed up to [indiscernible] we stayed above 10 million in 2023, the industry shipments fell back down to 2019 a little bit ahead. So if you take a normal, let's say, 2% or 3% growth rate that the industry historically has had put that against where we were in 2019 and take the delta. Yes, that looked like a pull forward to me. Like I indicated to you, one, we've got to look at it geographically because you have longer life spans, obviously, in Michigan than you do in Miami, Florida. I think we -- each one of our operating units is developing plans for what we call phase in phasing in the A2L products and phasing out the 410 products. We have -- and obviously, we have a safeguard that we mentioned earlier with the AIM Act where we can sell the 410A all the way through next year. But each one of our operating units is working on that plan so that -- we want to be able to hit our inventory targets. We want to be able to hit the demands of the marketplace and our contractors. And we want to be able to do it in a very logical format so that it's not disruptive to the business and it's not creating additional overhead for us."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Al Nahmad, CEO. Please go ahead.\nAl Nahmad: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. And this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. With me is A.J. Nahmad, President and Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Before we start our normal cautionary statement, this conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Now, on to the quarter. Watsco delivered a record quarter, which is all the more rewarding given a record performance achieved in the third quarter last year. Third quarter last year was a barnburner. And so I am so happy we are able to beat that. Sales grew 4%, driven by 6% increase in HVAC equipment. Residential unit volumes steadily improved throughout the quarter and price realization continues to be strong. Commercial end markets also remain very healthy. As a reminder, we have navigated through immense product transition in 2023 following the step-up minimum efficiency standards mandated across the United States by the U.S. federal government. Approximately 60% of the HVAC systems we are now selling represent new products. Let me repeat that. 60% of the systems we are selling are new products. Thousands of customers have been trained. Our digital product library has been updated, adding over 400,000 new SKUs since the start of the year. As mentioned in our second quarter call, one of our primary OEM partners was disproportionately impacted by the product transition affecting product availability during the summer selling season. That impact diminished during the third quarter and I am happy to share that our locations are now fully stocked. Sales growth has returned to the effective stores and our partner is aggressively investing and collaborating with us to drive growth. But the reality is that all our OEM partners were affected to some measure and all have improved their supply chain to help us meet the needs of our customers. Here are some other highlights. Our commercial business continued to grow at a healthy double-digit rate this quarter and our backlog of projects extend into next year. Sales of ductless systems, an increasingly important component of our business also grew double-digits during the quarter. We saw the continued trend of gas furnaces converting towards heat pumps, which sell at higher average selling prices. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 80 basis points this quarter, a good start to what we feel is an important opportunity to improve productivity and overall efficiency. We are optimistic about driving more operating efficiencies across our network as supply chains improve and operating conditions return to normalcy. We have the tools, the technology and the most importantly, the entrepreneurial culture to achieve more, particularly as it relates to our internal productivity. We are focused on internal productivity. And of course, our balance sheet remains strong with a small amount of debt offset by cash, in other words, no debt. As always, the financial position improves \u2013 the financial position provides us the flexibility to invest in virtually any opportunity as we continue to grow our scale in a very fragmented $50 billion plus North American market. M&A remains an important contributor to growth. This quarter, a great family business joined our family with acquisition \u2013 with the acquisition of Gateway Supply in South Carolina. I have spoken to the principles and you couldn\u2019t ask for higher quality people. Gateway is a legendary company in its Sunbelt markets and provides us with the ability to partner with great leadership to grow beyond their current $180 million sales run-rate. We continue to look for more entrepreneurs and businesses to partner with. Watsco is a great home for entrepreneurs in our space. We sustain culture, invest in people and provide technology to secure and build under great legacies. Looking beyond the short-term, our press release provides critical details to support Watsco\u2019s long-term growth strategy. We have an immense technology advantage and we are investing to grow that advantage. Our mobile platforms and e-commerce channels have increased customer engagement, reduced attrition, created market share gains and supported our margin expansion in recent years. Watsco\u2019s broad array of products and brand is a competitive advantage that allows us to serve contractors in any environment. We have a leading market share in Sunbelt markets that provide stability and higher growth rates over time. We have also made important technology investments with our business that will support margins and productivity in the years to come. In addition, there are several important regulatory and industry catalysts that are in effect, which are listed in today\u2019s press release. All of these catalysts will be good for the industry in the coming years and we believe our scale, technology and financial strength position us to especially benefit from these opportunities. With that, let\u2019s go on to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nAl Nahmad: Good morning, Tommy.\nTommy Moll: Good morning, Al. Appreciate you taking my questions.\nAl Nahmad: Of course.\nTommy Moll: I want to start on the topic of gross margins. I don\u2019t imagine you will get any more than a question or two on that today. But just to start the conversation, what can you tell us about the drivers, headwinds or tailwinds from your second quarter to your third quarter results? And then associated with those, if I look over the past few years, the margin rate tends to improve as you move into fourth quarter from third quarter. Is there any reason that should not be the case this year? Is there something else going on that you want to make sure we are aware of?\nAl Nahmad: Well, I am going to turn that over to two persons, A.J., the President and Barry Logan, our Chief Financial Officer.\nA.J. Nahmad: Good morning, Tommy. Yes, we had a bet going. Would it be the first question would be on margins or would it be every other [indiscernible].\nTommy Moll: For the first 10.\nA.J. Nahmad: Exactly. So I\u2019ll let Rick and Barry get into the details, but I wanted to spend a second in here and abstract as a layer and talk about the big picture. And start with reminding everyone what Barry usually reminds us of is that there are many components to our gross margin. There is the transaction margins or what we make on an invoice-by-invoice basis, on a markup basis if you will. There is cost changes that come from the 1,000 or 2,000 manufacturers that we buy products from. There is volatility in commodity items that we sell. There is internal pricing actions with our optimization tools that we are getting more fluent in. There are product delivery costs. There is product mix changes between commercial and residential equipment, supplies etcetera. So there is action in all of these categories all the time. But what I want to get across is a reminder that we are a long-term company. And quarter-to-quarter, there is going to be noise and actions in all those categories, but we are focused on the signal. And as we have said, the long-term aspirational goal of margins is 30% and we see that within reach in time. And let me tell you why. And really, it starts with what we talk about a lot, which is our technology, but we should really call our continuous improvement culture. What the technology enables is our teams to be able to do analytics, to spot opportunities, enhance our capabilities, measure and track our successes in all parts of our business. Things like prospecting and winning new customers and changing and improving how customers engage with us with things like e-commerce and our apps, which eventually reduce our cost to serve those customers. We can increase with the tech or the continuous improvement. We are increasing our productivity levels in the warehouses. We spend a ton of money moving cost in and out and through our network and our fleet and transportation, which is now another frontier how we can use technology to improve what we are doing there. Optimizing our inventory, we have talked about a lot, and there will be meaningful gains there. Marketing and sales is a new system that goes on and on and on. But that continuous improvement culture or what we call technology, so it\u2019s a tool set to win in the marketplace and increase our \u2013 what we do and margins will be part of that. Higher gross margins will be part of our \u2013 is part of our DNA and more importantly will continue to grow profits and generate a lot of cash. But quarter-to-quarter there will be noise and I know that, that\u2019s very interesting to you all. Rick and Barry and Paul can much more eloquently answer questions about the noise, but I want to make sure that, that big picture was communicated and a reminder that we are a long-term company and long-term we expect to have not only strong gross margins but continuous growth. Yes. So Barry, I don\u2019t know if you want to jump in and answer a specific question, but I wanted to just to have underlying the conversation here.\nAl Nahmad: Okay. That was well done. And Rick, too, you both can jump in wherever you want.\nBarry Logan: First, I think there is two to \u2013 if I become the analyst for a second, there is two things to analyze, right. There is year-over-year margins and we are talking about a 90-day period, and that\u2019s okay, we have to address it. But I wouldn\u2019t get in this box of thinking that every 90-day period is like a new conversation, that\u2019s not. It\u2019s a continuous process, as A.J. suggested. But if I go ahead and put myself in the box and talk about it, obviously, our equipment business is \u2013 grew nicely this quarter. Our non-equipment business did not and that\u2019s in the press release, 6% growth in HVAC equipment, 4% decline in other HVAC and there is a margin difference between the two in that mix and that mix is about 30 basis points year-over-year in terms of just pure big impact of margin. And so if the question beyond that is what happened to non-equipment, that\u2019s where our commodities reside, 6% of Watsco is refrigerant, copper tubing and sheet metal products. Deflation in those products in the quarter cost revenue. Pricing of those products has improved throughout the quarter and is more well-established today than it was 90 days ago. So that\u2019s a good \u2013 that\u2019s good news. But those are some break considerations there. Also, obviously, our commercial business, somebody will ask later in the call, grew double-digits. That would mean our residential business was single-digits. There is a few basis points of margin there, if you again stay in the box of year-over-year change in gross profit margin, sequentially, which is your question, Tommy, if I finally get to your question. Sequentially, we talked about last quarter having OEM pricing actions that took effect in March benefited the margin in the second quarter. And that\u2019s a nice, again, algebraic benefit to that quarter\u2019s performance. Sequentially, no such thing occurred. And that\u2019s the noise that A.J. is referring to is you just can\u2019t get trapped in 90-day periods and try to gain inferences over a long period of time. So if I kind of wrap it up and Rick, maybe you have more, but the concept of, let\u2019s look at the last 12 months being 27% and change, that\u2019s very consistent with what we\u2019ve been saying. And to add to that in the future, where the aspiration is 30%, the other credibility in that is we have business units within our portfolio of business units that approach that number today. And we certainly have locations that are in excess of that today. So when we talk about continuous improvement or looking out to a horizon, that\u2019s the perspective. Rick, I don\u2019t know if there is anything \u2013 we are going to talk about this all day, Rick and I, but it will be boring, Rick?\nRick Gomez: I can\u2019t expand on it. I would only \u2013 I would just add a data point, Tommy, that when you look at the year-to-date margin picture, right, let\u2019s take a more medium-term perspective on it. It\u2019s almost a rounding error as compared to last year. And I think that\u2019s an achievement on our part given the unit environment we have been in and given the relative lack of price that\u2019s been in the market this year relative to last year, to say that there is only a 20 basis point difference, I call that a good outcome.\nTommy Moll: Thank you, all. I\u2019ll pivot to a forward-looking conversation here and I hope that we could advance the conversation around potential revenue impact next year and into \u201825 from the coming refrigerant regulations. The OEMs have certainly been more vocal here. We have heard that the impact could be as much as 15% to 20% cumulative price over the next couple of years. And so my question for you is, does that sound like a reasonable range? And if you unpack the dynamics here, what do you expect to see in terms of impact from the pricing on the new equipment? And what are you seeing now or what do you think you might see on the existing equipment configured for R410, where there will be a big curtailment of supply as you head into next year?\nAl Nahmad: So let me call on Paul Johnston for that.\nPaul Johnston: Yes, easy question here. I think what two of the OEMs have announced that they think it\u2019s going to be in the 10% to 15% range. We\u2019ll just have to see what they \u2013 what movement that they have on that. There are going to be higher cost in the new products. And obviously, those are going to be reflected in higher prices. I think as we move into next year, we are going to find out more and more about what the regulations actually state and what the regulations allow going forward into 2025 as far as the curtailment of 410a equipment. And I think that\u2019s really the open question that we have right now. Obviously, at some point, we are going to be 100% 454 or 32a refrigerant, which are going to have higher prices, because they are slightly inflammable. There have to be safety devices on the units. It is going to increase the price of the products. There is no doubt about it. I am not going to give you a forecast what I think it\u2019s going to be, but it will be higher than what we are seeing right now. It\u2019s the new higher efficiency products that we introduced this year.\nTommy Moll: And just on the on the existing equipment configured for R410, are you seeing anything or hearing anything or expecting anything as you move into next year where the refrigerant itself is likely more expensive and what that could mean for overall equipment pricing there?\nPaul Johnston: I think there is going to be \u2013 there is going to be some increases. There have been increases here recently in the last couple of weeks on 410a. It\u2019s a matter of what the refrigerant manufacturers are \u2013 how they are going to handle their new allocations. Their allocations for GWP products were reduced by 30% for next year. And so they are going to have to come up with their formulas internally that would determine how much 410a they can afford to make versus some of the other lower GWP products given their allocations. And then secondly, we get into the long-term issue, we\u2019ve got another 30% reduction coming in 2029. And when that occurs, I think you are going to really see a crunch, if you will. But right now, we are just \u2013 we are trying to ferret out exactly what the regulations, how they impact the OEMs, how they impact the service level for the contractors that we work with and what\u2019s going to be the long tail or short tail of existing 410 equipment in the market.\nTommy Moll: Thank you, all. I appreciate the insight and will turn it back.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Linzey from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nBrett Linzey: Hey, good morning. Yes. So just the first question regarding HVAC equipment growth, a nice snapback up 6% in the third quarter. Do you think there is a little bit of catch-up from some of the OE issues you had in the second quarter? And then any comments just on underlying replacement activity does continue to show some resilience here. But just curious if there is any cracks in terms of metrics or ticket size, etcetera?\nPaul Johnston: This is Paul again. I don\u2019t think really we saw any real change in dynamics as it relates to the replacement market. The replacement market remained healthy and strong and a lot of conversation, a lot of debate going on. Are we moving to a repair versus a replace type of market? Our indications are slightly \u2013 we are seeing a slight uptick in parts, which shows up in our numbers as far as compressor sales, motor sales, those types of things that would be a repair item. But really too early in the game and it\u2019s \u2013 we are not really seeing any real trends yet. But I think the consumer is replacing the equipment with a higher efficiency product and we are all happy for the consumer.\nBrett Linzey: Yes. Great. And then maybe just one on price. So you\u2019ve been talking about the price optimization software and some of the deployment across the organization. I\u2019m just curious how you think about price capture above sort of normal course of business as you think about some of the surgical opportunities on price and various SKUs across the line curve there?\nBarry Logan: I mean I\u2019ll handle some of that.\nAl Nahmad: Yes, go ahead, Barry.\nBarry Logan: Yes. I mean, first, I just want to say this that when we say 60% of our equipment products or new products, that\u2019s obviously a huge inventory conversion. It\u2019s also a pricing and margin execution process. Everything is new. Everything has a new price. Everything had to be prosecuted in the market with our customers. And \u2013 so this year, for example, 8% is the price increase achieved on our residential products. This quarter and year-to-date is about the same. So it\u2019s consistent through the year. By the way, units this quarter were down 4%. Obviously, last quarter was down double digits. And if I account for 1 less selling day this quarter and look at \u2013 start to look at things a little bit pro forma, the quarter\u2019s units were near flat, if I look at it that way. So price and units are combining to help business. And that\u2019s just the \u2013 that\u2019s the equipment business. A.J., you\u2019re going to talk about the broader picture now.\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes. I just \u2013 we talked about the pricing optimization a lot, and it\u2019s not one thing. It is hundreds of opportunities across every product we sell to every customer in every location. So just that one maybe small example would be, if you say, everybody sells the same, meaning all of our business units just in the Florida market or Miami market a Honeywell 1, 2, 3 APC thermostat. And maybe there is 3,000 customers that bought that thermostat in the last 6 months. Well, it probably is at 3 different \u2013 3,000 different prices. And there is wide variation in that sale price. Well, now with this tool, for example, what we can do is understand all those sale prices of that same thermostat in the same market, and we can do some rationalization and some floor setting and making sure that the right customer, meaning larger customers are getting a more appropriate price, and smaller customers who haven\u2019t earned a lower price or getting a price that\u2019s right for them. And that\u2019s \u2013 if you do that one at that micro level, but you multiply it times hundreds and hundreds of opportunities, that\u2019s part of the effort that\u2019s going on now, and it helps. It\u2019s going to help drive margins and it\u2019s going to help, in fact, sell more product because it\u2019s not always about raising price. It\u2019s about getting the price right so that customers find it attractive and want to purchase the product from us as well.\nBrett Linzey: Got it. Appreciate the insight.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dave Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead.\nAl Nahmad: Good morning, Dave.\nDave Manthey: Thank you, good morning, Al. In the press release, you noted potential for additional productivity gains as operational complexities abate. And I\u2019m just wondering if you can outlining the key remaining complexities that would represent the biggest opportunity over the next 6 to 12 months?\nAl Nahmad: That\u2019s an interesting question. Who wants to deal with that?\nBarry Logan: It\u2019s Rick.\nRick Gomez: Yes, sure. Hi, Dave. Good morning. Yes. I mean I don\u2019t think I\u2019m overstating it by saying it\u2019s been the Wild West out in the field the last couple of years, and all of that supply chain imbalance weighs on that same-store productivity equation. And so what you\u2019ve seen in the last few quarters is variable SG&A reacting to a different end market. But more importantly, what we\u2019ve been working on the last year or so is a lot of energy into understanding our own internal productivity. And we\u2019ve armed our leaders with real-time data that should help drive this in the field. They know this is a priority and they are responding. But that \u2013 this productivity journey that we\u2019re on is going to take some time. It encompasses a huge number of things. It starts with how we order and receive product from 2,000 suppliers. And we talk about supply chains getting better, but they are not better everywhere just yet. Commercial is one example. And you asked where are the pain points still, that is still a pain point in the supply chain is commercial and high-efficiency product. But it starts with how we receive product from over 2,000 suppliers. It impacts the real estate footprint, how we fulfill orders in the warehouse and finally, how we deliver product to customers. That\u2019s really the what this productivity effort encompasses, it\u2019s a lot of things really from the very beginning to the very end of our processes. And so we\u2019re starting to see progress, but there is a lot more to do. And I think big picture, two thoughts, I\u2019ll leave you with two thoughts. One is that I think our growing scale naturally enables more efficiency, right? As a $7 billion company, we have more opportunity to be more efficient than we did as a company half our size 4 years ago. And secondly, we possess the technology and the tools to drive this productivity throughout our network. And you\u2019ll note in the press release that we talked about what some of those internal investments have been in the pricing technology that A.J. just talked about, the warehouse management and order fulfillment technology. Some interesting work going on around logistics in our network. And so over time, that will bear some fruit in productivity and that will \u2013 we\u2019re starting to see the benefits of that today and not just variable SG&A reacting, but fixed SG&A reacting as well.\nDave Manthey: Thank you.\nA.J. Nahmad: I\u2019ll double click on the last one, the logistics and transportation delivery. That is the third biggest expense for the company. About $200 million we spend moving products in and through and around our network and delivering products to customers. And I call it our next frontier of opportunity for continuous improvement. I think there is about 800 trucks in the fleet today. But there are now with the data being exposed and smart people taking smart actions, we\u2019re realizing that some of those trucks are sitting idle for 90% of the day. It doesn\u2019t make sense to have that truck or maybe use a different means of transportation to get product from point A to point B? Or can our business unit share trucks? Or is there a more efficient route to deliver the product? So all those questions now about the millions of times that we\u2019re moving products around our network in and out and through to customers are open season on that effort, and it\u2019s a big bucket. So we\u2019re going to move a needle on a big bucket.\nDave Manthey: Okay. Thank you for that detail. And second, could you give us your take on Governor DeSantis rejecting IRA funds?\nAl Nahmad: We do not expect political risk. And we are not going to talk about that. Next questions. \nOperator: The Next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nAl Nahmad: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions. So inventory. Can we talk about where we stand right now on inventory? I think you\u2019ve said in previous calls, maybe $200 million of reduction for the full year. Are we still on that track?\nAl Nahmad: Well, that\u2019s a good question, and I\u2019ll turn it over to the executive that\u2019s taking care of that for me. Go ahead, Paul.\nPaul Johnston: Alright. Yes, we can expect that. We\u2019ve been delayering our inventory now since the season ended, and we\u2019re seeing great progress. We\u2019ve set goals for each one of our operating units. We track them daily with our ability to identify what we have on order and what our sales through is \u2013 sales output is. And we\u2019re seeing definite reductions month over month, day over day.\nNigel Coe: Okay. So that implies fourth quarter should be a big source of funds from inventory. That\u2019s the way to read that?\nPaul Johnston: It better be. I would \u2013 Okay. I would not want to pigeon hold into that. We\u2019re not give you that kind of...\nNigel Coe: Okay. I think just \u2013 with the question.\nAl Nahmad: Yes, we\u2019re very focused on it. Don\u2019t forget that during the \u2013 all these delivery issues that we had to do things that we normally don\u2019t do, the producers couldn\u2019t ship partial the order and that sort of thing. And it takes a while to get that inventory we have to be what it should be in terms of complete systems and that sort of thing. But we\u2019re working very focused. And yes, I do plan to take out that kind of number and improve our cash flow along with it.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That\u2019s great. And my follow-up question is around the 410a phaseouts. I mean I think the EPA, the way that it was written right now, I think it\u2019s an installation deadline as of 1 Jan 2025 as opposed to a production deadline. So how are you guys thinking about that in terms of managing 410a inventory levels? And how do you think the 454B availability will come through next year?\nPaul Johnston: Are you asking about the new EPA?\nNigel Coe: Yes, I think...\nPaul Johnston: Yes, it came out last Friday night. Yes, everybody is still working their way through it. Basically, what it provided was that the outdoor unit becomes a component and hence, can be replaced as a repair item or a system that you can\u2019t install systems, indoor and outdoor units, but you can repair the by putting in an outer unit. And that\u2019s got a lot of ramifications, which I don\u2019t know if really have been thought all the way through by the people who wrote it up. For instance, how can you make sure that the coil on the inside matches the outdoor unit, which is only going to be the higher efficiency product. So if you\u2019re putting in a 15.3 outdoor unit with a 13 or 14 SEER indoor unit, you\u2019re not going to get the efficiency that you\u2019re paying for, for the outdoor. And then secondly, I think we\u2019re looking at a difference from when we went through the transition between R22 and 410a. This one is different. It\u2019s different in the regard that there is no replacement for 410a. There were other replacements that you could drop in that would replace the R22 that aren\u2019t going to be available with the new product. Also, a lot of questions that I think we need to ask our OEMs, and OEMs will have to answer the question what\u2019s going to happen to the price of the 410 units because, obviously, the production will be lower from the OEM, will that raise the price of the product? What\u2019s going to happen to the availability of 410a to make the repair cost so the repair cost would be acceptable to the consumer. What happens to the 30% to 40% of the installed base, which is still operating on R22 where you can\u2019t change out the outdoor unit with a 410a unit. So I\u2019ve got a lot of questions. I guess I don\u2019t have a lot of answers for you. That\u2019s \u2013 but those are things that we\u2019re thinking of, and we\u2019re working with our OEMs and working with the refrigerant manufacturers who try to figure out how all this is going to play out and not only in \u201824, but also in \u201825 when we do the actual rollout.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Look, you actually have more questions than I did. So \u2013 but it sounds like it\u2019s a little bit too early to have a view, but I appreciate the context. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAl Nahmad: Good morning, Ryan. Good morning.\nRyan Merkel: Hey, morning. Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. So I wanted to ask about demand trends through the quarter and maybe even through October, just given the fears out there about consumer spending starting to decline. Just update us on what you saw through the quarter and into October?\nAl Nahmad: Barry?\nBarry Logan: Hi, Ryan, yes, I mean, very consistent, I would say, throughout the quarter and quarter ended. If I looked at September, for example, just to say it that way, it looks like the rest of the quarter, so pretty consistent throughout \u2013 October is only a few business days, and it\u2019s our biggest month of the fourth quarter last year. So not quite the same answer, but all of our field checks, talking to our people see a good fourth quarter.\nRyan Merkel: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I had a high-level question, too, that\u2019s probably hard to answer, but we all see the price increases coming 15% to 20%. And then obviously, there is been a lot of price increases on equipment the last few years. How do you guys think about sort of the impact to the consumer. Are they going to be able to afford these systems? Is financing going to need to be a bigger part of the HVAC industry? How much worry do you have that there will be more sort of repair versus replace?\nAl Nahmad: That\u2019s an interesting \u2013 we think about things like that. As you may or may not know, we now have a financing platform ourselves, and it\u2019s probably \u2013 when we speak consider the most user-friendly platform that exists for a customer to find the loan that we want to finance it. So \u2013 anyone, do you want to take a shot at a more sophisticated answer?\nPaul Johnston: Yes, there is a concern. Is there an elasticity issue here where we\u2019re going to reach a point where a consumer can\u2019t afford it. I don\u2019t \u2013 I still feel like this is a necessity of life that people have to have heat have to have cool. Also, we\u2019re seeing a lot more interest, obviously, we really haven\u2019t felt the impact of 25c as far as the tax credits coming into effect for the higher income people. The rebate programs that hopefully will start maybe in the second or third quarter of 2024 should start picking in now support at least with an $8,000 rebate to the medium and low income consumer to be able to replace their unit and their system. But the consumer so far has been fairly resilient as far as taking care of what I would consider to be an absolute need for life, if you will. Also, we\u2019re starting to see a lot more activity around what utilities are doing, what states are doing in the area of the weatherization programs and that type of thing. So maybe that\u2019s a little bit of pollyanna, but I think going forward, the consumer is going to have to have to figure out which programs work out best for them so that they can be replacement. And with the financing is going to help also.\nBarry Logan: Yes. I think affordability has always been a question, and yet the industry has grown 3.5% compounded for 30 years, and things are obviously always more expensive over time given all the regulatory things. So I would just point to that as a long-term reality of it. But Ryan, if I give you an interesting answer, I just recently took out a system in my home, $6,200 was the bill. Contractor did it in a day. They expect it to be paid that day. And I was curious, I went back and looked at our cost to him, meaning our revenues, what did Watsco sell that guy in my $6,200 installation. And the answer was around $2,900. So the layer \u2013 my point is there is a layer in this called the contractor that\u2019s also a very important layer of both profit and cost and consumer price and so on. if our cost of goods went up 10% because of regulatory matters, that\u2019s $270. That\u2019s something the contractor would have to decide how to pass that on or what to do about it. But there is this entrepreneurial thing, and it\u2019s really doing a lot of the work called a contractor, not just Carrier or not just Watsco, but contractor, and that\u2019s where all these tools we\u2019re talking about, how do we help the contractor sell products? How do we help them grow their business? How do we help them digitize our business? How do we help them improve their business processes? How do we cater to that clientele that\u2019s growing at a much faster rate and build on it? So this whole idea of how we\u2019re approaching the contractor gets beyond just the economics of a price increase. It really is a much bigger picture that we\u2019re after.\nRyan Merkel: Yes, makes sense. Alright. Thank you for the color. I will pass it on.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nAl Nahmad: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Hammond: Hey, guys. Good morning. Just want to come back to this regulatory issue. I know there is a lot of uncertainty. But like is your expectation that the split system kind of needing to be installed kind of sticks? And if that\u2019s the case, just how do you think about transition timing? Are the OEMs going to be ready to kind of start getting a new product? This kind of brings in kind of inventory obsolescence. Just maybe talk a little bit more about that.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. I think all of our OEMs are geared up to have the new product and hopefully, we can start introducing product in the second and third quarter of next year, the new product. So I really don\u2019t have a lot of concern that they are not going to be ready. They will be ready. And then on the 410 transition, your guess is as good in mind. If they allow this to continue the way it\u2019s unfolding right now or has been written up in the latest blurb we got from the EPA that means 410a units will be available indefinitely until we run out of the ability to supply them with 410a. But I think that\u2019s not a good move for the consumer and the consumer would be much better off with the longer warranty period as well as having a new machine that actually is operating to specs, and improve their overall efficiency in their home. So, it\u2019s a guess as far as whether or not the EPA is going to continue on this path, where are they going to change their path or modify it in some way, we don\u2019t know.\nJeff Hammond: It seems like the R22 drive ship over again, but\u2026\nPaul Johnston: It is. As I indicated, that was different at that time because you had all these drop-ins available and the consumer could rely that they were going to have a unit that would be serviced for the 10-year or 12-year or 14-year lifespan of the product. We don\u2019t have that certainty this time.\nBarry Logan: That\u2019s another one of those questions added to the list of questions is what does warranty look like on our R410A products moving forward when 5 years, 10 years \u2013 5 years to 10 years from now, they didn\u2019t even be serviceable.\nJeff Hammond: Yes. And then just on this 30% gross margin target, I mean I think you put it out there maybe a quarter or two quarters ago. Just level set us on \u2013 as you think about the path from 27% to 30%, what do you think the biggest buckets of opportunity to kind of get there over time? Thanks.\nAl Nahmad: I will answer that. We have a lot of pockets of opportunity, and we will just have to take one at a time and see how we get there but we have folk, we have ambition and knowledge and the financial capability to achieve. And at some point in time, our goal, that\u2019s our confidence level. Yes.\nA.J. Nahmad: I would say there is not a silver bullet or two silver bullets. It\u2019s hundreds of small opportunities that add up to a lot. But now we have the tools and the teams and the drive and the focus, and we will get there.\nJeff Hammond: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Damian Karas with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAl Nahmad: Good morning Damian.\nDamian Karas: Good morning Al. So, maybe I will throw you guys a real curveball here and ask a more strategic question. With the Gateway deal, you are sort of stepping up into the plumbing space. So, maybe you could talk a little bit about the deal rationale and how you are thinking about that market opportunity? And just kind of comparing, say, the water here and the HVAC market, are there any notable differences in the distribution model and financial profile?\nAl Nahmad: Well, we don\u2019t want to provide publicly our thinking about things like that. Let\u2019s say that we do believe that heat pump water heaters will be \u2013 have a substantial opportunity for us, and we are thinking about how to take advantage of that.\nDamian Karas: Okay. I appreciate that. Would you be able to give us a sense for kind of where Gateway\u2019s gross margins are coming into the business?\nAl Nahmad: I don\u2019t have that. Do you have it, Barry or Rick? I don\u2019t mind sharing it.\nBarry Logan: Yes. No, it wasn\u2019t dilutive and it wasn\u2019t accretive. So, that means it\u2019s very comparable.\nA.J. Nahmad: I think we have to take this opportunity to say how impressed we are with Chris Williams and his brothers and the team at Gateway. They have both a tremendous company over many years, and we are so proud and excited to have them as part of the family. It\u2019s an honor that they are with us now and we can do great things together.\nBarry Logan: Yes. I would say it this way too that, everyone on this call, you are in a community. And you know the legendary players and wonderful track records and so on, you know that within your industry. And with our \u2013 within our industry, Gateway is one of those very special stories and companies. So, the fun part is what happens next, though which is what can they do with kind of the keys to the kingdom in their hands, how can they grow, where can they expand, what new things can they accomplish, and what ambitions did they have that were parked because of capital, things like that. So, it\u2019s a \u2013 there are more special companies like is a very special company.\nDamian Karas: Great. Appreciate all the color guys, best of luck.\nAl Nahmad: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAl Nahmad: Good morning Steve.\nSteve Volkmann: Good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I don\u2019t think anybody has mentioned gross margins yet. So, I wanted to ask.\nAl Nahmad: My goodness.\nSteve Volkmann: Since we are at the end of the call, Barry, I appreciate you jumping into the short-term box with us against your will, but you didn\u2019t provide any thought about 4Q, anything to call out in the fourth quarter that we should be aware of?\nBarry Logan: Yes. I had \u2013 my brain goes back to last year, is there anything peculiar or interesting about last year in comparative, and I don\u2019t know the answer. My instinct is a measure of consistency as we play out the year with what you are seeing because I think \u2013 I don\u2019t think there are any big pricing actions going on in the market at this point. Paul, do you have any insight beyond that?\nPaul Johnston: No, not really. I have got a little bit on the commodity side. I think we are going to start seeing some upticks in some of the commodities, but whether they will kick in, in the fourth quarter, I can\u2019t definitively say.\nSteve Volkmann: Okay. Great. And then \u2013 sorry, my real question is I wanted to ask about this refrigerant transition but from a different angle because it feels like \u2013 I think, Al, you mentioned at the outset here that 60% is now new products. My guess is 12 months to 18 months from now it could be even more new products just as we go through all these transitions. And I am curious sort of how you guys feel like you are going to be able to manage that from two perspectives. One, SG&A, because I imagine there is going to be a lot of training on the new products and how to replace old products and all that kind of stuff. And I am curious how that impacts SG&A. And then also on the inventory side, my guess is that you may have to layer in a little extra inventory in \u201824 as this transition kind of goes through. So, just any early thoughts on how those two things might trend?\nAl Nahmad: Whatever those opportunities are in the future, we will deal with them as we have in the prior changes that come to the industry. We are very good at it. We have never been better at it. And so far as specific goals, anybody from the Watsco team want to deal with them?\nPaul Johnston: Yes, I think we have got some ideas on how we can handle it without having to really overlay inventory, different ways of handling our logistics, our order plans and how we utilize some of our DC attributes to accommodate the replacement of the 410A units, early innings on that.\nA.J. Nahmad: I will say this. I am glad that we have the scale and the strength that we have because we can do exactly what was just said is deal with anything that comes with us, in an efficient way and effective way. And we can use our resources as needed. It\u2019s going to be presumably more difficult for smaller competitors of ours. They will have a tougher time with the challenges I would imagine.\nSteve Volkmann: Great. I appreciate the color. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hi guys. Good morning.\nAl Nahmad: Hey. Good morning. Thank you.\nSteve Tusa: Can you just clarify again what you said about October, you said it was like a different comment or something, I didn\u2019t quite understand what the October comment was.\nBarry Logan: A bit lower growth rate. But again, if I look at a year ago, it was very strong this time of the year. So, I am not going to get too much of an inference out of it. If we look out the rest of the quarter, we are seeing \u2013 expected to drive growth.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Got it. And then I don\u2019t quite understand the comments. I mean the refrigerant prices we have seen, which is kind of curious or down double digit year-over-year, which is kind of unusual going into a period where everybody has visibility on this wind down. I know everybody is very highly convicted that, that price is going up. But from what we have heard in the channel from the actual refrigerant suppliers themselves, they continue to say it\u2019s actually going down sequentially, and it\u2019s like now in the high-single digits per pound type of area. You said you saw an uptick this week or something like that or the last couple of weeks. What are you guys seeing? Yes, what are you guys seeing that...?\nPaul Johnston: We saw a definite uptick and those are the guys that are selling it to us. So hopefully, they saw the same uptick. But yes, we have seen an increase in the price of 410. We had \u2013 there was some dislocation where some people were taking inventory out earlier, and we are reducing price to be able to create some sort of sell-through, and when that ended, we started seeing the price come back the other way.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. So and then just the last one, Barry, the 2,900 equipment number that you mentioned in your instance, that\u2019s after like, obviously, like a 30%-plus increase over the last few years, that just seems low. Is that \u2013 I don\u2019t know, is that for like a pool house or something like that, like maybe clarify what, because I mean you have done pretty done pretty well for yourself over the years. I mean that seems like a pretty low number. What is building on your estate\u2026?\nBarry Logan: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s a 1.5-ton home office system that sits, so it\u2019s a smaller tonnage system. It\u2019s not a 5-ton system, but the more important\u2026\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Is that a ductless system?\nBarry Logan: No, it\u2019s a ducted system.\nSteve Tusa: Okay. Alright. That\u2019s\u2026\nBarry Logan: And it is an arms length of margin for the record when I purchased something from one of our subsidiaries.\nSteve Tusa: Yes, something didn\u2019t quite add up there. And then just one last one. Have you actually seen the \u2013 I mean these OEMs haven\u2019t even really come out with their new products. I mean they have kind of perhaps giving you a bit of a sneak preview on some of them, but like have you actually seen the pricing yet for the 454 products?\nPaul Johnston: No, we have not, did not establish a price yet for us.\nSteve Tusa: So, if you guys are kind of saying that like it sounds like there is some uncertainty here. I mean I know the rule of the EPA just went through last week, that is finalized and in the Federal Register in a few weeks. But like how can they be so confident in kind of going out there and predicting what their \u2013 what kind of price they are going to actually capture over the next 2 years, like what\u2019s the disconnect there?\nPaul Johnston: You have to ask them.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. Okay. We will do. Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nAl Nahmad: Good morning Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprague: Hey. A lot of good ground covered here. So, let me just do two quick little cleanup ones. Barry, you gave us 8% price and down 4% on units, so consolidated revenues up 4%. Can you do the same on HVAC equipment? And give us a little bit of detail on within price, kind of what the price mix dynamic is there?\nBarry Logan: That is residential equipment at those data points. And then our double-digit growth in commercial brings the overall equipment growth rate up to 6%.\nJeffrey Sprague: Got it. And then on the \u2013 and can you say anything about mix Barry? How much is kind of price versus mix?\nBarry Logan: Boy, again, it\u2019s an infinite array of data in that answer. The 8% price is \u2013 it\u2019s an number of answers inside that 8%. It\u2019s more so, what it\u2019s most of is the new products having a higher cost and a higher price in the market than that composite a year ago.\nJeffrey Sprague: Yes. And just back to the 60% of products being new, I would assume that is just mostly SEER change units. But could you maybe address what percent of your volume is the new higher SEER product at this point? How much more do we have to go until we are 100% there? Maybe if there is a difference between that 60% on new product, new SEER product versus other new product?\nBarry Logan: It\u2019s a solid question. Go ahead, Paul.\nPaul Johnston: We can\u2019t replenish the old product. So, it\u2019s no longer in production. So, it\u2019s going to be pretty much at 100% at some point once the remaining product is sold through.\nJeffrey Sprague: Domestically, right, internationally?\nBarry Logan: Yes. Just a reminder what changed, and this was a change from prior times is it\u2019s not just a higher efficiency systems being mandated. The way efficiency was measured changed and kind of what we would be called SERR 2. And SEER 2 changed the way a 17 SEER system is rated a year ago versus now or a 16 SEER system is rated today versus a year ago. So, when we talk about \u2013 and then the matching air handlers that go with it and the matching components that go with it. That\u2019s the complexity. That\u2019s the nuance. And that\u2019s why as a composite, it\u2019s a higher price. But I guess your question is how mature is that within\u2026?\nJeffrey Sprague: I am trying to break out \u2013 how much more mix effect do you have to come through for us to get to that 100%?\nBarry Logan: Question is, when does it annualize, so to speak, and it would be obviously some time probably early next year. Paul, does that make sense?\nPaul Johnston: Yes. I would say early next year will be pretty much all new equipment.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. Thank you. I will leave it there guys. Much appreciated.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAl Nahmad: Good morning.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Hey everybody. How are you?\nAl Nahmad: Well. You?\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: I am good. Just \u2013 I will just kind of clean up with one more about the model here. A lot of great questions so far. A lot of mine have been taken. If I think through a lot of the considerations for the fourth quarter, Barry, kind of asking you to get back in the year-over-year box again here, but volume comps getting easier into November and December. You are starting to actually get probably even more SEER mix benefit because of the geography of how it rolled out. There is probably some catch-up from the weather in the third quarter benefiting even into the fourth quarter, and then also the OEM logistics. So, is it possible that we could be looking at like high-single digit type revenue growth in the fourth quarter? And then just thinking about \u2013 you said at the beginning of the year, you were targeting earnings growth. It looks like you are likely to get there? Just kind of wondering how much you might be able to grow EPS this year with just one quarter left? Is it 2% to 3% or potentially something more?\nA.J. Nahmad: We don\u2019t have that in our history. We do not forecast because we are in a business that fluctuates considerably with weather. And that\u2019s been our tradition. And I don\u2019t know that we are going to change it. Barry, if you can help them without changing that.\nBarry Logan: No, I was going to say we will give you our thoughts and our educated close reaction to what\u2019s going on, but we are not going to give guidance, and we are not going to give \u2013 certainly not fourth quarter guidance when again, we are getting a 90-day period and trying to crystallize something. So, we have given you the trends. I think again that \u2013 if you think about where we started this year, where unit volumes were down 10% or more and worry \u2013 and the question was, will that get worse or better, it\u2019s gotten much better as the years has gone on in a short period of time. Inventory flowing into the channel and earnest at this point. Our one vendor issue that hurt the first half of the year is now converting into a growth opportunity for the rest of the year. So, just kind of leave it at that. And our focus has to also be looking into next year, and as we are the major partner for much of the OEMs that you can talk to, and growth and market share and expansion and more brands and more SKUs and new SKUs next year, we start to look ahead, and that\u2019s pretty exciting. Fourth quarter, we will see. I wouldn\u2019t say\u2026\nAl Nahmad: Alright. Barry\u2026\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Okay. I appreciate that. Maybe just one more then, kind of related to the prior question about this year proportion. I noticed in the release in the second quarter, you talked about 60% of year-to-date sales representing the new equipment. And then now in the release it\u2019s the same number, but you are talking about the number of SKUs at your locations. Just wondering if that was an intentional change, and if that was intended to communicate anything there?\nA.J. Nahmad: That\u2019s a fair question, but I don\u2019t \u2013 maybe somebody else can answer it, because I am not sure. Barry, go ahead.\nBarry Logan: Yes, it\u2019s a clarification that the inventory we actually carry in our stores, that 60% is new, and that\u2019s the clarification versus a digital catalog where it\u2019s a much broader set of products what we actually carry in stores. And the point is, we emptied out 60% of what we sell a year ago into new products this year. It\u2019s an immense change, and obviously, also an immense opportunity with what\u2019s going on.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer: Alright. Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Al Nahmad for any closing remarks.\nAl Nahmad: Once again, thanks very much for your interest in Watsco. We hope to continue to build this wonderful company and appreciate very much your interest. Bye-bye now.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "First, I think there is two to \u2013 if I become the analyst for a second, there is two things to analyze, right. There is year-over-year margins and we are talking about a 90-day period, and that's okay, we have to address it. But I wouldn't get in this box of thinking that every 90-day period is like a new conversation, that's not. It's a continuous process, as A.J. suggested. But if I go ahead and put myself in the box and talk about it, obviously, our equipment business is \u2013 grew nicely this quarter. Our non-equipment business did not and that's in the press release, 6% growth in HVAC equipment, 4% decline in other HVAC and there is a margin difference between the two in that mix and that mix is about 30 basis points year-over-year in terms of just pure big impact of margin. And so if the question beyond that is what happened to non-equipment, that's where our commodities reside, 6% of Watsco is refrigerant, copper tubing and sheet metal products. Deflation in those products in the quarter cost revenue. Pricing of those products has improved throughout the quarter and is more well-established today than it was 90 days ago. So that's a good \u2013 that's good news. But those are some break considerations there. Also, obviously, our commercial business, somebody will ask later in the call, grew double-digits. That would mean our residential business was single-digits. There is a few basis points of margin there, if you again stay in the box of year-over-year change in gross profit margin, sequentially, which is your question, Tommy, if I finally get to your question. Sequentially, we talked about last quarter having OEM pricing actions that took effect in March benefited the margin in the second quarter. And that's a nice, again, algebraic benefit to that quarter's performance. Sequentially, no such thing occurred. And that's the noise that A.J. is referring to is you just can't get trapped in 90-day periods and try to gain inferences over a long period of time. So if I kind of wrap it up and Rick, maybe you have more, but the concept of, let's look at the last 12 months being 27% and change, that's very consistent with what we've been saying. And to add to that in the future, where the aspiration is 30%, the other credibility in that is we have business units within our portfolio of business units that approach that number today. And we certainly have locations that are in excess of that today. So when we talk about continuous improvement or looking out to a horizon, that's the perspective. Rick, I don't know if there is anything \u2013 we are going to talk about this all day, Rick and I, but it will be boring, Rick? I mean I'll handle some of that. Yes. I mean, first, I just want to say this that when we say 60% of our equipment products or new products, that's obviously a huge inventory conversion. It's also a pricing and margin execution process. Everything is new. Everything has a new price. Everything had to be prosecuted in the market with our customers. And \u2013 so this year, for example, 8% is the price increase achieved on our residential products. This quarter and year-to-date is about the same. So it's consistent through the year. By the way, units this quarter were down 4%. Obviously, last quarter was down double digits. And if I account for 1 less selling day this quarter and look at \u2013 start to look at things a little bit pro forma, the quarter's units were near flat, if I look at it that way. So price and units are combining to help business. And that's just the \u2013 that's the equipment business. A.J., you're going to talk about the broader picture now. It's Rick. Hi, Ryan, yes, I mean, very consistent, I would say, throughout the quarter and quarter ended. If I looked at September, for example, just to say it that way, it looks like the rest of the quarter, so pretty consistent throughout \u2013 October is only a few business days, and it's our biggest month of the fourth quarter last year. So not quite the same answer, but all of our field checks, talking to our people see a good fourth quarter. Yes. I think affordability has always been a question, and yet the industry has grown 3.5% compounded for 30 years, and things are obviously always more expensive over time given all the regulatory things. So I would just point to that as a long-term reality of it. But Ryan, if I give you an interesting answer, I just recently took out a system in my home, $6,200 was the bill. Contractor did it in a day. They expect it to be paid that day. And I was curious, I went back and looked at our cost to him, meaning our revenues, what did Watsco sell that guy in my $6,200 installation. And the answer was around $2,900. So the layer \u2013 my point is there is a layer in this called the contractor that's also a very important layer of both profit and cost and consumer price and so on. if our cost of goods went up 10% because of regulatory matters, that's $270. That's something the contractor would have to decide how to pass that on or what to do about it. But there is this entrepreneurial thing, and it's really doing a lot of the work called a contractor, not just Carrier or not just Watsco, but contractor, and that's where all these tools we're talking about, how do we help the contractor sell products? How do we help them grow their business? How do we help them digitize our business? How do we help them improve their business processes? How do we cater to that clientele that's growing at a much faster rate and build on it? So this whole idea of how we're approaching the contractor gets beyond just the economics of a price increase. It really is a much bigger picture that we're after. That's another one of those questions added to the list of questions is what does warranty look like on our R410A products moving forward when 5 years, 10 years \u2013 5 years to 10 years from now, they didn't even be serviceable. Yes. No, it wasn't dilutive and it wasn't accretive. So, that means it's very comparable. Yes. I would say it this way too that, everyone on this call, you are in a community. And you know the legendary players and wonderful track records and so on, you know that within your industry. And with our \u2013 within our industry, Gateway is one of those very special stories and companies. So, the fun part is what happens next, though which is what can they do with kind of the keys to the kingdom in their hands, how can they grow, where can they expand, what new things can they accomplish, and what ambitions did they have that were parked because of capital, things like that. So, it's a \u2013 there are more special companies like is a very special company. Yes. I had \u2013 my brain goes back to last year, is there anything peculiar or interesting about last year in comparative, and I don't know the answer. My instinct is a measure of consistency as we play out the year with what you are seeing because I think \u2013 I don't think there are any big pricing actions going on in the market at this point. Paul, do you have any insight beyond that? A bit lower growth rate. But again, if I look at a year ago, it was very strong this time of the year. So, I am not going to get too much of an inference out of it. If we look out the rest of the quarter, we are seeing \u2013 expected to drive growth. That's right. That's right. It's a 1.5-ton home office system that sits, so it's a smaller tonnage system. It's not a 5-ton system, but the more important... No, it's a ducted system. And it is an arms length of margin for the record when I purchased something from one of our subsidiaries. That is residential equipment at those data points. And then our double-digit growth in commercial brings the overall equipment growth rate up to 6%. Boy, again, it's an infinite array of data in that answer. The 8% price is \u2013 it's an number of answers inside that 8%. It's more so, what it's most of is the new products having a higher cost and a higher price in the market than that composite a year ago. It's a solid question. Go ahead, Paul. Yes. Just a reminder what changed, and this was a change from prior times is it's not just a higher efficiency systems being mandated. The way efficiency was measured changed and kind of what we would be called SERR 2. And SEER 2 changed the way a 17 SEER system is rated a year ago versus now or a 16 SEER system is rated today versus a year ago. So, when we talk about \u2013 and then the matching air handlers that go with it and the matching components that go with it. That's the complexity. That's the nuance. And that's why as a composite, it's a higher price. But I guess your question is how mature is that within...? Question is, when does it annualize, so to speak, and it would be obviously some time probably early next year. Paul, does that make sense? No, I was going to say we will give you our thoughts and our educated close reaction to what's going on, but we are not going to give guidance, and we are not going to give \u2013 certainly not fourth quarter guidance when again, we are getting a 90-day period and trying to crystallize something. So, we have given you the trends. I think again that \u2013 if you think about where we started this year, where unit volumes were down 10% or more and worry \u2013 and the question was, will that get worse or better, it's gotten much better as the years has gone on in a short period of time. Inventory flowing into the channel and earnest at this point. Our one vendor issue that hurt the first half of the year is now converting into a growth opportunity for the rest of the year. So, just kind of leave it at that. And our focus has to also be looking into next year, and as we are the major partner for much of the OEMs that you can talk to, and growth and market share and expansion and more brands and more SKUs and new SKUs next year, we start to look ahead, and that's pretty exciting. Fourth quarter, we will see. I wouldn't say... Yes, it's a clarification that the inventory we actually carry in our stores, that 60% is new, and that's the clarification versus a digital catalog where it's a much broader set of products what we actually carry in stores. And the point is, we emptied out 60% of what we sell a year ago into new products this year. It's an immense change, and obviously, also an immense opportunity with what's going on."

            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. And this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. With me is A.J. Nahmad, President and Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Before we start our normal cautionary statement, this conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Now, on to the quarter. Watsco delivered a record quarter, which is all the more rewarding given a record performance achieved in the third quarter last year. Third quarter last year was a barnburner. And so I am so happy we are able to beat that. Sales grew 4%, driven by 6% increase in HVAC equipment. Residential unit volumes steadily improved throughout the quarter and price realization continues to be strong. Commercial end markets also remain very healthy. As a reminder, we have navigated through immense product transition in 2023 following the step-up minimum efficiency standards mandated across the United States by the U.S. federal government. Approximately 60% of the HVAC systems we are now selling represent new products. Let me repeat that. 60% of the systems we are selling are new products. Thousands of customers have been trained. Our digital product library has been updated, adding over 400,000 new SKUs since the start of the year. As mentioned in our second quarter call, one of our primary OEM partners was disproportionately impacted by the product transition affecting product availability during the summer selling season. That impact diminished during the third quarter and I am happy to share that our locations are now fully stocked. Sales growth has returned to the effective stores and our partner is aggressively investing and collaborating with us to drive growth. But the reality is that all our OEM partners were affected to some measure and all have improved their supply chain to help us meet the needs of our customers. Here are some other highlights. Our commercial business continued to grow at a healthy double-digit rate this quarter and our backlog of projects extend into next year. Sales of ductless systems, an increasingly important component of our business also grew double-digits during the quarter. We saw the continued trend of gas furnaces converting towards heat pumps, which sell at higher average selling prices. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 80 basis points this quarter, a good start to what we feel is an important opportunity to improve productivity and overall efficiency. We are optimistic about driving more operating efficiencies across our network as supply chains improve and operating conditions return to normalcy. We have the tools, the technology and the most importantly, the entrepreneurial culture to achieve more, particularly as it relates to our internal productivity. We are focused on internal productivity. And of course, our balance sheet remains strong with a small amount of debt offset by cash, in other words, no debt. As always, the financial position improves \u2013 the financial position provides us the flexibility to invest in virtually any opportunity as we continue to grow our scale in a very fragmented $50 billion plus North American market. M&A remains an important contributor to growth. This quarter, a great family business joined our family with acquisition \u2013 with the acquisition of Gateway Supply in South Carolina. I have spoken to the principles and you couldn't ask for higher quality people. Gateway is a legendary company in its Sunbelt markets and provides us with the ability to partner with great leadership to grow beyond their current $180 million sales run-rate. We continue to look for more entrepreneurs and businesses to partner with. Watsco is a great home for entrepreneurs in our space. We sustain culture, invest in people and provide technology to secure and build under great legacies. Looking beyond the short-term, our press release provides critical details to support Watsco's long-term growth strategy. We have an immense technology advantage and we are investing to grow that advantage. Our mobile platforms and e-commerce channels have increased customer engagement, reduced attrition, created market share gains and supported our margin expansion in recent years. Watsco's broad array of products and brand is a competitive advantage that allows us to serve contractors in any environment. We have a leading market share in Sunbelt markets that provide stability and higher growth rates over time. We have also made important technology investments with our business that will support margins and productivity in the years to come. In addition, there are several important regulatory and industry catalysts that are in effect, which are listed in today's press release. All of these catalysts will be good for the industry in the coming years and we believe our scale, technology and financial strength position us to especially benefit from these opportunities. With that, let's go on to Q&A. Good morning, Tommy. Of course. Well, I am going to turn that over to two persons, A.J., the President and Barry Logan, our Chief Financial Officer. Okay. That was well done. And Rick, too, you both can jump in wherever you want. So let me call on Paul Johnston for that. Yes, go ahead, Barry. Good morning, Dave. That's an interesting question. Who wants to deal with that? We do not expect political risk. And we are not going to talk about that. Next questions. Good morning, Nigel. Well, that's a good question, and I'll turn it over to the executive that's taking care of that for me. Go ahead, Paul. Yes, we're very focused on it. Don't forget that during the \u2013 all these delivery issues that we had to do things that we normally don't do, the producers couldn't ship partial the order and that sort of thing. And it takes a while to get that inventory we have to be what it should be in terms of complete systems and that sort of thing. But we're working very focused. And yes, I do plan to take out that kind of number and improve our cash flow along with it. Good morning, Ryan. Good morning. Barry? That's an interesting \u2013 we think about things like that. As you may or may not know, we now have a financing platform ourselves, and it's probably \u2013 when we speak consider the most user-friendly platform that exists for a customer to find the loan that we want to finance it. So \u2013 anyone, do you want to take a shot at a more sophisticated answer? Good morning, Jeff. I will answer that. We have a lot of pockets of opportunity, and we will just have to take one at a time and see how we get there but we have folk, we have ambition and knowledge and the financial capability to achieve. And at some point in time, our goal, that's our confidence level. Yes. Good morning Damian. Well, we don't want to provide publicly our thinking about things like that. Let's say that we do believe that heat pump water heaters will be \u2013 have a substantial opportunity for us, and we are thinking about how to take advantage of that. I don't have that. Do you have it, Barry or Rick? I don't mind sharing it. Thank you. Good morning Steve. My goodness. Whatever those opportunities are in the future, we will deal with them as we have in the prior changes that come to the industry. We are very good at it. We have never been better at it. And so far as specific goals, anybody from the Watsco team want to deal with them? Hey. Good morning. Thank you. Good morning Jeff. Good morning. Well. You? Alright. Barry... Once again, thanks very much for your interest in Watsco. We hope to continue to build this wonderful company and appreciate very much your interest. Bye-bye now."

            "name": "A.J. Nahmad",
            "content": "Good morning, Tommy. Yes, we had a bet going. Would it be the first question would be on margins or would it be every other [indiscernible]. Exactly. So I'll let Rick and Barry get into the details, but I wanted to spend a second in here and abstract as a layer and talk about the big picture. And start with reminding everyone what Barry usually reminds us of is that there are many components to our gross margin. There is the transaction margins or what we make on an invoice-by-invoice basis, on a markup basis if you will. There is cost changes that come from the 1,000 or 2,000 manufacturers that we buy products from. There is volatility in commodity items that we sell. There is internal pricing actions with our optimization tools that we are getting more fluent in. There are product delivery costs. There is product mix changes between commercial and residential equipment, supplies etcetera. So there is action in all of these categories all the time. But what I want to get across is a reminder that we are a long-term company. And quarter-to-quarter, there is going to be noise and actions in all those categories, but we are focused on the signal. And as we have said, the long-term aspirational goal of margins is 30% and we see that within reach in time. And let me tell you why. And really, it starts with what we talk about a lot, which is our technology, but we should really call our continuous improvement culture. What the technology enables is our teams to be able to do analytics, to spot opportunities, enhance our capabilities, measure and track our successes in all parts of our business. Things like prospecting and winning new customers and changing and improving how customers engage with us with things like e-commerce and our apps, which eventually reduce our cost to serve those customers. We can increase with the tech or the continuous improvement. We are increasing our productivity levels in the warehouses. We spend a ton of money moving cost in and out and through our network and our fleet and transportation, which is now another frontier how we can use technology to improve what we are doing there. Optimizing our inventory, we have talked about a lot, and there will be meaningful gains there. Marketing and sales is a new system that goes on and on and on. But that continuous improvement culture or what we call technology, so it's a tool set to win in the marketplace and increase our \u2013 what we do and margins will be part of that. Higher gross margins will be part of our \u2013 is part of our DNA and more importantly will continue to grow profits and generate a lot of cash. But quarter-to-quarter there will be noise and I know that, that's very interesting to you all. Rick and Barry and Paul can much more eloquently answer questions about the noise, but I want to make sure that, that big picture was communicated and a reminder that we are a long-term company and long-term we expect to have not only strong gross margins but continuous growth. Yes. So Barry, I don't know if you want to jump in and answer a specific question, but I wanted to just to have underlying the conversation here. Yes. I just \u2013 we talked about the pricing optimization a lot, and it's not one thing. It is hundreds of opportunities across every product we sell to every customer in every location. So just that one maybe small example would be, if you say, everybody sells the same, meaning all of our business units just in the Florida market or Miami market a Honeywell 1, 2, 3 APC thermostat. And maybe there is 3,000 customers that bought that thermostat in the last 6 months. Well, it probably is at 3 different \u2013 3,000 different prices. And there is wide variation in that sale price. Well, now with this tool, for example, what we can do is understand all those sale prices of that same thermostat in the same market, and we can do some rationalization and some floor setting and making sure that the right customer, meaning larger customers are getting a more appropriate price, and smaller customers who haven't earned a lower price or getting a price that's right for them. And that's \u2013 if you do that one at that micro level, but you multiply it times hundreds and hundreds of opportunities, that's part of the effort that's going on now, and it helps. It's going to help drive margins and it's going to help, in fact, sell more product because it's not always about raising price. It's about getting the price right so that customers find it attractive and want to purchase the product from us as well. I'll double click on the last one, the logistics and transportation delivery. That is the third biggest expense for the company. About $200 million we spend moving products in and through and around our network and delivering products to customers. And I call it our next frontier of opportunity for continuous improvement. I think there is about 800 trucks in the fleet today. But there are now with the data being exposed and smart people taking smart actions, we're realizing that some of those trucks are sitting idle for 90% of the day. It doesn't make sense to have that truck or maybe use a different means of transportation to get product from point A to point B? Or can our business unit share trucks? Or is there a more efficient route to deliver the product? So all those questions now about the millions of times that we're moving products around our network in and out and through to customers are open season on that effort, and it's a big bucket. So we're going to move a needle on a big bucket. I would say there is not a silver bullet or two silver bullets. It's hundreds of small opportunities that add up to a lot. But now we have the tools and the teams and the drive and the focus, and we will get there. I think we have to take this opportunity to say how impressed we are with Chris Williams and his brothers and the team at Gateway. They have both a tremendous company over many years, and we are so proud and excited to have them as part of the family. It's an honor that they are with us now and we can do great things together. I will say this. I am glad that we have the scale and the strength that we have because we can do exactly what was just said is deal with anything that comes with us, in an efficient way and effective way. And we can use our resources as needed. It's going to be presumably more difficult for smaller competitors of ours. They will have a tougher time with the challenges I would imagine. We don't have that in our history. We do not forecast because we are in a business that fluctuates considerably with weather. And that's been our tradition. And I don't know that we are going to change it. Barry, if you can help them without changing that. That's a fair question, but I don't \u2013 maybe somebody else can answer it, because I am not sure. Barry, go ahead."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Yes, easy question here. I think what two of the OEMs have announced that they think it's going to be in the 10% to 15% range. We'll just have to see what they \u2013 what movement that they have on that. There are going to be higher cost in the new products. And obviously, those are going to be reflected in higher prices. I think as we move into next year, we are going to find out more and more about what the regulations actually state and what the regulations allow going forward into 2025 as far as the curtailment of 410a equipment. And I think that's really the open question that we have right now. Obviously, at some point, we are going to be 100% 454 or 32a refrigerant, which are going to have higher prices, because they are slightly inflammable. There have to be safety devices on the units. It is going to increase the price of the products. There is no doubt about it. I am not going to give you a forecast what I think it's going to be, but it will be higher than what we are seeing right now. It's the new higher efficiency products that we introduced this year. I think there is going to be \u2013 there is going to be some increases. There have been increases here recently in the last couple of weeks on 410a. It's a matter of what the refrigerant manufacturers are \u2013 how they are going to handle their new allocations. Their allocations for GWP products were reduced by 30% for next year. And so they are going to have to come up with their formulas internally that would determine how much 410a they can afford to make versus some of the other lower GWP products given their allocations. And then secondly, we get into the long-term issue, we've got another 30% reduction coming in 2029. And when that occurs, I think you are going to really see a crunch, if you will. But right now, we are just \u2013 we are trying to ferret out exactly what the regulations, how they impact the OEMs, how they impact the service level for the contractors that we work with and what's going to be the long tail or short tail of existing 410 equipment in the market. This is Paul again. I don't think really we saw any real change in dynamics as it relates to the replacement market. The replacement market remained healthy and strong and a lot of conversation, a lot of debate going on. Are we moving to a repair versus a replace type of market? Our indications are slightly \u2013 we are seeing a slight uptick in parts, which shows up in our numbers as far as compressor sales, motor sales, those types of things that would be a repair item. But really too early in the game and it's \u2013 we are not really seeing any real trends yet. But I think the consumer is replacing the equipment with a higher efficiency product and we are all happy for the consumer. Alright. Yes, we can expect that. We've been delayering our inventory now since the season ended, and we're seeing great progress. We've set goals for each one of our operating units. We track them daily with our ability to identify what we have on order and what our sales through is \u2013 sales output is. And we're seeing definite reductions month over month, day over day. It better be. I would \u2013 Okay. I would not want to pigeon hold into that. We're not give you that kind of... Are you asking about the new EPA? Yes, it came out last Friday night. Yes, everybody is still working their way through it. Basically, what it provided was that the outdoor unit becomes a component and hence, can be replaced as a repair item or a system that you can't install systems, indoor and outdoor units, but you can repair the by putting in an outer unit. And that's got a lot of ramifications, which I don't know if really have been thought all the way through by the people who wrote it up. For instance, how can you make sure that the coil on the inside matches the outdoor unit, which is only going to be the higher efficiency product. So if you're putting in a 15.3 outdoor unit with a 13 or 14 SEER indoor unit, you're not going to get the efficiency that you're paying for, for the outdoor. And then secondly, I think we're looking at a difference from when we went through the transition between R22 and 410a. This one is different. It's different in the regard that there is no replacement for 410a. There were other replacements that you could drop in that would replace the R22 that aren't going to be available with the new product. Also, a lot of questions that I think we need to ask our OEMs, and OEMs will have to answer the question what's going to happen to the price of the 410 units because, obviously, the production will be lower from the OEM, will that raise the price of the product? What's going to happen to the availability of 410a to make the repair cost so the repair cost would be acceptable to the consumer. What happens to the 30% to 40% of the installed base, which is still operating on R22 where you can't change out the outdoor unit with a 410a unit. So I've got a lot of questions. I guess I don't have a lot of answers for you. That's \u2013 but those are things that we're thinking of, and we're working with our OEMs and working with the refrigerant manufacturers who try to figure out how all this is going to play out and not only in \u201824, but also in \u201825 when we do the actual rollout. Yes, there is a concern. Is there an elasticity issue here where we're going to reach a point where a consumer can't afford it. I don't \u2013 I still feel like this is a necessity of life that people have to have heat have to have cool. Also, we're seeing a lot more interest, obviously, we really haven't felt the impact of 25c as far as the tax credits coming into effect for the higher income people. The rebate programs that hopefully will start maybe in the second or third quarter of 2024 should start picking in now support at least with an $8,000 rebate to the medium and low income consumer to be able to replace their unit and their system. But the consumer so far has been fairly resilient as far as taking care of what I would consider to be an absolute need for life, if you will. Also, we're starting to see a lot more activity around what utilities are doing, what states are doing in the area of the weatherization programs and that type of thing. So maybe that's a little bit of pollyanna, but I think going forward, the consumer is going to have to have to figure out which programs work out best for them so that they can be replacement. And with the financing is going to help also. Yes. I think all of our OEMs are geared up to have the new product and hopefully, we can start introducing product in the second and third quarter of next year, the new product. So I really don't have a lot of concern that they are not going to be ready. They will be ready. And then on the 410 transition, your guess is as good in mind. If they allow this to continue the way it's unfolding right now or has been written up in the latest blurb we got from the EPA that means 410a units will be available indefinitely until we run out of the ability to supply them with 410a. But I think that's not a good move for the consumer and the consumer would be much better off with the longer warranty period as well as having a new machine that actually is operating to specs, and improve their overall efficiency in their home. So, it's a guess as far as whether or not the EPA is going to continue on this path, where are they going to change their path or modify it in some way, we don't know. It is. As I indicated, that was different at that time because you had all these drop-ins available and the consumer could rely that they were going to have a unit that would be serviced for the 10-year or 12-year or 14-year lifespan of the product. We don't have that certainty this time. No, not really. I have got a little bit on the commodity side. I think we are going to start seeing some upticks in some of the commodities, but whether they will kick in, in the fourth quarter, I can't definitively say. Yes, I think we have got some ideas on how we can handle it without having to really overlay inventory, different ways of handling our logistics, our order plans and how we utilize some of our DC attributes to accommodate the replacement of the 410A units, early innings on that. We saw a definite uptick and those are the guys that are selling it to us. So hopefully, they saw the same uptick. But yes, we have seen an increase in the price of 410. We had \u2013 there was some dislocation where some people were taking inventory out earlier, and we are reducing price to be able to create some sort of sell-through, and when that ended, we started seeing the price come back the other way. No, we have not, did not establish a price yet for us. You have to ask them. We can't replenish the old product. So, it's no longer in production. So, it's going to be pretty much at 100% at some point once the remaining product is sold through. Yes. I would say early next year will be pretty much all new equipment."

I would only \u2013 I would just add a data point, Tommy, that when you look at the year-to-date margin picture, right, let's take a more medium-term perspective on it. It's almost a rounding error as compared to last year. And I think that's an achievement on our part given the unit environment we have been in and given the relative lack of price that's been in the market this year relative to last year, to say that there is only a 20 basis point difference, I call that a good outcome. Yes, sure. Hi, Dave. Good morning. Yes. I mean I don't think I'm overstating it by saying it's been the Wild West out in the field the last couple of years, and all of that supply chain imbalance weighs on that same-store productivity equation. And so what you've seen in the last few quarters is variable SG&A reacting to a different end market. But more importantly, what we've been working on the last year or so is a lot of energy into understanding our own internal productivity. And we've armed our leaders with real-time data that should help drive this in the field. They know this is a priority and they are responding. But that \u2013 this productivity journey that we're on is going to take some time. It encompasses a huge number of things. It starts with how we order and receive product from 2,000 suppliers. And we talk about supply chains getting better, but they are not better everywhere just yet. Commercial is one example. And you asked where are the pain points still, that is still a pain point in the supply chain is commercial and high-efficiency product. But it starts with how we receive product from over 2,000 suppliers. It impacts the real estate footprint, how we fulfill orders in the warehouse and finally, how we deliver product to customers. That's really the what this productivity effort encompasses, it's a lot of things really from the very beginning to the very end of our processes. And so we're starting to see progress, but there is a lot more to do. And I think big picture, two thoughts, I'll leave you with two thoughts. One is that I think our growing scale naturally enables more efficiency, right? As a $7 billion company, we have more opportunity to be more efficient than we did as a company half our size 4 years ago. And secondly, we possess the technology and the tools to drive this productivity throughout our network. And you'll note in the press release that we talked about what some of those internal investments have been in the pricing technology that A.J. just talked about, the warehouse management and order fulfillment technology. Some interesting work going on around logistics in our network. And so over time, that will bear some fruit in productivity and that will \u2013 we're starting to see the benefits of that today and not just variable SG&A reacting, but fixed SG&A reacting as well."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Albert Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. And this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. And with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomes. Now before we start, our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Watsco delivered a solid quarter against a challenging backdrop. It was the second strongest quarterly performance in our history, which is about 50 years, only surpassed by last year's record-breaking second quarter when sales were up 15% and earnings per share was up 33% last year. Our teams executed very well to generate this quarter's results, which came with considerable challenges, including product availability, as mentioned in our press release. The product shortages are a consequence of an immense product transition that is playing out this year following the step-up of minimum efficiency standards mandated across the United States. Approximately 60% of the equipment we are selling today represents new or revamped products. Pricing capture and margins consistency have done well, as evidenced by our gross margin performance for the quarter and the year-to-date. We are converting inventory and balancing our product offerings across our footprint. We have trained thousands of customers on the new products. We have updated our digital library to include all of the new products, adding over 400,000 new SKUs since the start of the year. The transition, however, has been uneven. One of our primary OEM partners was disproportionately impacted, affecting product availability of higher efficiency systems and, therefore, affecting our sales. We estimated a second sales impact of $75 million to $80 million, and as much as $125 million for the 6-month period ended June 30. The reality is all of our OEM partners have been affected to some measure and all are working to improve supply chain and help us meet the needs of our customers. As we mentioned, beyond the tough comps and supply chain issues, the arrival of a hot summer weather was delayed this year as evidenced by the decline in cooling degree days. Cooling degree days is measured by the U.S. government, so we have a lot of information as to the demand for cooling systems during the year. Summer has now arrived and current business conditions are encouraging. Apart from the product transition, which largely affected our residential business, other facets of the business are performing very well. Our commercial business continues to grow strong, double digits this quarter, and our backlog of projects extends into next year. Sales of ductless systems, an increasingly important component of our business, also grew double digits during the quarter. We saw the continued trend of gas furnaces converting towards heat pumps, which we sell at higher average selling prices. Gross margins held firm this quarter at 28.1%, reflecting our disciplined mindset around price and continued progress on our investment in our pricing technology. We also exhibited good SG&A discipline this quarter, and we are optimistic about driving more operating efficiencies across our network as we move through the years -- through the year, I should say. And of course, our balance sheet remains strong with little net debt at the peak of our seasonality. As always, the financial position provides us flexibility to invest in virtually any opportunity as we continue to grow and scale in a very fragmented $50 billion-plus North American market. We continue to look for acquisitions. Watsco is a great home for entrepreneurs in our space. We sustain cultures, invest in people and provide technology to secure and build under great legacies. Looking beyond the short term, our press release provides critical details that support Watsco's long-term growth trajectory. We have immense technology advantage, and we are investing to grow with that advantage. Our mobile preference and e-commerce channels have increased customer engagement, reduced attrition, created market share gains and supported our margin expansion in recent years. Watsco's broad array of products and brands is a competitive advantage that allows us to serve contractors in any environment. We have a leading market share position in Sunbelt markets that provides stability and high growth rates over time. In addition, there are several important regulatory and industry catalysts that are developing. For example, the introduction of higher efficiency standards for HVAC equipment has taken a full effect this year, providing price and sales mix benefits. New refrigerant standards historically has made it harder to repair existing systems and benefits our sales of replacement systems. In other words, whenever they change the refrigeration mandate, it makes a very difficult to repair what you've got, so they have they generally go and buy a replacement system. The phaseout of current refrigeration began last year and the launch of new equipment that conforms to the new refrigerant standards is scheduled in 2025. We also see continued progress towards electrification and greater adoption of heap pumps with higher average selling prices. Finally, we expect the Inflation Reduction Act, enhanced tax credit and consumer incentives to help upgrade HVAC systems in the years ahead. All of these catalysts will benefit the industry in the coming years, and we certainly believe our scale, technology and financial strength positions us to capture these market opportunities. With that, let's go on to questions and answers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair.\nRyan Merkel : I had a question on sales and then a question on group margins. So first on sales, you mentioned the weather, Al. Any chance you can share the July growth rate or just give us a sense of the magnitude change in sales from May, June to July?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I would say that -- let me answer the first question. In July, we're seeing growth, low single digits, but it's expanding and I think it will end up with growth rates in the third quarter. And what was the second part of your question?\nRyan Merkel : Yes. And just in terms of the magnitude of the improvement in July relative to what you saw in May and June?\nAlbert Nahmad: Over May and June or over the same period last year? I gave you the same period last year, we're up low single digits. Paul, if you got have you got that answer?\nPaul Johnston: Yes. I mean we're seeing definite growth rates pretty much across the board, seeing an uptick which -- because the weather was so weak in the first half of the year, we're seeing an uptick in repair parts which is always good for us on a gross profit basis. But really not a big trend towards replace versus repair or repair versus replace, whichever way you're going on this. Both of them were starting to see some upticks on.\nRyan Merkel : Okay. Got it.\nBarry Logan: And Ryan, it's Barry. The question was how was June versus July, we can't be granular in that way. Obviously, June is a huge month within the quarter. So June looked a lot like our second quarter performance. So July is obviously better, and that's a good thing.\nRyan Merkel : Yes. That was what I was getting at. On the gross margins, everyone's favorite topic. The long-term goal is 27%. You just did 28.1%. So just unpack for us why you're 100 basis points above your target. And then should we think about long-term target of 27% to 28%? Are you willing to make that change here today?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I'm going to raise your expectations. We're shooting for 30%. Now I'm not going to give you a timetable on it, but we believe we can get there and then eventually beyond that. Who wants to take a shot at his questions?\nBarry Logan: I'd be happy to. And again, there are 5 or 6 important variables in the current performance that have improved versus 3 years ago, whenever our that question was asked. It was asked 2 or 3 years ago, I feel like. And I think all 5 or 6 variables have been influenced by technology, number one. We talked about our pricing platform and how everything we sell to everyone we sell it to is being touched in some way through a pricing platform and so on. The other obvious reality we've talked about is we're selling a lot of new products. We had the opportunity this year to go out and get price margin and support our OEM community with all of their new products and sustained profitability. And so far, so good. Obviously, too, you have a growth in the replacement market relative to new construction, which helps margin some. And I think the overall mix of everything we're selling in terms of efficiencies and higher growth rates of heat pumps, for example, helps margin as well. Now I still haven't answered your question, though, which is where are we on the spectrum of our target and so on. In the short term, I don't think there's anything that is too remarkable to either pressurize or to add to gross profit where we are today. What I was suggesting longer term is we feel far from satisfied that we're doing all the things we can do to grow margin and to get the full benefit of the technology that we put in place only a couple of years ago. I mean the whole pricing discussion we're talking about with technology is only a couple of years old, and therefore, very far from being mature in terms of benefits.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, that was a long-winded answer. What was that a good one? I like that, Barry.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tommy Moll with Stephens Inc.\nTommy Moll : So I wanted to start with a continuation of pricing theme. We are potentially late in this pricing cycle, and I just wonder if you could give any qualitative commentary on where it feels like we sit today. And then to the extent you can give anything quantitative on what the contribution was in the second quarter, that would be helpful as well.\nAlbert Nahmad: All right. Who is best to handle that?\nPaul Johnston: Barry, do you want to take a run at that?\nBarry Logan: Sure, sure. Tommy, again, it's the same variables that we have to go out and prosecute and execute and -- in price and layering costs through the market given all the changes have gone. So I think for the quarter, it's about a 9%, 10% benefit to overall average selling price for our residential business or residential equipment. The 9%, 10% obviously has very little OEM kind of inflation capture. There was some of that, but very, very moderate this quarter. Most of it comes from a mix or from all the new products that are being layered in, and also heat pumps, which obviously have higher average selling price. So in the quarter, and it's pretty much the same number for year-to-date, I think 9% is the overall, call it, average selling price increase for the quarter and the year.\nTommy Moll : That's helpful. I also wanted to ask about the disruption you called out with one of your key OEM partners. Any other context you can share there would be good to know. And in particular, can you give us the status today? And is this something that we should expect to continue to pressure revenue in the third quarter and December?\nAlbert Nahmad: That's a very good question. They're a great company, and they're working very hard at it and they're improving. And my guess is that either through the end of this quarter or certainly by the end of the fourth quarter, they will be all caught up.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dave Manthey from Baird.\nDave Manthey : Since you put it out there, I'll ask a question on your 30% gross margin target. Just could you give us broad strokes, I won't ask you time lines, but what mechanisms would you see that would move you in that direction?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, there are lots of opportunity in the nonequipment side. We sell -- a considerable amount of our revenues comes from nonequipment that people seem to forget. And secondly, the movement towards heat pumps, by the nature of that, creates a higher margin. And that's where the demand is going to expand significantly, motivated by federal government mandates and things like that, plus the value of having heat pumps. And we have other things that our technology is providing ability to compete more effectively. So it's internal and its external forces that, I'm hoping, to move us to the 30% and eventually beyond. When you have this kind of scale that we do, you should be able to accomplish those kind of things.\nPaul Johnston: And Dave, this is Paul Johnston. You also see an awful lot of change happening with regulation over the next really over the next 5 to 6 years. We've got the refrigeration change that's going to -- that Al mentioned in his opening remarks, which will be in effect next year, which is going to reduce the availability of gas by another 30%. We just saw 10% 2 years ago, now we did another 30%, and we see another 30% happening in 2028. so we're going to have a definite squeeze on that as a commodity and also as an ability for us to be able to sell more replacement products even from the products that we sell in 2024 and 2025. Then we've got the complete change of product line that we're going to be getting in, in 2025, which is kind of a little bit of a flexibility in the time line as far as when that's released, but we're going to be seeing that occur. We've also got 2 other things that are hitting us, and that is there's going to be an increase in the minimum of efficiency for gas furnace to a minimum of 95%. We feel pretty confident that that's going to occur. And there's a potential of an additional refrigerant change, where the government could reduce the global warming potential down from 750 down to 500. So anytime there's a changing market, I think there's an opportunity for an upside in gross profit for Watsco.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes, don't take me literally that we expect -- we have a timetable for 30%. That's an aspiration, but we feel very confident we'll get there.\nDave Manthey : No, that's great color. Actually, I expected to be shut down in that question, but I appreciate all of the details.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I went to the resource, I knew we talked them also. You're good. You're good.\nDave Manthey : Absolutely. Well, so second is on tech spending. If you treat a run rate of $55 million right now. That's about 2x when you started standing up all these tools and populating your databases and everything else. And I'm just wondering if you could help us understand what are the key tech spending priorities and buckets that you're dealing with today?\nAlbert Nahmad: You mean you want to know who the big spender is?\nDave Manthey : Yes.\nAlbert Nahmad: Hey, Mr. President.\nAaron Nahmad: Yes, yes. No, I think we've consistently said with our tech spending that we are going to invest [indiscernible] today in an unlimited universe of opportunities to apply technology and innovation and process improvement and smart thinking and mark people to everything we do. And we've been at it now for 10, 12 years, and I think it's had a major impact on the business. And now with the advent of generative AI, there's a whole another world of opportunity. And next chapter is just starting to be written, and we are knee-deep in that opportunity as well now, which is obviously changing very, very fast. So maybe an ambiguous answer, but we're going to continue to invest because we know it's right for the long-term health of the business.\nAlbert Nahmad: And we might invest more. I think we will. We've been investing more every year. This company is very focused on long term. I know an analyst asked us last year some time, when are you going to stop investing? And I said, \"Well, we're never going to do that. This is our advantage, and we're going to continue to increase our advantage.\"\nBarry Logan: I think -- yes. I was just going to add a layer of thinking to it for your sake, David, is -- I mean, it's roughly, let's say, 300 people, technology people in that number in that $55 million number. What's not well understood is that probably 2/3 of that headcount is actually sitting in the field with customers. It's not sitting in a corporate ivory tower geeking out new technology, we have that. But a lot of the momentum, a lot of the new investing is helping customers and then growing our customers and then growing new customers at the field level. It really is spreading a local religion, so to speak, in very local market. So just get the sense that's not just invention and development, that's going on for sure, but it's also this ground game that is truly at the ground level in our markets.\nAaron Nahmad: And it's worth saying again that our customers that use our technology are better customers. Their growth rates with us are higher, their attrition rates are lower, our cost is serve them is lower. So the more customers we get using the technology more often, the better it is for the company. As well for the customers, by the way. They are more efficient and profitable as a result of using the technology.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.\nAlbert Nahmad: Josh, are you liking us better recently?\nJosh Pokrzywinski : You guys have done all right, Al. I'll give you that.\nAlbert Nahmad: Thank you. Thank you.\nJosh Pokrzywinski : A couple of questions here. Maybe one just kind of sticking to the quarter itself. Barry, I know you gave some good color last quarter about maybe some of the moving items in gross margin, basically the selling initiatives maybe versus kind of that inventory or inflation margin phenomenon. I know that there was an extra wrinkle in 2Q with the timing of price increases, anything that you could give us as bridge items to unpack that a little?\nBarry Logan: Sure. Well, in general, the selling margin, which is the purest form of price versus cost, did increase in the quarter. So that's a high-quality important component of gross profit because it is the largest component to the performance. So -- and that's without considering any benefit from some of the pricing actions that came in, in the quarter. So just pure quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year quality of margin improved. Some of the below-the-line items, I would say we're fairly flat. And something like freight, freight in, where we pay our vendors to deliver certain things to us, that still doesn't have some of the savings that we would like to have, again, because we're going through is pretty enormous transition of inventory. But nothing too remarkable, Josh, one way or the other. I think what is replicable is the selling margin, which is, again, simply price and cost being prosecuted in the market was positive without any considering a benefit of pricing actions?\nJosh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just shifting over more philosophically on heat pumps. I think with all the stimulus out there, I guess, IRA specifically, I know that these things carry a higher price point anyway. But do you guys get the sense that the OEMs or maybe the industry at large sort of disproportionately raises the price of pumps out there to start to capture some of that versus letting it all flow to the consumer? I'm just trying to think through sort of what are the pricing strategy you guys think evolves as IRA becomes more meaningful.\nPaul Johnston: IRA, we finally got some clarity around IRA that the tax credits, the IRS has finally published a list of what pieces of equipment by model and SKU are available that will get the tax credit. So that just occurred this week. And of course, because of our technology, we were able to get that out on our dealer apps to a couple of hundred thousand people quickly. So we really haven't felt the benefit of that. There's historically been a spread between a heat pump and a straight cool. There are different components, different electronics involved. And so I don't think there's any real uptick now that's going to occur where you're going to see heat pump margins going up because of the IRA proposition that we've got on the table right now. So I don't think the 2 are related right now, because there really hasn't been any impact at all on sales from higher rate. And we finally got the word out that the states now have the recommendation from the DOE on how to manage their rebate programs from mid- and low-income people. And so we're not going to see any of that probably until end of first quarter, beginning of second quarter next year, perhaps.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nMitch Moore: This is Mitch Moore on for Jeff. I just had a quick question. How much inventory do you guys want or need to take out in the second half? I think you said you'd address inventory levels once you had a better handle on the selling season.\nAlbert Nahmad: Who wants to take a shot? I'll say that my sense of it is we can -- we're capable of taking out another $200 million when things settle down, and that will be helpful in terms of inventory turns and in terms of cash flow.\nPaul Johnston: I would agree. That's a fair assessment.\nMitch Moore: Okay. Great. And then just one more. On the SG&A line, what can you guys do to temper decrementals if we continue to see volume declines in the second half?\nBarry Logan: I mean I can answer it if you like, Al.\nAlbert Nahmad: Sure.\nBarry Logan: Yes. I mean, first, what helps in that equation to be conservative, if you're asking let's be conservative on the top line, what happens below the top line, if that's your question. So SG&A becomes a focused item, obviously. SG&A went down this quarter in the second quarter, it's good. If I look inside that number, variable costs are down in the teens. Somewhere between 15% and 20%. Our variable costs that we've been expecting to reflect kind of the change in the top line is occurring. And fixed costs were up 4% in the quarter, for example, which is still a measure of inflation and also does not fully yet benefit from some of the productivity things that we have that our teams have focused on. So I don't -- I'm not going to predict precisely where SG&A has, but it's obvious that it was better in the second quarter than the first in terms of trend. And we'll see how the rest of the year plays out, but there is an immense amount of effort and challenge and data and technology, looking at SG&A for the rest of the year in terms of how we can reduce it further. So that would help the decremental equation. And if there's any level of growth, it certainly helps the earnings growth rate.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho.\nBrett Linzey: Just wanted to come back to the refrigerant changeover beginning in '25. Clearly, the regional SEER transition created some impediments for Watsco with the OE issue. How does that change or maybe inform the way you think about prebuy next year ahead of the '25 changeover as you look to maybe secure more inventory?\nAlbert Nahmad: That's a good question for Paul. He follows it.\nPaul Johnston: Yes, I don't -- we've been out -- we discussed this with all of our OEMs. We're not looking at a prebuy. I don't think anybody is right now looking at prebuy on 410A. As I indicated earlier, there's already been a 30% reduction in the GWP allocations for next year, which means we're going to be at 60% of what was allocated in 2011. And there's going to be a further one in 2028. So we're going to be down to basically 30%. So offering a unit and doing a prebuy on a unit where the refrigerant is going to be in short supply or very, very expensive, I don't think would be a prudent business opportunity for anybody.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Got it. And then just shifting to the consumer backdrop, clearly mix. I was wondering if there's anything you can glean from credit metrics across the organization or anything specific to the complexion of parts growth versus equipment that might suggest you're seeing some repair versus replacement trade down.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. We -- there's two primary components that we look at when we look at what the repair buses replace is doing, and it's motors and compressors. And what's happening with motors and compressors is we're seeing -- we are -- we finally are seeing -- in the month of July, we're finally seeing an uptick, which we didn't see in the first half of the year. And so as we see a growth in that, that would indicate that there would be more repair happening. We also monitor any sort of warranty claims back to the OEMs that we make to make sure that, one, they're in line with the marketplace, but also as an indicator whether or not the units are requiring repair while they're under warranty. To date, as I indicated earlier, yes, we are seeing an increase in the repair business in the -- in July, but it's not a not a major trend, I don't think yet. It's only been -- all I've got is 3 weeks of information. But at this point, I wouldn't say it's a major trend. But certainly, it's there and it's positive, and I'm happy about it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: My first question is, who had the sweet pipes at the beginning of the call there? That was -- that was nice thinking. That's good. I know Barry doesn't sing. Maybe it was Paul, I don't know. I don't know. Well, there are obviously reasons to sing with those gross margins, so congrats on continued execution there. I just wanted to level set kind of the July commentary. So you said you're up low single digits, maybe a little bit more from a like components and repair-related product perspective. What was -- what's kind of like the equipment unit? Would that be down high singles equipment unit volume in July?\nAlbert Nahmad: Paul? Barry?\nPaul Johnston: Yes, I would say it is. Yes, Barry, if you want you to take that.\nBarry Logan: First, I think when we talk about growth, we're talking about the whole business, Steve. And our part sales are not consequential enough to matter in that equation. Is it up? Yes, but consequential to the overall growth. Consequential is the continuance of price that we see, average higher selling prices. Probably a single-digit decline in units if I use common sense, and that's about it. I think -- and we're up against, again, 15% comps of a year ago. So if we're still not -- we're still -- as we've said many times now, we're still up against blockbuster stuff with the year ago. And so for July to have some growth, that's good.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. And then I just want to -- I'm having trouble reconciling something. I mean you guys had a tough time with supply, but your inventories are up significantly. Can you help kind of reconcile those 2 dynamics?\nAlbert Nahmad: And accounting for you, Mr. Logan.\nSteve Tusa: I think that's a little more basic than accounting, I don't know. You tell me.\nBarry Logan: I'm trying to prove I'm not just an accountant anymore after 30 years.\nSteve Tusa: You're everything, Barry.\nBarry Logan: So Steve, the irony of the question is if you look at -- if you took our data, looked through it and said I'm going to pick the whole universe of equipment, which is indoor unit outdoor units, ducted, coils, furnaces, everything that might be called a unit, the irony is the units are down this June versus a year ago single digits. So your question is why is inventory higher, right? Well, first, the cost is higher. The mix is higher. The mix is richer. And so part of the reality is we own inventory this year that is new. We can't say that enough or, obviously, clearly enough. Imagine any retail or any business that emptied out 60% of its products over the last 6 months and are carrying new products that are roughly 10%, 12% more in cost. And every customer, every price list, every into technology, everything had to be updated in the last 6 months to accommodate that. So it's the noisiest, most difficult, analytically reality time to ever measure anything in this industry, I think. And if I cut through with the crop and kind of just give you a simple answer, units are down in our inventory, and it's the cost that's up.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. And then one last one for you just on this kind of product transition dynamic. As they come back and supply you, do you -- you'll -- will you ship back to them as kind of -- as they can ship? And my guess is you took on more of somebody else's to make up for that this past quarter?\nBarry Logan: Yes. I would say we use the term balance. And it's not -- what that means is every store having matching systems that fit the need of any customer who calls or e-mails or e-commerces us is an order. The balance is having the right mix of everything, the right matching systems of everything. And that's been what has been the trickiest part, is the OEMs needing to manufacture matching systems in a very rich mix of new products that meets the local need of every customer in a local store. And so that's the challenge. And that balance is not fully balanced at this point in all the stores because of all the transitions that have gone up. So Paul, that's my abstract random thought answer, right? You're very close to this, too, maybe you have some thoughts.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. I want to make sure I totally understand your question. Your question was, are we going to move back to that OEM? Yes, of course, we are. We're going to support them in every way we can, and we're going to claw back any sales loss that we had and any share loss that we had. And collaboration that we have with that OEM is such that it's going to be a joint effort to be able to get that back. So yes, things happen. And when they happen, good partners stand together and work together.\nSteve Tusa: Yes. Sorry, one last quick one for you. You mentioned that inventories are down, but obviously, your sell-through unit wise is also down, probably a bit more meaningfully than I think we would have expected. If somebody were to come out and say like, industry residential HVAC unit inventories are in balance or that already seen a destock and that's over, it doesn't sound like that's the case with you guys saying you want to reduce your inventory by another $200 million. I mean it seems like there's a way to go here from that perspective.\nPaul Johnston: Yes. There still is some destock left to be performed. As Barry indicated, we have some -- you have some mismatch where you're going to have the outdoor units and not the indoor units to put the system there. The coil will be there, but not the not the air handling. So there is some destock as far as getting the proper match of inventory on hand and sold through. And we're still seeing a lot of great backlog on the commercial side, which we indicated in the open comments, where units are still as hot as it can be and we have a nice backlog of those. That we have in inventory in some of those, but they're awaiting jobs to be completed to be moved into. So I think there's some destocking that could be happening and then just some management that we're going to have to take on ourselves in order to reduce the inventory by $200 million.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Ahlersmeyer with Deutsche Bank.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer : Just want to follow up on that prior comment and the comments in the prepared remarks about commercial. You mentioned the double-digit growth in backlogs into next year. Is there -- could you give us a sense of whether those backlogs are coming down at this point? Are your current sales sort of greater than what you're adding to those backlogs?\nAlbert Nahmad: Good question. Paul, you've got the data.\nPaul Johnston: I think it varies based upon -- commercial is a very broad subject. Talking about commercial applied, where it's made to order for the job, I think we've still seen those backlogs continue to increase. When you get into commercial rooftop units, I think we've got a stabilization there. It supplies equaling demand right now. So I don't see that growing much further than where we are today. So it's kind of a mixed bag when you look at all the components that's going on in commercial.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer : Okay. Understood. And another couple, just a questions here. What percentage of the commercial business would you say is driven by repair and upgrade versus new construction? I think in the past, you said you're a bit less interested in the new construction because of the price and margin dynamics. And then on the resi side, just any number you might have in mind around how big heat pumps could be as a percentage of your overall equipment business today.\nPaul Johnston: And I would say once again, you've got a mixed bag when you talk about commercial. When you're talking about the applied business, it generally is new construction that we're into because those are made to order for a specific building. When you're talking rooftops, our game has historically continues to be on the replacement side.\nJoe Ahlersmeyer : And then heat pumps?\nPaul Johnston: And heat pumps continue to grow as a percent of our total business. I think you can get that information on the HRI website. You'll see that heat pumps now have exceeded -- in 2022, they exceeded the gas furnace sales. And now they've moved up to roughly, what, 40% of the total market. Watsco would be heavier on the heat pumps than most people because of our Sunbelt geography that we're heavy in. And so you're going to find more heat pump activity, obviously south of the Mason-Dixon line than you will north. However, that will change as the technology, the heat pump changes, and as government programs and utility programs push heat pumps into the northern climb.\nOperator: The next question comes from Damian Karas from UBS.\nDamian Karas : So I appreciate the details you gave around price and mix benefits, just curious if you happen to be seeing any signs that your competitors might be getting more competitive on price as inventories are being worked down. Or would you say that pricing mix uplift that you're seeing pretty consistent out there in the market?\nAlbert Nahmad: I would say it's been fairly consistent. We haven't really seen any breaks. Obviously, if you listen to the salesman, all the prices are going down. But if you really look at the reality of it, the marketplace is fairly disciplined, and we have not really seen a decline in the equipment pricing.\nDamian Karas : Understood. Appreciate that. And then a follow-up question on the refrigerant change. I mean you're effectively going to have multiple refrigerants competing. I think that's a little bit different than past cycles. And I believe you do work with OEMs that are on both sides of that. So I'm just curious how you see that dual refrigerant dynamic playing out and what it means for Watsco?\nPaul Johnston: Well, we have one of our companies that sells their OEM is going to go at the 32A, and then we have the rest of our companies where they're going with the 454B. It's very discrete and divided amongst our companies. So we have 1 company that will be carrying 2 flavors, 410 and 32A, 410 for repair and 32A for the new equipment. And the rest of our companies will be carrying 454 and 410. So I don't see a big deal there.\nOperator: I would like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks.\nAlbert Nahmad : Thanks again for your interest in our company. We appreciate it very much, and we look forward to speaking to you the next quarter. However, if any of you want to come visit and learn more about technology, the innovations that we're doing, feel free. We will happy to present to you the information that would be helpful to you. So thanks for listening, and see you the next time.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Albert Nahmad",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. And this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. And with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomes. Now before we start, our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Watsco delivered a solid quarter against a challenging backdrop. It was the second strongest quarterly performance in our history, which is about 50 years, only surpassed by last year's record-breaking second quarter when sales were up 15% and earnings per share was up 33% last year. Our teams executed very well to generate this quarter's results, which came with considerable challenges, including product availability, as mentioned in our press release. The product shortages are a consequence of an immense product transition that is playing out this year following the step-up of minimum efficiency standards mandated across the United States. Approximately 60% of the equipment we are selling today represents new or revamped products. Pricing capture and margins consistency have done well, as evidenced by our gross margin performance for the quarter and the year-to-date. We are converting inventory and balancing our product offerings across our footprint. We have trained thousands of customers on the new products. We have updated our digital library to include all of the new products, adding over 400,000 new SKUs since the start of the year. The transition, however, has been uneven. One of our primary OEM partners was disproportionately impacted, affecting product availability of higher efficiency systems and, therefore, affecting our sales. We estimated a second sales impact of $75 million to $80 million, and as much as $125 million for the 6-month period ended June 30. The reality is all of our OEM partners have been affected to some measure and all are working to improve supply chain and help us meet the needs of our customers. As we mentioned, beyond the tough comps and supply chain issues, the arrival of a hot summer weather was delayed this year as evidenced by the decline in cooling degree days. Cooling degree days is measured by the U.S. government, so we have a lot of information as to the demand for cooling systems during the year. Summer has now arrived and current business conditions are encouraging. Apart from the product transition, which largely affected our residential business, other facets of the business are performing very well. Our commercial business continues to grow strong, double digits this quarter, and our backlog of projects extends into next year. Sales of ductless systems, an increasingly important component of our business, also grew double digits during the quarter. We saw the continued trend of gas furnaces converting towards heat pumps, which we sell at higher average selling prices. Gross margins held firm this quarter at 28.1%, reflecting our disciplined mindset around price and continued progress on our investment in our pricing technology. We also exhibited good SG&A discipline this quarter, and we are optimistic about driving more operating efficiencies across our network as we move through the years -- through the year, I should say. And of course, our balance sheet remains strong with little net debt at the peak of our seasonality. As always, the financial position provides us flexibility to invest in virtually any opportunity as we continue to grow and scale in a very fragmented $50 billion-plus North American market. We continue to look for acquisitions. Watsco is a great home for entrepreneurs in our space. We sustain cultures, invest in people and provide technology to secure and build under great legacies. Looking beyond the short term, our press release provides critical details that support Watsco's long-term growth trajectory. We have immense technology advantage, and we are investing to grow with that advantage. Our mobile preference and e-commerce channels have increased customer engagement, reduced attrition, created market share gains and supported our margin expansion in recent years. Watsco's broad array of products and brands is a competitive advantage that allows us to serve contractors in any environment. We have a leading market share position in Sunbelt markets that provides stability and high growth rates over time. In addition, there are several important regulatory and industry catalysts that are developing. For example, the introduction of higher efficiency standards for HVAC equipment has taken a full effect this year, providing price and sales mix benefits. New refrigerant standards historically has made it harder to repair existing systems and benefits our sales of replacement systems. In other words, whenever they change the refrigeration mandate, it makes a very difficult to repair what you've got, so they have they generally go and buy a replacement system. The phaseout of current refrigeration began last year and the launch of new equipment that conforms to the new refrigerant standards is scheduled in 2025. We also see continued progress towards electrification and greater adoption of heap pumps with higher average selling prices. Finally, we expect the Inflation Reduction Act, enhanced tax credit and consumer incentives to help upgrade HVAC systems in the years ahead. All of these catalysts will benefit the industry in the coming years, and we certainly believe our scale, technology and financial strength positions us to capture these market opportunities. With that, let's go on to questions and answers. Well, I would say that -- let me answer the first question. In July, we're seeing growth, low single digits, but it's expanding and I think it will end up with growth rates in the third quarter. And what was the second part of your question? Over May and June or over the same period last year? I gave you the same period last year, we're up low single digits. Paul, if you got have you got that answer? Well, I'm going to raise your expectations. We're shooting for 30%. Now I'm not going to give you a timetable on it, but we believe we can get there and then eventually beyond that. Who wants to take a shot at his questions? Well, that was a long-winded answer. What was that a good one? I like that, Barry. All right. Who is best to handle that? That's a very good question. They're a great company, and they're working very hard at it and they're improving. And my guess is that either through the end of this quarter or certainly by the end of the fourth quarter, they will be all caught up. Well, there are lots of opportunity in the nonequipment side. We sell -- a considerable amount of our revenues comes from nonequipment that people seem to forget. And secondly, the movement towards heat pumps, by the nature of that, creates a higher margin. And that's where the demand is going to expand significantly, motivated by federal government mandates and things like that, plus the value of having heat pumps. And we have other things that our technology is providing ability to compete more effectively. So it's internal and its external forces that, I'm hoping, to move us to the 30% and eventually beyond. When you have this kind of scale that we do, you should be able to accomplish those kind of things. Yes, don't take me literally that we expect -- we have a timetable for 30%. That's an aspiration, but we feel very confident we'll get there. Well, I went to the resource, I knew we talked them also. You're good. You're good. You mean you want to know who the big spender is? Hey, Mr. President. And we might invest more. I think we will. We've been investing more every year. This company is very focused on long term. I know an analyst asked us last year some time, when are you going to stop investing? And I said, \"Well, we're never going to do that. This is our advantage, and we're going to continue to increase our advantage.\" Josh, are you liking us better recently? Thank you. Thank you. Who wants to take a shot? I'll say that my sense of it is we can -- we're capable of taking out another $200 million when things settle down, and that will be helpful in terms of inventory turns and in terms of cash flow. Sure. That's a good question for Paul. He follows it. Paul? Barry? And accounting for you, Mr. Logan. Good question. Paul, you've got the data. I would say it's been fairly consistent. We haven't really seen any breaks. Obviously, if you listen to the salesman, all the prices are going down. But if you really look at the reality of it, the marketplace is fairly disciplined, and we have not really seen a decline in the equipment pricing. Thanks again for your interest in our company. We appreciate it very much, and we look forward to speaking to you the next quarter. However, if any of you want to come visit and learn more about technology, the innovations that we're doing, feel free. We will happy to present to you the information that would be helpful to you. So thanks for listening, and see you the next time."

            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "And Ryan, it's Barry. The question was how was June versus July, we can't be granular in that way. Obviously, June is a huge month within the quarter. So June looked a lot like our second quarter performance. So July is obviously better, and that's a good thing. I'd be happy to. And again, there are 5 or 6 important variables in the current performance that have improved versus 3 years ago, whenever our that question was asked. It was asked 2 or 3 years ago, I feel like. And I think all 5 or 6 variables have been influenced by technology, number one. We talked about our pricing platform and how everything we sell to everyone we sell it to is being touched in some way through a pricing platform and so on. The other obvious reality we've talked about is we're selling a lot of new products. We had the opportunity this year to go out and get price margin and support our OEM community with all of their new products and sustained profitability. And so far, so good. Obviously, too, you have a growth in the replacement market relative to new construction, which helps margin some. And I think the overall mix of everything we're selling in terms of efficiencies and higher growth rates of heat pumps, for example, helps margin as well. Now I still haven't answered your question, though, which is where are we on the spectrum of our target and so on. In the short term, I don't think there's anything that is too remarkable to either pressurize or to add to gross profit where we are today. What I was suggesting longer term is we feel far from satisfied that we're doing all the things we can do to grow margin and to get the full benefit of the technology that we put in place only a couple of years ago. I mean the whole pricing discussion we're talking about with technology is only a couple of years old, and therefore, very far from being mature in terms of benefits. Sure, sure. Tommy, again, it's the same variables that we have to go out and prosecute and execute and -- in price and layering costs through the market given all the changes have gone. So I think for the quarter, it's about a 9%, 10% benefit to overall average selling price for our residential business or residential equipment. The 9%, 10% obviously has very little OEM kind of inflation capture. There was some of that, but very, very moderate this quarter. Most of it comes from a mix or from all the new products that are being layered in, and also heat pumps, which obviously have higher average selling price. So in the quarter, and it's pretty much the same number for year-to-date, I think 9% is the overall, call it, average selling price increase for the quarter and the year. I think -- yes. I was just going to add a layer of thinking to it for your sake, David, is -- I mean, it's roughly, let's say, 300 people, technology people in that number in that $55 million number. What's not well understood is that probably 2/3 of that headcount is actually sitting in the field with customers. It's not sitting in a corporate ivory tower geeking out new technology, we have that. But a lot of the momentum, a lot of the new investing is helping customers and then growing our customers and then growing new customers at the field level. It really is spreading a local religion, so to speak, in very local market. So just get the sense that's not just invention and development, that's going on for sure, but it's also this ground game that is truly at the ground level in our markets. Sure. Well, in general, the selling margin, which is the purest form of price versus cost, did increase in the quarter. So that's a high-quality important component of gross profit because it is the largest component to the performance. So -- and that's without considering any benefit from some of the pricing actions that came in, in the quarter. So just pure quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year quality of margin improved. Some of the below-the-line items, I would say we're fairly flat. And something like freight, freight in, where we pay our vendors to deliver certain things to us, that still doesn't have some of the savings that we would like to have, again, because we're going through is pretty enormous transition of inventory. But nothing too remarkable, Josh, one way or the other. I think what is replicable is the selling margin, which is, again, simply price and cost being prosecuted in the market was positive without any considering a benefit of pricing actions? I mean I can answer it if you like, Al. Yes. I mean, first, what helps in that equation to be conservative, if you're asking let's be conservative on the top line, what happens below the top line, if that's your question. So SG&A becomes a focused item, obviously. SG&A went down this quarter in the second quarter, it's good. If I look inside that number, variable costs are down in the teens. Somewhere between 15% and 20%. Our variable costs that we've been expecting to reflect kind of the change in the top line is occurring. And fixed costs were up 4% in the quarter, for example, which is still a measure of inflation and also does not fully yet benefit from some of the productivity things that we have that our teams have focused on. So I don't -- I'm not going to predict precisely where SG&A has, but it's obvious that it was better in the second quarter than the first in terms of trend. And we'll see how the rest of the year plays out, but there is an immense amount of effort and challenge and data and technology, looking at SG&A for the rest of the year in terms of how we can reduce it further. So that would help the decremental equation. And if there's any level of growth, it certainly helps the earnings growth rate. First, I think when we talk about growth, we're talking about the whole business, Steve. And our part sales are not consequential enough to matter in that equation. Is it up? Yes, but consequential to the overall growth. Consequential is the continuance of price that we see, average higher selling prices. Probably a single-digit decline in units if I use common sense, and that's about it. I think -- and we're up against, again, 15% comps of a year ago. So if we're still not -- we're still -- as we've said many times now, we're still up against blockbuster stuff with the year ago. And so for July to have some growth, that's good. I'm trying to prove I'm not just an accountant anymore after 30 years. So Steve, the irony of the question is if you look at -- if you took our data, looked through it and said I'm going to pick the whole universe of equipment, which is indoor unit outdoor units, ducted, coils, furnaces, everything that might be called a unit, the irony is the units are down this June versus a year ago single digits. So your question is why is inventory higher, right? Well, first, the cost is higher. The mix is higher. The mix is richer. And so part of the reality is we own inventory this year that is new. We can't say that enough or, obviously, clearly enough. Imagine any retail or any business that emptied out 60% of its products over the last 6 months and are carrying new products that are roughly 10%, 12% more in cost. And every customer, every price list, every into technology, everything had to be updated in the last 6 months to accommodate that. So it's the noisiest, most difficult, analytically reality time to ever measure anything in this industry, I think. And if I cut through with the crop and kind of just give you a simple answer, units are down in our inventory, and it's the cost that's up. Yes. I would say we use the term balance. And it's not -- what that means is every store having matching systems that fit the need of any customer who calls or e-mails or e-commerces us is an order. The balance is having the right mix of everything, the right matching systems of everything. And that's been what has been the trickiest part, is the OEMs needing to manufacture matching systems in a very rich mix of new products that meets the local need of every customer in a local store. And so that's the challenge. And that balance is not fully balanced at this point in all the stores because of all the transitions that have gone up. So Paul, that's my abstract random thought answer, right? You're very close to this, too, maybe you have some thoughts."

            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Yes. I mean we're seeing definite growth rates pretty much across the board, seeing an uptick which -- because the weather was so weak in the first half of the year, we're seeing an uptick in repair parts which is always good for us on a gross profit basis. But really not a big trend towards replace versus repair or repair versus replace, whichever way you're going on this. Both of them were starting to see some upticks on. Barry, do you want to take a run at that? And Dave, this is Paul Johnston. You also see an awful lot of change happening with regulation over the next really over the next 5 to 6 years. We've got the refrigeration change that's going to -- that Al mentioned in his opening remarks, which will be in effect next year, which is going to reduce the availability of gas by another 30%. We just saw 10% 2 years ago, now we did another 30%, and we see another 30% happening in 2028. so we're going to have a definite squeeze on that as a commodity and also as an ability for us to be able to sell more replacement products even from the products that we sell in 2024 and 2025. Then we've got the complete change of product line that we're going to be getting in, in 2025, which is kind of a little bit of a flexibility in the time line as far as when that's released, but we're going to be seeing that occur. We've also got 2 other things that are hitting us, and that is there's going to be an increase in the minimum of efficiency for gas furnace to a minimum of 95%. We feel pretty confident that that's going to occur. And there's a potential of an additional refrigerant change, where the government could reduce the global warming potential down from 750 down to 500. So anytime there's a changing market, I think there's an opportunity for an upside in gross profit for Watsco. IRA, we finally got some clarity around IRA that the tax credits, the IRS has finally published a list of what pieces of equipment by model and SKU are available that will get the tax credit. So that just occurred this week. And of course, because of our technology, we were able to get that out on our dealer apps to a couple of hundred thousand people quickly. So we really haven't felt the benefit of that. There's historically been a spread between a heat pump and a straight cool. There are different components, different electronics involved. And so I don't think there's any real uptick now that's going to occur where you're going to see heat pump margins going up because of the IRA proposition that we've got on the table right now. So I don't think the 2 are related right now, because there really hasn't been any impact at all on sales from higher rate. And we finally got the word out that the states now have the recommendation from the DOE on how to manage their rebate programs from mid- and low-income people. And so we're not going to see any of that probably until end of first quarter, beginning of second quarter next year, perhaps. I would agree. That's a fair assessment. Yes, I don't -- we've been out -- we discussed this with all of our OEMs. We're not looking at a prebuy. I don't think anybody is right now looking at prebuy on 410A. As I indicated earlier, there's already been a 30% reduction in the GWP allocations for next year, which means we're going to be at 60% of what was allocated in 2011. And there's going to be a further one in 2028. So we're going to be down to basically 30%. So offering a unit and doing a prebuy on a unit where the refrigerant is going to be in short supply or very, very expensive, I don't think would be a prudent business opportunity for anybody. Yes. We -- there's two primary components that we look at when we look at what the repair buses replace is doing, and it's motors and compressors. And what's happening with motors and compressors is we're seeing -- we are -- we finally are seeing -- in the month of July, we're finally seeing an uptick, which we didn't see in the first half of the year. And so as we see a growth in that, that would indicate that there would be more repair happening. We also monitor any sort of warranty claims back to the OEMs that we make to make sure that, one, they're in line with the marketplace, but also as an indicator whether or not the units are requiring repair while they're under warranty. To date, as I indicated earlier, yes, we are seeing an increase in the repair business in the -- in July, but it's not a not a major trend, I don't think yet. It's only been -- all I've got is 3 weeks of information. But at this point, I wouldn't say it's a major trend. But certainly, it's there and it's positive, and I'm happy about it. Yes, I would say it is. Yes, Barry, if you want you to take that. Yes. I want to make sure I totally understand your question. Your question was, are we going to move back to that OEM? Yes, of course, we are. We're going to support them in every way we can, and we're going to claw back any sales loss that we had and any share loss that we had. And collaboration that we have with that OEM is such that it's going to be a joint effort to be able to get that back. So yes, things happen. And when they happen, good partners stand together and work together. Yes. There still is some destock left to be performed. As Barry indicated, we have some -- you have some mismatch where you're going to have the outdoor units and not the indoor units to put the system there. The coil will be there, but not the not the air handling. So there is some destock as far as getting the proper match of inventory on hand and sold through. And we're still seeing a lot of great backlog on the commercial side, which we indicated in the open comments, where units are still as hot as it can be and we have a nice backlog of those. That we have in inventory in some of those, but they're awaiting jobs to be completed to be moved into. So I think there's some destocking that could be happening and then just some management that we're going to have to take on ourselves in order to reduce the inventory by $200 million. I think it varies based upon -- commercial is a very broad subject. Talking about commercial applied, where it's made to order for the job, I think we've still seen those backlogs continue to increase. When you get into commercial rooftop units, I think we've got a stabilization there. It supplies equaling demand right now. So I don't see that growing much further than where we are today. So it's kind of a mixed bag when you look at all the components that's going on in commercial. And I would say once again, you've got a mixed bag when you talk about commercial. When you're talking about the applied business, it generally is new construction that we're into because those are made to order for a specific building. When you're talking rooftops, our game has historically continues to be on the replacement side. And heat pumps continue to grow as a percent of our total business. I think you can get that information on the HRI website. You'll see that heat pumps now have exceeded -- in 2022, they exceeded the gas furnace sales. And now they've moved up to roughly, what, 40% of the total market. Watsco would be heavier on the heat pumps than most people because of our Sunbelt geography that we're heavy in. And so you're going to find more heat pump activity, obviously south of the Mason-Dixon line than you will north. However, that will change as the technology, the heat pump changes, and as government programs and utility programs push heat pumps into the northern climb. Well, we have one of our companies that sells their OEM is going to go at the 32A, and then we have the rest of our companies where they're going with the 454B. It's very discrete and divided amongst our companies. So we have 1 company that will be carrying 2 flavors, 410 and 32A, 410 for repair and 32A for the new equipment. And the rest of our companies will be carrying 454 and 410. So I don't see a big deal there."

No, I think we've consistently said with our tech spending that we are going to invest [indiscernible] today in an unlimited universe of opportunities to apply technology and innovation and process improvement and smart thinking and mark people to everything we do. And we've been at it now for 10, 12 years, and I think it's had a major impact on the business. And now with the advent of generative AI, there's a whole another world of opportunity. And next chapter is just starting to be written, and we are knee-deep in that opportunity as well now, which is obviously changing very, very fast. So maybe an ambiguous answer, but we're going to continue to invest because we know it's right for the long-term health of the business. And it's worth saying again that our customers that use our technology are better customers. Their growth rates with us are higher, their attrition rates are lower, our cost is serve them is lower. So the more customers we get using the technology more often, the better it is for the company. As well for the customers, by the way. They are more efficient and profitable as a result of using the technology."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer, Albert Nahmad. Please go ahead, sir.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning, everyone. I hope you all got to see the space ship Starlink launch few minutes ago, biggest space ship in the history of country or probably in the history of the world. Disclaimer for my error or [inaudible]. In any event, welcome to our first quarter earnings call. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO; and with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Now before we start, the cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws, ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statement. Now Watsco delivered an exceptional first quarter especially in light of last year\u2019s impressive first quarter. Last year same store scale sales were up 25% and EPS was up 109%. Let me say that again. This quarter compares to last year and last year\u2019s sales were up 25% and earnings per share was up 109%. This quarter sales grew 2% to record $1.55 billion, gross margins up 28.9% reflect our mindset around price and continued progress in our investments and pricing technology to help our leaders in the field optimize margins. You will recall that last year's first quarter gross margins also benefited from OEM pricing actions in response to unprecedented inflation. We are happy with the quarter's result given the reduced level of OEM pricing actions during this first quarter of this year compared to last year. SG&A increased 1%, reflecting early progress with cost containment and gains in operating efficiency that builds on what we achieved, started to achieve last quarter. Operating income was $165 million, operating margins remain in double digits at 10.6% and earnings per sale was $2.83 for the quarter. As per cash flow, this is the time of the year when we build inventory for the upcoming selling season and we are seeing supply chains ease in certain product segments versus last year. I must say not all OEMs are over the supply chain problem yet, but they're improving. Cash flow during the quarter improved $54 million year-over-year despite an unprecedented shift in inventory to new higher cost systems as a result of the change in efficiency standards that took place January 1. We expect further progress in terms of improved inventory terms and cash flow as the year goes on. All-in-all, our balance sheet remains strong with almost no debt. This provides us the flexibility to invest in virtually any opportunity As we continue to build scale in a very fragmented $50 billion plus North American market. We continue to look for acquisitions, as Watsco is a great home for family businesses. We sustain cultures, invest in people, and provide technology to secure and build on their great legacies. That's something we love doing building great legacies of companies that we acquire. Looking beyond the Short term, our press release today provides critical details that support Watsco's long term growth trajectory. We have an immense technology advantage, and we are investing to grow that advantage. These technologies are increasing customer engagement, reducing attrition, creating market share gains, and supporting margin. Watsco's broad array of products and brands is a competitive I should say, a competitive advantage that allows us to serve contractors in most environments. We also have a leading market share position in some bell markets to provide stability and higher growth rates. In addition, there are several important regulatory and industry catalysts for growth that will play out in the next few years. 2023 saw the introduction of federally mandated high efficiency standards for HVAC equipment, which will deliver price benefits in 2023 and beyond. 2025 will also mark the introduction of new refrigerant standards, which historically has made it harder to repair existing systems and favors more demand for replacements. We also see continued movement towards electrification and greater adoption of heat pumps which generally come at higher prices and higher margins. Sales of heat pumps grew 7% in our company during the first quarter, outpacing overall growth rates. Finally, we also expect new Inflation Reduction Act to provide enhanced tax credits and incentives for efficiency upgrades and electrification in the years ahead. All of these catalysts would benefit the industry in the coming years, and we certainly believe our scale, technology and financial strength position us to capture the new market share opportunities. With that let's go on to questions and answers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question here will come from Ryan Merkel with William Blair.\nRyan Merkel: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, first off, can you comment on trends so far in April? Just trying to figure out if things are continuing at this pretty healthy pace.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, that's just a few days start, but I'll let Barry provide some -- an answer to that.\nBarry Logan : I think, really, the first four months of the year all pretty consistent in a very \u2013 is not volatility, there's not a lot of change. It's been pretty consistent all four months as we start the year. But I would very critically and importantly say that May and June and the rest of the third quarter is where the big seasonal increase is for the quarter. For example, May and June would probably be 80% of the earnings of the quarter. So an early read in April, I'll give you some inference, but it's not representative of what the rest of the season looks like yet. But so far, so good. If I say it more simply.\nRyan Merkel: Okay, well, I'll take that and appreciate that. Yes, we're not in the season yet. And then turning to gross margin, was the quarter hurt by inventory profits rolling off year-over-year? And I guess, really my question is, are inventory profits out of your gross margin at this point?\nAlbert Nahmad: That's a great accounting question, Mr. Logan.\nBarry Logan: Yes, I mean, it's funny for my 30 year career, it's always been a first quarter question and never a question beyond the first quarter because that's generally the timing of pricing. But I'll take a shot at it, Ryan, because it's been anything but normal the last couple of years. So a year ago, OEMs had near double digit price actions effective January 1. This year they did not. This year, the pricing action is in on March 1 and it's less than double digit. So there's clearly a cost, as to use your term, which is really I wouldn't call it a cost. I would say there's clearly an impact in the short term margin this quarter could be 150 - 200 basis points in the quarter because of that algebra in the equation. And obviously our margins didn't go down by that amount because there is everything we've been saying now for a year about the entrepreneurial culture, the team, the technology, the culture. Working with our OEMs, all the heavy lifting going into the margin and pricing development the last two years, you can see offset some of that short term cost and margin. So that's the difference between short term and long term. In the short term, yes, there's an algebraic impact in the quarter. Long term, the benefits you can see, and you've been seeing it now for the last two or three quarters in a pretty significant way.\nOperator: And our next question here will come from Dave Manthey with Baird.\nDavid Manthey: Hey. Good morning, Al. I was wondering if you could talk about the OpEx a little bit here. Is it true to say that your increased investment and driving sales for key OEMs via selling and marketing expenses is being offset by tight cost control at the business operating unit level? Any color you can provide on those offsetting OpEx factors?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, we certainly hope so, but let me have Barry explain that.\nBarry Logan: Hey, Dave. Well, again, I like to look at things over a longer timeline just to tell the story conceptually more than just short term. So the last two years, it's pretty remarkable. I think that headcount is up about 15%. That's 800 people, say $60 million -$70 million in cost added to our network to serve customers, to deal with the environment we're in, to sell more products, to bring more technology, whatever it might be. And it's a remarkable number. And that's part of the investment that we talk about in growing the market, growing the business, the two way street of economics that we've been looking for to grow the business long term. And that's in the numbers. And if I dial into the quarter and be again more surgical about it for example, we saw fixed costs increase this quarter high single digits. And that goes with the people and the investments that are made where variable cost, some of the variable selling costs went down double digits in a quarter. So that's a little bit of what we expected, right? We're not going to shut off investments, we're going to keep investing, some of the variable or transitory costs of what's been going on the last two years if that eases and as those eases, we would expect cost reduction. So everything I've just said is playing out in 673 locations in very different ways. But culturally you can see over the last six months there's a big impact going on in SG&A, not just the quarter.\nDavid Manthey: Yes. Okay. And second, at a recent investor conference, Carrier said that they believe they're underrepresented in their aftermarket. Do you have any idea what they mean by that?\nAlbert Nahmad: No, that's news to me. I've never heard that.\nPaul Johnston: I think this OEM is now has been looking for an increase in their aftermarket share and it's something that all OEMs are after. And so, yes, as time goes on, we'll find out how we can motivate the contractor to do more repair parts than they've done in the past. But there's a tradeoff to that, obviously. Do you want replacement units and parts? I don't think the two necessarily go hand in hand.\nBarry Logan: Dave. I think I don't know the answer, but I'll add my editorial to it. There's a commercial element to that discussion probably that's pretty significant. I don't know market share in the commercial applied aftermarket parts business, but I have a feeling it's a pretty complex machine, and my guess is that some of this long term development can come there. And as Paul said, it's been elusive, I think, for all the OEMs in that sector.\nOperator: Our next question here will come from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeffrey Sprague: Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. You sound a little under the weather, Al. Hope you're feeling okay.\nAlbert Nahmad: It's my spring cold. Every spring I have to weather the cold. It's just a simple cold, but thank you for asking.\nJeffrey Sprague: Yes. Obviously, a lot of cross currents going on the revenue line. I just wondering if you could unpack that a little bit for us, right. We got carryover price, we got new price, we got the SEER change. I mean it's clear volumes are down, right. But can you give us a little bit of granular detail on the interplay of volume, price and mix?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I would say that all the things that you mentioned are positive for us. I don't see anything in front of us other than good things, and we have the scale to take advantage of that. But let's get a little more granular with you, Barry and Paul than anybody else. Rick, if you want to jump in as well.\nBarry Logan: Sure. Good morning, Jeff. Yes, I mean, first units are down in the quarter. We expected that, the industry expected that. It's mid-single digits in terms of decline. Pricing was up very high single digits, which is just more of a mix benefit this quarter. Again, the OEM pricing came later and we'll actually have some carryover benefit into the second quarter. But this quarter pricing is largely mixed and near double digits. And as far as commercial and that type of thing, commercial is up well into double digit territory, which is probably two and a half years now of trend. And to give you some sense of that, I think if we look out into the season, you still have a lag in the full market converting to the new higher tier systems. You have the northern part of the market catching up to the Sun Belt with new systems at higher prices. The manufacturers will all be asked further pricing actions this year, but as a group, most were effective March 1, which carries into the second third quarter. And what Al is referencing is 2023 has really three things going on that are remarkable too, which is the refrigerant change, the heat pump growth and tax credits and so on that could play a role and influence this. If I add a fourth one that I think is somewhat unique to Watsco, our ductless business, which is a big business for us, it's not centric, so to speak, to the US OEMs, but it's a growing part of the market. There's a lot of growth, a lot of investment, a lot of new territories for us in that market. So I think, all-in-all, once we get past some of this early comparable difficulty that we have, that's Al's frame of mind is we're pretty optimistic about the rest of the year.\nPaul Johnston : If I can add on to that a little bit the impact of 25C with the tax credits coming in for the high efficiency product really wasn't in our mix in the first quarter. We really didn't see a lot of evidence of, a lot of tailwinds coming from the tax credit. So we're looking forward to that second and third quarter as we start seeing more of that. And then exactly what Barry is saying the sell-through of the existing heat pumps is still going through. And we really haven't seen the benefit of the high efficiency heat pumps have not yet flowed through into the marketplace. So we've got some good upsides that we're looking at for Q2 and Q3.\nJeffrey Sprague: And maybe just a clarification on refrigeration. Are you saying you think the refrigeration change that happens in 2025 will already have some kind of positive impact on \u201823 in terms of pre buy or things like that? Or were you kind of referring to something else?\nAlbert Nahmad: No, we're preparing to when the rule comes in. We are not interested in that.\nPaul Johnston : That\u2019s not going to impact us until late \u201824.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Good morning, Al. Sorry, I was on mute there. Hope you feel better soon. Quick question on inventory. So a much bigger build in inventory than certainly what we'd expected. So I'm just wondering, was that magnitude of inventory build intentional? Are there any other factors you need to bear in mind?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, part of it, as I suggested in previous calls, is the supply chain issue is that we would get in a system, just part of one system, and we got the inventory at so we get the rest of the system. And that still lingers. We still have inventory of that sort. It's good inventory eventually would get into the pipeline and into the market. And I do believe we have more inventory at the moment than I'd like to see. But we're going into the season, so it's not a bad problem to have. As I said earlier, some OEMs are still having issues with supply, the product that we need. But it's good inventory, and eventually, I think we'll get it right size and pre turns, and that improves cash flow even beyond where we are today. As you know, our cash flow has performed very well to date. Any commentary from the team?\nAaron Nahmad: This is AJ. I'll just add that while year-over-year inventory looks up in dollars, there are inflation. There is inflation in those numbers. And if you look at units, they\u2019re actually down. So there are supply chain issues that keep us, if you will, at a higher inventory position than ideal. But it certainly weighs on those numbers. But I agree with what was just said is that here comes a season and we should be in pretty good shape to sell through what we got.\nNigel Coe: Yes. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe Barry, could I just go back to your comments on the gross margin. Obviously, the price increase came through later in the quarter than normal. So as we then trip into 2Q, does that mean that 2Q gross margin should be maybe a little bit higher than we would expect to see normally? Any color on how we should expect gross margin to kind of, I guess, trend through the balance of the year will be helpful. Thanks.\nBarry Logan: Yes. Again, we're speaking in basis points here, not percentages, so don't get carried away with it. But, yes, there is a benefit that will flow into the end of the second quarter that can benefit gross profit because of the timing of the price increases. But it's in basis points. I wouldn't get carried away with the analysis.\nNigel Coe: Please go ahead.\nAaron Nahmad: Sorry, I was just going to add that, yes, it's true. The price increase came later than usual. It's also more moderate than usual, or at least than last year. And it's only on our equipment business, right? The price increases on all the other thousands of SKUs that we sell have tampered relative to the last two years.\nNigel Coe: That's fair. Sorry, just one more clarification. Do you think 20% plus is a good number to use for second quarter and beyond?\nAlbert Nahmad: You mean gross margin?\nNigel Coe: Yes.\nAlbert Nahmad: Oh, my goodness. It's, of course, we think. Hear a question, go ahead, Barry.\nBarry Logan: I didn\u2019t hear.\nAlbert Nahmad: I think you said, do you think we'll do 20% or better in the second quarter in gross margin? I think you said that.\nBarry Logan: 28%.\nAlbert Nahmad: Oh, 28%, I'm sorry. I didn't hear that right. I want to speculate on that. Barry? I mean \u2013\nBarry Logan: Yes. I'm going to stick to what we've said now, about a year ago. What are you looking at for gross margin? We said 27% as a target, as a baseline. Obviously, we've been exceeding that the last six months especially. But, Nigel, I'm going to stick to that just until we can see the real seasonal impact of everything. We're 30%, 40% larger business 90 days from now just out of first seasonality. So let's be conservative and thoughtful, and we'll change our mind when we have more data.\nAaron Nahmad: Thanks, Barry. Last time, you set us up for 27 last time, Barry, and we did pretty well against that goal, so maybe you should raise the bar.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Good morning, Al. Just want to follow up on the gross margin commentary. Obviously, when you see numbers that big, everyone's trying to figure out where that looks like going forward. But, Barry, you mentioned that the 150 -200 basis points, I think any other factors that we should keep in mind in there? You mentioned selling price, but anything on the freight side? And then I guess maybe just specifically on selling price. Do you think of that as more doing better on the buying side or doing better on kind of the customer selling side? Obviously, both have the impact.\nAlbert Nahmad: You brought a good point on trade. Barry, you go ahead and answer that.\nBarry Logan: Yes, well, first the parts of cost of sales that don't relate to the cost of the product. Like freight in shrinkage, inner branch freight, things that are costs within cost of sales over the last six months again, no great variation as a basis point impact. We would hope at some point actually freight would be a contributor to gross profit, as it's been a higher cost over the last couple of years. But as a trend, those line items have had no impact on what you've seen. And the results the last months, result comes from again, taking 100,000 -200,000 SKUs and going through a pricing margin optimization program. It also goes to the branch level leadership incentivizing them or culturally giving them tools they didn't have two years ago. And it is also, as I said, more generically working with OEMs over the last two or three years. So I think, Josh, that there's not much to report or volatility or one big impact items. It's all been pretty consistent, I think, for the last several quarters now, the only variable that changes has been the level of pricing actions like we're articulating carefully today. And yes, it had a cost, but the other things had a benefit. And to the extent that levels out the OEM pricing actions levels out, the benefits will be there and that's how we look at it. Hope that makes sense.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it, certainly does. And then I know 2025 is kind of a long way off, especially with a little more macro uncertainty. But just trying to put in context that higher cost of repair that I think you guys mentioned earlier, I mean did we see sort of a step function change, I guess, entering COVID? I know with the higher replacement rates and just the market strength over the past two, three years, a lot of kind of Monday morning quarterbacking on, or was it supply chain, was it people operating units more which probably doesn't make a ton of sense, but all sorts of factors that people are trying to figure out as to why replacement has been better. But is repair just getting a lot more expensive even today before we get to 2025 that this is just kind of the new normal on that front.\nPaul Johnston : If I can take a cut at that. And it's not scientific and we don't have any data yet on being able to answer or that quantifiably. But yes, repair probably is going up. The cost of labor has gone up. And as you know, labor is not included in a warranty calculation. So consumers are being hit with a higher price to do warranty than they were in the past. And then the other side of it is obviously things like refrigerant and some of the commodities that aren't covered by a warranty also are adding to the cost of being able to do a warranty. Warranty is not free in our world. Warranty has a definite cost to it and it also has a timing to it that it takes longer to do a repair or replacement of a compressor than it does to replace the entire system. So there's a lot of very subjective things that go into the repair versus replace that I think we've tried to explain away in the past with some fairly simplistic concepts that now I think we need to dig deeper and find out more detail as far as what really does drive that.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Tommy Moll with Stephens.\nTommy Moll: Good morning. Appreciate you taking the questions. Al, you mentioned that the OEMs moved a little bit later this year on their pricing initiatives. But vis-\u00e0-vis your distributor competitors, are you seeing any emerging signs of price based competition? And if not on a like for like basis, do you think pricing could actually be up again this year across the industry?\nAlbert Nahmad: Tom, it's a very good question and I'm going to go to my two guys, Paul and Barry.\nPaul Johnston : Yes. Regionally and with certain customers, yes, there is still this price competition going on. There always will be price competition existing in our industry among the OEMs and among distribution. I think with the changeover in products and with a lot of the other aspects that we've been talking about, it probably hasn't been as significant as perhaps it's been in the past. But still, it's there. It's always going to be there. It's a very competitive industry.\nAaron Nahmad: Yes. Paul, I mean, one thing that sticks out, and I agree it's regionally and kind of noise, not the signal. But we heard from one of our northern businesses yesterday that they're later in the transition to the M1 product, the new products, that some of the old products are being moved in their region at lower prices. So that'd be an example of kind of a regional, if you will, but a temporary and not material, I think, in the end of the day.\nPaul Johnston : Right. And hopefully transitory.\nAlbert Nahmad: The whole offering of M1 is more expensive than what they're replacing. Right. And that's just new in the market now, beginning this first quarter. Yeah, that would be impact.\nAaron Nahmad: Right. That's the big story. The other stories are just noise, is my point.\nTommy Moll: Right. Maybe to put a finer point on it. Do any of these dynamics feel like they've accelerated or moderated this year in particular, just given that industry wide volumes may be pressured? Or do you still think that net-net across the industry pricing does, in fact move higher through this year?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I hope, it's hard to predict, but we've had a pricing action that takes place now, just starting, and it's more moderate than it has been. But it's hard for us to advise you that we expect no changes in pricing. I just don't think that's something that we have, we would know that comes from the OEM. Paul, anything to add?\nPaul Johnston : Yes, I think I agree with Al completely. I mean until we start seeing normal supply chain, until we start seeing where the weather goes and what the consumer dynamic is, making a prediction like that in April would be a wild guess on our part.\nBarry Logan: Just to add a layer to that. I think this is just important, educationally. We have a store in Miami here that sells more than $50 million of equipment. That's more than a Home Depot sells. Right. We're selling to a couple of thousand customers at different prices. Our pricing to the market, to our customers has variability. It has customization, it has competitive thinking to it. It has technology around it now. And what's really not well known is we're buying from our manufacturers at different prices to match and closely manage margin as we sell products in Miami. And now let's extrapolate that to 90,000 customers and 670 locations. It's a mammoth math and science equation where pricing is that granular across that many markets and customers. So two points to that is there's a lot of fluidity in how we can manage margin, no matter what a local market is doing or how another OEM might be behaving. It's an immense equation that is very fluid. And the good news is, and I'll say it again, third time in this call, there's now technology in place to look at all of that, to manage that, to prosecute that strategy in a way we didn't have it two or three years ago.\nTommy Moll: Appreciate the context. If I could ask one on market share again, just starting from the construct of industry volumes down, let's just say somewhere in the mid-single digits this year, in recent years, you've taken significant share. I presume you'll plan to repeat that again this year. But could that net to Watsco volumes flat or even up on the year, do you think?\nAlbert Nahmad: You mean in units or in dollars?\nTommy Moll: In units.\nAlbert Nahmad: I would certainly hope so. Given it\u2019s always a good shot.\nPaul Johnston : We've never set a goal to not increase market share in a year. That just isn't something that's in the Watsco DNA.\nAlbert Nahmad: I think he's referring to the environment. And we're going to have the environment that grows here. The variables to that are if you get hot weather, it doesn't matter what we want to do, the demand is going to be there because heat creates demand. Hot weather grows demand.\nPaul Johnston : Well, also, I think this year what we're looking at is spicing the market into different segments. Not just looking at market share in split systems, but looking at market share in heat pumps versus straight cool versus the mini splits for the ductless type product. So I think it's going to become a more complicated equation than we've looked at in the past. And it's also going to be probably more important that we're looking at markets here, in the markets that we think have got the longest legs and the longest future. That obviously is the ductless product and the heat pump product.\nTommy Moll: Appreciate the insight, I\u2019ll turn it back.\nAlbert Nahmad: Dimension, right, in terms of share, I think that's correct statement of those products.\nOperator: And our next question here will come from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nMitchell Moore : Hey, guys, good morning. This is Mitch Moore on for Jeff. It seems like the supply chain for residential equipment is pretty close to normal here, but I was just wondering if there's any areas where within resi where lead times are still an issue.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. We're not going to identify it, but we have. We have an issue with the equipment still. And the issues are more serious in different places and different brands. Yes, we still are overcoming shortages of equipment itself. No question about it.\nMitchell Moore : Okay, that's helpful. And then just on inventory, I was wondering maybe what's a realistic source of cash from inventory kind of this year?\nAlbert Nahmad: What would I like? Or what do we think is going to happen? I mentioned before I'd like to get another $200 million out of our inventory and cash flow, but, yes, we'll see what happens. But we're better prepared for that because of the various supply chain as it improves, we improve our churn because equipment that isn't matched right now will be matched, will be freer to sell it. And just our technology has got a lot better so that we can obviously improve the churn. That's what our goal is. So I gave you a number. It's a goal, it's not a projection.\nOperator: Our next question here will come from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan.\nPatrick Baumann: Good morning, Al. How's it going? I hope you feel better.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yes, it's just a cold. Thank you, though.\nPatrick Baumann: Good. I had a quick one, a few, actually. In the press release, you mentioned that unit volumes are adjusting to more conventional run rates. But what was meant by that comment? Maybe that's a Barry question.\nAlbert Nahmad: Barry and Paul. And Patrick, may I suggest that you come visit us. We always want to have you guys come visit. Are you going to, hope you'll be able to do that soon.\nPatrick Baumann: Yes, we are. We'll be coming down there soon. We will.\nAlbert Nahmad: Thank you for that. Okay, guys. Well, answer that.\nBarry Logan: Yes, Patrick, I mean, if you look at 20-30 years of data, the growth rate of the industry is right around 3% unit growth. It's been closer to 7%-8% the last two or three years. And so the comment really is that some adjustment is going on, obviously, the last few quarters. And I think the realignment towards that longer term growth rate is probably what we'll see at some point. And so it's just a reset. It's not meant to tell you what we think unit growth will be short term, but it's part of the reset that obviously has been in the cards now for probably the last year kind of taking place.\nPatrick Baumann: Makes sense. And then switching gears on HVAC products sales. Can you talk through what you're seeing there? The decline in the first quarter was modest, but just kind of curious if you could parse that out a little bit, whether it's volume or price or however you want to talk about it. I know there's a lot of stuff within that subset of sales. Just kind of curious if you could talk about that subset.\nAlbert Nahmad: Patrick, I didn't hear your question.\nPatrick Baumann: Yes. Just want to talk a little bit about HVAC product sales. Not the equipment side, the product subset of sales. So it was down 2% in the quarter. Anything you could talk about, whether it's volume or price or specific product categories. However, you can talk to what's going on in that segment.\nBarry Logan: It's about 1,000 vendors, about 80 different product lines, and anything from duct tape to refrigerant to replacement parts to copper tubing and so on. So no great inference on any one thing. It's a basket where a year ago again, 25% plus, I think, same store sales a year ago. So I think that's just a reality a year later of a very tough comparable.\nAlbert Nahmad: Also, Patrick, remember what we do. We participate in a very stable market. We're not involved that much with new construction. It's about, I don't know, about 10%, maybe as much as 15% sometimes. We're in the business of helping air conditioning and heating continue operating 12- months a year. That's what we support. And that's not going to, it's just nice to be in that sort of the business where it's pretty stable. Sometimes it goes a little faster than others, but it's stable. And with the millions and millions of homes and businesses that are using HVAC products, it's just something that, shall we say, essential. You got to cool homes, you got to heat homes. And that's not going to be that effective with economic trends to a large extent. Now, where we think we can also help is financing if things get too expensive in terms of interest rates and inflation on the product. And so we are focused on helping the consumer with financing that we have designed probably industry leading technology to help the contractor help the consumer with financing these products.\nPatrick Baumann: Understood. Thanks for that color. And then the last one is just on the M&A pipeline. Maybe you could talk about how you guys are feeling about the M&A space these days, seller expectations. Maybe market uncertainty holds that back a bit. I don't know any color you could give on that.\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, I want to say that I think our reputation for our culture is our best selling point. Private equity entered the industry. I don't know the impact of higher rates is going to have on private equity as competitors to make acquisitions. But we're a different kind of a buyer from private equity. We're for the long term, we like building the legacies of people that created a business. We're very unique in that position. And yes, we're always active in M&A. We think of that as a strategic way for us to expand our footprint throughout North America. And I don't think that's are going to change now. Will private equity come and go? We'll see. But doesn\u2019t remember, there are over 1,000 distributors out there. It doesn't mean that we're not going to be active in it. We always will be active in it.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Albert Nahmad for any closing remarks.\nA - Albert Nahmad: Thanks, Joe, for a good job. And thank you all listeners for our interest in our company. And we look forward to having another one of these calls at the end of this quarter. Bye-bye now.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you very much for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "I think, really, the first four months of the year all pretty consistent in a very \u2013 is not volatility, there's not a lot of change. It's been pretty consistent all four months as we start the year. But I would very critically and importantly say that May and June and the rest of the third quarter is where the big seasonal increase is for the quarter. For example, May and June would probably be 80% of the earnings of the quarter. So an early read in April, I'll give you some inference, but it's not representative of what the rest of the season looks like yet. But so far, so good. If I say it more simply. Yes, I mean, it's funny for my 30 year career, it's always been a first quarter question and never a question beyond the first quarter because that's generally the timing of pricing. But I'll take a shot at it, Ryan, because it's been anything but normal the last couple of years. So a year ago, OEMs had near double digit price actions effective January 1. This year they did not. This year, the pricing action is in on March 1 and it's less than double digit. So there's clearly a cost, as to use your term, which is really I wouldn't call it a cost. I would say there's clearly an impact in the short term margin this quarter could be 150 - 200 basis points in the quarter because of that algebra in the equation. And obviously our margins didn't go down by that amount because there is everything we've been saying now for a year about the entrepreneurial culture, the team, the technology, the culture. Working with our OEMs, all the heavy lifting going into the margin and pricing development the last two years, you can see offset some of that short term cost and margin. So that's the difference between short term and long term. In the short term, yes, there's an algebraic impact in the quarter. Long term, the benefits you can see, and you've been seeing it now for the last two or three quarters in a pretty significant way. Hey, Dave. Well, again, I like to look at things over a longer timeline just to tell the story conceptually more than just short term. So the last two years, it's pretty remarkable. I think that headcount is up about 15%. That's 800 people, say $60 million -$70 million in cost added to our network to serve customers, to deal with the environment we're in, to sell more products, to bring more technology, whatever it might be. And it's a remarkable number. And that's part of the investment that we talk about in growing the market, growing the business, the two way street of economics that we've been looking for to grow the business long term. And that's in the numbers. And if I dial into the quarter and be again more surgical about it for example, we saw fixed costs increase this quarter high single digits. And that goes with the people and the investments that are made where variable cost, some of the variable selling costs went down double digits in a quarter. So that's a little bit of what we expected, right? We're not going to shut off investments, we're going to keep investing, some of the variable or transitory costs of what's been going on the last two years if that eases and as those eases, we would expect cost reduction. So everything I've just said is playing out in 673 locations in very different ways. But culturally you can see over the last six months there's a big impact going on in SG&A, not just the quarter. Dave. I think I don't know the answer, but I'll add my editorial to it. There's a commercial element to that discussion probably that's pretty significant. I don't know market share in the commercial applied aftermarket parts business, but I have a feeling it's a pretty complex machine, and my guess is that some of this long term development can come there. And as Paul said, it's been elusive, I think, for all the OEMs in that sector. Sure. Good morning, Jeff. Yes, I mean, first units are down in the quarter. We expected that, the industry expected that. It's mid-single digits in terms of decline. Pricing was up very high single digits, which is just more of a mix benefit this quarter. Again, the OEM pricing came later and we'll actually have some carryover benefit into the second quarter. But this quarter pricing is largely mixed and near double digits. And as far as commercial and that type of thing, commercial is up well into double digit territory, which is probably two and a half years now of trend. And to give you some sense of that, I think if we look out into the season, you still have a lag in the full market converting to the new higher tier systems. You have the northern part of the market catching up to the Sun Belt with new systems at higher prices. The manufacturers will all be asked further pricing actions this year, but as a group, most were effective March 1, which carries into the second third quarter. And what Al is referencing is 2023 has really three things going on that are remarkable too, which is the refrigerant change, the heat pump growth and tax credits and so on that could play a role and influence this. If I add a fourth one that I think is somewhat unique to Watsco, our ductless business, which is a big business for us, it's not centric, so to speak, to the US OEMs, but it's a growing part of the market. There's a lot of growth, a lot of investment, a lot of new territories for us in that market. So I think, all-in-all, once we get past some of this early comparable difficulty that we have, that's Al's frame of mind is we're pretty optimistic about the rest of the year. Yes. Again, we're speaking in basis points here, not percentages, so don't get carried away with it. But, yes, there is a benefit that will flow into the end of the second quarter that can benefit gross profit because of the timing of the price increases. But it's in basis points. I wouldn't get carried away with the analysis. I didn't hear. 28%. Yes. I'm going to stick to what we've said now, about a year ago. What are you looking at for gross margin? We said 27% as a target, as a baseline. Obviously, we've been exceeding that the last six months especially. But, Nigel, I'm going to stick to that just until we can see the real seasonal impact of everything. We're 30%, 40% larger business 90 days from now just out of first seasonality. So let's be conservative and thoughtful, and we'll change our mind when we have more data. Yes, well, first the parts of cost of sales that don't relate to the cost of the product. Like freight in shrinkage, inner branch freight, things that are costs within cost of sales over the last six months again, no great variation as a basis point impact. We would hope at some point actually freight would be a contributor to gross profit, as it's been a higher cost over the last couple of years. But as a trend, those line items have had no impact on what you've seen. And the results the last months, result comes from again, taking 100,000 -200,000 SKUs and going through a pricing margin optimization program. It also goes to the branch level leadership incentivizing them or culturally giving them tools they didn't have two years ago. And it is also, as I said, more generically working with OEMs over the last two or three years. So I think, Josh, that there's not much to report or volatility or one big impact items. It's all been pretty consistent, I think, for the last several quarters now, the only variable that changes has been the level of pricing actions like we're articulating carefully today. And yes, it had a cost, but the other things had a benefit. And to the extent that levels out the OEM pricing actions levels out, the benefits will be there and that's how we look at it. Hope that makes sense. Just to add a layer to that. I think this is just important, educationally. We have a store in Miami here that sells more than $50 million of equipment. That's more than a Home Depot sells. Right. We're selling to a couple of thousand customers at different prices. Our pricing to the market, to our customers has variability. It has customization, it has competitive thinking to it. It has technology around it now. And what's really not well known is we're buying from our manufacturers at different prices to match and closely manage margin as we sell products in Miami. And now let's extrapolate that to 90,000 customers and 670 locations. It's a mammoth math and science equation where pricing is that granular across that many markets and customers. So two points to that is there's a lot of fluidity in how we can manage margin, no matter what a local market is doing or how another OEM might be behaving. It's an immense equation that is very fluid. And the good news is, and I'll say it again, third time in this call, there's now technology in place to look at all of that, to manage that, to prosecute that strategy in a way we didn't have it two or three years ago. Yes, Patrick, I mean, if you look at 20-30 years of data, the growth rate of the industry is right around 3% unit growth. It's been closer to 7%-8% the last two or three years. And so the comment really is that some adjustment is going on, obviously, the last few quarters. And I think the realignment towards that longer term growth rate is probably what we'll see at some point. And so it's just a reset. It's not meant to tell you what we think unit growth will be short term, but it's part of the reset that obviously has been in the cards now for probably the last year kind of taking place. It's about 1,000 vendors, about 80 different product lines, and anything from duct tape to refrigerant to replacement parts to copper tubing and so on. So no great inference on any one thing. It's a basket where a year ago again, 25% plus, I think, same store sales a year ago. So I think that's just a reality a year later of a very tough comparable."

            "content": "Good morning, everyone. I hope you all got to see the space ship Starlink launch few minutes ago, biggest space ship in the history of country or probably in the history of the world. Disclaimer for my error or [inaudible]. In any event, welcome to our first quarter earnings call. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO; and with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Now before we start, the cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws, ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statement. Now Watsco delivered an exceptional first quarter especially in light of last year's impressive first quarter. Last year same store scale sales were up 25% and EPS was up 109%. Let me say that again. This quarter compares to last year and last year's sales were up 25% and earnings per share was up 109%. This quarter sales grew 2% to record $1.55 billion, gross margins up 28.9% reflect our mindset around price and continued progress in our investments and pricing technology to help our leaders in the field optimize margins. You will recall that last year's first quarter gross margins also benefited from OEM pricing actions in response to unprecedented inflation. We are happy with the quarter's result given the reduced level of OEM pricing actions during this first quarter of this year compared to last year. SG&A increased 1%, reflecting early progress with cost containment and gains in operating efficiency that builds on what we achieved, started to achieve last quarter. Operating income was $165 million, operating margins remain in double digits at 10.6% and earnings per sale was $2.83 for the quarter. As per cash flow, this is the time of the year when we build inventory for the upcoming selling season and we are seeing supply chains ease in certain product segments versus last year. I must say not all OEMs are over the supply chain problem yet, but they're improving. Cash flow during the quarter improved $54 million year-over-year despite an unprecedented shift in inventory to new higher cost systems as a result of the change in efficiency standards that took place January 1. We expect further progress in terms of improved inventory terms and cash flow as the year goes on. All-in-all, our balance sheet remains strong with almost no debt. This provides us the flexibility to invest in virtually any opportunity As we continue to build scale in a very fragmented $50 billion plus North American market. We continue to look for acquisitions, as Watsco is a great home for family businesses. We sustain cultures, invest in people, and provide technology to secure and build on their great legacies. That's something we love doing building great legacies of companies that we acquire. Looking beyond the Short term, our press release today provides critical details that support Watsco's long term growth trajectory. We have an immense technology advantage, and we are investing to grow that advantage. These technologies are increasing customer engagement, reducing attrition, creating market share gains, and supporting margin. Watsco's broad array of products and brands is a competitive I should say, a competitive advantage that allows us to serve contractors in most environments. We also have a leading market share position in some bell markets to provide stability and higher growth rates. In addition, there are several important regulatory and industry catalysts for growth that will play out in the next few years. 2023 saw the introduction of federally mandated high efficiency standards for HVAC equipment, which will deliver price benefits in 2023 and beyond. 2025 will also mark the introduction of new refrigerant standards, which historically has made it harder to repair existing systems and favors more demand for replacements. We also see continued movement towards electrification and greater adoption of heat pumps which generally come at higher prices and higher margins. Sales of heat pumps grew 7% in our company during the first quarter, outpacing overall growth rates. Finally, we also expect new Inflation Reduction Act to provide enhanced tax credits and incentives for efficiency upgrades and electrification in the years ahead. All of these catalysts would benefit the industry in the coming years, and we certainly believe our scale, technology and financial strength position us to capture the new market share opportunities. With that let's go on to questions and answers. Well, that's just a few days start, but I'll let Barry provide some -- an answer to that. That's a great accounting question, Mr. Logan. Well, we certainly hope so, but let me have Barry explain that. No, that's news to me. I've never heard that. It's my spring cold. Every spring I have to weather the cold. It's just a simple cold, but thank you for asking. Well, I would say that all the things that you mentioned are positive for us. I don't see anything in front of us other than good things, and we have the scale to take advantage of that. But let's get a little more granular with you, Barry and Paul than anybody else. Rick, if you want to jump in as well. No, we're preparing to when the rule comes in. We are not interested in that. Well, part of it, as I suggested in previous calls, is the supply chain issue is that we would get in a system, just part of one system, and we got the inventory at so we get the rest of the system. And that still lingers. We still have inventory of that sort. It's good inventory eventually would get into the pipeline and into the market. And I do believe we have more inventory at the moment than I'd like to see. But we're going into the season, so it's not a bad problem to have. As I said earlier, some OEMs are still having issues with supply, the product that we need. But it's good inventory, and eventually, I think we'll get it right size and pre turns, and that improves cash flow even beyond where we are today. As you know, our cash flow has performed very well to date. Any commentary from the team? You mean gross margin? Oh, my goodness. It's, of course, we think. Hear a question, go ahead, Barry. I think you said, do you think we'll do 20% or better in the second quarter in gross margin? I think you said that. Oh, 28%, I'm sorry. I didn't hear that right. I want to speculate on that. Barry? I mean \u2013 You brought a good point on trade. Barry, you go ahead and answer that. Tom, it's a very good question and I'm going to go to my two guys, Paul and Barry. The whole offering of M1 is more expensive than what they're replacing. Right. And that's just new in the market now, beginning this first quarter. Yeah, that would be impact. Well, I hope, it's hard to predict, but we've had a pricing action that takes place now, just starting, and it's more moderate than it has been. But it's hard for us to advise you that we expect no changes in pricing. I just don't think that's something that we have, we would know that comes from the OEM. Paul, anything to add? You mean in units or in dollars? I would certainly hope so. Given it's always a good shot. I think he's referring to the environment. And we're going to have the environment that grows here. The variables to that are if you get hot weather, it doesn't matter what we want to do, the demand is going to be there because heat creates demand. Hot weather grows demand. Dimension, right, in terms of share, I think that's correct statement of those products. Yes. We're not going to identify it, but we have. We have an issue with the equipment still. And the issues are more serious in different places and different brands. Yes, we still are overcoming shortages of equipment itself. No question about it. What would I like? Or what do we think is going to happen? I mentioned before I'd like to get another $200 million out of our inventory and cash flow, but, yes, we'll see what happens. But we're better prepared for that because of the various supply chain as it improves, we improve our churn because equipment that isn't matched right now will be matched, will be freer to sell it. And just our technology has got a lot better so that we can obviously improve the churn. That's what our goal is. So I gave you a number. It's a goal, it's not a projection. Yes, it's just a cold. Thank you, though. Barry and Paul. And Patrick, may I suggest that you come visit us. We always want to have you guys come visit. Are you going to, hope you'll be able to do that soon. Thank you for that. Okay, guys. Well, answer that. Patrick, I didn't hear your question. Also, Patrick, remember what we do. We participate in a very stable market. We're not involved that much with new construction. It's about, I don't know, about 10%, maybe as much as 15% sometimes. We're in the business of helping air conditioning and heating continue operating 12- months a year. That's what we support. And that's not going to, it's just nice to be in that sort of the business where it's pretty stable. Sometimes it goes a little faster than others, but it's stable. And with the millions and millions of homes and businesses that are using HVAC products, it's just something that, shall we say, essential. You got to cool homes, you got to heat homes. And that's not going to be that effective with economic trends to a large extent. Now, where we think we can also help is financing if things get too expensive in terms of interest rates and inflation on the product. And so we are focused on helping the consumer with financing that we have designed probably industry leading technology to help the contractor help the consumer with financing these products. Well, I want to say that I think our reputation for our culture is our best selling point. Private equity entered the industry. I don't know the impact of higher rates is going to have on private equity as competitors to make acquisitions. But we're a different kind of a buyer from private equity. We're for the long term, we like building the legacies of people that created a business. We're very unique in that position. And yes, we're always active in M&A. We think of that as a strategic way for us to expand our footprint throughout North America. And I don't think that's are going to change now. Will private equity come and go? We'll see. But doesn't remember, there are over 1,000 distributors out there. It doesn't mean that we're not going to be active in it. We always will be active in it."

            "content": "This is AJ. I'll just add that while year-over-year inventory looks up in dollars, there are inflation. There is inflation in those numbers. And if you look at units, they're actually down. So there are supply chain issues that keep us, if you will, at a higher inventory position than ideal. But it certainly weighs on those numbers. But I agree with what was just said is that here comes a season and we should be in pretty good shape to sell through what we got. Sorry, I was just going to add that, yes, it's true. The price increase came later than usual. It's also more moderate than usual, or at least than last year. And it's only on our equipment business, right? The price increases on all the other thousands of SKUs that we sell have tampered relative to the last two years. Thanks, Barry. Last time, you set us up for 27 last time, Barry, and we did pretty well against that goal, so maybe you should raise the bar. Yes. Paul, I mean, one thing that sticks out, and I agree it's regionally and kind of noise, not the signal. But we heard from one of our northern businesses yesterday that they're later in the transition to the M1 product, the new products, that some of the old products are being moved in their region at lower prices. So that'd be an example of kind of a regional, if you will, but a temporary and not material, I think, in the end of the day. Right. That's the big story. The other stories are just noise, is my point."

            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "I think this OEM is now has been looking for an increase in their aftermarket share and it's something that all OEMs are after. And so, yes, as time goes on, we'll find out how we can motivate the contractor to do more repair parts than they've done in the past. But there's a tradeoff to that, obviously. Do you want replacement units and parts? I don't think the two necessarily go hand in hand. If I can add on to that a little bit the impact of 25C with the tax credits coming in for the high efficiency product really wasn't in our mix in the first quarter. We really didn't see a lot of evidence of, a lot of tailwinds coming from the tax credit. So we're looking forward to that second and third quarter as we start seeing more of that. And then exactly what Barry is saying the sell-through of the existing heat pumps is still going through. And we really haven't seen the benefit of the high efficiency heat pumps have not yet flowed through into the marketplace. So we've got some good upsides that we're looking at for Q2 and Q3. That's not going to impact us until late \u201824. If I can take a cut at that. And it's not scientific and we don't have any data yet on being able to answer or that quantifiably. But yes, repair probably is going up. The cost of labor has gone up. And as you know, labor is not included in a warranty calculation. So consumers are being hit with a higher price to do warranty than they were in the past. And then the other side of it is obviously things like refrigerant and some of the commodities that aren't covered by a warranty also are adding to the cost of being able to do a warranty. Warranty is not free in our world. Warranty has a definite cost to it and it also has a timing to it that it takes longer to do a repair or replacement of a compressor than it does to replace the entire system. So there's a lot of very subjective things that go into the repair versus replace that I think we've tried to explain away in the past with some fairly simplistic concepts that now I think we need to dig deeper and find out more detail as far as what really does drive that. Yes. Regionally and with certain customers, yes, there is still this price competition going on. There always will be price competition existing in our industry among the OEMs and among distribution. I think with the changeover in products and with a lot of the other aspects that we've been talking about, it probably hasn't been as significant as perhaps it's been in the past. But still, it's there. It's always going to be there. It's a very competitive industry. Right. And hopefully transitory. Yes, I think I agree with Al completely. I mean until we start seeing normal supply chain, until we start seeing where the weather goes and what the consumer dynamic is, making a prediction like that in April would be a wild guess on our part. We've never set a goal to not increase market share in a year. That just isn't something that's in the Watsco DNA. Well, also, I think this year what we're looking at is spicing the market into different segments. Not just looking at market share in split systems, but looking at market share in heat pumps versus straight cool versus the mini splits for the ductless type product. So I think it's going to become a more complicated equation than we've looked at in the past. And it's also going to be probably more important that we're looking at markets here, in the markets that we think have got the longest legs and the longest future. That obviously is the ductless product and the heat pump product."

Please note that today's event is being recorded and all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Also, please be aware that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Albert Nahmad, CEO of Watsco. Please go ahead sir.\nAlbert Nahmad: Good morning. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call and this is Albert Nahmad, Chairman and CEO and with me is A.J Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Before we start, our usual cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Watsco produced record sales and net income for the quarter. Our markets have shown signs of stability and the fourth quarter is off to a good start with October sales up mid-single digits driven by meaningful unit growth. Let me say that again. October sales are up mid-single digits and driven by meaningful unit growth. We also believe we have gained share based on industry data and shipment trends. We have also generated record cash flow this year and our balance sheet remains in pristine condition to enable investments in growth. As communicated in our press release, we are in recovery mode with one of our primary OEMs, a fairly large supplier of equipment to us. We are collaborating with them and co-investing to make the needed investments to regain business and add new customers. Moving on, we continue to make investments in the industry's most innovative technology platforms for HVAC contractors. Greater adoption and use of our platforms by a growing number of contractors has helped produce market share gains. Annualized E-Commerce sales now exceed $2.5 billion and our active users continue to grow faster than non-users. OnCall Air, which is Watsco's digital sales platform, continue to expand and generate growth for contractor customers. Thus far in 2024, OnCall Air Contractors presented close to approximately 258,000 households, a 17% increase and generated $1.2 billion of sales for our contractors. That's a 22% increase over last year. We are also leveraging our technology platforms to optimize the launch of the new federally mandated A2L systems beginning in 2025. Historically, regulatory change has been good for our industry and good for our business. In 2023, energy efficiency mandates went into effect, providing contractors the ability to upgrade older systems with higher efficiency systems. The trend to electrification of fossil fuel heating has driven increased sales of heat pump systems which are both sold at higher average unit prices than conventional alternative systems. The growing penetration of ductless HDA systems is also made a catalyst for growth as they provide homeowners and businesses a more energy efficient alternative to conventional assistance. And now the A2L transition is upon us and we look forward to the opportunity. Turning to our balance sheet, we have a strong cash position, no debt to support, and that supports most of our investment we choose to make. Although we have produced record cash flow this year, we are still not satisfied with our inventory turns. We are working with our OEM community and continuously improving our methodology to improve our inventory turns. We have also made progress improving operating efficiency across our network as evidenced by the modest change in SG&A year-over-year. But there is more to do. In summary, we operate in a great industry and in attractive geographical markets. We have a proven entrepreneurial culture that empowers local leaders. We possess the industry's most innovative technology platforms for HVAC contractors. We have leading scale and product diversity, particularly in high growth market. And finally, our balance sheet and access to capital enables future investments in our highly fragmented industry. As always, if you have an interested in learning more, please visit Miami and see us. We are transforming an industry and we enjoy telling you about it. With that, let's now go on to Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. At this time we will take our first question which will come from David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead.\nAlbert Nahmad: Morning, Dave.\nDavid Manthey: Hey Al. Good morning everyone. First question I have to ask is about the hurricanes, particularly Helene, which hit us pretty hard here in Tampa. Could you talk about the negatives and potential unwinding positives you might see from Helene and or Milton?\nAlbert Nahmad: Well, let's see if we can get one of us to tell you at least what he thinks. You want to take that, Paul?\nPaul Johnston: Sure, I can get it started and then somebody else can pick up. But yeah, we had our branches shut down for a couple days for Helene and then we also had them shut down for another couple days with Milton. Most everything is back to normal now and obviously we're seeing an initial rush at least of repair components that are going out the door in October. Milton came through so quickly. It really didn't impact us as severely as the other storm. However, when you get up into the North Carolina, Georgia area, a lot more severe damage was done and we've. Yeah, it slowed us down, but it didn't really impact our sales that dramatically, more or less.\nBarry Logan: Just to add to that, I've said for many years growing up in Florida and being in Watsco for 32 years that hurricanes typically disrupt local markets and may not have an impact on the whole market. And the reverse is true. If there's business opportunity, it's good for those markets and not necessarily material for the, the national scale. I think the most obvious question and thought is that, when they talk about $10 billion, $20 billion, $30 billion of insurance investment that follows these things. A portion of that always is our industry, be it equipment or non-equipment. The materiality of that needs to play out sometime this year or next year obviously, but and that's how I've characterized it, at least over time.\nDavid Manthey: Okay, so. But even though Florida is clearly your biggest market and Helene in particular ripped up the whole coast, you're saying it's fairly immaterial and we shouldn't view the mid-single digit growing up growth in October as just a temporary snapback from storm activity is what you're saying?\nPaul Johnston: Absolutely not. No, it's a -- nothing is that material relative to helium and either disruption in the last week of the quarter or to a benefit for the first part of October, as very indicated, when the insurance kick. The insurance is going to kick in within the Next, let's say 30 to 90 days. So we really don't see equipment sold. What we see is the motors sold, the compressors, that type of. To start with.\nDavid Manthey: Got it. Okay, thanks. Great. Yeah, thanks for that. And then on the gross margin came in a little bit light. I know you had a reason for that here that you discussed with one of your major OEMs, but just medium term you still feel good about 27%.\nA.J. Nahmad: This is A.J I'll jump in. The answer is yes in the short term and the ambition is much higher than that. I think we've talked about publicly. One day we'd like to achieve 30%. So our engines are revved up and we very much have a focus on gross margins and we're investing there and have high expectations.\nBarry Logan: I think in the analysis, Dave, there's obviously the magic words are price and mix and price overall was pretty consistent this quarter. So that's not really a discussion item. Mix is where the variations are so far this year and for this quarter. And the word mix is a broad term really. There's customer mix, there's geographic mix, there's product mix, there's end market mix, there's brand mix, so a little bit of weight in those factors. If I spent 20 minutes explaining to you what I just said, a little bit of weight on margin this quarter. But those are short term conversations. And I think if you consider the A2L transition in front of us, if I look forward, it's really an opportunity to basically re-price and go to market with what will essentially be 60% new products over the next 12 months. So our OEMs who listen to this call, along with all of you, this is a very critical stage where we're making tremendous investments. Inventory is going to completely cycle a year over the next 12 months. And pricing, marketing features and benefits mix, overall mix, is going to be critical over the next 12 months to drive margin. I think one of the messages we tried to convey in the press release and I'll convey now is, and somebody will ask this question is where are we in terms of unit volumes and stability and things like that? And year to date, unit volumes are positive in the quarter, they're overall positive for our selling season. Overall positive and positive. To the extent that it's kind of conventional growth rates in units, I look at a longer term average. So if I try to consider stability as well as the opportunity in front of us, that's where we have some optimism in what we're doing.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning. Yes, sir. And thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to start on some of the co-investment you described in the press release this morning alongside one of your OEM partners. And it's a two part question here. First part is where you did call it out this morning with substantial detail. Did something change since last quarter that prompted the enhanced discussion on this item? And then as you look forward, is there anything you can do to calibrate our expectations about how this ought to progress and ultimately fade? Thank you.\nAlbert Nahmad: Terrific question. Who wants to answer? Paul Barry, A.J. rick. Rick.\nBarry Logan: Didn't mean to leave you out, Rick. Yeah, I think, I mean, I'll go first and just add to it because it's an important point and in our collaborative spirit you'll get Insight into how we look at These discussions internally, I wouldn't say anything critically changed in the third quarter as an isolated event. We felt it's needed to kind of reconcile where we are year to date. A year ago we talked about disruptions and whatever the range of revenue was, $150 million, $200 million of revenue at the time, you have to go back and look at the disclosures. But a year later, the idea of recovering that business, growing volume, growing market share, re-establishing market share. These are markets like Florida, Texas, California that are huge markets, Carolinas as well. And there is a collaboration, there is a co investment. We use that term intentionally in the press release where we work with our OEM partner and try to figure this out. And this is the scorecard year to date, business and unit growth has outpaced overall growth rates for sure for that particular product group it better. And when we talk about pricing, there's more to it than just the price on the product. There's again the mix of those products. And I'm not going to give too much competitive detail in this discussion in answering you. And the other is incentives that we chose to put on the street to not just get somebody back buying more from us, but getting new customers at the same time. In other words, play offense with this opportunity. And that is a shared cost and a shared experience with our OEM. But we thought it was important to go ahead and kind of reconcile that scorecard year to date. And that's what we've done. Now as far as extent, as far as lingering impact, which is the second part of your question, there's some lingering impact, needless to say, in the fourth quarter and that dissipates, I would believe more so next year when again all the new ATL products will come in. And we are kind of truly working on today a complete set of economics for those new products with all of our OEMs. And it's a chance to kind of recalibrate those economics looking forward.\nA.J. Nahmad: Yeah, I'll just stress that our OEM partner here is truly a partner. They're a long time relationship. I think it's a successful partnership now. It has been, it will be. This is absolutely a collaboration with them and it's nice to have such a wonderful partner.\nTommy Moll: Anyone else before we move on here? All right. I also wanted to ask about inventory and any pre buy dynamics we may be seeing. Al, you talked about hoping to improve inventory turns and I did note that inventory dollars were up versus the second quarter, which is atypical. But is some of that just the 410A pre buy that we're seeing. And what's the view there at this point?\nPaul Johnston: Yeah, it is.\nAlbert Nahmad: Yep, go ahead.\nPaul Johnston: Yeah, it is, it is the inventory pre buy on the 410 as each one of the OEMs has come up with a program to at least fill in for the 410 that they have to be able to manufacture and be completed by the end of the year and so some of them have asked if they could move the inventory quickly into our inventory so that we can be ready for at least the first quarter selling the 410A that should taper down at the same time that's tapering down. We're going to be bringing in the A2L inventory. So I don't see much of a fluctuation in the next quarter with our inventory.\nRick Gomez: Yeah, Tommy, I would just add to that, that when we most OEMs have had their last call and those products are starting to get received. And so I think as you look forward to Paul's point about, the next quarter or two, the seasonality around inventory probably looks different over the next quarter or two as we go through this transition. And then it probably picks up its normal seasonal cadence sometime middle of next year once 410 diminishes as a percentage of shipments and sell through. Really. And a 2L becomes just a greater proportion of sales in our balance sheet as well. Makes sense and I appreciate the insight. Thanks all.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ryan Merkle with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkle: Hey everyone. Good morning. Just wanted to ask, on October to start, you said meaningful unit growth improvement and then mid-single digit growth. Can you just clarify, what pricing is? Because my assumption was pricing is still kind of running up maybe 3, 4. So how do we bridge the mid-single digits if volumes are popping back positive?\nBarry Logan: Yeah, I'll cover that. So let's be careful. Let's be careful. I'll give it to you in a spoon fed way because this is like critical data. I'm not going to comment as much on specifics for October other than to say what we've said which is it's, meaningful unit growth. But let's just be analytical about it and then we can talk the business side of it. So for the quarter overall units were up 4% and that includes both ducted products which actually declined 1% and ductless products which were up double digits. So it's a year to date trend. It's probably an 18 month trend where our investments in ductless is paying off very well. Mitsubishi and Gree & Carriers brands and. And other brands that we sell in ductless have been doing very well, both domestic and international. So there's a bit of a story inside of that number. That's our investment, our business units doing well with ductless products. If I stick to. What is more curious, maybe for the group is the ducted product, and we're interested in all of it. But deducted product volumes were down 1% and price was down 1% in ducted products. And again, that has nothing to do with deflation or average selling prices. In terms of, price risk, that is mix. That's what I'm alluding to earlier in the call, where if I look at brand mix, customer mix, and market mix, there's a little bit of a weight in price this quarter. For the year, for year to date, units are up 5% and unitary pricing is up 1%. Induction pricing is up 1%. And that's kind of like makes sense to me because the OEMs launched pricing earlier in the year. I think they've all kind of said about the same thing about it. And this is a year where price has not contributed really anything to the equation. And honestly, I'm quite glad our gross margins kind of look the way they look in the absence of any price. And we know that's going to change.\nRyan Merkle: We know that's going to evolve from here. And I welcome anybody else's color. Okay, well, yeah, that's helpful. That explains it then. And then just back to gross margins. Can we bridge 3Q back to 27%? It sounds like parts and supplies were down, so there's a mix element that's occurring. And then you also, you didn't quantify for the quarter, but this co investment. So just can we get back to 27% or what are the pieces?\nAlbert Nahmad: Go ahead, Rick.\nRick Gomez: Yeah, Ryan, I think you heard AJ Say the answer is yes, and I think there's an upward bias to that over time. But let me try and start with. I think the most important layer of margin, which we haven't talked about and has been consistent is our transactional margin, our invoice margin, which is the most basic form of margin that any distributor can have before you get to mix. And to Barry's point earlier, that transactional margin is constant versus last year in a year where there's been relatively no contribution to price at all in our gross margin. That is a testament to some of the pricing technology that's been deployed and It's a testament to the work that our field leaders are doing on this subject. So then, so what do we bridge if transactional margin is constant and consistent with last year? And it's those four basic elements of mix that we've talked about. It's firstly, a difference in growth rates between equipment and non equipment that will always weigh on your overall margin to some extent. Secondly, within equipment it is a difference in growth rates between residential and commercial. Residential has been in that low single mid, single digit type environment and commercial has been higher. We like that because we have profit dollars to account for that higher growth rate. But it does weigh and influence your overall mix. Thirdly, and particularly in the third quarter, in a seasonal period, you tend to have a little bit more residential new construction than you have add on replacement. Right. It's a time where the builder channel gets a lot of things done and that tends to weigh a little bit. And it has been true that for the last year or two the residential new construction end market has been outpacing add on replacement. You can look at the, the housing completion data to tell you that. And then lastly is this element of customer mix which is, the hardest one to untangle in some ways. But if you just simply segment your customer base, you do see differences in growth rates. And what we see in our data is that larger, more progressive, more tech enabled customer is growing faster than his or her counterpart that is smaller and less sophisticated. So not to write a whole paragraph about it, but those are the three or four elements of mix that explain and help contextualize a year date margin profile that looks different. I go back to where I started, which is the key point in all of this, is that transactional margin, same customer, same product, is very consistent with last year.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jeff Hammond with Keybank Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Hammond: Hey, good morning everyone. Just on the A2L, new product introductions, just what kind of pricing are you seeing relative to kind of this, 10 to 15%. And as you talk with your major OEM partners, just address kind of their readiness, so there's no kind of hiccups as you transition.\nPaul Johnston: Yeah, I can, cover part of that. And that is that, among all of the OEMs that we talk to, everybody is ready. As a matter of fact, one OEM has started their launch in the fourth quarter and we've actually taken equipment in and started selling a 2L. When it comes to the pricing, the pricing has been consistently, in the double digit, low double digit range, it's been around, 8% to 10%, some pricing a little bit higher. But we're going to have to wait until probably the second quarter for that to be adjusted to find out exactly where that price settles. It's an unusual situation for each of the OEMs because it's a total new product line that's going to be offered. And it's an unusual situation also that the consumer is going to have to buy a system now as opposed to in the past when we've sold the 410 product, they could just install the outdoor unit. And now you're not going to be able to do that. Technically, you're supposed to replace the indoor and the outdoor unit both. So it's not just the raising of the price. It's also the idea that we're going to be selling more systems and less single unit replacements once the A2L becomes firmly lodged. And that's going to be spread out over all. 120 million units that are installed out there right now will at some point have to be replaced, all at various times. But it seems to us that it's a wonderful opportunity not only for the price increase, but also for the system.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay, and then just a quick follow on that. Can you just remind us that the multiplier effect, as you do the matched versus the standard, and then just maybe just touch on M&A environment. It seems like, the PE has gotten more crowded in this space. And just what you're seeing in general\nRick Gomez: I can tackle the M&A piece here. I mean, it's. Look, Jeff, there's always more M&A to do. There's no way to predict it or to think about a cadence of it. And I would say that, private equity was a lot more prevalent in the space the last two years. That has subdued a little bit of late. And this is still bigger picture and longer term, a very fragmented industry. And I think what a lot of you all from the outside don't see as it relates to M&A is two things. One is that we're very focused on partnering with the right entrepreneurs. And that's different from consolidating an industry. That cultural element of M&A is very, very important. We want the right entrepreneurs who will embrace our technology, embrace our growth spirit and our equity culture to help transform their business. So it's very much a Cultural discussion oftentimes more so than a financial discussion. And then the second thing that I would point to that, I hope leads to incremental opportunity going forward is today, our technology platform and our M&A discussions are essentially one and the same. You know, we've always had access to capital, we've always had scale, we've always had great vendor relationships, we've always had an equity culture. Those things have been constant for 35 years since we've been in distribution. What's different today and what has been different over the last five years is we've invested in this technology platform that I think now is well better understood, if not well understood out in the market. And it's leading to more and more discussions with long term prospects. So my job is to help lead some of that. And so I can speak to it with some pride. And we want more of it. Absolutely. But I will also point out that as a $7.5 billion company now, we have a whole lot of internal levers at our disposal too, to grow. And we're not dependent on M&A to grow profitably in the future.\nA.J. Nahmad: Rick, this is A.J. i think what you said about these being cultural discussions more than financial discussions is so true. And it runs both ways where it really has to be a good fit for these are often multifamily, I'm sorry, multigenerational family businesses that we're saying, come be part of our multi generational family business and you be you guys with your leadership team and your branding and your customers and your teams, but do it under our umbrella and use all of our resources. And those resources are capital. It's equity to recruit and retain great people and these technologies which are all about helping you grow and helping your customers grow, because that's what we are all about, a long term sustainable growth for the business. And those families and the leaders of those families that have joined our business over the last five, 10 years are really going back forever. They are thriving in that environment, they are happy, they are still running the business, they are motivated and they're growing in many cases faster than our, if you would call legacy businesses, if you will. So it has to be a fit. And when it is a fit, they seem to be home runs, which is what we're going for.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our next question will come from Patrick Baumann with JP. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Baumann: Good morning, Al. How are you? It's hot and humid. Yeah, it's actually warmer up here than it is usually for this time of year. Just wanted to maybe quickly go back to something Barry said on units. I think he said year to date up. Was that a total unit comment or was that. I assume duct did is not up that much. Right. Just maybe clarify that if you could?\nBarry Logan: Yeah, yeah, I should, I should clarify that. So duct did is flat in units year to date and overall is up 5%. Which would suggest that this is up double digits.\nPatrick Baumann: That's helpful.\nBarry Logan: And then just to be like, even more refined, we mentioned this in the press release. If I look at our selling season, so I'm really looking at joint performance of our seasonal business, let's join together second third quarter. So there's no push and pull, aspect to it, to the analysis. So for the season, second third quarter combined ducted units are up 3% and overall up 5%. So when we talk about stability, that's the frame of mind.\nPatrick Baumann: Okay, helpful. And then are you, have you guys been. I think we talked about inventory earlier. You expect it to be stable through the end of the year, is your view. That is the channel restocking currently in terms of inventory?\nPaul Johnston: Yeah, the channel right now is picking up 410 equipment which they'll pick up in November, December and January. And so yes, that it's not restocking. It's. It's kind of a pull forward, if you will, into, it's first quarter sales, fourth quarter shipments. It'll turn into first quarter, second quarter sales.\nA.J. Nahmad: Right, right. Yeah, that I think the industry and included are bringing into our barns for the large part. Bringing into our Barns what we'll sell 410A products will sell through the first quarter. And as that is being sold through, we can't replenish them with the 410A unit. So we'll replenish them with the 8L units.\nPatrick Baumann: Helpful. And then one for you on margin, on the gross margin side, normally there's like a lift, I think from seasonality in the fourth quarter because the mix, which I guess hurt you in the third quarter typically improves somewhat. Is that reasonable to assume this year or are there factors like that, OEM investment collaboration that holds that back in the year end?\nPaul Johnston: I think we should see some lift with the mix. As we get into the colder season, we start seeing more furnaces, more heat pumps, which have obviously higher margins to them and higher volumes. So without knowing what the weather is going to be in the fourth quarter I would say yes.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead\nNigel Coe: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. I think this is meant to be a cold winter according to the pharmaceutical. So if that's true, then it should be a little bit of help for you guys. I know you cut a lot of ground. I don't want to retread ground we've already taken. Just on the gross margin, seems like there was a bit of lapping of price from earlier this year and you talked about mix and, and some OEM support. Is there more discounting going on, especially at the higher tier levels? Is that a factor at all in some of the gross margin pension?\nBarry Logan: I think if you listen to Rick's comments, as a composite, we look at the most important metric, which is does the transactional margin have any material change to it? The answer was no. So I don't think, I'm not saying neutral is exactly what we want, but it means there's not been a risk factor relative to deflation, let's say at really any level of product group. So I think it's more subtle and the mix of it. And I think again, Paul, you have a good insight into this. But the higher tier systems, the 16, 18, 20 plus year systems, really only came into existence in our inventory sometime late last year and has not really been a factor, if you will, in the sales process this year. I think the movement of energy efficiency mandates that happened in last year kind of condensed, the base layer into a much more broad part of our business now.\nAlbert Nahmad: And Paul, maybe you have some perspective.\nPaul Johnston: Yeah, it happens every time we've gone through a change in standards with the federal government and that is there's a compression where a greater percentage of the industry moves towards standard efficiency. And with this last energy efficiency change, they basically increase the efficiency to roughly 15 seers from 14 seer.\nNigel Coe: And so when they did that, we definitely saw a compression where the high efficiency equipment shrunk as far as a meaningful size in the marketplace. Okay, that's helpful. Thanks guys. And then just a couple of quick ones here. Just on the A2L transition, obviously you've been through many of these transitions before. When you compare this to the 10 seer, 13 seer, 22 to 14, do you think the contractors, the end customers, are ready for this transition? And obviously you're very close to those guys. You provide a lot of training, support, etc. Are they ready for this?\nPaul Johnston: I think the consumer is probably not ready for this. They don't really understand what's going to be coming at them. As you indicated earlier, it's going to be a system change out, not just an outdoor change out. And that's going to be a bit of a sticker shock, I think, for some of the consumers once they see what the pricing is going to look like. So it's more than just the 10% price increase. It's also the entire system. The contractors themselves, I think they're going to pretty easily go through the transition. The only real change in the units is going to be on the inside. You're going to have a detector that's going to detect any sort of leak in the refrigerant into the home. And then if it detects that there is a leak, it's going to turn the blower motor off. So it's not going to contaminate all the indoor air.\nNigel Coe: That's the biggest change. Outside of that, the refrigerant itself is going to have a different component in it than the old refrigerant did, but it's still the base component in both refrigerants. The 454 as well as the 32A is still 32A. So it's going to be the same. The same refrigerant that we've had with 410A, basically. Okay.Okay. It sounds like it's not going to be a big deal?\nA.J. Nahmad: Yes. I'll just add that it's our job to help them get ready from a technology perspective, product perspective, from a business and selling perspective from. And then support them with helping them figure out what product they need and getting technical support and et cetera, et cetera. And we do that at a scale and with a technology background that I think is unparalleled in the space and sets us apart.\nNigel Coe: And I think there's a big reason why customers or contractors choose to do business with a lot of companies. Okay. Okay. And then just a quick one, as I may. Obviously great news about October up mid-singles, and I know you said no more details on that, but I've got to say I'm a little bit surprised with the hurricane's impact in Florida and the southeast. I know you've got some extra days selling in October, so is there some benefit from selling days in October offset and some of the hurricane impact, or am I off base there?\nBarry Logan: Yeah, again, Nigel, it's something we track down to dollars and cents in terms of hurricane impact. And we had like the last two or three days of the quarter, and we had, three or four days for Milton this quarter. So I think if we have any pickup, it's been offset by disruption with Milton. And again, in relative terms, not that material of an event. I think with the destruction that is obvious in these markets, there's a business opportunity that will flow once insurance money flows. Nothing is immediate, but the word destruction I'm using purposely because that's what has gone on in those markets, there will be that opportunity once dollars flow.\nA.J. Nahmad: I also just want to report quickly just an important point. We have a lot of employees that we're in the path of these storms and very happy to say that everybody is safe and accounted for and those who have destruction in their homes or problems that we could help with, we are helping to the best of our ability. We care very much about our team members and we're very thankful everybody came out on skate, relatively speaking.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nStephen Tusa: Senor Tusa, how are you? Hey, good morning. Sorry, just to follow up to Pat's question, got a little bit late on the call here. Do you have complete visibility into, all the OEMs pricing for a 2L product at this stage? Is there anybody that's, playing a little more close to the vest than others? Not just your suppliers, but kind of across the industry?\nPaul Johnston: Yeah, we have visibility into every manufacturer's pricing. There's only one or two that right now have not really fully released their pricing. I think it's not that they're trying to be coy or sly about how they release their pricing. I just think that their timing is probably just a little bit off. But for the most part, we've got most of the pricing in. And Steve, is that pricing going to hold throughout this entire transition? That's the question we ask.\nStephen Tusa: Do you think customers are looking at it as a bit of similar to a list price increase? I think Most of the OEMs are pitching it as cost push, which is just inevitable versus hey, here's the new price, and then let the negotiations begin. Or how are most of them looking at it?\nPaul Johnston: I think most of them are very serious about this price, because they are adding costs or adding two new components to the system itself. So due to that, I think that, I think the pricing will probably be closer to the, the 8% to 10% range than the 15, but I think it's going to hold around 10%. That's why it's.\nStephen Tusa: Yeah. So the 8 to 10 is kind of a bit of a discount to what they had previously said.\nPaul Johnston: I think a little bit, but not that much. We'll have to wait and see and find out. Yeah, All I got is opinion right now, you know.\nBarry Logan: Yeah. I want to remind you, I mean, maybe that maybe you're asking that question from an OEM perspective, but from our perspective, if we buy, say, $25 million of one SKU from an OEM, and the price is, quoted to us, we're reselling that $25 million at maybe 1,000 different prices depending on the customer, the market, the end market. You know, there's variations, obviously on our selling price and more ironically, there's variations on our buy price depending on the intended, again, customer or end market. So this is an art form, more so than just strict analysis. And when we allude to technology that's helping us do that and raising margin over the last four or five years, that's where technology has played its role, is in that snowflake management, if you will. We have a much more gifted capability than we had three or four years ago. And in this transition, it's another chance to accomplish the same thing. And if we need to react to a market condition, we have our OEMs react to our cost. So that fluidity is why this is hard to predict. But I can tell you why it's benefited us in the last three or four years.\nStephen Tusa: Right. And I guess your point is that, like, to take 10% or whatever and like, stick it into a model and a spreadsheet, like, it's a lot more complicated than that.\nPaul Johnston: A lot more complicated than that. As Barry alluded to all the variable price, I wish it was as simple as that, but it's not as simple as that because you do have the different market segments and you got originality to the pricing.\nStephen Tusa: Got it. One last one for you. Just on the light commercial side, everybody's had a pretty good 3Q. One of your peers said it's a little bit slower in the fourth quarter. Any signs of weakening there on the back of fundamentals in the next year for, like, commercial?\nPaul Johnston: I think as the availability of the commercial product improved, I think we saw some reduction in some of the pricing. But as far as the demand, the demand has remained fairly strong. We're still up double digit. Yep.\nOperator: Great. All right, thanks, guys. As usual. Thanks for details. All right, guys, and this concludes our question and answer. Session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Albert Naumann for any closing remarks.\nAlbert Nahmad: Once again, it's always good to communicate to all of you. And we hope you'll be here for the next quarter. Numbers and performance. So thank you for your interest in our company. And as we said earlier, it's winter. Why don't you come down to Miami and see us for yourself? Bye. Bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "Just to add to that, I've said for many years growing up in Florida and being in Watsco for 32 years that hurricanes typically disrupt local markets and may not have an impact on the whole market. And the reverse is true. If there's business opportunity, it's good for those markets and not necessarily material for the, the national scale. I think the most obvious question and thought is that, when they talk about $10 billion, $20 billion, $30 billion of insurance investment that follows these things. A portion of that always is our industry, be it equipment or non-equipment. The materiality of that needs to play out sometime this year or next year obviously, but and that's how I've characterized it, at least over time. I think in the analysis, Dave, there's obviously the magic words are price and mix and price overall was pretty consistent this quarter. So that's not really a discussion item. Mix is where the variations are so far this year and for this quarter. And the word mix is a broad term really. There's customer mix, there's geographic mix, there's product mix, there's end market mix, there's brand mix, so a little bit of weight in those factors. If I spent 20 minutes explaining to you what I just said, a little bit of weight on margin this quarter. But those are short term conversations. And I think if you consider the A2L transition in front of us, if I look forward, it's really an opportunity to basically re-price and go to market with what will essentially be 60% new products over the next 12 months. So our OEMs who listen to this call, along with all of you, this is a very critical stage where we're making tremendous investments. Inventory is going to completely cycle a year over the next 12 months. And pricing, marketing features and benefits mix, overall mix, is going to be critical over the next 12 months to drive margin. I think one of the messages we tried to convey in the press release and I'll convey now is, and somebody will ask this question is where are we in terms of unit volumes and stability and things like that? And year to date, unit volumes are positive in the quarter, they're overall positive for our selling season. Overall positive and positive. To the extent that it's kind of conventional growth rates in units, I look at a longer term average. So if I try to consider stability as well as the opportunity in front of us, that's where we have some optimism in what we're doing. Didn't mean to leave you out, Rick. Yeah, I think, I mean, I'll go first and just add to it because it's an important point and in our collaborative spirit you'll get Insight into how we look at These discussions internally, I wouldn't say anything critically changed in the third quarter as an isolated event. We felt it's needed to kind of reconcile where we are year to date. A year ago we talked about disruptions and whatever the range of revenue was, $150 million, $200 million of revenue at the time, you have to go back and look at the disclosures. But a year later, the idea of recovering that business, growing volume, growing market share, re-establishing market share. These are markets like Florida, Texas, California that are huge markets, Carolinas as well. And there is a collaboration, there is a co investment. We use that term intentionally in the press release where we work with our OEM partner and try to figure this out. And this is the scorecard year to date, business and unit growth has outpaced overall growth rates for sure for that particular product group it better. And when we talk about pricing, there's more to it than just the price on the product. There's again the mix of those products. And I'm not going to give too much competitive detail in this discussion in answering you. And the other is incentives that we chose to put on the street to not just get somebody back buying more from us, but getting new customers at the same time. In other words, play offense with this opportunity. And that is a shared cost and a shared experience with our OEM. But we thought it was important to go ahead and kind of reconcile that scorecard year to date. And that's what we've done. Now as far as extent, as far as lingering impact, which is the second part of your question, there's some lingering impact, needless to say, in the fourth quarter and that dissipates, I would believe more so next year when again all the new ATL products will come in. And we are kind of truly working on today a complete set of economics for those new products with all of our OEMs. And it's a chance to kind of recalibrate those economics looking forward. Yeah, I'll cover that. So let's be careful. Let's be careful. I'll give it to you in a spoon fed way because this is like critical data. I'm not going to comment as much on specifics for October other than to say what we've said which is it's, meaningful unit growth. But let's just be analytical about it and then we can talk the business side of it. So for the quarter overall units were up 4% and that includes both ducted products which actually declined 1% and ductless products which were up double digits. So it's a year to date trend. It's probably an 18 month trend where our investments in ductless is paying off very well. Mitsubishi and Gree & Carriers brands and. And other brands that we sell in ductless have been doing very well, both domestic and international. So there's a bit of a story inside of that number. That's our investment, our business units doing well with ductless products. If I stick to. What is more curious, maybe for the group is the ducted product, and we're interested in all of it. But deducted product volumes were down 1% and price was down 1% in ducted products. And again, that has nothing to do with deflation or average selling prices. In terms of, price risk, that is mix. That's what I'm alluding to earlier in the call, where if I look at brand mix, customer mix, and market mix, there's a little bit of a weight in price this quarter. For the year, for year to date, units are up 5% and unitary pricing is up 1%. Induction pricing is up 1%. And that's kind of like makes sense to me because the OEMs launched pricing earlier in the year. I think they've all kind of said about the same thing about it. And this is a year where price has not contributed really anything to the equation. And honestly, I'm quite glad our gross margins kind of look the way they look in the absence of any price. And we know that's going to change. Yeah, yeah, I should, I should clarify that. So duct did is flat in units year to date and overall is up 5%. Which would suggest that this is up double digits. And then just to be like, even more refined, we mentioned this in the press release. If I look at our selling season, so I'm really looking at joint performance of our seasonal business, let's join together second third quarter. So there's no push and pull, aspect to it, to the analysis. So for the season, second third quarter combined ducted units are up 3% and overall up 5%. So when we talk about stability, that's the frame of mind. I think if you listen to Rick's comments, as a composite, we look at the most important metric, which is does the transactional margin have any material change to it? The answer was no. So I don't think, I'm not saying neutral is exactly what we want, but it means there's not been a risk factor relative to deflation, let's say at really any level of product group. So I think it's more subtle and the mix of it. And I think again, Paul, you have a good insight into this. But the higher tier systems, the 16, 18, 20 plus year systems, really only came into existence in our inventory sometime late last year and has not really been a factor, if you will, in the sales process this year. I think the movement of energy efficiency mandates that happened in last year kind of condensed, the base layer into a much more broad part of our business now. Yeah, again, Nigel, it's something we track down to dollars and cents in terms of hurricane impact. And we had like the last two or three days of the quarter, and we had, three or four days for Milton this quarter. So I think if we have any pickup, it's been offset by disruption with Milton. And again, in relative terms, not that material of an event. I think with the destruction that is obvious in these markets, there's a business opportunity that will flow once insurance money flows. Nothing is immediate, but the word destruction I'm using purposely because that's what has gone on in those markets, there will be that opportunity once dollars flow. Yeah. I want to remind you, I mean, maybe that maybe you're asking that question from an OEM perspective, but from our perspective, if we buy, say, $25 million of one SKU from an OEM, and the price is, quoted to us, we're reselling that $25 million at maybe 1,000 different prices depending on the customer, the market, the end market. You know, there's variations, obviously on our selling price and more ironically, there's variations on our buy price depending on the intended, again, customer or end market. So this is an art form, more so than just strict analysis. And when we allude to technology that's helping us do that and raising margin over the last four or five years, that's where technology has played its role, is in that snowflake management, if you will. We have a much more gifted capability than we had three or four years ago. And in this transition, it's another chance to accomplish the same thing. And if we need to react to a market condition, we have our OEMs react to our cost. So that fluidity is why this is hard to predict. But I can tell you why it's benefited us in the last three or four years."

            "content": "Good morning. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call and this is Albert Nahmad, Chairman and CEO and with me is A.J Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. Before we start, our usual cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Watsco produced record sales and net income for the quarter. Our markets have shown signs of stability and the fourth quarter is off to a good start with October sales up mid-single digits driven by meaningful unit growth. Let me say that again. October sales are up mid-single digits and driven by meaningful unit growth. We also believe we have gained share based on industry data and shipment trends. We have also generated record cash flow this year and our balance sheet remains in pristine condition to enable investments in growth. As communicated in our press release, we are in recovery mode with one of our primary OEMs, a fairly large supplier of equipment to us. We are collaborating with them and co-investing to make the needed investments to regain business and add new customers. Moving on, we continue to make investments in the industry's most innovative technology platforms for HVAC contractors. Greater adoption and use of our platforms by a growing number of contractors has helped produce market share gains. Annualized E-Commerce sales now exceed $2.5 billion and our active users continue to grow faster than non-users. OnCall Air, which is Watsco's digital sales platform, continue to expand and generate growth for contractor customers. Thus far in 2024, OnCall Air Contractors presented close to approximately 258,000 households, a 17% increase and generated $1.2 billion of sales for our contractors. That's a 22% increase over last year. We are also leveraging our technology platforms to optimize the launch of the new federally mandated A2L systems beginning in 2025. Historically, regulatory change has been good for our industry and good for our business. In 2023, energy efficiency mandates went into effect, providing contractors the ability to upgrade older systems with higher efficiency systems. The trend to electrification of fossil fuel heating has driven increased sales of heat pump systems which are both sold at higher average unit prices than conventional alternative systems. The growing penetration of ductless HDA systems is also made a catalyst for growth as they provide homeowners and businesses a more energy efficient alternative to conventional assistance. And now the A2L transition is upon us and we look forward to the opportunity. Turning to our balance sheet, we have a strong cash position, no debt to support, and that supports most of our investment we choose to make. Although we have produced record cash flow this year, we are still not satisfied with our inventory turns. We are working with our OEM community and continuously improving our methodology to improve our inventory turns. We have also made progress improving operating efficiency across our network as evidenced by the modest change in SG&A year-over-year. But there is more to do. In summary, we operate in a great industry and in attractive geographical markets. We have a proven entrepreneurial culture that empowers local leaders. We possess the industry's most innovative technology platforms for HVAC contractors. We have leading scale and product diversity, particularly in high growth market. And finally, our balance sheet and access to capital enables future investments in our highly fragmented industry. As always, if you have an interested in learning more, please visit Miami and see us. We are transforming an industry and we enjoy telling you about it. With that, let's now go on to Q&A. Morning, Dave. Well, let's see if we can get one of us to tell you at least what he thinks. You want to take that, Paul? Terrific question. Who wants to answer? Paul Barry, A.J. rick. Rick. Yep, go ahead. Go ahead, Rick. And Paul, maybe you have some perspective. Once again, it's always good to communicate to all of you. And we hope you'll be here for the next quarter. Numbers and performance. So thank you for your interest in our company. And as we said earlier, it's winter. Why don't you come down to Miami and see us for yourself? Bye. Bye."

            "content": "This is A.J I'll jump in. The answer is yes in the short term and the ambition is much higher than that. I think we've talked about publicly. One day we'd like to achieve 30%. So our engines are revved up and we very much have a focus on gross margins and we're investing there and have high expectations. Yeah, I'll just stress that our OEM partner here is truly a partner. They're a long time relationship. I think it's a successful partnership now. It has been, it will be. This is absolutely a collaboration with them and it's nice to have such a wonderful partner. Rick, this is A.J. i think what you said about these being cultural discussions more than financial discussions is so true. And it runs both ways where it really has to be a good fit for these are often multifamily, I'm sorry, multigenerational family businesses that we're saying, come be part of our multi generational family business and you be you guys with your leadership team and your branding and your customers and your teams, but do it under our umbrella and use all of our resources. And those resources are capital. It's equity to recruit and retain great people and these technologies which are all about helping you grow and helping your customers grow, because that's what we are all about, a long term sustainable growth for the business. And those families and the leaders of those families that have joined our business over the last five, 10 years are really going back forever. They are thriving in that environment, they are happy, they are still running the business, they are motivated and they're growing in many cases faster than our, if you would call legacy businesses, if you will. So it has to be a fit. And when it is a fit, they seem to be home runs, which is what we're going for. Right, right. Yeah, that I think the industry and included are bringing into our barns for the large part. Bringing into our Barns what we'll sell 410A products will sell through the first quarter. And as that is being sold through, we can't replenish them with the 410A unit. So we'll replenish them with the 8L units. Yes. I'll just add that it's our job to help them get ready from a technology perspective, product perspective, from a business and selling perspective from. And then support them with helping them figure out what product they need and getting technical support and et cetera, et cetera. And we do that at a scale and with a technology background that I think is unparalleled in the space and sets us apart. I also just want to report quickly just an important point. We have a lot of employees that we're in the path of these storms and very happy to say that everybody is safe and accounted for and those who have destruction in their homes or problems that we could help with, we are helping to the best of our ability. We care very much about our team members and we're very thankful everybody came out on skate, relatively speaking."

            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Sure, I can get it started and then somebody else can pick up. But yeah, we had our branches shut down for a couple days for Helene and then we also had them shut down for another couple days with Milton. Most everything is back to normal now and obviously we're seeing an initial rush at least of repair components that are going out the door in October. Milton came through so quickly. It really didn't impact us as severely as the other storm. However, when you get up into the North Carolina, Georgia area, a lot more severe damage was done and we've. Yeah, it slowed us down, but it didn't really impact our sales that dramatically, more or less. Absolutely not. No, it's a -- nothing is that material relative to helium and either disruption in the last week of the quarter or to a benefit for the first part of October, as very indicated, when the insurance kick. The insurance is going to kick in within the Next, let's say 30 to 90 days. So we really don't see equipment sold. What we see is the motors sold, the compressors, that type of. To start with. Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is, it is the inventory pre buy on the 410 as each one of the OEMs has come up with a program to at least fill in for the 410 that they have to be able to manufacture and be completed by the end of the year and so some of them have asked if they could move the inventory quickly into our inventory so that we can be ready for at least the first quarter selling the 410A that should taper down at the same time that's tapering down. We're going to be bringing in the A2L inventory. So I don't see much of a fluctuation in the next quarter with our inventory. Yeah, I can, cover part of that. And that is that, among all of the OEMs that we talk to, everybody is ready. As a matter of fact, one OEM has started their launch in the fourth quarter and we've actually taken equipment in and started selling a 2L. When it comes to the pricing, the pricing has been consistently, in the double digit, low double digit range, it's been around, 8% to 10%, some pricing a little bit higher. But we're going to have to wait until probably the second quarter for that to be adjusted to find out exactly where that price settles. It's an unusual situation for each of the OEMs because it's a total new product line that's going to be offered. And it's an unusual situation also that the consumer is going to have to buy a system now as opposed to in the past when we've sold the 410 product, they could just install the outdoor unit. And now you're not going to be able to do that. Technically, you're supposed to replace the indoor and the outdoor unit both. So it's not just the raising of the price. It's also the idea that we're going to be selling more systems and less single unit replacements once the A2L becomes firmly lodged. And that's going to be spread out over all. 120 million units that are installed out there right now will at some point have to be replaced, all at various times. But it seems to us that it's a wonderful opportunity not only for the price increase, but also for the system. Yeah, the channel right now is picking up 410 equipment which they'll pick up in November, December and January. And so yes, that it's not restocking. It's. It's kind of a pull forward, if you will, into, it's first quarter sales, fourth quarter shipments. It'll turn into first quarter, second quarter sales. I think we should see some lift with the mix. As we get into the colder season, we start seeing more furnaces, more heat pumps, which have obviously higher margins to them and higher volumes. So without knowing what the weather is going to be in the fourth quarter I would say yes. Yeah, it happens every time we've gone through a change in standards with the federal government and that is there's a compression where a greater percentage of the industry moves towards standard efficiency. And with this last energy efficiency change, they basically increase the efficiency to roughly 15 seers from 14 seer. I think the consumer is probably not ready for this. They don't really understand what's going to be coming at them. As you indicated earlier, it's going to be a system change out, not just an outdoor change out. And that's going to be a bit of a sticker shock, I think, for some of the consumers once they see what the pricing is going to look like. So it's more than just the 10% price increase. It's also the entire system. The contractors themselves, I think they're going to pretty easily go through the transition. The only real change in the units is going to be on the inside. You're going to have a detector that's going to detect any sort of leak in the refrigerant into the home. And then if it detects that there is a leak, it's going to turn the blower motor off. So it's not going to contaminate all the indoor air. Yeah, we have visibility into every manufacturer's pricing. There's only one or two that right now have not really fully released their pricing. I think it's not that they're trying to be coy or sly about how they release their pricing. I just think that their timing is probably just a little bit off. But for the most part, we've got most of the pricing in. And Steve, is that pricing going to hold throughout this entire transition? That's the question we ask. I think most of them are very serious about this price, because they are adding costs or adding two new components to the system itself. So due to that, I think that, I think the pricing will probably be closer to the, the 8% to 10% range than the 15, but I think it's going to hold around 10%. That's why it's. I think a little bit, but not that much. We'll have to wait and see and find out. Yeah, All I got is opinion right now, you know. A lot more complicated than that. As Barry alluded to all the variable price, I wish it was as simple as that, but it's not as simple as that because you do have the different market segments and you got originality to the pricing. I think as the availability of the commercial product improved, I think we saw some reduction in some of the pricing. But as far as the demand, the demand has remained fairly strong. We're still up double digit. Yep."
        },
        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Rick Gomez",
            "content": "Yeah, Tommy, I would just add to that, that when we most OEMs have had their last call and those products are starting to get received. And so I think as you look forward to Paul's point about, the next quarter or two, the seasonality around inventory probably looks different over the next quarter or two as we go through this transition. And then it probably picks up its normal seasonal cadence sometime middle of next year once 410 diminishes as a percentage of shipments and sell through. Really. And a 2L becomes just a greater proportion of sales in our balance sheet as well. Makes sense and I appreciate the insight. Thanks all. Yeah, Ryan, I think you heard AJ Say the answer is yes, and I think there's an upward bias to that over time. But let me try and start with. I think the most important layer of margin, which we haven't talked about and has been consistent is our transactional margin, our invoice margin, which is the most basic form of margin that any distributor can have before you get to mix. And to Barry's point earlier, that transactional margin is constant versus last year in a year where there's been relatively no contribution to price at all in our gross margin. That is a testament to some of the pricing technology that's been deployed and It's a testament to the work that our field leaders are doing on this subject. So then, so what do we bridge if transactional margin is constant and consistent with last year? And it's those four basic elements of mix that we've talked about. It's firstly, a difference in growth rates between equipment and non equipment that will always weigh on your overall margin to some extent. Secondly, within equipment it is a difference in growth rates between residential and commercial. Residential has been in that low single mid, single digit type environment and commercial has been higher. We like that because we have profit dollars to account for that higher growth rate. But it does weigh and influence your overall mix. Thirdly, and particularly in the third quarter, in a seasonal period, you tend to have a little bit more residential new construction than you have add on replacement. Right. It's a time where the builder channel gets a lot of things done and that tends to weigh a little bit. And it has been true that for the last year or two the residential new construction end market has been outpacing add on replacement. You can look at the, the housing completion data to tell you that. And then lastly is this element of customer mix which is, the hardest one to untangle in some ways. But if you just simply segment your customer base, you do see differences in growth rates. And what we see in our data is that larger, more progressive, more tech enabled customer is growing faster than his or her counterpart that is smaller and less sophisticated. So not to write a whole paragraph about it, but those are the three or four elements of mix that explain and help contextualize a year date margin profile that looks different. I go back to where I started, which is the key point in all of this, is that transactional margin, same customer, same product, is very consistent with last year. I can tackle the M&A piece here. I mean, it's. Look, Jeff, there's always more M&A to do. There's no way to predict it or to think about a cadence of it. And I would say that, private equity was a lot more prevalent in the space the last two years. That has subdued a little bit of late. And this is still bigger picture and longer term, a very fragmented industry. And I think what a lot of you all from the outside don't see as it relates to M&A is two things. One is that we're very focused on partnering with the right entrepreneurs. And that's different from consolidating an industry. That cultural element of M&A is very, very important. We want the right entrepreneurs who will embrace our technology, embrace our growth spirit and our equity culture to help transform their business. So it's very much a Cultural discussion oftentimes more so than a financial discussion. And then the second thing that I would point to that, I hope leads to incremental opportunity going forward is today, our technology platform and our M&A discussions are essentially one and the same. You know, we've always had access to capital, we've always had scale, we've always had great vendor relationships, we've always had an equity culture. Those things have been constant for 35 years since we've been in distribution. What's different today and what has been different over the last five years is we've invested in this technology platform that I think now is well better understood, if not well understood out in the market. And it's leading to more and more discussions with long term prospects. So my job is to help lead some of that. And so I can speak to it with some pride. And we want more of it. Absolutely. But I will also point out that as a $7.5 billion company now, we have a whole lot of internal levers at our disposal too, to grow. And we're not dependent on M&A to grow profitably in the future."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.\nAl Nahmad: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO and with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. In this call, I have asked these executives to join in anytime they wish with their thoughts so that all of you can get the views from multiple people in the company. Before we start, I will state our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Watsco delivered another strong quarter. We achieved record sales, reflecting strengths in both residential and commercial markets. Operating efficiency improved during the quarter as evidenced by lower SG&A as a percentage of sales. We generated strong cash flow and our balance sheet remains in pristine condition to enable most any size investment to grow our business. Simply put, Watsco's entrepreneurial culture, which empowers local leaders to make local decisions continue to perform well. Technology continues to have an impact and we are fortunate to have served such a large and growing number of contractors with the industry's most innovative technologies. Greater adoption and use of our platforms by a growing number of contractors has produced growth and market share gains. Annualized e-commerce sales now exceeds $2.5 billion and our active users continue to grow faster than non-users. OnCall Air, Watsco's consumer facing sales platform that helps contractors do business continues to grow and expand. Thus far in 2024, contractors presented quotes to approximately 160,000 households, an 18% increase and generated $743 million of sales for our contractors, a 27% increase over last year. We are actively updating our technology platforms to optimize the launch of new low GWP A2L systems. This presents another important federal regulatory change providing the opportunity for growth in the coming years. Other federal regulatory changes continue to influence growth. Energy efficiency mandates went into effect last year, providing contractors the ability to upgrade older systems with higher efficiency systems. The trend towards electrification of fossil fuel heating has driven increased sales of heat pumps contributing to growth. We are fortunate to be in such a great industry and believe our proven culture, customer focused technologies, scale and access to capital provide unique advantages and opportunities. Finally, as always, if you have interest in earning more, please come to Miami and see us. We are transforming an industry, and we will enjoy telling you about it. With that, let's go on to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Jeffrey Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Hammond: Hey, good morning, guys. What's going on?\nAl Nahmad: Hi, Jeff. Well, it's bright and sunny and happy to hear your voice.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay, great. Can we just talk about the moving pieces in gross margin? I know you're kind of been level setting people around 27%, but looks like it was down 100 basis points year-on-year and I know kind of the price timing with the price increases maybe was going to be supportive in the quarter? Thanks.\nAl Nahmad: Paul or Barry or both, please answer.\nPaul Johnston: Sure. Jeff, good morning. Again, we look at things a little by little in a quarter. I want to just zoom out a bit and look at the first half of the year, you look at the first half of the year at 27% plus, which has been our bogey. We've been asked about this now consistently for 2.5 years and kind of said the same thing and there are -- the moving pieces are more obviously than just the timing or level of an OEM price increase. In fact, the only kind of real price increase that straddled the quarter that's material is the carrier price increase that came in March, helped the first quarter some and obviously came into the second quarter as well, but I just don't want to get too obsessive about short-term discussions when the long-term is working through. Having said that, in the quarter, you can see that our equipment business grew at, I think, a pretty terrific growth rate and our non-equipment business didn't and obviously, there's a big disparity in gross margin in those two families of products. Enough so to account for some of the year-over-year change in margin. Also, mix is a conversation when it comes to price and margin and we're far more complex in that regard than an OEM. Watsco has brand mix. We sell multiple OEMs with multiple brands and I won't discuss how much, but there is a variety of margins we make depending on what brands we sell and growth rates that pertain to those brands that can affect margin. There was some of that in the quarter in terms of mix year-over-year working against margin. It's again in basis points. It's not a big material thing, but it's a component, as I mentioned. We also see less inventory being owned this quarter. That means purchases have been down and replenishment has been down. There's a little bit of a consequential impact year-over-year on rebates and discounts, things like that, that are earned in the period, and I could give you like five more basis point conversations in that mix conversation, but if I again dial it back, look at the big picture year-to-date, where we said we would be, we're never satisfied where we are by the way. We still have certainly more potential and as we've said, long term much higher aspirations than this, and I'll let Paul talk or Rick as well. Rick, you have a lot of insight too.\nAl Nahmad: Rick? There you are. Wait a minute. Rick? I don't know what happened to Rick. Anybody know?\nPaul Johnston: I don't know.\nAl Nahmad: Can you all hear me?\nRick Gomez: Now we can. I guess I was muted on the other end. Sorry about that. Yeah, Jeff, good morning, and just to I think Barry explained it very well. I'll just add two tidbits to it that I think are maybe helpful. First is, for that year-to-date period, we have also seen again just steady commercial strength and that family of products relative to residential also has some mix implication as it relates to gross margin. Second thought I'd share is just, again, if we look ahead a little bit and not backwards, we've got a big product transition coming at the end of the year. Those periods of time are usually good opportunities to evaluate margin and act on opportunities and for us, I think what we're looking forward to is leaning in on some of the technology tools that are now maturing that can be helpful to margin long term as we go about that regulatory transition.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay, great.\nAl Nahmad: Okay. He's satisfied. Let's go.\nJeffrey Hammond: That's a good segue here because I wanted to jump in. It seems like a couple of OEMs have kind of put out last calls for 410A product. Just maybe your updated thoughts on how much 410A you want to exit with and any kind of implications around pre-buys? And then just as you talk to your OEM partners, how are you feeling about the readiness for the A2L transition in new products?\nPaul Johnston: Yes, I think, Jeff, everybody is pretty much ready to go with their A2 products. In fact, we're seeing one manufacturer located in Texas, it's already putting out their A2L product. So I'm not really concerned about a transition here. It's not much of a transition, it's putting in different compressor into the unit and it's also putting in a sensor that senses and smells if there is any leakage and then a switch that basically will turn on and off the system. So there is not a big change in the product. When you get to the 410, how much 410 are we going to carry forward? We put in our final orders now pretty much across the board. We think we're going to have enough product to go perhaps into the first quarter, but probably no further than that.\nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tommy Moll from Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning, Al. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to talk about some of the trends for the residential business. You called out 6% growth inducted units year-over-year. Can you walk us through how the selling season progressed through second quarter and are you able to give us an update on how July paced?\nAl Nahmad: All right. Well, Barry?\nBarry Logan: Yes. Good morning, Tommy. Well, first, I mean, things did progress in terms of stronger growth rates during the quarter and kind of a weird item and just to speak in algebra for a second is we had actually had two more days in April and two less days in June, and in some weird way, I would have rather had been the reverse because our business is much bigger in June than in April. It was probably $20 million a headwind in the quarter, by the way, just to be a trivia -- give you the trivia of that algebra, but if I look at average sales per day during the quarter, it progressed and June certainly was the stronger of the three months. If I look at again average sales per day, certainly north of our overall growth rate for the quarter up into high single digits on a same-store basis. For July, the only thing strange in July is we have our largest market probably in the country and the Texas coast getting influenced by some hurricane activity, some closed stores. If I look past that, there's the same kind of growth rate in July that you see for the quarter, but it's early and it's strange and August is as big as July and so in terms of a trend, I don't want to get happy or sad on July. August is just as big and will be at full all cylinders as we get through the summer, which wasn't the case throughout part of July.\nTommy Moll: Thank you. As a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the OpEx leverage that you showed this quarter. It's been a theme that's come up for some time now and I think you grew same store OpEx at about half the rate of sales, so showed up clearly leveraging that expense line this quarter. What are some of the drivers there that you can unpack for us and how are you feeling about the initiative that's been in place for some time now to continue to drive leverage there? Thank you.\nBarry Logan: I think, yeah, I think first, going back in time, some then I'll do what Rick does, which is go forward in time. I go back in time, in COVID, it was a circus act to get product to get everyone served and SG&A had to be built and incurred to serve businesses and to serve our customers in a difficult environment. So two years later, how do you evaluate that, look back and set expectations or communicate the data to our field to act on it. So I would say beginning last fall, it was a more aggressive campaign to act on SG&A. More actions occurred in the first quarter, and this is the first quarter where I think there's more evidence of everything I've just said with more opportunities and more actions and more results to come and I looked at SG&A right before the call actually. The only thing peculiar, for example, is health care is up $7 million year-to-date. That's the only outlier in the whole list of how we look at it and we improved our benefit plan, we improved our medical plan with intention and there is some bottom line impact to that that reality for our employees, which is a long term perspective. That's the only thing that stands out amongst a long list of things and so I think the teams in the field are have acted, have reacted and have more to do and I think you'll see the results of that and it's all database. None of this is emotion or reactionary. It's all in the numbers and looking at the data.\nA.J. Nahmad: This is A.J. I was going to go to the same place, Barry, where it's intentional. This is a continuous improvement culture that we have at Watsco. When we talk about technology, it's really become a buzzword, but really what it means -- what it also means is looking at processes and systems and opportunities to be more efficient with our time and our people and getting orders processed and filled etc., etc. So, there's certainly been work to continually improve everything we do.\nTommy Moll: Thank you, both. I'll turn it back.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nRyan Merkel: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Can we talk about the other HVAC products, parts and supplies? Why was it a little bit weaker than equipment? Is there anything that stands out?\nPaul Johnston: No, there's nothing I can really think of that was odd or unusual about other. If it was down, it was down a bit, but there really isn't anything in there that was very strange.\nBarry Logan: And then I mean, just to be helpful with something we've talked about in the past and because Ryan, I think it's a good question is, if we say it's 25% of our business, then in the quarter it was a $500 million business, right? And there's probably 60 different product groups, 300 or 400 different vendors. It's a hodgepodge of a variety of stuff, right? We have talked about commodities and we only have really three that we consider commodities that's copper tubing, sheet metal products and refrigerant, and again that component of our revenue is closer to $100 million in the quarter, $100 million, out of the $500 million, and there we have seen stability in price and cost and margin. That's one of those more volatile variables we were seeing a year ago. A year later, it's much more the bandwidth of volatility is much less, but the dollars are less because the pricing is less. So a little bit of headwind still in revenue, but not on margin and not in general business conditions from a materiality point of view.\nRyan Merkel: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then as it relates to product mix, are you seeing the higher share stuff grow? Or are you seeing people trade down to base systems?\nBarry Logan: I think it's certainly trading yes it's basically trending towards the basic product. We've got a minimum efficiency now, which is at a point where, the higher share product really doesn't have as much impact as it used to. So what we're seeing is the industry is tracking at, I would say, close to 90% at the standard efficiency level. So definitely, you're seeing a trend down.\nRyan Merkel: Okay, great. Thank you.\nBarry Logan: I mean, the one trend -- I'll add to that, the one trend that is consistent and consistently good for business, good for the industry is heat pumps. Heat pumps are certainly growing at a faster rate than underlying furnace demand, and that's in our numbers and that's a mixed benefit to selling price, needless to say and also, I would say, high efficiency heat pumps have grown at decent rates relative to the underlying. So the heat pump would I would carve out a little bit in that conversation and say, there are some good trends there.\nRyan Merkel: Thanks Barry.\nBarry Logan: And I think as Rick said, A2L is going to basic \u2013 the A2L products, if you think about it, it's going to replace basically probably 55% of what we sell company wide and it's all new equipment, all new efficiencies, all new opportunities, all new discussions, all new training, all new inventory, but it's a nice chance to kind of refresh the opportunity that's in front and we kind of like those changes because it puts us in a position to do that.\nOperator: The next questioner comes from Brett Linzey from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nBrett Linzey: Hey, guys. This is Peter Casa on for Brett Linzey. I just wanted to ask around inventory levels in 2Q. You guys took them down sequentially and historically I think it tends to increase. Is there anything to read into there or is that more of a function of the build in Q1? And then how would you characterize inventory levels just relative to what you're seeing in the market? Thanks.\nA.J. Nahmad: I'll make a brief statement on that. First of all, we're very focused as we've been saying quarter after quarter on the inventory asset, which is our largest asset and we've been applying a considerable amount of technology and science to it. So we're getting more efficient on inventory turns, and Barry, you can follow that up with whatever you want.\nBarry Logan: Yes. I think, again, it's A.J. mentioned the term continuous improvement and heaven knows after the COVID challenges, inventory remained high even post COVID and inventory turns, if you look at today do the math today versus any historical period, we are looking to improve turns. We obviously must take care of customers in season, and we're doing that as evidenced in the growth rates, but I would say inventory is still a work in process also. It's still a matter of continuous improvement to really get the inventory turns back in the closer to five times instead of today, it's closer to four times. I think that process takes time because of A2L transition coming in front of us. There's another huge transition occurring, but if you talk to us two years from now or three years from now, I would expect inventory turns and to be more historical at closer to five than today, closer to four. I wouldn't read into the there's no science or message in the sequential change. If Inventory was built in the first quarter, that was in order to be in a good position for growth, which occurred and how to react to what's going on for the rest of the year. I wouldn't read into that and there's certainly no message behind it.\nBrett Linzey: Thanks, and then could you just walk through what you're seeing more broadly from the consumer affordability side? Are you guys worried about any sort of pushback or erosion there?\nPaul Johnston: Really when we look at what the prices have gone up over the last, gosh, it's been five years now, that we have seen prices continue to move up. We have expected the consumer to start pushing back on price. We have not seen that as of yet. As we indicated in the release, our residential sales were actually up in units for the quarter, which is a strong indication that the consumers out there and they're still buying the product at the price that we're offering it. Secondly, we are seeing some moderate increase in the repair side, where it's -- we've been seeing high single digit increases in compressors, motors, the type of things that you would repair a unit with, those continue to remain strong. So it's kind of like we have the best of both worlds going right now where we have a consumer that is willing to purchase it at the price that we offer and at the same time, people are repairing.\nBarry Logan: And just to add to that, Paul, I think what we don't talk a lot about, the industry doesn't talk too much about is the ductless side of it, the ductless side of the market. We represent multiple OEMs on the ductless side. Unit growth rates for ductless actually exceeded the ducted product this quarter and year-to-date. That's a solution that contractors are offering more often, they're comfortable offering and that will work in cold climates now where they're all high efficiency, they're all heat pumps and it's both international and domestic. So that is a product that fits somewhere in that conversation of affordability. When you look at the traditional ducted systems versus repair, ductless does fit somewhere in that discussion and we're certainly seeing growth rates in DUC List, and have for some time now.\nOperator: The next question comes from Patrick Baumann from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Baumann: Thanks for taking my call. First question is on the Texas manufacturer that has made the decision to move to A2L, maybe quicker than others. Are you seeing any or do you expect to see any short-term share impacts for the other OEMs that have maintained supply, steady supply of their 410A product? And then if so, what kind of impact would that have in the business?\nA.J. Nahmad: No, I really don't see a big impact in market share coming from that one manufacturer that's introducing their A2L product. I think it's more of an availability issue on their part to be able to provide product that product that is going to be available in 2025. They decided to come out early. They've got a unique design to it and hence they feel that they've got an opportunity to try to step in and at least lead the way on A2L, but I don't see it as a big change in the marketplace as far as share market for them.\nBarry Logan: I'll just add one other note on the clauses of A.J. again. As we had a question earlier about pre-buys, and I want to make sure that it's clear. We're not speculating on pre-buys or how the transition will play out and try to make a special bet. What we're trying to do is have a functional, harmonious and seamless transition to the new brands \u2013 not new brands, new products and we will have new -- I'm sorry, we'll have a year to sell through the old stuff as well. So we expect it to be pretty smooth.\nPatrick Baumann: And what type of initial pricing are you seeing for the new technology versus the current generation or the 410, I'm sorry?\nA.J. Nahmad: We're seeing the 10% increases that were indicated by, I think, every OEM probably a dozen times here in the last year.\nPatrick Baumann: Yes. Okay. Just wanted to check that. And so we take basically so 55% times to 10% is the way to think about your mix impact for next year from selling this new product? Maybe that's a Barry question. I don't know.\nBarry Logan: Yeah, Patrick, the only reality, right, is it's not 100% new product, 0% old. There's a blend that's going to play out into next year too. So it's a blend into next year, if not all of next year. Plus, we have to wait for the Department of Energy still has not pronounced what represents a replacement unit. The current write-up that we've been provided by the government indicates that you can sell a unit, a 410 unit if it's repairing a system. It would be a component and there's a lot of debate in the industry right now about whether or not that will really hold true going forward into 2025. So we really need to wait to find out what the DOV decides, which hopefully will happen soon.\nPatrick Baumann: Yes. No, we're waiting to hear that as well. Okay. And then maybe one quick one for Barry, if I could, on gross margin, normal seasonality or however you want to talk to it through the rest of the year. Is there anything unusual we should think about versus normal seasonality for gross margin for the rest of the year?\nBarry Logan: No, I think we stick to the big picture for the year at the 27% level and third quarter will tell us the progress and I would keep to -- I think we're keeping to the goal and the notion of 27% for the year. The seasonality is what it is over the third and fourth quarter and if you can look at the historical trend of that and make your own assumptions.\nPatrick Baumann: Yeah, makes sense, will do. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Manthey from Baird. Please go ahead.\nDavid Manthey: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. First off, Barry, in the release, you mentioned that ducted residential units average selling price was up about 3%. I was hoping maybe you could zoom out and talk about the overall price mix impact on both equipment as well as other HVAC products in general?\nBarry Logan: Sure. Well, the second part first on other HVAC products, honestly, I don't count how many rolls of duct tape we sold and understand unit versus price on duct tape and there's 80 as I said, there's probably 80 product lines in that, that I'm not sure we have -- I'm sure we have insight. I don't know the insight. What I did comment on, on the commodity side is stability and what had been volatile pricing on commodities has become very stable and so from that perspective, from what I can tell on the HVAC in non-equipment, I don't think there's anything remarkable in pricing units in that equation. On the equipment side, again, when we use the word average selling price, that's a composite of actual price mix and mix can be geographic mix, product mix, brand mix, vendor mix, customer mix. It starts to broaden out into snowflake. So I couldn't give you the components of all that. I can tell you that the OEM pricing actions year-to-date flow through and you don't see much variation in equipment margin for us year-to-date, if you look at the full six months and I would say, so far so good with the pricing actions. I think, as Paul suggested, if we look at mix within brands, within products, within markets, there is a conservatism in the market that I think is there. It still means we're replacing systems and I think it's an extremely important concept that every single Watsco location, all 700 have multiple brands of products, multiple price points and if one market is tighter than another, we have brands to sell and sustain margins, sustain the replacement market. Not all competitors, in fact, very few competitors sell more than one brand and that would include the OEM networks that sell single brands and so we like the diversity, it's helpful to market share, helpful to margin, it's helpful competitively, and it lets us react to what's going on in individual markets in a very, very good way.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Thanks, Barry, and just to clarify your statement on the commodity product, when you say stable, are you referring to it is stable today relative to what it was a month or two ago? Or are you talking about a year-over-year we should be thinking that that's sort of a flatness today?\nBarry Logan: Yes, I would say, if I look at the first quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2024, price margin and really the quality of gross profit is sound this year, where last year, it was highly volatile. It would go up and down quarter to quarter and it's much more stable and I would say in a very narrow range and acceptable margins for those products this year.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. All right and then one more on acquisitions. Is there any update on the Gateway acquisition? And then given the timing of that, I think it was September of 2023, the rollover effect from acquisitions in the third quarter, I'm coming up with about $40 million in revenues. Does that sound right to you?\nRick Gomez: Jeff, it's Rick. I can speak to that a little bit. First, we are more than delighted with how Gateway is doing. It's a terrific team. It's a terrific market. We will be there actually pretty soon to have a powwow with those folks and I would say that they are exceeding expectations up to this point when we look at the numbers relative to what we invested in, what they were doing last year when we made that investment. So very pleased with how that is unfolding. You are in the ballpark as it relates to third quarter contribution and I think September 1st, the anniversary of that. So it'll -- we will lap that here starting in the third quarter.\nDavid Manthey: All right. Thanks, Rick. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, Al. Thanks, everyone. Just you mentioned I know 454B is not a -- sorry is that me or you. Okay. Background noise please. So I know the 454B is not a huge fact, but I think you did mention that there's a handful of distributors out there, so customers out there accepting products. I was just curious kind of what you're seeing in terms of the kind of customer acceptance and whether the price on 454B is sticking? Are you seeing that sort of 10%, 15% uplift on mix? Thanks.\nA.J. Nahmad: Well, it's weirdly to be able to give you any sort of prediction on how the customers are accepting it. We just -- I think we just had our first delivery of 100 units to a particular customer. So we'll find out quickly what the reaction has been. We obviously have done a tremendous amount of training and we'll continue to add to that and add more training to it to make sure that the customer understands what the tools are that they have to have and what the how they're going to install it. There are some variances that will occur, but way too early to be able to really gauge price and acceptance of the product. I have no doubt in my mind that it's going to be accepted.\nNigel Coe: Yeah, it's actually earlier than expected. So sorry for the question, I thought maybe it's a bit more on that. And then you mentioned share gains I'm just curious how the how you view the market in second quarter versus the 4% same-store sales. So just any color there, and then inventory I know you've built a fair amount of inventory in 1Q, you looked that down in 2Q. Normally you'd work up inventory in the second quarter and I suppose the question is really that it feels like this is a year when inventory is moving higher, not lower. So just curious your perspectives on inventory over the back half of the year.\nAl Nahmad: Paul, let me deal with the first parts. I've earlier stated that we're very focused on using our tools to improve inventory turn, and we are succeeding that we have certainly enough inventory to meet demand, and hopefully, the turns will increase and will carry less inventory and still meet demand.\nPaul Johnston: I would say, as we go through the year, I see our inventory actually trailing downwards and continuing to move down as it does because of one seasonality and two because of the transition to the new A2L refrigerants and then we'll probably see in the first quarter, we'll probably see an overlap of inventory where we can have 410 and we're going to have A2L, which perhaps will cause a bump in the inventory, which would be normal anyway just based on the season. So it's going to be an unusual ride I think as we go through this transition to the new product. A lot of the product information that we have right now indicates that it should go smoothly and knock on wood that it does.\nNigel Coe: So, what you're saying loud and clear here is no pre-buy or no material pre buy.\nPaul Johnston: No material pre-buy, no.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Thanks guys.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Al Nahmad for closing remarks.\nAl Nahmad: As always, thank you for your interest in our company. We very much appreciate it and we're very sincere in asking you to come visit. You want to learn more about what we do, especially in the technology field. You're always welcome. All it takes is a phone call and to that end, we look forward to catching up with you in the next quarter. Thanks for your interest and for your support. Bye, bye now.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. [Operator Closing Remarks].",

            "name": "Barry Logan",
            "content": "Yes. Good morning, Tommy. Well, first, I mean, things did progress in terms of stronger growth rates during the quarter and kind of a weird item and just to speak in algebra for a second is we had actually had two more days in April and two less days in June, and in some weird way, I would have rather had been the reverse because our business is much bigger in June than in April. It was probably $20 million a headwind in the quarter, by the way, just to be a trivia -- give you the trivia of that algebra, but if I look at average sales per day during the quarter, it progressed and June certainly was the stronger of the three months. If I look at again average sales per day, certainly north of our overall growth rate for the quarter up into high single digits on a same-store basis. For July, the only thing strange in July is we have our largest market probably in the country and the Texas coast getting influenced by some hurricane activity, some closed stores. If I look past that, there's the same kind of growth rate in July that you see for the quarter, but it's early and it's strange and August is as big as July and so in terms of a trend, I don't want to get happy or sad on July. August is just as big and will be at full all cylinders as we get through the summer, which wasn't the case throughout part of July.

So two years later, how do you evaluate that, look back and set expectations or communicate the data to our field to act on it.

That's one of those more volatile variables we were seeing a year ago. A year later, it's much more the bandwidth of volatility is much less, but the dollars are less because the pricing is less. So a little bit of headwind still in revenue, but not on margin and not in general business conditions from a materiality point of view. I think it's certainly trading yes it's basically trending towards the basic product. We've got a minimum efficiency now, which is at a point where, the higher share product really doesn't have as much impact as it used to. So what we're seeing is the industry is tracking at, I would say, close to 90% at the standard efficiency level. So definitely, you're seeing a trend down. I mean, the one trend -- I'll add to that, the one trend that is consistent and consistently good for business, good for the industry is heat pumps. Heat pumps are certainly growing at a faster rate than underlying furnace demand, and that's in our numbers and that's a mixed benefit to selling price, needless to say and also, I would say, high efficiency heat pumps have grown at decent rates relative to the underlying. So the heat pump would I would carve out a little bit in that conversation and say, there are some good trends there. And I think as Rick said, A2L is going to basic \u2013 the A2L products, if you think about it, it's going to replace basically probably 55% of what we sell company wide and it's all new equipment, all new efficiencies, all new opportunities, all new discussions, all new training, all new inventory, but it's a nice chance to kind of refresh the opportunity that's in front and we kind of like those changes because it puts us in a position to do that. Yes.

In this call, I have asked these executives to join in anytime they wish with their thoughts so that all of you can get the views from multiple people in the company. Before we start, I will state our cautionary statement. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Watsco delivered another strong quarter. We achieved record sales, reflecting strengths in both residential and commercial markets. Operating efficiency improved during the quarter as evidenced by lower SG&A as a percentage of sales. We generated strong cash flow and our balance sheet remains in pristine condition to enable most any size investment to grow our business. Simply put, Watsco's entrepreneurial culture, which empowers local leaders to make local decisions continue to perform well. Technology continues to have an impact and we are fortunate to have served such a large and growing number of contractors with the industry's most innovative technologies. Greater adoption and use of our platforms by a growing number of contractors has produced growth and market share gains. Annualized e-commerce sales now exceeds $2.5 billion and our active users continue to grow faster than non-users. OnCall Air, Watsco's consumer facing sales platform that helps contractors do business continues to grow and expand. Thus far in 2024, contractors presented quotes to approximately 160,000 households, an 18% increase and generated $743 million of sales for our contractors, a 27% increase over last year. We are actively updating our technology platforms to optimize the launch of new low GWP A2L systems. This presents another important federal regulatory change providing the opportunity for growth in the coming years. Other federal regulatory changes continue to influence growth. Energy efficiency mandates went into effect last year, providing contractors the ability to upgrade older systems with higher efficiency systems. The trend towards electrification of fossil fuel heating has driven increased sales of heat pumps contributing to growth. We are fortunate to be in such a great industry and believe our proven culture, customer focused technologies, scale and access to capital provide unique advantages and opportunities. Finally, as always, if you have interest in earning more, please come to Miami and see us. We are transforming an industry, and we will enjoy telling you about it. With that, let's go on to Q&A. Hi, Jeff. Well, it's bright and sunny and happy to hear your voice. Paul or Barry or both, please answer. Rick? There you are. Wait a minute. Rick? I don't know what happened to Rick. Anybody know? Can you all hear me? Okay. He's satisfied. Let's go. All right. Well, Barry? Paul, let me deal with the first parts. I've earlier stated that we're very focused on using our tools to improve inventory turn, and we are succeeding that we have certainly enough inventory to meet demand, and hopefully, the turns will increase and will carry less inventory and still meet demand. As always, thank you for your interest in our company. We very much appreciate it and we're very sincere in asking you to come visit. You want to learn more about what we do, especially in the technology field. You're always welcome. All it takes is a phone call and to that end, we look forward to catching up with you in the next quarter. Thanks for your interest and for your support. Bye, bye now."

            "content": "This is A.J. I was going to go to the same place, Barry, where it's intentional. This is a continuous improvement culture that we have at Watsco. When we talk about technology, it's really become a buzzword, but really what it means -- what it also means is looking at processes and systems and opportunities to be more efficient with our time and our people and getting orders processed and filled etc., etc. So, there's certainly been work to continually improve everything we do. I'll make a brief statement on that. First of all, we're very focused as we've been saying quarter after quarter on the inventory asset, which is our largest asset and we've been applying a considerable amount of technology and science to it. So we're getting more efficient on inventory turns, and Barry, you can follow that up with whatever you want. No, I really don't see a big impact in market share coming from that one manufacturer that's introducing their A2L product. I think it's more of an availability issue on their part to be able to provide product that product that is going to be available in 2025. They decided to come out early. They've got a unique design to it and hence they feel that they've got an opportunity to try to step in and at least lead the way on A2L, but I don't see it as a big change in the marketplace as far as share market for them. We're seeing the 10% increases that were indicated by, I think, every OEM probably a dozen times here in the last year. Well, it's weirdly to be able to give you any sort of prediction on how the customers are accepting it. We just -- I think we just had our first delivery of 100 units to a particular customer. So we'll find out quickly what the reaction has been. We obviously have done a tremendous amount of training and we'll continue to add to that and add more training to it to make sure that the customer understands what the tools are that they have to have and what the how they're going to install it. There are some variances that will occur, but way too early to be able to really gauge price and acceptance of the product. I have no doubt in my mind that it's going to be accepted."

            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Sure. Jeff, good morning. Again, we look at things a little by little in a quarter. I want to just zoom out a bit and look at the first half of the year, you look at the first half of the year at 27% plus, which has been our bogey. We've been asked about this now consistently for 2.5 years and kind of said the same thing and there are -- the moving pieces are more obviously than just the timing or level of an OEM price increase. In fact, the only kind of real price increase that straddled the quarter that's material is the carrier price increase that came in March, helped the first quarter some and obviously came into the second quarter as well, but I just don't want to get too obsessive about short-term discussions when the long-term is working through. Having said that, in the quarter, you can see that our equipment business grew at, I think, a pretty terrific growth rate and our non-equipment business didn't and obviously, there's a big disparity in gross margin in those two families of products. Enough so to account for some of the year-over-year change in margin. Also, mix is a conversation when it comes to price and margin and we're far more complex in that regard than an OEM. Watsco has brand mix. We sell multiple OEMs with multiple brands and I won't discuss how much, but there is a variety of margins we make depending on what brands we sell and growth rates that pertain to those brands that can affect margin. There was some of that in the quarter in terms of mix year-over-year working against margin. It's again in basis points. It's not a big material thing, but it's a component, as I mentioned. We also see less inventory being owned this quarter. That means purchases have been down and replenishment has been down. There's a little bit of a consequential impact year-over-year on rebates and discounts, things like that, that are earned in the period, and I could give you like five more basis point conversations in that mix conversation, but if I again dial it back, look at the big picture year-to-date, where we said we would be, we're never satisfied where we are by the way. We still have certainly more potential and as we've said, long term much higher aspirations than this, and I'll let Paul talk or Rick as well. Rick, you have a lot of insight too. I don't know. Yes, I think, Jeff, everybody is pretty much ready to go with their A2 products. In fact, we're seeing one manufacturer located in Texas, it's already putting out their A2L product. So I'm not really concerned about a transition here. It's not much of a transition, it's putting in different compressor into the unit and it's also putting in a sensor that senses and smells if there is any leakage and then a switch that basically will turn on and off the system. So there is not a big change in the product. When you get to the 410, how much 410 are we going to carry forward? We put in our final orders now pretty much across the board. We think we're going to have enough product to go perhaps into the first quarter, but probably no further than that. No, there's nothing I can really think of that was odd or unusual about other. If it was down, it was down a bit, but there really isn't anything in there that was very strange. Really when we look at what the prices have gone up over the last, gosh, it's been five years now, that we have seen prices continue to move up. We have expected the consumer to start pushing back on price. We have not seen that as of yet. As we indicated in the release, our residential sales were actually up in units for the quarter, which is a strong indication that the consumers out there and they're still buying the product at the price that we're offering it. Secondly, we are seeing some moderate increase in the repair side, where it's -- we've been seeing high single digit increases in compressors, motors, the type of things that you would repair a unit with, those continue to remain strong. So it's kind of like we have the best of both worlds going right now where we have a consumer that is willing to purchase it at the price that we offer and at the same time, people are repairing. I would say, as we go through the year, I see our inventory actually trailing downwards and continuing to move down as it does because of one seasonality and two because of the transition to the new A2L refrigerants and then we'll probably see in the first quarter, we'll probably see an overlap of inventory where we can have 410 and we're going to have A2L, which perhaps will cause a bump in the inventory, which would be normal anyway just based on the season. So it's going to be an unusual ride I think as we go through this transition to the new product. A lot of the product information that we have right now indicates that it should go smoothly and knock on wood that it does. No material pre-buy, no."

            "content": "Now we can. I guess I was muted on the other end. Sorry about that. Yeah, Jeff, good morning, and just to I think Barry explained it very well. I'll just add two tidbits to it that I think are maybe helpful. First is, for that year-to-date period, we have also seen again just steady commercial strength and that family of products relative to residential also has some mix implication as it relates to gross margin. Second thought I'd share is just, again, if we look ahead a little bit and not backwards, we've got a big product transition coming at the end of the year. Those periods of time are usually good opportunities to evaluate margin and act on opportunities and for us, I think what we're looking forward to is leaning in on some of the technology tools that are now maturing that can be helpful to margin long term as we go about that regulatory transition. Jeff, it's Rick. I can speak to that a little bit. First, we are more than delighted with how Gateway is doing. It's a terrific team. It's a terrific market. We will be there actually pretty soon to have a powwow with those folks and I would say that they are exceeding expectations up to this point when we look at the numbers relative to what we invested in, what they were doing last year when we made that investment. So very pleased with how that is unfolding. You are in the ballpark as it relates to third quarter contribution and I think September 1st, the anniversary of that. So it'll -- we will lap that here starting in the third quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Watsco First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the conference over to Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead. \nAlbert Nahmad: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our First Quarter Earnings Call. And this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. And with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. \n Now before we start, I will state our cautionary statement as usual. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. \n Now on to the performance. Watsco delivered good results despite softer market conditions. As a reminder, the first quarter is traditionally the low season for sales in our industry. Although it is early, we are encouraged by the improved sales trends in April ahead of the summer selling season. \n We believe our technology, breadth of brands and products and the expansion of our network have generated market share gains. Our balance sheet strengthened during the quarter through a combination of record cash flow and an equity raise using our ATM program. And once again, we boosted our annual dividends by 10% to $10.80 per share, beginning April of 2024. This year marks Watsco's 50th consecutive year of paying dividends. \n Now commentary highlights on the quarter. Although residential equipment unit demand remains low, our price realization, a richer sales mix of heat pumps as well as high efficiency products and new locations contributed to record sales in the quarter. Commercial end markets experienced growth and our backlog of projects remain healthy. Sales of ductless systems, an increasingly important component of our business grew and offset declines in the conventional ductless residential business. Gross margins performed well and are consistent with our near-term target of 27%, though we believe higher margins are achievable over time. \n Turning to expenses. SG&A increased 2% on an adjusted same-store basis. Variable SG&A expenses were lower for the fourth consecutive quarter, and our teams across Watsco has implemented a number of actions to improve efficiency and reduce SG&A. \n And to that end, we have equipped leaders with the necessary tools and data to improve productivity, and most importantly, of all, we possess an entrepreneurial culture to execute change in [indiscernible] possible way. Since the beginning of last year, we expanded our network through acquisition in 3 -- through acquisitions with 3 terrific businesses joining the Watsco family. Collectively, their aggregate sales are approximately $200 million per year. And more importantly, they expand Watsco's reach into new markets. These businesses will retain their culture, their leadership and teams and uniqueness in the market, which is consistent with our long-term practice of sustaining great legacy and investing to drive additional growth. \n Our industry remains highly fragmented, and we will continue to pursue other great companies to grow scale in our $64 billion North American market. Watsco's technology advantage, industry-leading scale, equity culture and the strength of our balance sheet are all great reasons to join the Watsco family. \n And finally, before getting into Q&A, as always, I want to emphasize that our focus remains on the long term. Our balance sheet is strong, and we stand ready to invest in the right growth opportunity. We have an immense technology advantage, and we are investing to grow that advantage. Watsco's broad array of products and brands is also a competitive advantage that allows us to serve contractors in any environment. And we are also fortunate to operate in an industry that benefits from regulation changes and fundamental catalysts that will play out in the years ahead. \n With that, let's go on to Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nJeffrey Hammond: Well, I'll ask first about this equity raise. Just wondering, why now? And does it signal some kind of imminent M&A coming? Or what's the rationale? \nAlbert Nahmad: Well, it's an opportunity that we had from an institution that has a reputation for being a long-term holder. And we wanted to have them engage with us for the long term because that's their reputation. That's all it is. \nJeffrey Hammond: And then since we were picking up in our channel checks, is repair/replace kind of [ shifting more towards players ], kind of consumers struggle with higher rates, et cetera, and the increased cost. Just wondering what you're seeing on that end? \nAlbert Nahmad: Paul? \nPaul Johnston: Yes, we're really not seeing a lot of repair pickup in the first quarter. And we saw a little bit on the motor side but not on the compressor side. The weather just wasn't there to really institute any real change in the market dynamics right now. \nJeffrey Hammond: Okay. And then just finally, as you mentioned April being better, maybe put a little more context around what you're seeing? \nAlbert Nahmad: I'll let Barry answer that. \nBarry S. Logan: Again, it's been a nice pickup and it's in the -- I would call it, characterize it as the high single-digit range that includes the new branches. I look at things on a same-store basis, it's in the mid-single digits is how I put it and unit growth thus far in the market. \nOperator: The next question is from Tommy Moll with Stephens. \nThomas Moll: So believe it or not, I'm not going to start on gross margin today. I wanted to focus on SG&A. \nAlbert Nahmad: Well, we hope you haven't much of that on gross margins. \nThomas Moll: No, no. But on the SG&A point, I think even if we strip out the $5 million and change of nonrecurring items that you called out, that expense item did grow faster on a same-store basis versus the top line. I know driving leverage there has been a priority over the past year or so. So what can you tell us about what you saw in the first quarter and how you think that might unfold going forward? \nAlbert Nahmad: Mr. Logan? \nBarry S. Logan: Tommy, first, it is the first quarter, and a lot of actions were taken in terms of streamlining the branch and the headcount, and again, the general conditions that leaders went out and did. They tended to take those actions at the beginning of this year as opposed to before the holidays. So that makes common sense. And again, that's part of the mindset, is to start the year with that kind of momentum going on. So much of that played out in February and March, and I would expect the rest of the year -- the remainder of the year to reflect some reductions in some of our major categories. Transportation, freight, logistics were down in the quarter. That's been consistent now for several quarters. On the headcount side, which is the largest of the contributors to SG&A. I think you'll see some results from what was done for the remainder of the year. \nThomas Moll: That's helpful. And I guess a question just on the A2L transition here. What is the state of the union you can offer there in terms of how you're thinking about managing inventory for this year and maybe even into next year, where there will be some portion of the market on the 410A still and then another portion on the A2L. Just what can you tell us about the strategy here? \nAlbert Nahmad: It's a good one for you, Paul. \nPaul Johnston: Okay. Well, it's going to be an interesting time. We're still waiting to hear from the EPA whether or not there's going to be all the sell-through that people anticipate with the all 410A units. Will they be allowed as components? So that's kind of a fly in the ointment right now. Right now, what we're looking at is probably just start incorporating the A2L units, probably third and fourth quarter. We'll probably see some sales pickup in the first and second quarter of 2025. I think it's going to be a phase down, phase up between the 2 product lines. Right now, it's a quite some market as far as when each one of the manufacturers that we represent is going to be introducing their A2L products. \nThomas Moll: And in the midst of all of that, is it fair to say, just from a turns perspective, you may need to run that a little higher than typical as you get into the middle or back half -- middle part of back half of this year? \nPaul Johnston: Yes, it would be contrary to what Mr. Nahmad would like, but some lower turns as we transition from the old 410A over to the new A2L product. We're going to see how much of that we can mitigate, but definitely, there's going to be some uptick in inventory. \nAaron Nahmad: This is A.J. Just if I can add one more piece of color there, speaks to our culture a little bit and being a little more conservative. One thing we will not do, which some other maybe smaller independent distributors may do, is speculate and take huge positions either way on the 410A product or the 454 product. Our job is to meet the market and meet the expectations of our customers. We're not trying to speculate for some short-term giant swing over the others because we are long-term players. \nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. \nJeffrey Sprague: I want to come back to inventory, again, if I could. Just from my historical vantage point, it still looks a touch high in Q1 relative to, I guess, my estimate of full year sales, and maybe that may differ from what you're planning. But anything else going on there. You've got some new distributors, I'm sure, there's a role. It doesn't sound like the 454B stuff is impacting you, but perhaps it is. Just any other color on kind of where your inventories stand today relative to how the year might play out. \nAlbert Nahmad: I'm going to give you... \nPaul Johnston: Go ahead. \nAlbert Nahmad: Paul, I was just going to give a big picture [ in a turned ] view. I agree with you that the inventory may be slightly higher, and we're not going to stop until we achieve the goals that we had said for that. In more detail, Paul, do you want to deal with that? \nPaul Johnston: Yes. It's -- again, a lot of it is pricing that we're seeing in the marketplace. We had a price increase in April -- we had a price increase in February and another one in March from various manufacturers, we have seen copper go up to $4.50 a pound. So we've seen a lot of upward thrust as far as our cost is concerned. As far as the number of units that we have, outdoor units that we have in inventory, that's actually down year-over-year. So we feel like we're managing our inventory. It's a little bit tough out there right now with the price increases. \nAaron Nahmad: And I'll add, there was some, I guess, on the margin opportunistic buying that our business took advantage of. So that, and as a result of a moving out of supply chain, which has been chaotic for the last 3 years in COVID, I believe our business [indiscernible] feel that they are very well prepared for the busy summer going season as far as inventory goes. They've got the right mix of products and they've got a healthy quality of inventory. So the expectation is that as the selling season begins and run its course, we should be well positioned to take care of our customers and [ move ] product. \nBarry S. Logan: Yes. I'll just say that, I think, a year ago in this call, we lamented one of our major vendors and not being at a strong inventory position for the season and lamented about lost sales and so on. And obviously, a year later, the channel for that particular vendor is still then in a very good competitive condition, it grew nicely in their early stage of the year-to-year, and there's a lot more work to do, but that's also an inventory position. If you look at a year-over-year basis, that contributes to some of our current position. \nJeffrey Sprague: And then on just price, OEM price, obviously, on 454B, there's going to be a different price regime. But on kind of like-for-like product, do you see kind of a bias for kind of OEMs to be looking for more than one increase during the year, as you noted, copper is moving up or we've kind of gotten to something like a little bit more normal on kind of like-for-like units in terms of what's going on with OEM price increases? \nPaul Johnston: Well, I mean we're just starting to see the prices roll in from the OEMs on the new A2L products. So I would say we're going to see one price increase on the A2L products. And then I think that's going to be probably it for the year. I'm hoping. \nAaron Nahmad: Yes. And the like-for-like products are going away, right? I mean the 410A products will not be sold to us again next year. \nJeffrey Sprague: And just one other one for me. These kind of Oxbox branded products. Can you just address how significant, if at all, this is to your strategy, in particular, the interest in the channel in these products and how they're selling through. \nPaul Johnston: Well, there's, like every market, there's a good, better, best selection of products out there and Oxbox generally fits the value portion of that market. So that's where I think Trane has got a product positioned right now. We've got a number of other products, such as Payne, some of our ICP products, some of our private label products that compete in that marketplace. And it's a market segment. \nBarry S. Logan: I was going to emphasize that. It's a crowded space, the value segment. There are a lot of brands that are sold in the market. Watsco itself sells probably a half a dozen brands in that segment. And so it's a crowded space, and it is a way for an OEM to diversify its price points in the market. But again, it's a crowded space. \nOperator: The next question is from Dave Manthey with Baird. \nDavid Manthey: First question is on the nonrecurring SG&A, just what was that? And then second, on the 27% gross margin, anything about that, that makes you more or less positive about hitting 27% for the full year? \nAlbert Nahmad: Okay. Barry, you're the numbers guy. \nBarry S. Logan: On the -- first, on the gross profit side, I think we -- I think I chimed in on that probably 2.5 years ago when we said what we thought the long term would look like, and it's held up pretty well. So I'll sustain my opinion and what our capabilities are in the near term and for this year. Obviously, there's always 10, 15 variables and coming up with that, that are subject to change, but I don't think our conviction has changed at all for this year, if that answers your question. \n On the nonrecurring side, we mentioned, all of our stores, all of our leadership across Watsco in a responsible way, reduce headcount in the first quarter. There's obviously some costs incurred in making those decisions, in those reductions. So that would be a component of that, probably the major component of the number. And as far as other things, there's no one item that's taking out, it's probably $4 million or $5 million items that are just in our minds, clearly, something that is behind us and not a recurring item. \nDavid Manthey: Okay. And second, it looks like Florida is now going to accept the IRA funding [ between about ] $346 million. And some of our contacts are saying in different states that, that might start to benefit in maybe the fourth quarter this year or something. Can you give us a read, anything you're seeing in terms of when consumers might start to see that help from the Inflation Reduction Act? \nPaul Johnston: Yes. I think you're correct, in probably the third quarter, fourth quarter, depends on what part of the country. Right now, New York is the one that's been funded. And so we're hoping to see what that -- what sort of impulse that generates so that we can find out what the impact of it's going to be. Then from there, I think it's going to be California, will probably be in second place. So it's going to be a gradual spreading of the wealth throughout the U.S. as this thing rolls forward. So it's going to be interesting to see what the first 2 states lay out before we really jump in and say it's going to be a big deal. \nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. I was going to say something similar, Paul, that it should be a good thing, but how good and when? We don't know. \nPaul Johnston: Yes. But I will say this, [indiscernible] benefit right now in the first quarter, for example. And we'll see how this plays out and the trend in the summer. But at least the first quarter, if I look at heat pump growth versus everything else, it's remarkably better. If that's one of the promises of incentives and so on, we're seeing improved heat pump sales period without necessarily a benefit coming. \n And second is part of the recalibration of all the new products last year was essentially a reinvention of all the higher efficiency products that the industry makes. So 16 SEER, 17 SEER and above, our new products essentially this year. And again, growth rates in that higher mix category grew nicely in the quarter. So those are just good things without a regulatory incentive. I'll accept it as good things. And again, it needs to play out for the full year. And if the incentives can add to that, that's a good thing. But right now, it's been nice to see the mix improving in the early part of the year and could be good for the rest of the year if it continues. \nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. \nRyan Merkel: I wanted to start on gross margin. And I'm curious, if second quarter, we'll see a sequential lift from the first quarter, my thinking is some of the OEM pricing came a little later this year. Is that the right way to think about it? \nAlbert Nahmad: Do you have a fortune ball there, Barry? Who knows? I mean you can take a shot at it, if you wish. \nBarry S. Logan: Yes. Ryan, there are pricing actions that came in later, you're right. And obviously, it's still -- it's a better market, but it's still not a strong market. So we'll always handicap some conservatism just because of what the market is doing. And if I'm wrong, it will be hopefully on the upside of that discussion. So I'm not -- I want to change the tune this early in the season. We'll be conservative about our commentary and the market will educate us over the next 6 months of really what's going on. \nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. And like you said earlier, Barry, there's, I don't know, half a dozen, a dozen different things that make up gross margins. So that's an important one, but it's not alone. \nRyan Merkel: No. That's helpful. And then I wanted to ask about the [ A2L ] pricing. I think you mentioned you're starting to get some of the letters from the OEMs. Just what range are we seeing, I think 10% to 15% is what we've heard? And then the other question I had is, do you expect to get the full list price increase because it's a transition in new equipment because sometimes you don't get full list if it's just a normal increase. I don't know if that's hard to answer, but... \nPaul Johnston: That's really tough. But the initial wins we've gotten in are in the 10% to 15% range. And in fact, they're right in the middle. And so that pretty much held true. I didn't think that would vary. Are we going to see a variance on that price as we move into the season? If we do, it's going to be, like I say, very late this year, early next year before we really see an adjustment to that. I think we're going to have 4 10 units to sell right through. And then we'll start seeing some of the A2L units moving into the marketplace probably in the third quarter, fourth quarter. \nAlbert Nahmad: Yes. But I'll just add quickly. I mean, with our advanced pricing systems, which are relatively new to the company, still, we do expect to capture price increases at a rate -- a more complete rate than previously. \n Does that make sense? \nRyan Merkel: Yes, it does. Yes. Just -- and then just quickly, one of your competitors is forecasting that A2L next year will be 50%, 55% of the market. Does that seem fair to you? \nPaul Johnston: Boy, it'd be great if it would. I don't think anybody's got a crystal ball that's going to allow them to see exactly what the impact of the A2L product is going to be next year. I would say it would be somewhere between 50% and 60%. \nAlbert Nahmad: It's a positive move. All these are major moves that are positive, which is a little difficult to summarize on the timing of it all. That long term, it's all good. \nOperator: The next question is from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. \nPatrick Baumann: A couple of quick ones. The -- what you saw in the quarter in terms of the HVAC equipment sales being down 1% on a same-store basis? Any way to give us more color on the residential [indiscernible] unit lines versus the average selling prices year-over-year in the quarter? \nRick Gomez: Yes, Patrick, this is Rick. On the residential side, we saw unit declines of mid-single digits, and that mirrors sort of what's -- what's happening with broader industry trends and sell into the channel. Actually, I think we're outperforming that trend a little bit. And price was positive, not hugely positive but it was positive. And commercial continues to do better than residential. The backlog there is still very healthy and a lot of strength in Latin America to support that. So that's the color we would give. \nBarry S. Logan: We provided a little bit of data on top of this. So I'd just be helpful. So kind of the unitary product, [indiscernible] product, that is the OEM -- U.S. OEM type product, price and mix, that was up around 3% for the quarter. I used the word mix, price and mix purposely at. And as we've said, routinely now those pricing actions happen ultimately later in the quarter as opposed to early. So it gives you some read of it. Our ductless products, which is part of our unit [ dispossession ], pricing there is a bit more flat. But in that case, our largest vendor this year decided to have April 1 pricing actions. So that kind of makes sense. And on commercial, as Rick said, it's outperformed, it grew in the quarter end, is in a steady state, I think at this point of, call it, mid-single-digit growth. \nPatrick Baumann: And the comment on resi -- I mean, I'm sorry, on units trending up in April, that applies to resi as well? \nBarry S. Logan: Yes. That's only resi when I say that. \nPatrick Baumann: Yes. Okay. And then I know HVAC product, there's a bunch of different things going on in that subsegment. Is there any color you can give on the sales decline you saw in the quarter? Was it volumes or price or maybe color on like what you're seeing in commodity products like refrigerants? \nBarry S. Logan: Sure. I can give the color. It's probably our third quarter where we've had essentially commodity deflation going on an average selling price just being simply a headwind during a quarter. And when we use the word commodities, that's refrigerant, copper tubing and sheet metal products as a category, it's around between 5% and 6% of Watsco's total sales to give the context but it does have a bigger imputation of reality in that non-equipment products category. \n The good news is that margins and pricing have stabilized. The good news is copper is increasing in price and the better news is that we're kind of getting through this year-over-year cycle and expect less impact if, in fact, no impact and perhaps even positive impact as we get into the rest of this year. So this seems to be end of the line with some of that discussion. I'm hoping so and expect so based on kind of what we're seeing as we look into the spring, the spring time here. \nPatrick Baumann: Super helpful. And then last one for me, just on the same-store SG&A side. I think last time we talked, you were thinking maybe down slightly for the year. Is that still a reasonable expectation on a same-store basis? \nBarry S. Logan: Well, it's a good aspiration and goal and it's not [indiscernible]. That's not how we manage Watsco. We manage it through our leadership, if they want to find investments or do something that's important for a market or a customer, they'll do it. But I think from a mindset, from a cultural point of view, it's what we've been after. But again, carrying that out in the market, if there's sales generation going on to the extent that there is today, let's say, variable costs are going to increase, and we'll probably violate that concept of [indiscernible], which is not a bad thing. We have variable expenses would drive -- would grow along with sales growth. So it's early days. I'm glad that there's growth going on. Time will tell. There is some noise in the first quarter SG&A that we've quantified to an extent and I would expect better performance as the year goes on. \nOperator: The next question is from Damian Karas with UBS. \nDamian Karas: So I'd say really encouraging to hear about the pickup in demand you're seeing in April. You mentioned, I think, mid-single-digit same-store sales growth. Do you have to have be comparable for last year in April, like what the same-store sales growth was in April 2023? And could you just remind us kind of like in the second quarter, what the -- like what the seasonal [ shaping ] looks like, April, May, June? \nAlbert Nahmad: That's a lot of forecasting and which we don't like to engage with because of the nature of the industry. I don't know if anybody wants to take a shot from Watsco side. \nAaron Nahmad: [indiscernible] breakout months. Yes. I don't think we break out..... \nAlbert Nahmad: We're not going to do that. \nDamian Karas: Okay. The comp from last year for April, though you don't happen to have that? \nAlbert Nahmad: The what? \nPaul Johnston: We have it but it [indiscernible]. \nAlbert Nahmad: We're just not [indiscernible]. \nDamian Karas: Okay. Fair enough, totally understand. Well, maybe I could just ask you about -- so you guys have put your pricing through. I think, from your OEMs, March and April. One thing that we've heard is that maybe some of the contractors are struggling to pass on some of the price increases. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on whether you agree with that? You just kind of experience that in your customer base? And if so, is that pretty much just kind of a short-term demand-related issue right now and if someone is going to end up resolving that? Or is that maybe kind of a cumulative byproduct of just like all of the inflation that [indiscernible] in wages over the last few years? \nAlbert Nahmad: I mean that is [indiscernible] question with looking in the future, and I don't think we have even a need to respond to that because things will have to happen as they happen. So I'll pass -- we're going to pass on the question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is a follow-up from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. \nJeffrey Sprague: Just sort of a follow-up, I don't know, maybe at Ryan with Damian's question there. But Al, you said a couple of times, you hope not to see any more price increases this year. So I'm wondering if that is an indication that you're seeing some stress out there in terms of the ability to just handle this stuff? You noted that the repair versus replace dynamics have not eroded, but is this something that's just kind of on your radar screen as a watch item? Or are you seeing some maybe early signs that maybe that is happening? \nAlbert Nahmad: No. I mean it's -- the market does what the market does. I mean, what's happening, is the market pricing has gone up. And now we're waiting for the A2L pricing to come in. That was the only insinuation that we have there. \nBarry S. Logan: I've got to chime in on this because it's an important like backbone to what we've talked about already. And I want to emphasize it. First, if we said earlier that higher-priced heat pumps are outperforming everything else, that's a statement about what's going on in the market with contractors installing higher-priced systems, right? Secondly, as I've said in the call that the mix of higher efficiency is also increasing remarkably, that too is an early stage -- at least an early stage indicator of what's going on in the market. And again, I'd rather do October and report on how it went. [indiscernible] the early signs of what's going on.\n Third of all -- and third of all, we -- no one ever asks, ever, about credit quality, about what's going on with our contractor. It's never a question. It's remarkable to me. And so I feel like I have to talk about it or bring it up. If you look at the bad debt expense for the quarter versus a year ago, it's less and overall credit quality and how our contractors are behaving with us when they pay us $7 billion or more a year is very healthy. So that's an April view. It's not an October view. But I really -- I don't look at this as like a binary thing of on or off. It's the subtlety of what's going on in the market, obviously. \n And the contractors, at the end of the day, are going to do the best job they can to get the job, if they have to discount their services or go to a lower brand or go to a product that they need. I know we're going to have it. There's not a location in Watsco that doesn't have multiple brands in it to serve that local market. And we have very few competitors who do have the same variety of brands across markets. So in a softer market or a trickier market, I like our competitive position even more if I kind of round out the conversation. \nAaron Nahmad: I just have to -- I love your answer there, Barry, and I'll build on it. I love our competitive position on the whole. And we talked about -- we have high-quality inventory deployed in the field. We've got best-in-class technology that our competitors can't match. We've got a balance sheet that's strong and ready to invest in any size opportunity. We've got, like Barry said, we've got every product that a contractor could need. I just think that we're very well positioned here in the market and expect a good year and expect a good tenure. \nOperator: The next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: Sorry, I was late joining. So I apologize if you've addressed this already. But on the ATM drawdown, I'd be really curious on the timing of that, Al. You obviously got the cash [indiscernible], et cetera, but why do that in March, unless you got a line of sight on kind of options out there? But issue is in the timing and I've got a follow-up question as well, please. \nAlbert Nahmad: I'm sorry, why do what in March? \nNigel Coe: The ATM draw. The [indiscernible]? \nAlbert Nahmad: As I said earlier, we didn't do it. Somebody wanted it. And the opportunity came up, we took it because of the -- who we believe the holder is, would be, if we supplied him the shares, and we believe he's a high-quality holder, long-term holder. We wanted to meet what he wanted at that time. We did that. \nNigel Coe: Okay. That's fair. And then on the opportunity set out there to deploy the capital, and I'm sure you're not in a rush or anything, but I'd be curious, the [indiscernible] you have to take in full control of [indiscernible] or maybe taking up some of the [indiscernible] within the current prices. I mean are there any sort of big opportunities out there you see to deploy that capital? \nAlbert Nahmad: If we did, we would tell you. \nNigel Coe: Okay. So you just keep the cash [indiscernible]? \nAlbert Nahmad: Sorry? \nNigel Coe: You will keep the cash? \nAlbert Nahmad: What would you like for us to? Of course, we're going to keep it. What would you like me to do?\n I don't understand the question. We told you we do -- we took it because we had the opportunity to bring in a significant important investor. We do not -- we have a long-term goal of expansion in this program, so the capital will be very useful. \nOperator: The next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: I just wanted to follow up on Pat's question, and I was on another call, so I wanted to join and say hi, first and foremost. So just on this -- these pricing dynamics and mix, I mean, would you -- do you expect pricing to obviously accelerate over the course of the year given the timing of the [ increase ]? I mean, I thought the Carrier increase was like early March, not exactly April 1. So maybe just some color on how you would expect that to play out. \nPaul Johnston: The March increase we had from Carrier was on the 410A equipment. And then subsequent to that, we've also received pricing on what they're going to be -- what we're going to see on the new A2L products. But we have not received any of the A2L products yet. No. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Got it. And you will be taking those -- like at what point do you expect to be kind of filling those products in the warehouses? \nPaul Johnston: We're [indiscernible],  depend on what the operating units will do, it would probably be third quarter, fourth quarter before we see any significant amount of A2L product. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Got it. Okay. And then just on this inventory question. I mean, I guess there's a bunch of ways you can really cut it. I mean, do you think your inventories are now normal or you took on a little bit extra ahead of the prebuy, they're lean? How would you kind of characterize your inventories now relative to demand? \nPaul Johnston: We're a little bit ahead, don't you? I think we're a little bit ahead of inventory right now. We've got some prebuys that came in on the 410A products, and we also had some additional products that we purchased. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then just one last one, just on -- from an end market demand perspective and putting weather aside, are you seeing anything on repair versus replace, any kind of change up there? \nPaul Johnston: Nope. Not yet. Too early. There just hasn't been any -- if you put weather aside, there is nothing. \nOperator: The next question is Chris Dankert with Loop Capital. \nChristopher Dankert: Just one quick question for you here, I guess. Explicit technology spending in the quarter. Is that still kind of running at about a [ 14 ] run rate? And is there anything that you'd kind of be teasing us with or anything explicit worth highlighting in the quarter on the technology side beyond on-call air or just anything else on that technology front? \nAlbert Nahmad: I didn't understand the question. Did you, A.J.? \nAaron Nahmad: Are there new things to talk about on the technology side? Is that the question? \nChristopher Dankert: Just the spending run rate and then is there anything new you're introducing or I would call out here? \nAlbert Nahmad: Well, when we're going to introduce it, we'll introduce it. We're not going to -- I mean, we're constantly introducing new ideas. \nBarry S. Logan: As far as the pure SG&A, that's your question, there's not much change in the technology spend this quarter sequentially from last quarter. If that's your question. \nChristopher Dankert: It was. \nAaron Nahmad: You can expect us to keep innovating on the technology side, though, for sure. \nOperator: The next question is from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. \nStephen Volkmann: Barry, I wanted to ask you about credit quality, if that's okay? All seriousness aside, I was curious, I know that you -- I'm grateful for that commentary, but I know you guys also do sort of some origination, I don't know, brokering, how you want to think about it for the end customer financing as well. I think that's available through some of your platforms. And I'm curious if you have visibility into how that credit quality looks? \nAlbert Nahmad: Well, we don't hold. Yes. Go ahead, A.J. \nAaron Nahmad: So it's not origination, it's really matchmaking between our customers and their -- largely our customers' customers and financing sources, do a small amount of that, and it's pretty stable, I would say. But we do not -- once we make that matchmaking, we are out of the picture and don't have visibility, frankly, into the performance of those loans. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Al Nahmad for his closing remarks. \nAlbert Nahmad: Once again, thanks very much for your interest in our company. We look forward to conversing with you as time goes on. Bye. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Albert Nahmad",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our First Quarter Earnings Call. And this is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. And with me is A.J. Nahmad, President; Paul Johnston, Barry Logan and Rick Gomez. \n Now before we start, I will state our cautionary statement as usual. This conference call has forward-looking statements as defined by SEC laws and regulations that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of these various laws. Ultimate results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements. \n Now on to the performance. Watsco delivered good results despite softer market conditions. As a reminder, the first quarter is traditionally the low season for sales in our industry. Although it is early, we are encouraged by the improved sales trends in April ahead of the summer selling season. \n We believe our technology, breadth of brands and products and the expansion of our network have generated market share gains. Our balance sheet strengthened during the quarter through a combination of record cash flow and an equity raise using our ATM program. And once again, we boosted our annual dividends by 10% to $10.80 per share, beginning April of 2024. This year marks Watsco's 50th consecutive year of paying dividends. \n Now commentary highlights on the quarter. Although residential equipment unit demand remains low, our price realization, a richer sales mix of heat pumps as well as high efficiency products and new locations contributed to record sales in the quarter. Commercial end markets experienced growth and our backlog of projects remain healthy. Sales of ductless systems, an increasingly important component of our business grew and offset declines in the conventional ductless residential business. Gross margins performed well and are consistent with our near-term target of 27%, though we believe higher margins are achievable over time. \n Turning to expenses. SG&A increased 2% on an adjusted same-store basis. Variable SG&A expenses were lower for the fourth consecutive quarter, and our teams across Watsco has implemented a number of actions to improve efficiency and reduce SG&A. \n And to that end, we have equipped leaders with the necessary tools and data to improve productivity, and most importantly, of all, we possess an entrepreneurial culture to execute change in [indiscernible] possible way. Since the beginning of last year, we expanded our network through acquisition in 3 -- through acquisitions with 3 terrific businesses joining the Watsco family. Collectively, their aggregate sales are approximately $200 million per year. And more importantly, they expand Watsco's reach into new markets. These businesses will retain their culture, their leadership and teams and uniqueness in the market, which is consistent with our long-term practice of sustaining great legacy and investing to drive additional growth. \n Our industry remains highly fragmented, and we will continue to pursue other great companies to grow scale in our $64 billion North American market. Watsco's technology advantage, industry-leading scale, equity culture and the strength of our balance sheet are all great reasons to join the Watsco family. \n And finally, before getting into Q&A, as always, I want to emphasize that our focus remains on the long term. Our balance sheet is strong, and we stand ready to invest in the right growth opportunity. We have an immense technology advantage, and we are investing to grow that advantage. Watsco's broad array of products and brands is also a competitive advantage that allows us to serve contractors in any environment. And we are also fortunate to operate in an industry that benefits from regulation changes and fundamental catalysts that will play out in the years ahead. \n With that, let's go on to Q&A. Well, it's an opportunity that we had from an institution that has a reputation for being a long-term holder. And we wanted to have them engage with us for the long term because that's their reputation. That's all it is. Paul? I'll let Barry answer that. Well, we hope you haven't much of that on gross margins. Mr. Logan? It's a good one for you, Paul. I'm going to give you... Paul, I was just going to give a big picture [ in a turned ] view. I agree with you that the inventory may be slightly higher, and we're not going to stop until we achieve the goals that we had said for that. In more detail, Paul, do you want to deal with that? Okay. Barry, you're the numbers guy. Yes. I was going to say something similar, Paul, that it should be a good thing, but how good and when? We don't know. Do you have a fortune ball there, Barry? Who knows? I mean you can take a shot at it, if you wish. Yes. And like you said earlier, Barry, there's, I don't know, half a dozen, a dozen different things that make up gross margins. So that's an important one, but it's not alone. Yes. But I'll just add quickly. I mean, with our advanced pricing systems, which are relatively new to the company, still, we do expect to capture price increases at a rate -- a more complete rate than previously. \n Does that make sense? It's a positive move. All these are major moves that are positive, which is a little difficult to summarize on the timing of it all. That long term, it's all good. That's a lot of forecasting and which we don't like to engage with because of the nature of the industry. I don't know if anybody wants to take a shot from Watsco side. We're not going to do that. The what? We're just not [indiscernible]. I mean that is [indiscernible] question with looking in the future, and I don't think we have even a need to respond to that because things will have to happen as they happen. So I'll pass -- we're going to pass on the question. No. I mean it's -- the market does what the market does. I mean, what's happening, is the market pricing has gone up. And now we're waiting for the A2L pricing to come in. That was the only insinuation that we have there. I'm sorry, why do what in March? As I said earlier, we didn't do it. Somebody wanted it. And the opportunity came up, we took it because of the -- who we believe the holder is, would be, if we supplied him the shares, and we believe he's a high-quality holder, long-term holder. We wanted to meet what he wanted at that time. We did that. If we did, we would tell you. Sorry? What would you like for us to? Of course, we're going to keep it. What would you like me to do?\n I don't understand the question. We told you we do -- we took it because we had the opportunity to bring in a significant important investor. We do not -- we have a long-term goal of expansion in this program, so the capital will be very useful. I didn't understand the question. Did you, A.J.? Well, when we're going to introduce it, we'll introduce it. We're not going to -- I mean, we're constantly introducing new ideas. Well, we don't hold. Yes. Go ahead, A.J. Once again, thanks very much for your interest in our company. We look forward to conversing with you as time goes on. Bye."

            "name": "Aaron Nahmad",
            "content": "This is A.J. Just if I can add one more piece of color there, speaks to our culture a little bit and being a little more conservative. One thing we will not do, which some other maybe smaller independent distributors may do, is speculate and take huge positions either way on the 410A product or the 454 product. Our job is to meet the market and meet the expectations of our customers. We're not trying to speculate for some short-term giant swing over the others because we are long-term players. And I'll add, there was some, I guess, on the margin opportunistic buying that our business took advantage of. So that, and as a result of a moving out of supply chain, which has been chaotic for the last 3 years in COVID, I believe our business [indiscernible] feel that they are very well prepared for the busy summer going season as far as inventory goes. They've got the right mix of products and they've got a healthy quality of inventory. So the expectation is that as the selling season begins and run its course, we should be well positioned to take care of our customers and [ move ] product. Yes. And the like-for-like products are going away, right? I mean the 410A products will not be sold to us again next year. [indiscernible] breakout months. Yes. I don't think we break out..... I just have to -- I love your answer there, Barry, and I'll build on it. I love our competitive position on the whole. And we talked about -- we have high-quality inventory deployed in the field. We've got best-in-class technology that our competitors can't match. We've got a balance sheet that's strong and ready to invest in any size opportunity.

            "name": "Paul Johnston",
            "content": "Yes, we're really not seeing a lot of repair pickup in the first quarter. And we saw a little bit on the motor side but not on the compressor side. The weather just wasn't there to really institute any real change in the market dynamics right now. Okay. Well, it's going to be an interesting time. We're still waiting to hear from the EPA whether or not there's going to be all the sell-through that people anticipate with the all 410A units. Will they be allowed as components? So that's kind of a fly in the ointment right now. Right now, what we're looking at is probably just start incorporating the A2L units, probably third and fourth quarter. We'll probably see some sales pickup in the first and second quarter of 2025. I think it's going to be a phase down, phase up between the 2 product lines. Right now, it's a quite some market as far as when each one of the manufacturers that we represent is going to be introducing their A2L products. Yes, it would be contrary to what Mr. Nahmad would like, but some lower turns as we transition from the old 410A over to the new A2L product. We're going to see how much of that we can mitigate, but definitely, there's going to be some uptick in inventory. Go ahead. Yes. It's -- again, a lot of it is pricing that we're seeing in the marketplace. We had a price increase in April -- we had a price increase in February and another one in March from various manufacturers, we have seen copper go up to $4.50 a pound. So we've seen a lot of upward thrust as far as our cost is concerned. As far as the number of units that we have, outdoor units that we have in inventory, that's actually down year-over-year. So we feel like we're managing our inventory. It's a little bit tough out there right now with the price increases. Well, I mean we're just starting to see the prices roll in from the OEMs on the new A2L products. So I would say we're going to see one price increase on the A2L products. And then I think that's going to be probably it for the year. I'm hoping. Well, there's, like every market, there's a good, better, best selection of products out there and Oxbox generally fits the value portion of that market. So that's where I think Trane has got a product positioned right now. We've got a number of other products, such as Payne, some of our ICP products, some of our private label products that compete in that marketplace. And it's a market segment. Yes. I think you're correct, in probably the third quarter, fourth quarter, depends on what part of the country. Right now, New York is the one that's been funded. And so we're hoping to see what that -- what sort of impulse that generates so that we can find out what the impact of it's going to be. Then from there, I think it's going to be California, will probably be in second place. So it's going to be a gradual spreading of the wealth throughout the U.S. as this thing rolls forward. So it's going to be interesting to see what the first 2 states lay out before we really jump in and say it's going to be a big deal. Yes. But I will say this, [indiscernible] benefit right now in the first quarter, for example. And we'll see how this plays out and the trend in the summer. But at least the first quarter, if I look at heat pump growth versus everything else, it's remarkably better. If that's one of the promises of incentives and so on, we're seeing improved heat pump sales period without necessarily a benefit coming. \n And second is part of the recalibration of all the new products last year was essentially a reinvention of all the higher efficiency products that the industry makes. So 16 SEER, 17 SEER and above, our new products essentially this year. And again, growth rates in that higher mix category grew nicely in the quarter. So those are just good things without a regulatory incentive. I'll accept it as good things. And again, it needs to play out for the full year. And if the incentives can add to that, that's a good thing. But right now, it's been nice to see the mix improving in the early part of the year and could be good for the rest of the year if it continues. That's really tough. But the initial wins we've gotten in are in the 10% to 15% range. And in fact, they're right in the middle. And so that pretty much held true. I didn't think that would vary. Are we going to see a variance on that price as we move into the season? If we do, it's going to be, like I say, very late this year, early next year before we really see an adjustment to that. I think we're going to have 4 10 units to sell right through. And then we'll start seeing some of the A2L units moving into the marketplace probably in the third quarter, fourth quarter. Boy, it'd be great if it would. I don't think anybody's got a crystal ball that's going to allow them to see exactly what the impact of the A2L product is going to be next year. I would say it would be somewhere between 50% and 60%. We have it but it [indiscernible]. The March increase we had from Carrier was on the 410A equipment. And then subsequent to that, we've also received pricing on what they're going to be -- what we're going to see on the new A2L products. But we have not received any of the A2L products yet. No. We're [indiscernible],  depend on what the operating units will do, it would probably be third quarter, fourth quarter before we see any significant amount of A2L product. We're a little bit ahead, don't you? I think we're a little bit ahead of inventory right now. We've got some prebuys that came in on the 410A products, and we also had some additional products that we purchased. Nope. Not yet. Too early. There just hasn't been any -- if you put weather aside, there is nothing."

On the residential side, we saw unit declines of mid-single digits, and that mirrors sort of what's -- what's happening with broader industry trends and sell into the channel. Actually, I think we're outperforming that trend a little bit. And price was positive, not hugely positive but it was positive. And commercial continues to do better than residential. The backlog there is still very healthy and a lot of strength in Latin America to support that. So that's the color we would give."

            "name": "Barry S. Logan",
            "content": "Again, it's been a nice pickup and it's in the -- I would call it, characterize it as the high single-digit range that includes the new branches. I look at things on a same-store basis, it's in the mid-single digits is how I put it and unit growth thus far in the market. Tommy, first, it is the first quarter, and a lot of actions were taken in terms of streamlining the branch and the headcount, and again, the general conditions that leaders went out and did. They tended to take those actions at the beginning of this year as opposed to before the holidays. So that makes common sense. And again, that's part of the mindset, is to start the year with that kind of momentum going on. So much of that played out in February and March, and I would expect the rest of the year -- the remainder of the year to reflect some reductions in some of our major categories. Transportation, freight, logistics were down in the quarter. That's been consistent now for several quarters. On the headcount side, which is the largest of the contributors to SG&A. I think you'll see some results from what was done for the remainder of the year. Yes. I'll just say that, I think, a year ago in this call, we lamented one of our major vendors and not being at a strong inventory position for the season and lamented about lost sales and so on. And obviously, a year later, the channel for that particular vendor is still then in a very good competitive condition, it grew nicely in their early stage of the year-to-year, and there's a lot more work to do, but that's also an inventory position. If you look at a year-over-year basis, that contributes to some of our current position. I was going to emphasize that. It's a crowded space, the value segment. There are a lot of brands that are sold in the market. Watsco itself sells probably a half a dozen brands in that segment. And so it's a crowded space, and it is a way for an OEM to diversify its price points in the market. But again, it's a crowded space. On the -- first, on the gross profit side, I think we -- I think I chimed in on that probably 2.5 years ago when we said what we thought the long term would look like, and it's held up pretty well. So I'll sustain my opinion and what our capabilities are in the near term and for this year. Obviously, there's always 10, 15 variables and coming up with that, that are subject to change, but I don't think our conviction has changed at all for this year, if that answers your question. \n On the nonrecurring side, we mentioned, all of our stores, all of our leadership across Watsco in a responsible way, reduce headcount in the first quarter. There's obviously some costs incurred in making those decisions, in those reductions. So that would be a component of that, probably the major component of the number. And as far as other things, there's no one item that's taking out, it's probably $4 million or $5 million items that are just in our minds, clearly, something that is behind us and not a recurring item. Yes. Ryan, there are pricing actions that came in later, you're right. And obviously, it's still -- it's a better market, but it's still not a strong market. So we'll always handicap some conservatism just because of what the market is doing. And if I'm wrong, it will be hopefully on the upside of that discussion. So I'm not -- I want to change the tune this early in the season. We'll be conservative about our commentary and the market will educate us over the next 6 months of really what's going on. We provided a little bit of data on top of this. So I'd just be helpful. So kind of the unitary product, [indiscernible] product, that is the OEM -- U.S. OEM type product, price and mix, that was up around 3% for the quarter. I used the word mix, price and mix purposely at. And as we've said, routinely now those pricing actions happen ultimately later in the quarter as opposed to early. So it gives you some read of it. Our ductless products, which is part of our unit [ dispossession ], pricing there is a bit more flat. But in that case, our largest vendor this year decided to have April 1 pricing actions. So that kind of makes sense. And on commercial, as Rick said, it's outperformed, it grew in the quarter end, is in a steady state, I think at this point of, call it, mid-single-digit growth. Yes. That's only resi when I say that. Sure. I can give the color. It's probably our third quarter where we've had essentially commodity deflation going on an average selling price just being simply a headwind during a quarter. And when we use the word commodities, that's refrigerant, copper tubing and sheet metal products as a category, it's around between 5% and 6% of Watsco's total sales to give the context but it does have a bigger imputation of reality in that non-equipment products category. \n The good news is that margins and pricing have stabilized. The good news is copper is increasing in price and the better news is that we're kind of getting through this year-over-year cycle and expect less impact if, in fact, no impact and perhaps even positive impact as we get into the rest of this year. So this seems to be end of the line with some of that discussion. I'm hoping so and expect so based on kind of what we're seeing as we look into the spring, the spring time here. Well, it's a good aspiration and goal and it's not [indiscernible]. That's not how we manage Watsco. We manage it through our leadership, if they want to find investments or do something that's important for a market or a customer, they'll do it. But I think from a mindset, from a cultural point of view, it's what we've been after. But again, carrying that out in the market, if there's sales generation going on to the extent that there is today, let's say, variable costs are going to increase, and we'll probably violate that concept of [indiscernible], which is not a bad thing. We have variable expenses would drive -- would grow along with sales growth. So it's early days. I'm glad that there's growth going on. Time will tell. There is some noise in the first quarter SG&A that we've quantified to an extent and I would expect better performance as the year goes on. I've got to chime in on this because it's an important like backbone to what we've talked about already. And I want to emphasize it. First, if we said earlier that higher-priced heat pumps are outperforming everything else, that's a statement about what's going on in the market with contractors installing higher-priced systems, right? Secondly, as I've said in the call that the mix of higher efficiency is also increasing remarkably, that too is an early stage -- at least an early stage indicator of what's going on in the market. And again, I'd rather do October and report on how it went. [indiscernible] the early signs of what's going on.\n Third of all -- and third of all, we -- no one ever asks, ever, about credit quality, about what's going on with our contractor. It's never a question. It's remarkable to me. And so I feel like I have to talk about it or bring it up. If you look at the bad debt expense for the quarter versus a year ago, it's less and overall credit quality and how our contractors are behaving with us when they pay us $7 billion or more a year is very healthy. So that's an April view. It's not an October view. But I really -- I don't look at this as like a binary thing of on or off. It's the subtlety of what's going on in the market, obviously. \n And the contractors, at the end of the day, are going to do the best job they can to get the job, if they have to discount their services or go to a lower brand or go to a product that they need. I know we're going to have it. There's not a location in Watsco that doesn't have multiple brands in it to serve that local market. And we have very few competitors who do have the same variety of brands across markets. So in a softer market or a trickier market, I like our competitive position even more if I kind of round out the conversation. As far as the pure SG&A, that's your question, there's not much change in the technology spend this quarter sequentially from last quarter. If that's your question."
