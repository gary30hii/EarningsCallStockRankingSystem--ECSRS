We specifically disclaim any obligation to update such statements. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John. John?\nJohn Maraganore: Thanks, Christine, and thank you everyone for joining the call today. Despite the challenges we all faced in 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic, Alnylam had one of its strongest years ever as a successful global commercial organization with a highly productive R&D platform. We delivered on our commercial expansion, growing top line product revenues by over 100%, driven by strong continued execution for ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. We continue to advance the pipeline, which includes programs across both rare and common disease populations. And we remained focused on financial discipline to help us reach our goal of achieving a self-sustainable financial profile.\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks, John and good morning everyone. I appreciate the warm welcome, and couldn't be more excited to join the Alnylam team. Let's get started with a review of our commercial performance. For ONPATTRO, we achieved $90.4 million in global net product revenues in the fourth quarter, representing approximately 10% quarter-on-quarter growth compared with Q3. And we achieved $306.1 million in global ONPATTRO revenues for the full year 2020.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Thanks Tolga and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis where we're advancing our two product candidates patisiran and vutrisiran. ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat the polyneuropathy associated hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. We're committed to expanding the products label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients.\nJeff Poulton: Thanks, Akshay and good morning, everyone. 2020 was an unprecedented year that underscores Alnylam's strong commercial capabilities and operational excellence, as we delivered robust top line growth while managing disciplined investment across our business. After commenting on our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results, I will also provide our financial guidance for 2021. As Tolga highlighted, U.S. sales of ONPATTRO increased 10% versus Q3 2020, and we're impacted by the following: Patient demand increased 13% driven by the addition of new patients on therapy, with patient compliance remaining consistent with Q3 when we returned to pre-pandemic levels. Inventory destocking during the quarter compared with modest stocking in Q3 reduced reported growth during the quarter. We ended the quarter with just over one week of inventory in the channel in the U.S. We're really pleased with the continued strength in our U.S. results, with two consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, following a pandemic challenge Q2 and with Q4 sales representing the highest level since launch. In our international markets, ONPATTRO performance remained strong with growth of 9% versus Q3 2020, primarily driven by increased patient demand broadly across Europe and Japan. Additionally, there was a modest benefit from inventory stocking in Japan at year-end. Turning to our results for GIVLAARI. We had a strong fourth quarter, generating $22.1 million in global net revenue, representing 33% growth compared to the third quarter of 2020. Revenue in Europe during 2020, as expected, was primarily generated from two markets, Germany and France. As we saw with ONPATTRO in year two of its commercialization, as we secure pricing and reimbursement, we anticipate additional markets for GIVLAARI coming online across Europe and Asia in 2021. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter and full year. Total product sales for 2020 were approximately $362 million, which were more than double 2019 with ONPATTRO delivering more than 80% growth versus 2019 and GIVLAARI contributing $55 million in its initial launch year. Net revenue from collaborations for the fourth quarter was $50.7 million primarily due to revenue recognized from our Vir and Regeneron collaborations and a $15 million increase around milestone from Novartis following the December EU approval of Leqvio. Gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 86% for the quarter, up from 83% in Q4 2019, primarily due to ONPATTRO inventory write-off that occurred in Q4, 2019. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses in the fourth quarter 2020 decreased compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to Q4 2019 having a high level of expense associated with clinical material manufactured for future clinical trials. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to increased investment in commercial and medical affairs activities to support the ongoing launches of ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI and the launch preparation activity for OXLUMO. Our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $1,063 million in 2020, representing 11% growth versus 2019, which was significantly lower than the growth in combined at non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense in 2019, which was 31%. As I've noted on several occasions over the last year, this more moderate level of OpEx growth is one of the key levers supporting our path towards profitability. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter decreased by approximately $82 million compared to the same period in 2019, driven by strong top line growth and flat non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expense. Full year non-GAAP operating loss ended at approximately $649 million, which is $116 million favorable to our full year 2019 non-GAAP operating loss, consistent with our past guidance that 2019 would be our peak loss year. We ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.9 billion, up from $1.5 billion at the end of 2019. Cash was favorably impacted in 2020 by the $2 billion Blackstone strategic financing collaboration that we announced in Q2, which contributed approximately $800 million in financing this year, including $200 million in Q4 related to the initial drawdown of the debt facility with GSO Blackstone's credit arm. Now turning to our financial guidance for 2021. Starting with net product revenues, we are now transitioning to providing combined net product revenue guidance from ONPATTRO GIVLAARI, and OXLUMO. We anticipate combined net product revenues for these three products will be between $610 million and $660 million with the midpoint representing more than 75% growth compared to 2020. Vutrisiran approval is not expected until early 2022, so it was not factored into our guidance for product revenues this year. It is also worth noting that our guidance reflects the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which should decrease over time as the vaccine rollout progresses around the world.  Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties is a range between $150 million and $200 million with the midpoint of the range representing more than 30% growth from 2020. Growth in 2021 is expected to come primarily from our collaboration with Regeneron and royalties and milestones from Leqvio. Our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense is a range between $1,175 million and $1,275 million. The midpoint of the guidance range represents a projected 15% increase compared with 2020. We anticipate SG&A growth will be modest as we generate operating leverage from our existing commercial infrastructure to support our three commercial products. We expect a higher rate of growth for R&D driven by investments in our two Phase 3 ATTR cardiomyopathy studies, APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B, as well as initiation of two robust Phase 2 studies in our AGT program for hypertension. Finally, achievement of the top line and non-GAAP operating expense guidance we have provided today, 2021 will deliver another year of improvement in our non-GAAP operating loss, as we continue to make progress on our path to delivering sustainable profitability. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Yvonne to review our goals for 2021. Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Jeff and hello everyone. 2021 is shaping up to be a productive year for Alnylam, as we embark on a new five-year chapter of our journey outlines that Alnylam P5x25 guidance. This past year, we plan to continue our global commercialization of ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. We look forward to major market approvals in Japan for GIVLAARI and Brazil for OXLUMO. We plan to continue advancing our ATTR franchise program with the ongoing ATTR cardiomyopathy study. For patisiran, we expect to complete enrollment in the APOLLO-B study early this year. For vutrisiran, enrollment is ongoing in the HELIOS-B study. In following the HELIOS-A positive top line results, we look forward to filing an NDA and presenting nine months results at AAN in April. In 2021, we also plan to report additional data on the 18-month endpoint, which include a larger number of exploratory cardiac endpoints measures. We expect to start studying our biannual dose regimen of vutrisiran in early 2021. For Lumasiran, the ILLUMINATE-C Phase 3 study is expected to have top-line results midyear and we look forward to initiating the KARDIA 1 and 2 Phase 2 studies for ALN-AGT in hypertension. And, of course, we're excited about what's our partners have in store this year. Novartis will be executing on the initial launch of Leqvio and aiming for U.S. approval. And Sanofi will be advancing for fitusiran in the ATLAS Phase 3 program. Finally, you can expect additional data readouts from our pipeline during the course of the year. 2021 marks the starts the next chapter for Alnylam, with sights set on our new five-year goals become one of the most successful companies in the industry. We're eager to deliver on this ambition and look forward to updating you throughout the year. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Yvonne. Operator, we will now open the call for your questions. To those dialed in, we'd like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each and then get back in the queue if you have any additional questions.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from the line of David Lebowitz from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. \nDavid Lebowitz: Thank you for taking my question. When you look at GIVLAARI performance thus far, it seems to be doing quite well. Has this caused you to, number one, reevaluate what the size of the market is for GIVLAARI in general? And has it changed the way you look at markets for these types of diseases and what you think of what the ultimate opportunity for these types for PH1 porphyria and other diseases its nature might be.\nJohn Maraganore: Thank you, David. I think that was you David. I think that's a good question. Obviously, GIVLAARI was really off to a good start and had a very strong year, its first full year of launch last year and we look forward to its launch into -- continued launch in 2021. And we do expect continued growth in 2021, driven not only by new patient finding, but significant geographic expansion that will be occurring by virtue of PNR. And also, approvals we expect in major markets like Japan in 2021. Let me turn it over to Tolga and Andy Orth maybe to comment further. Let's start with Tolga, anything to add to that?\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks, John. And hi, David. Good morning. No, John essentially -- I mean, it's good to be recognized with a good strong performance of GIVLAARI, especially during a pandemic era that says a lot about the capabilities of the organization and how we've been able to launch this both in the U.S. and ex-U.S. And to your point, we do anticipate an approval in Japan. So, overall, I think the trends are good. It's also a good sign of the value of the medicine that provides to these patients that have not been properly treated.\nJohn Maraganore: Andy, anything to add to that?\nAndy Orth: Yeah. I would just add that. We continue to be really excited about the opportunity. We still think this is a half billion dollar opportunity for the company globally. And the learnings we're gaining here, as we go through 2020, will hopefully allow us to accelerate that as we get into 2021 and 2022.\nJohn Maraganore: Right. Thank you. David, does that answer your question?\nDavid Lebowitz: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question.\nJohn Maraganore: Great.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Beatty from Citi. Your line is now open.\nJoel Beatty: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I'm curious, could you share any insight into the ability to have combination therapy in TTR with any competing drugs in the U.S. and how that compares with ex-U.S. markets?\nJohn Maraganore: Yeah. That's a great question. A very important one and one that defines an important part of the dynamics of the ONPATTRO execution and market dynamics in the U.S. and rest of world. So, why don't we go to Tolga to add some more color on that question?\nTolga Tanguler: Yeah. Would you be able to repeat the question again? I wasn't quite sure if you were asking about the sort of the concomitant use.\nJoel Beatty: Yeah. Concomitant use of ONPATTRO with competing TTR agent, is that different in the U.S. versus ex-U.S.?\nTolga Tanguler: Right. No, it is. It is different. What we see in the U.S. in particular is that there's about 20%, 25% of the utilization of current ONPATTRO patients are actually also on tafamidis. We do see that in ex-U.S., we tend to see a much rapid switch from TTR stabilizers to silencers. That's what we've experienced. However, in some markets, we also see some minor level of concomitant use as well, when it comes to using a stabilizer than a silencer.\nJohn Maraganore: And just to emphasize the point, obviously, the use of ONPATTRO is for the treatment of the polyneuropathy that exists in these patients, which is where it's indicated. So, these are hereditary ATTR patients that have polyneuropathy and likely have a mixed phenotype, which is why they may be getting both drugs.\nTolga Tanguler: Absolutely. Yes.\nJoel Beatty: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nSalveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just curious if we're going to see an interim analysis here on HELIOS-B and when we can expect that and what we should expect to see.\nJohn Maraganore: Yeah. Great question, Salveen. So, just as a reminder, and I'm going to hand this over to Akshay in a second. But as a reminder, HELIOS-B is our randomized double blind placebo controlled study of vutrisiran compared to placebo on top of standard-of-care for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. So that includes both hereditary as well as wild-type disease. The study is enrolling quite well. We are going to be enrolling throughout 2021, but we're really pleased with how well the enrollment is going. But your point about interim analysis, let's turn it over to Akshay.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yeah. Thanks, Salveen. So, I think, we have a wonderful option to do an interim analysis in HELIOS-B. There are a number of approaches we can consider. But importantly, we want to use all data elements to inform that interim analysis. And we have data from the original patisiran APOLLO study itself. We now have data from HELIOS-A, nine months to 18 in patients with mix the ATTR disease with cardiomyopathy, those were exploratory data on BNP, which we've shared showing improvement in BNP. And we're going to get 18 months data later in the year that will encompass, not just BNP and echo data, but some technician's scan data and also can be to test another element. So there are a lot of datasets coming, that continue to inform us about the potential for RNAi based approaches for ATTR cardiomyopathy. And most importantly, next year, as we've just guided, we'll get APOLLO-B data on the six minute walk distance. And so, these are the elements that will go into our thinking. There are lots of options. We're excited about it and we will update you when we have finalized the approach.\nJohn Maraganore: Great. Does that answer your question, Salveen?\nSalveen Richter: Yes. Thank you.\nJohn Maraganore: Excellent. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Matteis from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nPaul Matteis: Great. Thank you much for taking my question. I wanted to ask just a broader pipeline one. Last year AGT really came into the forefront. If you had to pick one of your earlier programs that you featured in R&D Day or in the CNS pipeline that you don't think it's discussed right now, but might be at the forefront of the conversation by the end of this year early next, which would you pick? And then one piece of that, I'm a little surprised you guys don't have anything in neuromuscular, given the amount of funding that's gone into conjugation approaches there. Are there any -- is that all of interest of you with RNAi? Thanks a lot.\nJohn Maraganore: Okay. Great questions, Paul. So, I'm going to give you my view and then we'll go to Akshay and then we'll go to Yvonne. So you get three different perspectives on it. And then, we'll come back and Akshay will address the question on neuromuscular. Look, from my perspective, a program in our pipeline that, I think, we'll get a lot of attention this year is ALN-APP. That's our RNAi therapeutic targeting amyloid precursor protein. It's our first CNS program. It's really going to be a defining moment for extra hepatic delivery of RNAi therapeutics. And we're leading the way on the translation of this remarkable technology for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, where there's just enormous unmet need. And so, I think that's going to be a landmark program for the field and for Alnylam and for the future of our pipeline. So that's my pick. Let's go to Akshay next.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: I was going to pick that. Okay. I'll pick something. I think we have the benefit of many, many interesting targets we're addressing -- to address a high unmet medical need. I trained as a rheumatologist, the SDH program, which we featured at R&D Day will address gout. Gout is a hugely prevalent global disorder, not only the rheumatologic disorder, but it can impact the kidneys and kidney function. So very, very important disease and one that's rapidly increasing in incidents by the way. So we would love to make a bet that the animal data are very encouraging. We can get over 95% knocked down at the target SDH, with over 50% reduction in peripheral blood urea levels. It be interesting, based on the Phase 1, which I think will be very informative and we can achieve a lot without Phase 1 to figure out how to position exactly and help the most patients. But as part of our broadening into common disease, that's another element beyond AGT and the NASH programs like SDH. John's talked about APP and outsiders. So, I'd pick the SDH program. Yvonne?\nJohn Maraganore: Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Okay. Well, I'm going to pick the HBV program for three reasons. One, HBV is enormous opportunity. It's a disease that afflicts close to 300 million people around the world. So, incredibly important. Second reason is I think the encouraging base that we've had from our Phase 2 study with the one and a half log reduction in HB surface antigen. And obviously, in partnership with Vir, that's now being studied in combination. And I think has the opportunity to affect functional cure for these patients, which would be absolutely tremendous. And then the third reason is the fact that we have a 50/50 three option and a right price to Phase 34. So, I think this could start some kind of program that we spend a little bit more time talking about it as the year goes on.\nJohn Maraganore: Absolutely. And we're encouraged to -- by the progress that Vir has been making. And I'm sure there'll be quite a bit of new data this year on that program. So, Akshay, do you want to handle the neuromuscular question?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yeah. Paul, so, I mean, I think we are doing a good amount of work actually in neuromuscular disease. If we think about it, that front center, we've got all our work in ATTR amyloidosis, the polyneuropathy there is -- it's a peripheral neuropathy and so it is squarely a neuromuscular disorder. Of course, it's impactful in the hereditary situation. Increasingly we hear about neuropathy in wild type and I think that'll be an important area to think about as well. ONPATTRO is approved, of course, for the hereditary polyneuropathy in ATTR. So, that's one area. We're going to do a study of HELIOS-C which we intend to kickoff later in the year with vutrisiran to prevent the onset of this syndrome, hATTR amyloidosis more to come on that. And separately, we've got programs in ALS. There are a number of genetically validated targets in ALS that people are familiar with sort of one and others and that's under the basket or programs with Regeneron where we collaborate. So that's another neuromuscular disorder caused with Regeneron. We're also pursuing Myasthenia Gravis with the Cemdisiran and C5 anthropoid Pozelimab. So more details on those. The Regeneron collaborative programs to come I'm sure later in the year, actually. And beyond that, we are doing work in lots of additional neuromuscular disorders at a research and preclinical stage, that we don't necessarily share until the data mature enough to discuss. But I can assure you, there all programs ongoing in other disorders, including common inherited peripheral neuropathy, for example, we're interested in. So, lots going on in neuromuscular disease. And I think, we're pretty excited about the progress we've made and certainly the dent we've made in hATTR amyloidosis polyneuropathy.\nJohn Maraganore: Thanks, Akshay. Paul, does that answer your question?\nPaul Matteis: Yeah. Thank you.\nJohn Maraganore: All right. Great.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nTazeen Ahmad: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Wanted to get your thoughts on, how you think the ATTR market in general is developing? Do you have a better sense of how much of being addressable patients have been diagnosed, and how the stabilizers are helping to develop that market? Thanks.\nJohn Maraganore: Well, that's a great question, Tazeen. And let me kick it off by saying that we have a multi-product multiyear perspective on the broader ATTR franchise at Alnylam -- a franchise we're we aim to be the leader across the industry, helping patients with the medicines and the innovation we bring forward. Obviously, today we are approved with one product for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. ONPATTRO is off to a terrific start. It is the market leading product for treating polyneuropathy with this disease. And we're really pleased with the performance that we've seen. We expect continued growth in the polyneuropathy segment for ONPATTRO alone. At the same time, we just recently reported positive Phase 3 data with HELIOS-A which will open up the opportunity for vutrisiran once quarterly subcut drug, which with additional work we believe we can make it once every six monthly subcut drug. And we should expect approval next year in ATTR polyneuropathy, which we believe will expand the polyneuropathy opportunity beyond even ONPATTRO. And then, of course, is as Akshay mentioned a minute ago, we open up the door with the APOLLO-B study mid next year, assuming positive data with cardiomyopathy both wild-type and hereditary. So this is really a multiyear growth opportunity for the innovation that we're bringing forward for the treatment of this disease. Tolga, do you want to comment a little bit further? Andy, you as well in terms of how we see this evolving over time?\nTolga Tanguler: No, I think, John, you said it very nicely. We certainly see this category evolving as the time goes by. And as John indicated, obviously, we now have a one indication with ONPATTRO that's becoming -- that is the leader in the silencer market for polyneuropathy. But we know that there are tale of two cities almost. You have the polyneuropathy, that's more of a rare disease with a lesser prevalence, given the hereditary condition. And then, obviously, there's the wild-type that we certainly don't have the indication yet with cardiomyopathy. But the diagnostics of that is probably going through the same route, which is really an inexpensive PYP scan. That access -- having that access has significantly increased our ability to be able to diagnose with more polyneuropathy patients. And if, HELIOS-A as well as, -- sorry -- HELIOS-A as well as APOLLO-B, if they were to succeed, we certainly will be able to take advantage of much larger cardiomyopathy segment. So, from Alnylam perspective, what we're already demonstrating with ONPATTRO and its leadership in polyneuropathy, I think is a great signal for us to be able to actually define how are we going to be able to play in this current segment, as well as be able to provide the right medicine for other segments, if our products were to be approved. Andy?\nAndy Orth: Yeah. And just to add, the hereditary and the wild-type markets are in the very early stages of their growth for what we expect them to be. And that's going to happen over the next one, two, five to 10 years. And as John and Tolga highlighted, our portfolio that we're going to bring to bear here, puts us in an excellent position. So, we're really pretty excited about it.\nJohn Maraganore: And Tazeen, I agree with everything that Tolga and Andy just said. I have often made the analogy of where the ATTR marketplace will go over time to what happened with multiple sclerosis, and with many products, many mechanisms of action and obviously major patient impact at the end of the day, along with obviously significant revenue and overall value of that market. So, I think you will see that materializing in a way that will accommodate multiple opportunities for patients at the end of the day. And Alnylam is going to be a major leader in this space.\nTazeen Ahmad: Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Maraganore: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ritu Baral from Cowan. Your line is now open.\nRitu Baral: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I'm going to be upfront. It does have a couple of different parts, but it's all on ONPATTRO performance, which continues to be really strong. One, how much does home infusion present a tailwind to what we've seen over, especially over Q4, and long-term, can you maintain coverage of home infusion? Are you planning on potentially expanding the sales effort with the vutrisiran approval in early 2022? And then lastly, just any color on a policy Akshay, you sort of threw it out there, prevention of symptoms, but anything else you can say about that?\nJohn Maraganore: Okay. So, let's -- why don't we -- Akshay, why don\u2019t you quickly answer the HELIOS-C question and then we'll go -- we'll give Tolga and Andy some time to reflect on the ONPATTRO questions and we'll go to them. So, Akshay.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Sure. Ritu, when we looked at the original APOLLO data is very clear that potent significant reduction of TTR 80% or so. It was associated with remarkable outcomes for polyneuropathy and for the cardiac aspects in those with mixed disease, we think. And the drug was labeled for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR, which is right and proper. But as we looked at the detailed data, patients with very early disease with lesser disease burden did very well and all -- their M&A scores went down to single digit, so very close to zero, and that led to the hypothesis that what if you could give the drug even before the overt onset of disease in patients with very low or maybe no evident polyneuropathy and can we prevent the onset of symptomatic disease. And I think we feel very optimistic about that. Similarly, we now know that patients are being diagnosed or being identified as having TTR deposits in the heart before the onset, despite by technetium scan before the onset of clinical disease. And so, it's a very reasonable hypothesis, and I think one with a highlighted success. But if we can turn the tap off and substantially reduce TTR levels, that we can substantially reduce the occurrence of this disease and prevent its onset. So, that's what we're working on now. We intend to start the study, which will call HELIOS-C with vutrisiran later in the year, the subcutaneous injectable once every six months or so. And more detail to follow. But I think it's a very, very exciting hypothesis and how often in a rare disease to be getting a chance to try and help patients by preventing the onset of disease.\nJohn Maraganore: Great. And let's go to Tolga first on the commercial questions on ONPATTRO, and then vutrisiran and the sales effort. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Sure. And thanks, John. A great question, and you're right. We're very pleased with the growth of ONPATTRO quarter-over-quarter. And certainly that will be -- it will be driven by continuous patient finding. And if appropriate, the switch outs from the patient's current treatments. Now, in regards to patient access, obviously, with the pandemic, what we've seen is a good steady increase of patients being able to access home infusion, particularly in the United States and Europe. Those rates have gone up, but we also believe that patients have been actually able to -- as well as the healthcare systems been able to quickly pivot and provide alternative care sites for patients, as well as providing easy access to infusion clinics. So, we're pleased that we have the ability to be able to either redirect those patients to alternatives site cares or provide the home infusion network that we have available, particularly in U.S. and Europe. That's certainly a tailwind. And we actually, frankly, have not seen any impact on our compliance rates. Therefore, the pandemic didn't really impact the current patient retention and compliance rates at all and again, we have those services available. The second part of your question, in regards to, how would we see the expansion, obviously, when the cardiomyopathy indication is received. Obviously, that's something we are always exploring and making sure that we have the ability to be able to communicate effectively to healthcare professionals about earlier indications. But that's something, obviously, we need to continue to plan for. Let me turn it over to Andy, if he has anything to add.\nAndy Orth: Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Tolga. I think you got it right on the home infusion. We've got that essentially quote unquote running smoothly and maxed out on our commercially insured patients and where they choose. Many are taking advantage of that. And then on the Medicare side, obviously, the rule that was passed last year, isn't exactly the favorite of hospitals and some physicians, but we've been able to take advantage of that where we can. I will say our ability to get folks infused at the common locations infusion centers, hospitals, et cetera, is great, and many patients frankly choose that as a route of preference for the social dynamic, or they just don't want somebody in their house. And on the second one -- was your question on HELIOS-A in neuropathy or HELIOS-B in cardiomyopathy?\nJohn Maraganore: No, it's \u2026\nRitu Baral: Yeah. It actually was for HELIOS-A. I'm just wondering if you are planning any commercial expansion just for vutrisiran and FAP even before your cardiomyopathy labels that come online.\nAndy Orth: Got it. And as you know, right, overlapping labels with ONPATTRO, and while we're not exactly releasing any plans on that front. We love the promotional efforts we've got out there today and are really excited about what HELIOS-A is going to bring to our portfolio.\nJohn Maraganore: Great. Okay. Good. Thank you, Ritu. We should move on to the next question I think.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anupam Rama from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTessa Romero: Good morning. This is Tessa on the call for Anupam. Thanks for taking our question. As you consider launch dynamics between GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, what are the similarities and differences worth considering here? And then second part of the question is on GIVLAARI, anything more granular you can provide on your assumptions around 2021 U.S. versus the rest of world growth in 2021 versus 2020. Thanks so much guys.\nJohn Maraganore: Okay. Thank you, Tessa. Those are great questions. Obviously, I think we covered GIVLAARI as an introduction earlier. We're excited about this year as being the second full year of launch for that important medicine. And then in the case of OXLUMO, which only got approved in November of last year for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria, this will be the first full year of launch. So, that's an exciting milestone. So, let's go to Tolga to answer this great question.\nTolga Tanguler: Sure. Thanks, John. Yeah. I mean, look, if you look at those -- both of those products and what they are really addressing, both diseases are highly rare and both diseases are highly devastating. And as John indicated, we had an excellent full year of launch with GIVLAARI during the pandemic. And we've been able to capitalize on a lot of patients that have been waiting for this therapy. And we look -- we're probably going to be looking at the same type of dynamic with OXLUMO, with obviously relevant prevalent number of patients across the world. Therefore, from a business model perspective, the condition that those patients are in, we expect a very similar uptake when it comes to OXLUMO.\nJohn Maraganore: Great. And Andy \u2026\nYvonne Greenstreet: I was just -- Andy, I was going to add. I guess one of the main differences here is that OXLUMO is going to be treating a lot of pediatric patients. And I also see patients with different population that needs to be addressed. But sorry -- Andy, over to you.\nAndy Orth: Yeah. The only thing I would add here is the level of excitement we are seeing right now in the PH1 communities, physicians, patients, patient advocacy groups, et cetera, is just incredible and frankly matches that we saw with GIVLAARI a year ago. So, we're off to a really, really good start. And as Yvonne mentioned here, this is a more so pediatric population than we saw with GIVLARRI early.\nJohn Maraganore: Terrific. So I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gena Wang from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nGena Wang: Thank you for taking my question. So, I have a one big picture question. For Alnylam, we know -- no doubt Alnylam is a clear leader in RNAi space. And you've done so much work identifying the best targets and candidates and some already come to fruition. Would you be willing to leverage this knowledge to the other technology platform, such as gene editing space and things we could see some synergy there.\nJohn Maraganore: Yeah. Thanks, Gena. I mean, look, we are excited about the many, many prospects we have with RNAi for the foreseeable future. We have a ton of wood to chop with this science and this technology and the type of innovation that we can bring forward really is boundless. Now, we're always going to look at other types of technologies and how they might complement what we're doing, especially for -- especially in areas where we have a commercial presence where we might want to -- obviously think about ways to strengthen and expand our leadership beyond maybe just an RNAi based approach. So, we'll certainly look at that. But in terms of product engines to speak of, what we have in front of us right now is just boundless from the number of opportunities, and we're very flush with things. Let me turn it over to Yvonne also to provide some additional color on that question as well. Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yeah. No, that's great, John. Yes. So we do keep a careful watch on what's going on outside Alnylam as well, for sure. I think one additional point to make on gene editing that's probably where you were going, I think, this approach has a lot of potential for patients, I think it is still in the very early stages of clinical development. There's a lot that we need to learn about long-term durability and efficacy and safety, et cetera. So, we continue to stay engaged and be aware of what's going on. But as John says, we have an awful lot to do with what we have in our hands at the moment.\nJohn Maraganore: Terrific. Thank you, Yvonne. Agree. So I think that's the last question, right, Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Correct.\nJohn Maraganore: Okay. Good. All right. So, let me then just close. I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call. We're obviously very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter. And what we did in 2020 was a remarkable year, despite the headwinds from COVID-19. But we're now on a new chapter with Alnylam P5x25, aiming to build the top five company in market capitalization over the next five years, with remarkable science and technology and innovation. So, thank you all and have a great day. Bye-bye now.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. ",

            "content": "Thanks, John and good morning everyone. I appreciate the warm welcome, and couldn't be more excited to join the Alnylam team. Let's get started with a review of our commercial performance. For ONPATTRO, we achieved $90.4 million in global net product revenues in the fourth quarter, representing approximately 10% quarter-on-quarter growth compared with Q3. And we achieved $306.1 million in global ONPATTRO revenues for the full year 2020. Thanks, John. And hi, David. Good morning. No, John essentially -- I mean, it's good to be recognized with a good strong performance of GIVLAARI, especially during a pandemic era that says a lot about the capabilities of the organization and how we've been able to launch this both in the U.S. and ex-U.S. And to your point, we do anticipate an approval in Japan. So, overall, I think the trends are good. It's also a good sign of the value of the medicine that provides to these patients that have not been properly treated. Yeah. Would you be able to repeat the question again? I wasn't quite sure if you were asking about the sort of the concomitant use. Right. No, it is. It is different. What we see in the U.S. in particular is that there's about 20%, 25% of the utilization of current ONPATTRO patients are actually also on tafamidis. We do see that in ex-U.S., we tend to see a much rapid switch from TTR stabilizers to silencers. That's what we've experienced. However, in some markets, we also see some minor level of concomitant use as well, when it comes to using a stabilizer than a silencer. Absolutely. Yes. No, I think, John, you said it very nicely. We certainly see this category evolving as the time goes by. And as John indicated, obviously, we now have a one indication with ONPATTRO that's becoming -- that is the leader in the silencer market for polyneuropathy. But we know that there are tale of two cities almost. You have the polyneuropathy, that's more of a rare disease with a lesser prevalence, given the hereditary condition. And then, obviously, there's the wild-type that we certainly don't have the indication yet with cardiomyopathy. But the diagnostics of that is probably going through the same route, which is really an inexpensive PYP scan. That access -- having that access has significantly increased our ability to be able to diagnose with more polyneuropathy patients. And if, HELIOS-A as well as, -- sorry -- HELIOS-A as well as APOLLO-B, if they were to succeed, we certainly will be able to take advantage of much larger cardiomyopathy segment. So, from Alnylam perspective, what we're already demonstrating with ONPATTRO and its leadership in polyneuropathy, I think is a great signal for us to be able to actually define how are we going to be able to play in this current segment, as well as be able to provide the right medicine for other segments, if our products were to be approved. Andy? Sure. And thanks, John. A great question, and you're right. We're very pleased with the growth of ONPATTRO quarter-over-quarter. And certainly that will be -- it will be driven by continuous patient finding. And if appropriate, the switch outs from the patient's current treatments. Now, in regards to patient access, obviously, with the pandemic, what we've seen is a good steady increase of patients being able to access home infusion, particularly in the United States and Europe. Those rates have gone up, but we also believe that patients have been actually able to -- as well as the healthcare systems been able to quickly pivot and provide alternative care sites for patients, as well as providing easy access to infusion clinics. So, we're pleased that we have the ability to be able to either redirect those patients to alternatives site cares or provide the home infusion network that we have available, particularly in U.S. and Europe. That's certainly a tailwind. And we actually, frankly, have not seen any impact on our compliance rates. Therefore, the pandemic didn't really impact the current patient retention and compliance rates at all and again, we have those services available. The second part of your question, in regards to, how would we see the expansion, obviously, when the cardiomyopathy indication is received. Obviously, that's something we are always exploring and making sure that we have the ability to be able to communicate effectively to healthcare professionals about earlier indications. But that's something, obviously, we need to continue to plan for. Let me turn it over to Andy, if he has anything to add. Sure. Thanks, John. Yeah. I mean, look, if you look at those -- both of those products and what they are really addressing, both diseases are highly rare and both diseases are highly devastating. And as John indicated, we had an excellent full year of launch with GIVLAARI during the pandemic. And we've been able to capitalize on a lot of patients that have been waiting for this therapy. And we look -- we're probably going to be looking at the same type of dynamic with OXLUMO, with obviously relevant prevalent number of patients across the world. Therefore, from a business model perspective, the condition that those patients are in, we expect a very similar uptake when it comes to OXLUMO."

            "content": "Yeah. I would just add that. We continue to be really excited about the opportunity. We still think this is a half billion dollar opportunity for the company globally. And the learnings we're gaining here, as we go through 2020, will hopefully allow us to accelerate that as we get into 2021 and 2022. Yeah. And just to add, the hereditary and the wild-type markets are in the very early stages of their growth for what we expect them to be. And that's going to happen over the next one, two, five to 10 years. And as John and Tolga highlighted, our portfolio that we're going to bring to bear here, puts us in an excellent position. So, we're really pretty excited about it. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Tolga. I think you got it right on the home infusion. We've got that essentially quote unquote running smoothly and maxed out on our commercially insured patients and where they choose. Many are taking advantage of that. And then on the Medicare side, obviously, the rule that was passed last year, isn't exactly the favorite of hospitals and some physicians, but we've been able to take advantage of that where we can.

This past year, we plan to continue our global commercialization of ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. We look forward to major market approvals in Japan for GIVLAARI and Brazil for OXLUMO. We plan to continue advancing our ATTR franchise program with the ongoing ATTR cardiomyopathy study. For patisiran, we expect to complete enrollment in the APOLLO-B study early this year. For vutrisiran, enrollment is ongoing in the HELIOS-B study. In following the HELIOS-A positive top line results, we look forward to filing an NDA and presenting nine months results at AAN in April. In 2021, we also plan to report additional data on the 18-month endpoint, which include a larger number of exploratory cardiac endpoints measures. We expect to start studying our biannual dose regimen of vutrisiran in early 2021. For Lumasiran, the ILLUMINATE-C Phase 3 study is expected to have top-line results midyear and we look forward to initiating the KARDIA 1 and 2 Phase 2 studies for ALN-AGT in hypertension. And, of course, we're excited about what's our partners have in store this year. Novartis will be executing on the initial launch of Leqvio and aiming for U.S. approval. And Sanofi will be advancing for fitusiran in the ATLAS Phase 3 program. Finally, you can expect additional data readouts from our pipeline during the course of the year. 2021 marks the starts the next chapter for Alnylam, with sights set on our new five-year goals become one of the most successful companies in the industry. We're eager to deliver on this ambition and look forward to updating you throughout the year. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? Okay. Well, I'm going to pick the HBV program for three reasons. One, HBV is enormous opportunity. It's a disease that afflicts close to 300 million people around the world. So, incredibly important. Second reason is I think the encouraging base that we've had from our Phase 2 study with the one and a half log reduction in HB surface antigen. And obviously, in partnership with Vir, that's now being studied in combination. And I think has the opportunity to affect functional cure for these patients, which would be absolutely tremendous. And then the third reason is the fact that we have a 50/50 three option and a right price to Phase 34. So, I think this could start some kind of program that we spend a little bit more time talking about it as the year goes on. I was just -- Andy, I was going to add. I guess one of the main differences here is that OXLUMO is going to be treating a lot of pediatric patients. And I also see patients with different population that needs to be addressed. But sorry -- Andy, over to you. Yeah. No, that's great, John. Yes. So we do keep a careful watch on what's going on outside Alnylam as well, for sure.

            "content": "Thanks, Christine, and thank you everyone for joining the call today. Despite the challenges we all faced in 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic, Alnylam had one of its strongest years ever as a successful global commercial organization with a highly productive R&D platform. We delivered on our commercial expansion, growing top line product revenues by over 100%, driven by strong continued execution for ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. We continue to advance the pipeline, which includes programs across both rare and common disease populations. And we remained focused on financial discipline to help us reach our goal of achieving a self-sustainable financial profile. Thank you, David. I think that was you David. I think that's a good question. Obviously, GIVLAARI was really off to a good start and had a very strong year, its first full year of launch last year and we look forward to its launch into -- continued launch in 2021. And we do expect continued growth in 2021, driven not only by new patient finding, but significant geographic expansion that will be occurring by virtue of PNR. And also, approvals we expect in major markets like Japan in 2021. Let me turn it over to Tolga and Andy Orth maybe to comment further. Let's start with Tolga, anything to add to that? Andy, anything to add to that? Right. Thank you. David, does that answer your question? Great. Yeah. That's a great question. A very important one and one that defines an important part of the dynamics of the ONPATTRO execution and market dynamics in the U.S. and rest of world. So, why don't we go to Tolga to add some more color on that question? And just to emphasize the point, obviously, the use of ONPATTRO is for the treatment of the polyneuropathy that exists in these patients, which is where it's indicated. So, these are hereditary ATTR patients that have polyneuropathy and likely have a mixed phenotype, which is why they may be getting both drugs. Yeah. Great question, Salveen. So, just as a reminder, and I'm going to hand this over to Akshay in a second. But as a reminder, HELIOS-B is our randomized double blind placebo controlled study of vutrisiran compared to placebo on top of standard-of-care for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. So that includes both hereditary as well as wild-type disease. The study is enrolling quite well. We are going to be enrolling throughout 2021, but we're really pleased with how well the enrollment is going. But your point about interim analysis, let's turn it over to Akshay. Great. Does that answer your question, Salveen? Excellent. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Matteis from Stifel. Your line is now open. Okay. Great questions, Paul. So, I'm going to give you my view and then we'll go to Akshay and then we'll go to Yvonne. So you get three different perspectives on it. And then, we'll come back and Akshay will address the question on neuromuscular. Look, from my perspective, a program in our pipeline that, I think, we'll get a lot of attention this year is ALN-APP. That's our RNAi therapeutic targeting amyloid precursor protein. It's our first CNS program. It's really going to be a defining moment for extra hepatic delivery of RNAi therapeutics. And we're leading the way on the translation of this remarkable technology for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, where there's just enormous unmet need. And so, I think that's going to be a landmark program for the field and for Alnylam and for the future of our pipeline. So that's my pick. Let's go to Akshay next. Yvonne? Absolutely. And we're encouraged to -- by the progress that Vir has been making. And I'm sure there'll be quite a bit of new data this year on that program. So, Akshay, do you want to handle the neuromuscular question? Thanks, Akshay. Paul, does that answer your question? All right. Great. Well, that's a great question, Tazeen. And let me kick it off by saying that we have a multi-product multiyear perspective on the broader ATTR franchise at Alnylam -- a franchise we're we aim to be the leader across the industry, helping patients with the medicines and the innovation we bring forward. Obviously, today we are approved with one product for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. ONPATTRO is off to a terrific start. It is the market leading product for treating polyneuropathy with this disease. And we're really pleased with the performance that we've seen. We expect continued growth in the polyneuropathy segment for ONPATTRO alone. At the same time, we just recently reported positive Phase 3 data with HELIOS-A which will open up the opportunity for vutrisiran once quarterly subcut drug, which with additional work we believe we can make it once every six monthly subcut drug. And we should expect approval next year in ATTR polyneuropathy, which we believe will expand the polyneuropathy opportunity beyond even ONPATTRO. And then, of course, is as Akshay mentioned a minute ago, we open up the door with the APOLLO-B study mid next year, assuming positive data with cardiomyopathy both wild-type and hereditary. So this is really a multiyear growth opportunity for the innovation that we're bringing forward for the treatment of this disease. Tolga, do you want to comment a little bit further? Andy, you as well in terms of how we see this evolving over time? And Tazeen, I agree with everything that Tolga and Andy just said. I have often made the analogy of where the ATTR marketplace will go over time to what happened with multiple sclerosis, and with many products, many mechanisms of action and obviously major patient impact at the end of the day, along with obviously significant revenue and overall value of that market. So, I think you will see that materializing in a way that will accommodate multiple opportunities for patients at the end of the day. And Alnylam is going to be a major leader in this space. Thank you. Okay. So, let's -- why don't we -- Akshay, why don\u2019t you quickly answer the HELIOS-C question and then we'll go -- we'll give Tolga and Andy some time to reflect on the ONPATTRO questions and we'll go to them. So, Akshay. Great. And let's go to Tolga first on the commercial questions on ONPATTRO, and then vutrisiran and the sales effort. Tolga? No, it's \u2026 Great. Okay. Good. Thank you, Ritu. We should move on to the next question I think. Okay. Thank you, Tessa. Those are great questions. Obviously, I think we covered GIVLAARI as an introduction earlier. We're excited about this year as being the second full year of launch for that important medicine. And then in the case of OXLUMO, which only got approved in November of last year for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria, this will be the first full year of launch. So, that's an exciting milestone. So, let's go to Tolga to answer this great question. Great. And Andy \u2026 Terrific. So I think we have time for one more question. Yeah. Thanks, Gena. I mean, look, we are excited about the many, many prospects we have with RNAi for the foreseeable future. We have a ton of wood to chop with this science and this technology and the type of innovation that we can bring forward really is boundless. Now, we're always going to look at other types of technologies and how they might complement what we're doing, especially for -- especially in areas where we have a commercial presence where we might want to -- obviously think about ways to strengthen and expand our leadership beyond maybe just an RNAi based approach.

Good. All right. So, let me then just close. I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call. We're obviously very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter. And what we did in 2020 was a remarkable year, despite the headwinds from COVID-19. But we're now on a new chapter with Alnylam P5x25, aiming to build the top five company in market capitalization over the next five years, with remarkable science and technology and innovation. So, thank you all and have a great day. Bye-bye now."

            "name": "Jeff Poulton",
            "content": "Thanks, Akshay and good morning, everyone. 2020 was an unprecedented year that underscores Alnylam's strong commercial capabilities and operational excellence, as we delivered robust top line growth while managing disciplined investment across our business. After commenting on our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results, I will also provide our financial guidance for 2021. As Tolga highlighted, U.S. sales of ONPATTRO increased 10% versus Q3 2020, and we're impacted by the following: Patient demand increased 13% driven by the addition of new patients on therapy, with patient compliance remaining consistent with Q3 when we returned to pre-pandemic levels. Inventory destocking during the quarter compared with modest stocking in Q3 reduced reported growth during the quarter. We ended the quarter with just over one week of inventory in the channel in the U.S. We're really pleased with the continued strength in our U.S. results, with two consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, following a pandemic challenge Q2 and with Q4 sales representing the highest level since launch. In our international markets, ONPATTRO performance remained strong with growth of 9% versus Q3 2020, primarily driven by increased patient demand broadly across Europe and Japan. Additionally, there was a modest benefit from inventory stocking in Japan at year-end. Turning to our results for GIVLAARI. We had a strong fourth quarter, generating $22.1 million in global net revenue, representing 33% growth compared to the third quarter of 2020. Revenue in Europe during 2020, as expected, was primarily generated from two markets, Germany and France. As we saw with ONPATTRO in year two of its commercialization, as we secure pricing and reimbursement, we anticipate additional markets for GIVLAARI coming online across Europe and Asia in 2021. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter and full year. Total product sales for 2020 were approximately $362 million, which were more than double 2019 with ONPATTRO delivering more than 80% growth versus 2019 and GIVLAARI contributing $55 million in its initial launch year. Net revenue from collaborations for the fourth quarter was $50.7 million primarily due to revenue recognized from our Vir and Regeneron collaborations and a $15 million increase around milestone from Novartis following the December EU approval of Leqvio. Gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 86% for the quarter, up from 83% in Q4 2019, primarily due to ONPATTRO inventory write-off that occurred in Q4, 2019. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses in the fourth quarter 2020 decreased compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to Q4 2019 having a high level of expense associated with clinical material manufactured for future clinical trials. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to increased investment in commercial and medical affairs activities to support the ongoing launches of ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI and the launch preparation activity for OXLUMO. Our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were $1,063 million in 2020, representing 11% growth versus 2019, which was significantly lower than the growth in combined at non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense in 2019, which was 31%. As I've noted on several occasions over the last year, this more moderate level of OpEx growth is one of the key levers supporting our path towards profitability. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter decreased by approximately $82 million compared to the same period in 2019, driven by strong top line growth and flat non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expense. Full year non-GAAP operating loss ended at approximately $649 million, which is $116 million favorable to our full year 2019 non-GAAP operating loss, consistent with our past guidance that 2019 would be our peak loss year. We ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.9 billion, up from $1.5 billion at the end of 2019. Cash was favorably impacted in 2020 by the $2 billion Blackstone strategic financing collaboration that we announced in Q2, which contributed approximately $800 million in financing this year, including $200 million in Q4 related to the initial drawdown of the debt facility with GSO Blackstone's credit arm. Now turning to our financial guidance for 2021. Starting with net product revenues, we are now transitioning to providing combined net product revenue guidance from ONPATTRO GIVLAARI, and OXLUMO. We anticipate combined net product revenues for these three products will be between $610 million and $660 million with the midpoint representing more than 75% growth compared to 2020. Vutrisiran approval is not expected until early 2022, so it was not factored into our guidance for product revenues this year. It is also worth noting that our guidance reflects the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which should decrease over time as the vaccine rollout progresses around the world.  Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties is a range between $150 million and $200 million with the midpoint of the range representing more than 30% growth from 2020. Growth in 2021 is expected to come primarily from our collaboration with Regeneron and royalties and milestones from Leqvio. Our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expense is a range between $1,175 million and $1,275 million. The midpoint of the guidance range represents a projected 15% increase compared with 2020. We anticipate SG&A growth will be modest as we generate operating leverage from our existing commercial infrastructure to support our three commercial products. We expect a higher rate of growth for R&D driven by investments in our two Phase 3 ATTR cardiomyopathy studies, APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B, as well as initiation of two robust Phase 2 studies in our AGT program for hypertension. Finally, achievement of the top line and non-GAAP operating expense guidance we have provided today, 2021 will deliver another year of improvement in our non-GAAP operating loss, as we continue to make progress on our path to delivering sustainable profitability. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Yvonne to review our goals for 2021. Yvonne?"

            "content": "Thanks Tolga and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis where we're advancing our two product candidates patisiran and vutrisiran. ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat the polyneuropathy associated hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. We're committed to expanding the products label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. Yeah. Thanks, Salveen. So, I think, we have a wonderful option to do an interim analysis in HELIOS-B. There are a number of approaches we can consider. But importantly, we want to use all data elements to inform that interim analysis. And we have data from the original patisiran APOLLO study itself. We now have data from HELIOS-A, nine months to 18 in patients with mix the ATTR disease with cardiomyopathy, those were exploratory data on BNP, which we've shared showing improvement in BNP. And we're going to get 18 months data later in the year that will encompass, not just BNP and echo data, but some technician's scan data and also can be to test another element. So there are a lot of datasets coming, that continue to inform us about the potential for RNAi based approaches for ATTR cardiomyopathy. And most importantly, next year, as we've just guided, we'll get APOLLO-B data on the six minute walk distance. And so, these are the elements that will go into our thinking. There are lots of options. We're excited about it and we will update you when we have finalized the approach. I was going to pick that. Okay. I'll pick something. I think we have the benefit of many, many interesting targets we're addressing -- to address a high unmet medical need. I trained as a rheumatologist, the SDH program, which we featured at R&D Day will address gout. Gout is a hugely prevalent global disorder, not only the rheumatologic disorder, but it can impact the kidneys and kidney function. So very, very important disease and one that's rapidly increasing in incidents by the way. So we would love to make a bet that the animal data are very encouraging. We can get over 95% knocked down at the target SDH, with over 50% reduction in peripheral blood urea levels. It be interesting, based on the Phase 1, which I think will be very informative and we can achieve a lot without Phase 1 to figure out how to position exactly and help the most patients. But as part of our broadening into common disease, that's another element beyond AGT and the NASH programs like SDH. John's talked about APP and outsiders. So, I'd pick the SDH program. Yvonne? Yeah. Paul, so, I mean, I think we are doing a good amount of work actually in neuromuscular disease. If we think about it, that front center, we've got all our work in ATTR amyloidosis, the polyneuropathy there is -- it's a peripheral neuropathy and so it is squarely a neuromuscular disorder. Of course, it's impactful in the hereditary situation. Increasingly we hear about neuropathy in wild type and I think that'll be an important area to think about as well. ONPATTRO is approved, of course, for the hereditary polyneuropathy in ATTR. So, that's one area. We're going to do a study of HELIOS-C which we intend to kickoff later in the year with vutrisiran to prevent the onset of this syndrome, hATTR amyloidosis more to come on that. And separately, we've got programs in ALS. There are a number of genetically validated targets in ALS that people are familiar with sort of one and others and that's under the basket or programs with Regeneron where we collaborate. So that's another neuromuscular disorder caused with Regeneron. We're also pursuing Myasthenia Gravis with the Cemdisiran and C5 anthropoid Pozelimab. So more details on those. The Regeneron collaborative programs to come I'm sure later in the year, actually. And beyond that, we are doing work in lots of additional neuromuscular disorders at a research and preclinical stage, that we don't necessarily share until the data mature enough to discuss. But I can assure you, there all programs ongoing in other disorders, including common inherited peripheral neuropathy, for example, we're interested in. So, lots going on in neuromuscular disease. And I think, we're pretty excited about the progress we've made and certainly the dent we've made in hATTR amyloidosis polyneuropathy. Sure. Ritu, when we looked at the original APOLLO data is very clear that potent significant reduction of TTR 80% or so. It was associated with remarkable outcomes for polyneuropathy and for the cardiac aspects in those with mixed disease, we think. And the drug was labeled for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR, which is right and proper. But as we looked at the detailed data, patients with very early disease with lesser disease burden did very well and all -- their M&A scores went down to single digit, so very close to zero, and that led to the hypothesis that what if you could give the drug even before the overt onset of disease in patients with very low or maybe no evident polyneuropathy and can we prevent the onset of symptomatic disease. And I think we feel very optimistic about that. Similarly, we now know that patients are being diagnosed or being identified as having TTR deposits in the heart before the onset, despite by technetium scan before the onset of clinical disease. And so, it's a very reasonable hypothesis, and I think one with a highlighted success. But if we can turn the tap off and substantially reduce TTR levels, that we can substantially reduce the occurrence of this disease and prevent its onset. So, that's what we're working on now. We intend to start the study, which will call HELIOS-C with vutrisiran later in the year, the subcutaneous injectable once every six months or so. And more detail to follow. But I think it's a very, very exciting hypothesis and how often in a rare disease to be getting a chance to try and help patients by preventing the onset of disease."

Please be advised that this call is being taped at the company's request. \n I'd now like to turn the call over to the company. \nChristine Lindenboom: Good morning. I'm Christine Lindenboom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Alnylam. With me today on the phone are John Maraganore, Chief Executive Officer; Andy Orth, Senior Vice President and Head of the U.S. business; Akshay Vaishnaw, President of R&D; Jeff Poulton, Chief Financial Officer; and Yvonne Greenstreet, President and Chief Operating Officer. \n For those of you participating via conference call, the accompanying slides can be accessed by going to the Events section of the Investors page of our website, investors.alnylam.com/events. \n During today's call, as outlined on Slide 2, John will provide some introductory remarks and provide some general context. Andy will provide an update on our global commercial progress. Akshay will review recent clinical and preclinical updates. Jeff will review our financials, and Yvonne will provide a brief summary of upcoming milestones before opening the call to your questions. \n I would like to remind you this call will contain certain remarks concerning Alnylam's future expectations, plans and prospects which constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in our most recent annual and quarterly reports and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our views only of the date of this recording and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaims any obligation to update such statements. \n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John. \nJohn Maraganore: Thanks, Christine, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. We believe the third quarter and recent period highlight the tremendous progress Alnylam has made as a global commercial organization with a highly productive R&D platform. \n Starting with our commercial execution, we saw strong ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI performance in Q3, which Andy Orth will review momentarily. We have continued confidence for the rest of this year with another upward revision of our ONPATTRO revenue guidance range for 2020 and another beat for GIVLAARI relative to estimates. \n Akshay will review our recent R&D progress shortly, but the highlight in the recent period is the positive CHMP opinions recommending approval of OXLUMO or lumasiran and LEQVIO or inclisiran, which set us up with the potential to achieve 4 RNAi therapeutic approvals and launches in less than 3 years, a truly remarkable achievement. \n You'll also hear from Jeff, on our financial performance and our progress towards achieving a self-sustainable financial profile. We believe we're on our way. Indeed, at Alnylam, we're focused on continued global commercial execution on potentially transformational medicines, excellence in productivity from our organic R&D efforts while maintaining a clear line of sight towards financial self-sustainability. In fact, this is what we envisioned when we established our Alnylam 2020 goals back in 2015, that we'd be a multiproduct, global company with a deep clinical pipeline for future growth and an organic product engine for sustainable innovation. That moment is now upon us, and we couldn't be prouder of our achievements toward those variable goals, which we're on track to actually exceed. And we couldn't be more excited for the next phase of Alnylam's evolution. \n We will lay out our multiyear vision soon. And we look forward to delivering on our potential as a top-tier biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing medicines with transformative potential to patients around the world. \n Now before I hand it over to Andy, I'd like to mention that we plan to host a virtual R&D Day event on the mornings of December 15 and 16, where we'll be reviewing progress across our pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics. We hope you'll be able to join us online. \n So with that, let's now turn to a review of our commercial and medical affairs progress. Andy? \nAndreas Orth: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our commercial performance in the third quarter as well as our medical affairs progress. \n For ONPATTRO, we achieved $82.5 million in global net product revenue, delivering 24% growth versus Q2 primarily driven by increased patient demand. As of September 30, over 1,150 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO treatment worldwide. \n Turning to the U.S., we saw notable increases in demand and new patients starting therapy. Also, with many patients now having successfully transitioned to alternate sites of care, including home care, we benefited from strong patient compliance, which also contributed to the rebound in revenues. We continue to see progress with new prescribers in the U.S. with cardiologists making up more than half of new prescribing physicians. In the United States, we also continue to see a steady rate of concomitant use of ONPATTRO with TTR stabilizers and expect this trend to continue to grow. \n Turning to the rest of the world. We made very encouraging progress with ONPATTRO in the third quarter with $43.5 million in revenues from ex U.S. markets. As noted last quarter, we have secured access in all priority markets in Western Europe, including Portugal, following our Q3 launch. We are also pleased with the continued growth in Japan, a country of strength for ONPATTRO. An important dynamic observed in ex U.S. is patients switching to ONPATTRO from stabilizers for the potential to halt or reverse disease progression in hATTR patients with polyneuropathy. This dynamic represents greater than 50% of new ONPATTRO patients outside the U.S. \n Our medical affairs team also remains committed to addressing the challenge of raising disease awareness and improving diagnosis rates of hATTR amyloidosis, including with Alnylam Act, our third-party genetic screening initiative in the U.S., Canada and Brazil. As of October, greater than 30,000 samples have been submitted, out of which approximately 1,800 have tested positive for apathogenic TTR mutation. We are encouraged by the recovery in Alnylam Act genetic testing volumes we've seen in recent months, and we believe these volumes will continue into the fourth quarter. \n We've also seen continued recovery in the number of PYP scans conducted for detection of cardiac amyloid. As you know, hATTR amyloidosis is a multi-systemic disease. And in the U.S., detection of cardiac amyloid is often the first step in an overall diagnosis of the disease as many of these patients also have polyneuropathy. ONPATTRO continues to be recognized as a breakthrough for patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, and we're honored to have received the highly prestigious Prix Galien USA award just last week. \n Moving on to GIVLAARI. We achieved $16.7 million in global net product revenues in the quarter, with over 150 patients now on commercial drug. Our progress with patient access in the U.S. has been strong, having now finalized 10 value-based agreements, or VBAs, with U.S. payers. We currently have confirmed access for over 90% of covered U.S. lives. We've not experienced any payer headwinds with GIVLAARI to date, and we're pleased to see the majority of plans adopt medical policies without restrictions to the number of baseline attacks. \n The CEMEA region saw great progress as well, with a successful ongoing GIVLAARI launch in Germany and named patient sales in other countries, including France. We're off to a very strong start for market access in CEMEA. In France, GIVLAARI received an improvement of medical benefit, or ASMR score of II, concluding it offers significant additional therapeutic value. Additionally, GIVLAARI obtained a Considerable Added Benefit rating in Germany with only 15% of all orphan drugs achieving such a high rating, and we secured a strong HTA rating in Italy. We're also excited to soon get our launch underway in Canada, following the recent approval and look forward to the completion of the ongoing review of our NDA in Japan, which was submitted in September. \n Finally, our commercial affairs teams are prepared for the upcoming launch of OXLUMO, the brand name for lumasiran. With a positive CHMP opinion in hand in the EU and an FDA PDUFA date just weeks away on December 3, we look forward to soon bringing our third RNAi therapeutic to patients around the world. We are well prepared with our OXLUMO supply chain and are ready to deploy our trained U.S. field team upon approval to help get this important medicine to the underserved primary hyperoxaluria type 1 or PH1 community. As with our other launches and guided by our patient access philosophy, we are hard at work making sure that patients who need OXLUMO are able to access it. Constructive conversations are ongoing with payers regarding VBA arrangements and we look forward to updating you further upon launch. \n In conclusion, the third quarter highlighted the broad capabilities of our commercial and medical affairs operations, including the continued growth of ONPATTRO, the continued launch of GIVLAARI and the preparation for the launch of OXLUMO. And we'll be watching with excitement as Novartis prepares to launch LEQVIA or inclisiran, which will mark the entry of RNAi therapeutics into a highly prevalent chronic disease indication. \n With that, I will now turn it over to Akshay to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Akshay? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we're advancing our 2 product candidates, patisiran and vutrisiran. \n Whilst ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat the polyneuropathy associated with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, we committed to expanding the product's label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end, we're conducting the APOLLO-B Phase III study. We continue to enroll patients in APOLLO-B and continue to expect completion of enrollment in 2021 due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. During Q3, we saw a pickup in the pace of enrollment and are still aiming to make up for lost time that we experienced during Q2 due to the pandemic. \n We're also advancing vutrisiran for the treatment of ATTR. Vutrisiran is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection. Here, we're conducting 2 Phase III studies. The first Phase III study is HELIOS-A, which is evaluating patisiran in hATTR patients with polyneuropathy. Enrollment is complete in HELIOS-A, and we remain on track to report top line results early next year. \n The second Phase III study of vutrisiran is HELIOS-B, which has been conducted in hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy, and this study is actively enrolling. On our ATTR roundtable in September, we shared modeling data suggesting the potential for a biannual dosing regimen for vutrisiran, which can further differentiate vutrisiran from other products currently approved or in development. We are actively advancing our efforts to bring a q6 monthly dose of the regimen to the market in parallel with our ongoing development of the q3 monthly regimen. \n Moving now to GIVLAARI, which is approved in the U.S., EU, Brazil and in Canada to treat acute hepatic porphyria, we're pleased with continued base supporting a positive risk benefit profile. For example, during the third quarter, we presented new interim data from the Phase I/II OLE study of GIVLAARI, showing maintenance clinical activity with continuous monthly dosing with a further numeric reduction in the annualized attack rate. The safety profile remains consistent with no new safety findings. \n I'll now turn to recent progress with lumasiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic that we're developing for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 or PH1. We're also thrilled to receive last month a positive CHMP opinion, recommending approval of lumasiran for the treatment of PH1 in all age groups. \n Recently, we presented full results from the ILLUMINATE-B study of lumasiran pediatric patients less than 6 years old. In the study, treatment with lumasiran led to a 71% mean reduction in spot urinary oxalate:creatine ratio from baseline to month 6, which was the primary endpoint of the study. Lumasiran also demonstrated positive results across secondary end points, including 50% of patients that achieved urinary oxalate levels at or below 1.5x the upper limit of normal. The most common drug-related adverse events were mild and transient injection site reactions reported in 17% of patients. The overall efficacy and safety profile of lumasiran was consistent with that observed in adults and children 6 years or older in the ILLUMINATE-A study. \n In both ILLUMINATE-A and B studies, we continued seeing encouraging evidence towards certain clinical events such as nephrocalcinosis and renal stone events or RSE. In ILLUMINATE-A, we previously reported on encouraging results with improvements in nephrocalcinosis and exploratory endpoint. At ASM, we showed some initial results from ILLUMINATE-A on improved RSEs with continued dosing. Based on the preliminary analysis for exploratory endpoints in ILLUMINATE-B, treatment with lumasiran led to bilateral or unilateral improvements in nephrocalcinosis in 44% of patients, with no patients worsening and eGFRs remaining stable. These results were similar to effects on nephrocalcinosis seen in ILLUMINATE-A study. \n We now await regulatory decisions and continue to believe that lumasiran will be approved by the FDA by the PDUFA action date of December 3 and by the EMA later this year as well. In the meantime, we continue to enroll patients in the ILLUMINATE-C Phase III study of lumasiran for the treatment of advanced PH1 patients of all ages with data expected in 2021. \n As you know, we have 2 additional late-stage programs that are in development with partners. This includes inclisiran in development for hypocholesterolemia, partnering with Novartis which is in registration in the United States and the EU. We're delighted that inclisiran has also received a positive CHMP opinion recommending approval of the drug in the EU for the treatment of adults with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. If approved, it will be marketed under the brand name LEQVIO. \n Our late-stage programs also includes fitusiran in development for hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors, partnered with Sanofi. Fitusiran is under evaluation in the Phase III Atlas program. \n Now in addition to our late-stage clinical programs, we believe we have also been making great progress with our early and mid-phase programs. Our partner Vir has initiated dosing of ALN-HBV02 or VIR-2218 with interferon in a Phase II study in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. We're very excited about the clinical data already presented for this molecule. As a reminder, Alnylam's retained the right to opt into a 50-50 share of the program prior to the start of Phase III. \n In our ALN-AGT program, we believe we have an opportunity to reimagine the treatment of hypertension, with tonic-controlled blood pressure. We look forward to presenting results from the Phase I study of ALN-AGT at the American Heart Association meeting next week. \n Also, in the recent period, we made progress with ALN-HSD, an investigational RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of NASH that is being advanced in collaboration with Regeneron. We were pleased to report today that we've initiated dosing in the Phase I study of ALN-HSD. \n We also continue to make strong progress on our many preclinical RNAi therapeutic opportunities beyond the liver. Notably, we continue to advance our CNS and ocular efforts with Regeneron. Our ALN-APP program remains on track for a CTA filing in mid-2021, and we're pleased that Regeneron has elected to exercise its co-development co-commercialization option on this program with Alnylam retaining the lead. \n ALN-COV is our investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the genome of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is partnered with Vir. Based on recent preclinical studies in a hamster model of COVID-19 infection, we've decided to generate additional animal model data prior to further program advancement. Accordingly, our IND filing time line will be delayed. \n As John previously mentioned, we look forward to highlighting all of this progress in an upcoming R&D day virtual event planned for December 15 and 16 later this year. \n With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results. Jeff? \nJeffrey Poulton: Thanks, Akshay, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting Alnylam's third quarter 2020 financial results. As Andy has already highlighted, it was a very strong quarter with outstanding results for both ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. \n Turning to our results first for ONPATTRO. We generated $82.5 million in global net ONPATTRO revenue for the quarter, which represents a return to growth driven by strong commercial execution and improving market conditions following Q2 which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. Global sales increased 24% versus the second quarter of 2020 and 79% compared with Q3 2019. U.S. sales of ONPATTRO increased 21% versus Q2 2020 with primary sources of growth from the following: Patient demand increased 14% driven by an improvement in patient compliance which returned to prepandemic levels as well as the addition of new patients during the quarter. \n Modest inventory stocking during the quarter compared with destocking during Q2, offset by a slight increase in gross to net sales reductions, favorably impacted Q3 growth by 7%. We ended the quarter with less than 2 weeks of inventory in the channel. We are really pleased with the strength of the results in the U.S. in the quarter, with Q3 sales representing the highest level since launch. \n In our international markets, ONPATTRO performance remained strong with growth of 27% versus Q2 of 2020, with primary sources of growth from the following: an increase in patient demand contributed 19% growth and was primarily from major markets in Europe, where we achieved recent PNR outcomes, including from Portugal. We also saw continued excellence from Japan. Source of new patients in our international markets remains balanced between patient switches from a TTR stabilizer and new patients naive to treatment. Additionally, there were onetime benefits associated with finalizing our price in France and with completing our initial access agreement in Canada, which contributed an additional 8% growth in the quarter. \n Turning to our results for GIVLAARI. We had a strong third quarter generating $16.7 million in global net revenue, representing 52% growth compared to the second quarter of 2020. This positive performance continues to be driven by ongoing launches in both the U.S. and Europe, and we now have more than 150 patients on commercial therapy globally. \n Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter. Net revenue from collaborations for the third quarter was $26.6 million primarily due to revenue recognized from our Vir and Regeneron collaborations. Gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 83% for the quarter, down from 93% in Q3 2019 primarily due to the current utilization of ONPATTRO full cost inventory while last year benefited from 0 cost ONPATTRO inventory as well as having a higher proportion of sales in the third quarter of 2020, coming from lower margins in international markets and a write-off of ONPATTRO inventory at our contract manufacturer. \n Our R&D expenses increased on a non-GAAP basis in the third quarter 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to the continued investment in advancing our late-stage pipeline programs. SG&A expenses increased on a non-GAAP basis in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to increased investment in commercial and medical affairs activities to support the ongoing launches of ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI and the launch of preparation activities for OXLUMO. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter decreased by approximately $12 million compared with the same period in 2019 driven by strong top line growth and moderate growth in operating expenses. We remain confident that 2019 represents our peak non-GAAP operating loss year, as we expect the trend of strong top line growth and moderate growth in operating expenses will continue for the remainder of the year. \n We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.8 billion, which includes $600 million in proceeds received in the second quarter of 2020 from the partial sale of future inclisiran royalties and issuance of common stock to Blackstone. \n Finally, turning to our financial guidance. We believe our results for the third quarter continue to demonstrate successful commercial execution in challenging circumstances. As a result of the strength of our Q3 ONPATTRO results, we are increasing our full year 2020 revenue guidance for ONPATTRO from $280 million to $300 million to $295 million to $310 million, representing a 4% increase from the midpoint of the prior range and the midpoint of the new range. \n Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and our guidance range for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses remain unchanged. However, we are expecting our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to end the year towards the upper end of our guidance range driven by an expected increase in Q4 in both R&D expense as we continue to make good progress in advancing key clinical stage programs and SG&A expense primarily driven by increased spend in support of our planned launch of OXLUMO. \n Please note we have revised the midpoint of our GAAP combined R&D and SG&A operating expense guidance range upward by $30 million primarily reflecting an increase associated with the contingent liability related to our arbitration with Ionis. \n Regarding cash, as mentioned in our second quarter call, we continue to believe our strategic financing collaboration with Blackstone adding up to $2 billion secures Alnylam's bridge towards a self-sustainable financial profile without the need for future equity financings. \n And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Yvonne to review our goals for the remainder of the year. Yvonne? \nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. As we look to close out 2020, we have a number of very important and exciting milestones lined up. For starters, we plan to continue our global commercialization of both ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. We're also expecting 2 additional regulatory approvals by the end of the year for lumasiran and inclisiran in both the U.S. and Europe. We expect to launch OXLUMO in the U.S. by year-end. We plan to continue enrollment in our ATTR cardiomyopathy studies, specifically APOLLO-B with patisiran and HELIOS-B with vutrisiran. \n We look forward to presenting additional clinical results from the ongoing Phase I trial of ALN-AGT in hypertension at the AHA meeting on November 13. And our partner, Regeneron, plans to initiate a Phase I study for cemdisiran in combination with pozelimab as a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. We also look forward to updating you on overall pipeline progress and strategy at our virtual R&D day event in December. \n As John noted earlier, these are very exciting times for Alnylam as we expect to exceed our original Alnylam 2020 guidance, exiting this year as a global multiproduct commercial company with a robust clinical pipeline for continued growth and an organic product engine delivering sustainable innovation. \n Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? \nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Yvonne. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Gena Wang from Barclays. \nHuidong Wang: And congrats on a very strong quarter. So one question regarding the commercial. First, for the ONPATTRO, do you expect for the 4Q, any thoughts on the inventory and where the major driver would be for the remaining of the year? And also for lumasiran, could you share with us the number of patients in early access program right now? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. So thank you, Gena. Let's -- I'll go to Andy and Jeff on the ONPATTRO question specifically. Regarding the lumasiran EAP, we're not giving out specifics on patients that are in the program. But I will say at a high level that, obviously, we do have patients in our expanded access program. And obviously, as lumasiran gets approved, we will be transitioning those patients onto commercial product on a country-by-country basis based on [ E&R ] being achieved. So that's where we'll leave that question. \n Andy, do you want to start? And then maybe, Jeff, you can comment on impact of inventory. But I think, Andy, you can give a bigger picture, Q4 expectations for ONPATTRO. \nAndreas Orth: Sure. Happy to. So as we noted, Q3, the growth was a mixture of both net new patient demand as well as a return to an increased compliance rate, specifically in the United States post that Q2 COVID impact. In Q4, we expect the growth to come primarily from that net new patient demand. And I'll turn it over to Jeff here on the inventory side. \nJeffrey Poulton: Yes. In terms of where we are in inventory, Gena, at the end of the third quarter for ONPATTRO, we're less than 2 weeks. And based on the distribution agreements we have, that range is typically in the 1 to 3 weeks range. So again, we're right, maybe right in the middle of that at this point. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America. \nTazeen Ahmad: So I wanted to get a sense of what information we should expect to see when the top line reads out from the HELIOS-A study early next year. And whatever that data does show, should we have any reason to think that there would be read-through into the population that you guys are studying in cardiomyopathy in the HELIOS-B study? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes, that's a great question, Tazeen, and I'll let Akshay handle it. Let me just start by saying we're very excited about vutrisiran because it is obviously going to enable a once-quarterly subcutaneous dose administration and potentially with additional work, we believe that we can introduce a biannual dosing regimen for patients with hATTR. Initially, it will be for the polyneuropathy setting with the HELIOS-A study. And then obviously, the focus will be in HELIOS-B and cardiomyopathy, both hereditary and wild-type. So Akshay, do you want to comment specifically on Tazeen's questions around what will be available at the top line and what potential read-through there will be on cardiomyopathy from HELIOS-A? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Thanks, John. So vis-\u00e0-vis HELIOS-A top line, we continue to believe that we'll have the data early next year. So that's very exciting. Our general habit when we present top line is to give the primary endpoint and relative secondaries and also, of course, the safety information on the study at a high level that's relevant to the report. We then report more fully on all the details at an upcoming scientific meeting after that. So those should be very informative as to how the study's done I think. \n And vis-\u00e0-vis the read-through into cardiomyopathy in HELIOS-B, if we harken back to APOLLO, the original APOLLO study with ONPATTRO, I think we learned a lot there about the impact on biomarkers, on the impact on [ echo ] findings in the heart in about 50% of the patients that had some evidence of cardiomyopathy within that study population for ONPATTRO. Now it remains to be determined exactly what proportion of patients have cardiac involvement here in HELIOS-A, but it will be exciting to see what the impacts have been on not just biomarkers, but other aspects of the disease in terms of the read-through, but very much dependent on the import population. \nJohn Maraganore: Thanks, Akshay. Does that -- Tazeen, does that answer your question? \nTazeen Ahmad: Yes. And when you say early next year, can you -- is it possible that the data would be in January? Or are you not providing that level of granularity? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. We're not going to provide that level of granularity, Tazeen. Our early period, as you know, is Q1 or Q2. But I think it's going to be early. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Paul Matteis from Stifel. \nPaul Matteis: Congrats on the quarter. Two questions. One, on vutrisiran, do you think you could bridge to the 6-month dose with just TTR lowering data and safety? And if so, what's the status of that clinical work? \n And then second, on lumasiran, on the Wall Street side, expectations of this drug are materially lower than that of givosiran, but I think some of the prevalence data for PH1 and 2, 3 that you've outlined are not that dissimilar to AHP's. So do you think givosiran is a realistic analogue for this? If so or if not, can you give any context? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Thanks, Paul, and great questions. I think for starters on the vutri q6 monthly, at a high level, it is certainly our belief that TTR lowering, combined with safety should support that approach. And we've been encouraged by engagement that we've had with regulators on that point. So I think that is certainly a path we would forward. And that would be consistent with other types of medicines and where dose regimens with a strong biomarker have been supported in future labeling. But obviously, that will require those data to be generated and then obviously submitted as part of an SNDA, and that would be the overall plan. \n Regarding OXLUMO and the market size, I'll let Andy comment a little bit on that further. But I think in general, when we look at the prevalence out there, we do believe that there are somewhere between 1,000 and 1,700 patients that are diagnosed and would be on label, if you will, patients that have mild to moderate PH1, which would be the initial label prior to then expanding it to include severe PH1. Andy, do you want to comment any further on the PH1 population and how we should think about lumasiran relative to GIVLAARI? \nAndreas Orth: Sure, John. Thanks. And as you said here, we're at this point, expecting that number somewhere between 1,000 and 1,700 that would be addressable and on-label. And overall market opportunity, we do see luma becoming a $500 million brand as it launches globally. And furthermore, right, we're excited to get out there and continue to shape this market, which is largely, to this point, pretty underserved. So we'll be learning a lot as we go. \nJohn Maraganore: Perfect. Does that answer your question, Paul? \nPaul Matteis: Yes, definitely. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Anita (sic) [ Anvita ] Gupta from Cowen. \nAnvita Gupta: This is Anvita on for Ritu today. Congrats on the quarter. So 2 questions from my side. Do you expect the fourth quarter new lockdown impact to be better or worse than the second quarter lockdown impact? And then secondly, understood that it's unclear how many cardiomyopathy patients would be in HELIOS-A study, but if you do plan to provide a subgroup cardiac analysis, what would be the primary function outcome of such an analysis? \nJohn Maraganore: Great. Well, I'm going to have Akshay answer the second part -- second question. But regarding the first question, let me just give a high level and then, Andy, you can comment. Look, at a high level, it's our belief that the medical system is more adapted at this point than it was in Q2. This is -- I'm saying this globally from a global perspective. And for the most part, we have seen a return to medical procedures and diagnostic testing done in -- globally. And therefore, we believe that even with shutdown of countries that will occur -- could occur as we go into Q4 to deal with the second wave or third wave, depending on where you are, we do expect the medical system to stay relatively open, relative to what it was like in Q2. Andy, do you want to add any more color to that? \nAndreas Orth: Yes. You've got it right, John. And furthermore, yes, the health care systems learned how to navigate and are showing that now with increased patient flows coming through maintenance of therapy for all levels of all patients continuing. But we have learned as well how to navigate this both on a promotional basis and continuity of care. So we're in a much better position here to weather what may come. \nJohn Maraganore: Fantastic. And Akshay, do you want to answer the HELIOS-A question? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Thanks, Anvita. We've got to remember that the primary goal of the study is to study the neuropathic aspects of the disease. So most of the endpoints are focused on that, certainly the primary endpoint and so forth. Now as I said before to a previous question, we will see how many cardiomyopathy patients or patients with true cardiomyopathy we have and report out all the data that we've collected, including biomarkers' echo. In terms of the primary functional outcome, as you put it, I guess the most important would be hospitalizations and deaths. But again, the study is not orientated towards kind of myopathy. So I don't know exactly how many of those events would have occurred, but we'll certainly be sharing them in due course. \nJohn Maraganore: Great. Does that answer your question? \nAnvita Gupta: Yes. \nOperator: Moving on to our next question, it's from Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. \nEmily Bodnar: This is Emily on for Alethia. In light of some of the recent progress and challenges in AAT, we're curious to see how you're thinking about plans going forward with [ small cell ] for RNAi. And do you think that combination with [indiscernible] are some of the long-range goal here? \nJohn Maraganore: So I'm not sure I heard you clearly on the first part, Emily, could you repeat what area are you commenting on specifically? \nEmily Bodnar: For AAT. In light of the early... \nJohn Maraganore: Alpha 1 antitrypsin. \nEmily Bodnar: Yes. \nJohn Maraganore: Okay. Got it. Absolutely. Yes. Look, I mean, we are excited about the potential for RNAi therapeutics to treat the liver disease associated with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and obviously have advanced a molecule alpha 1 -- ALN-AAT02 into development. Now earlier this year, we decided to partner that program together with Dicerna, who had their own independent effort as well. And so the combined effort between Alnylam and Dicerna now really is positioned to advance quite nicely and is in -- currently going to be -- is in a Phase I/II study. We'll be going into a Phase II/III in due course. \n So we're definitely excited about the opportunity, the way the partnership with Dicerna works is they will advance the program, 100% on their cost. We retain an opt-in right at the end of Phase III. So after all the risk is taken out, it's a free opt-in that we have to commercialize outside the U.S. market. So they'll keep the U.S., and we'll have the rest of world. So we are encouraging our colleagues at Dicerna to move swiftly with the program. And we do think that it becomes a very competitive opportunity to deal with the liver manifestations of the disease. Yvonne, anything else from your perspective to add as it relates to the Dicerna relationship? \nYvonne Greenstreet: No, John, I think you've covered it really well. \nJohn Maraganore: Right. Emily, does that answer your question? \nEmily Bodnar: Yes. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Ted Tenthoff from Piper Sandler. \nEdward Tenthoff: Just to congratulate you on continued excellent execution on the commercial side, especially going through difficult times. Really incredible to see just how, over the years, the vision to come together on how you're treating patients so effectively now. My question is related to fitusiran. A lot of the others were answered. But kind of what's the latest there? And we haven't really talked about that one as much recently just because there's been such a focus on the success with the other programs. But kind of how have you seen that market change a little bit over the last year? And where do you think that fits for Sanofi and for you guys going forward? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Thanks, Ted. Thanks -- first of all, for the comments, the congratulatory comments at the beginning. But on fitusiran, specifically, as you know, this is partnered, and as you mentioned, this is partnered with Sanofi. It's an RNAi therapeutic that targets antithrombin with the goal of increasing thrombin generation to improve hemostasis in patients with hemophilia A, hemophilia B with and without inhibitors. So it really is an attractive target product profile that we've constructed for the molecule. \n The program is in Phase III. It's being led by Sanofi. And we really rely on their continued execution of the program. So we hope to learn more in the next period. And so that's where it is. But I think for the most part, Sanofi really has been the driver of the program, and it's ultimately their call in terms of how they advance it. I don't know, Akshay or Yvonne, anything else to add to that from your perspectives? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: I think the only thing I'd add is to put the hemophilia landscape continues to need innovation. The adoption of Hemlibra shows that people are keen to find therapies other than multiple times a week intravenous factor replacement. And so I'm -- we're excited about fitusiran. And hopefully, there's a great home for it both in hemophilia A and B with and without inhibitors. But as John said, Sanofi would guide you on further progress with the program. \nEdward Tenthoff: Yes. Great. And can you just remind us your commercial interest there? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. So we have -- a very important point. So we have reciprocal -- we have royalties on fitusiran that range from 15% to 30% tiered to sales. So we have a -- we do have a significant and attractive financial interest in the product success. No question about it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Anupam Rama from JPMorgan. \nTessa Romero: This is Tessa on the call, John. So for -- with the APOLLO-B trial enrolling in ATTR-CM, I think you noted that enrollment is expected to complete in 2021. Sort of -- when considering a potential for an internal analysis here, what are the factors that you're considering? \n And then a second quick one, on the ALN-AGT update next week at AHA, can you just give us a quick sense on the size and scope of the data we'll be seeing at the conference there next week? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Terrific. Great questions. Let me just first clarify with APOLLO-B, which is the patisiran study in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR cardiomyopathy. That's a 12-month study. There is no interim analysis. You certainly are right regarding an interim analysis on HELIOS-B. So I just want to clarify what trial. \nTessa Romero: Yes. I'm sorry, John, I meant HELIOS-B. I misspoke. \nJohn Maraganore: Okay. That's what I wanted to clarify. Okay. So Akshay, do you want to comment on HELIOS-B a little bit in interim analysis? Akshay, are you on mute? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: The HELIOS-B interim analysis obviously is going to be very interesting to execute on. We've picked up enrollment very well this year after that slow Q2 with COVID. So as we further enroll in that study and also, importantly, completion of the APOLLO-B study, which will give important information on how our TTR reducing approaches impact cardiomyopathy. That information will be of strategic important, I think, in design of the interim analysis, which we're busy working on. And we'll share further details with you as enrollment picks up and we get more from APOLLO-B ultimately as the result reads out. \n With respect to your other question, Tessa, on ALN-AGT at American Heart next week. Yes, that's the first time we'll be sharing all the data that we have. There will be obviously safety. First and foremost, it's the first-in-human study. We'll also be sharing all the pharmacodynamic data on target knockdown and how that relates to change in blood pressure. We've reported that there are significant changes in blood pressure, but you'll see all the data in full, including dose dependence and the extent of change in systolic and diastolic, et cetera. \n And I think people will come away with the good insight into the frequency of dosing, and we obviously continue to believe that this will be an infrequently administered therapeutic for hypertension as we further develop it, which will give great advantage to this patient population where compliance is a huge, huge issue in about half the patients. So that's kind of a thumbnail on what's coming up next week. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Joel Beatty from Citi. \nJoel Beatty: Great. For Alnylam HSD in NASH and that recently initiated study, could you discuss the potential to evaluate any efficacy or biomarker endpoints? \nJohn Maraganore: Absolutely. Akshay, do you want to talk about the HSD Phase I? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. So that study is ongoing, will progress from healthy volunteers, dosing [ ascending ] fashion into a subset of patients with NASH itself. The target HSD, it doesn't circulate in the blood. So like a lot of our programs, we won't have direct biomarker data on the target itself, but there are a number of other downstream factors that we're looking at in terms of biomarkers, and we believe will be highly informative. We'll share more on that as the program progresses and the study progresses next year. And ultimately, I think what goes on in the liver in the NASH patients will be of great importance, both biochemically as well as radiological, and we'll share that as the study matures. \nJohn Maraganore: Yes, I'll just add to that, that we also have our upcoming R&D Day in December, and that will be an opportunity for us to do more of a deep dive on the HSD opportunity and the clinical plans for that program. But it is an exciting program because it is a genetically validated target for NASH. And we think it obviously holds great promise in that important indication. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Maury Raycroft from Jefferies. \nMaurice Raycroft: Congrats on the progress. First one is also on the ALN-AGT program. For the data next week, I'm just wondering if you're going to have some data from the additional exploratory cohorts, including obese patients, a soft control cohort and our combo cohort as well. And if not, I guess, what's the latest status with those cohorts? How meaningful are they? And then what are next steps with the program? \nJohn Maraganore: Okay. Great questions. I mean the simple answer is you won't see those cohorts next week because they haven't been dosed yet. But Akshay, do you want to comment a little bit on the next steps for those cohorts and just the completion of the Phase I? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. So Maury, obviously, the study did get delayed in part through Q2 with COVID and so forth, which hit that study like so many others. We've picked up steam. We haven't commenced dosing as John said yet, but we're in place now to start dosing those cohorts and that will be ongoing through the rest of the year. And in due course, we'll report where we'll give a further update on the Phase I study early next year in terms of scientific meeting, where we can bring that information to everybody. But most importantly, next year, I think beyond the clear antipertensity effect, which we believe we've established and everyone will share in next week at AHA, the most important thing is to take that observation into the Phase II setting, and we're very busy aligning on the design of the Phase II effort and getting going with that next year. So that's the crucial next goal. \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. And I would just add, Maury, that again, our upcoming R&D Day, we will do a deep dive on the hypertension opportunity because we think it is obviously an exciting prospect for new innovation coming from the Alnylam pipeline. \nOperator: Moving on to our next question, it comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. \nSonya Bhatia: This is Sonya on for Salveen. So just really a quick question on the progress of your [ extrahep ] portfolio, particularly there with the ALN-APP. When can we expect first data there? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Thanks, Sonya. Well, I'm glad to get a question like this, and I'm sure Akshay is as well. Let me just say at the start and remind everybody that one of the exciting breakthroughs that we achieved over the last couple of years is the delivery, the efficient and highly durable delivery of RNAi therapeutics to the CNS and other tissues as well, including the eye and more recently the lung. So we are obviously quite excited about that because it opens up new prospects for our pipeline growth outside of the liver. \n And in the setting of the CNS itself, of course, it is really an opportunity to go after the many, many neurodegenerative diseases that are caused by gain-of-function mutations or gain-of-function expression of proteins in the CNS with a dose regimen that we think intrathecally can be given once every 6 months, if not less frequently. So it is a great opportunity for the company, and we've partnered with Regeneron on a 50-50 basis in that regard. Akshay, do you want to specifically talk about APP and the next steps? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. So speaking of Regeneron and APP, it was great that they've partnered with us. We'll be taking the program with them into Phase I next year. We continue to guide that we'll enter Phase I in the middle of next year or so. And further guidance on when we'll actually see data will be given once we've gotten going with that Phase I study. \n And the other thing is, of course, this is a very interesting time with the aducanumab review ongoing, and there's a lot of excitement around what those data are showing. So it would be interesting to see the outcome of that on Friday. But we continue to believe in APP as a very important target for Alzheimer's disease and beyond. And not only can we tackle the a-beta deposits, we believe, in the extracellular space, but tackling the target outsource and turning off the tap, so to speak, and all the intraneuronal effects of a-beta will also be impacted. So we think this could have a really significant contribution to play. So excited to get into Phase I next year, and we'll update on data expectations after that. \nJohn Maraganore: And Yvonne, do you want to comment a little bit on how this works within our Regeneron relationship vis-\u00e0-vis our lead, et cetera? That might be a useful context. \nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. No, that's great. I mean we were delighted that Regeneron have opted in. We're actually going to be leading the program, and we're very excited about that and obviously, share the economics with Regeneron, but we're very excited to be leading the first CNS program out of our platform. \nOperator: We'll now out take -- our next questions comes from Alan Carr from Needham & Company. \nAlan Carr: Can you give a little more detail around the -- your COVID candidate? What exactly -- where things stand, what work you need to do around that? I'm kind of curious about where things stand. I believe you were looking at other candidates too and other targets around COVID-19. Can you give us a more comprehensive update around that program [indiscernible]? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Happy to, Alan. And let me start and then Akshay, you can comment as well. We're -- we continue to be committed to advancing our COVID program. Obviously, there's the opportunity of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which is an RNA genome, directly with an RNAi therapeutic is certainly an appropriate thing to do from a technology perspective and our recent advances in [ lung ] delivery obviously have come just in time to help us advance this program. \n We've done some work in the Syrian hamster model, which is an established model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. And we have seen antiviral activity in the model specifically. And we're encouraged by that. But we want to do more model work before we commit to specific IND timing and specific clinical development plan so that we can understand the best place to position this molecule in the context of emerging therapies for the treatment of COVID-19. \n And we're going to play the long game on this program as it relates to how it could play into the management of COVID-19 in the future, which we think will be an opportunity longer term for therapies, just like there is for diseases like flu. But that's how we're thinking about it, and those are the specific results. And we look forward to presenting those at some point in the future. Akshay, anything to add to that? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: No, I think you covered it, John. That's exactly right. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Patrick Trucchio from H.C. Wainwright. \nPatrick Trucchio: With the understanding that the closure in the U.S. election may take some time, I'm wondering if you can comment how a potential change in the administration could impact health care policy and what impact, if any, this could have on Alnylam's R&D or commercial execution in the U.S. in 2021 and beyond. \nJohn Maraganore: Okay. Great. So yes, obviously, we are hoping that there is a completion and clarity on the election here in the coming days or coming weeks. And I think it's great to see our democracy going through the process of counting all the votes, which is the way democracies need to work. And so it's great to see that happening. And we certainly stand by to sort of see how it emerges overall. \n But I think that regardless of the outcome, whether Trump or Biden get elected, we believe that there's going to be a dialogue and continue to be a dialogue around drug pricing politically. But I think that Alnylam is very well positioned in that dialogue because of the type of innovation that we consistently deliver from our platform and I think the type of medicines that we bring forward, the type of ways that we've engaged with payers around sharing of risk and obviously, delivery of value ultimately. These are the types of approaches that we think will bode well for continued success and continued ability to get the value of our innovation recognized by governments and payers around the world. \n So we do think that we're in a good position to -- regardless of the outcome, regardless of the policies that emerge, to be able to continue to do what's right for patients first and foremost and obviously deliver on the value of that from our platform. So we think we're in a good place, Patrick, on that overall. We certainly have been active in helping different stakeholders in this discussion, and we will remain active as a company in this discussion. But we are generally optimistic, and maybe there will be some changes that come -- that occur, but we think we're very well equipped to do well through all of that. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Leland Gershell from Oppenheimer. \nLeland Gershell: I echo others' comments on the solid execution. Just a question on the reimbursement and progress with OXLUMO having been through the VBA discussions with others, on GIVLAARI recently, just wanted to ask if you have any comments on any differences you're seeing in that progress and if you would expect it to be -- basically be on pace with where you were with GIVLAARI as you execute on OXLUMO. \nJohn Maraganore: Yes, that's a great question, Leland. Let me just start by saying how proud I am of our access teams around the world with the great job they've done with ONPATTRO, the great job they're doing right now with GIVLAARI and right now, we have over 30, just about -- actually just about 30 value-based agreements that we signed with commercial payers in the U.S., and we continue to work with -- in global markets very effectively with the payer stakeholders. And we've shown a lot of -- we've demonstrated and brought a lot of innovation forward on these VBAs, both the general structure of them and how we share risk around performance of the product. But also on some of the new features that we've introduced, like the prevalence-based adjustment model that we've introduced on GIVLAARI. \n So with that as context, Andy, do you want to get more specific on OXLUMO? And obviously, we can't share all the details that we'll share when we launch the product, but maybe you can give some context on how our discussions are going. \nAndreas Orth: Sure, sure. So similar to ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI, we will and are pursuing an aggressive value-based agenda with all payers globally. And feedback from early days on that front has been exceptionally positive. So we expect similar results in terms of open access for OXLUMO as we had with GIVLAARI and ONPATTRO, which are really, really strong. So we'll continue our industry leadership here. \nOperator: Moving on to our next question, comes from Mani Foroohar from SVB Leerink. \nMani Foroohar: A quick one, I guess, starting on for Jeff. Talk a little bit about the increasing compliance as a driver of ONPATTRO performance. I presume some of that is from patient hesitance that come in for their IV during the height of the pandemic. Has that compliance trend reversed entirely? Are there still a little bit of juice for next quarter and beyond? \n And then for Akshay, there's been a lot of talk about what HELIOS-A tells us about HELIOS-B. I'm inclined to agree that maybe APOLLO-B is the more useful leap forward. Can you give us a little detail on how you think about taking the option on HELIOS-B interim? Is the most appropriate approach to wait until you have APOLLO-B data to inform that? Or do you think that just data that you gather on a blinded basis from HELIOS-B itself as the study proceeds will provide you with the information you need to decide if and when to take that interim? \nJohn Maraganore: Okay. Those are great -- those are 2 great questions, Mani. Why don't we start with Jeff and then we'll have Akshay talk about the Cardi B, as we call them collectively strategery and how that relates to the interim. So Jeff, do you want to start first on the compliance question? \nJeffrey Poulton: Yes, sure. So just to remind you on the results that Andy commented on earlier and I did as well, we grew 21% in Q3 in the U.S. for ONPATTRO versus Q2, 14% of that was demand related, and that was a mix of new patients coming on to therapy and the increased compliance that we saw in Q3. And that returned in the U.S. to prepandemic levels, Mani. So I don't see no -- sort of a big impact of that on growth going forward. And just a reminder, outside the U.S., we didn't see the same impact on compliance in Q2 that we saw in the U.S. So outside the U.S., the health care systems seem to do a better job of maintaining patients on therapy and compliance wasn't impacted. So again, I don't see a big impact of increased compliance going forward on our growth rates. \nJohn Maraganore: And just before I hand it over to Akshay, I would just add that the side of care adjustments that we made in Q2 have, I think, bolstered any potential downside of pandemic resurgence, the third wave that might happen in the U.S., et cetera. So I think that we're very -- we're better sheltered in Q4 and beyond to not -- if things get much worse, to not have any significant impact from what we saw like in Q2. Akshay, do you want to now handle the more complicated but interesting question that Mani has asked? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Would love to, John. The question, Mani, focused on APOLLO-B and the read-through to HELIOS-B. And I agree that that's a very important aspect of the work we're doing and the insights that we'll glean there will be very important for us. I'd also say that continuing work with patients from APOLLO itself and the open-label extension study gives us important insights into long-term outcomes on neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. We've had a number of studies ongoing out in the field and Dr. Gilmore from the U.K. group just published a paper in Jack imaging on reversal of amyloid deposition in TTR cardiomyopathy patients of the inherited type. And I think that says something important, and we continue to work with groups like that to understand what they're seeing and the outcomes that they're seeing both clinically and radiologically. \n HELIOS-A, as we discussed earlier, to your point, it's not as rich a data set for cardiomyopathy but there could be some important information there. And then APOLLO-B itself. And I think ultimately, we'll just have to see on the timings of all these data points and how they factor in. And as we get greater insight into the APOLLO-B readout, I think we can guide on what the exact HELIOS-B interim will be and use all these points of information to guide that. But I think we're fortunate because there's so much to teach us about what to expect ultimately from HELIOS-B and that should lead to a very informed structure around the interim. \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Absolutely agree. Does that answer your question, Mani? \nMani Foroohar: Yes. That's great. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Navin Jacob from UBS. \nJonathan Lim: This is Jon on for Navin. So with respect -- you've alluded to the COVID recovery across geographies. And we're curious if COVID has caused any shift in payer mix for your assets on GIVLAARI and ONPATTRO. We're also curious as to how -- as to which analogue might be better for us as we prepare for the OXLUMO launch. Would it be more like GIVLAARI with a bit more Medicaid or perhaps more like ONPATTRO? Any color would be appreciated. \nJohn Maraganore: Those are great questions. I'm going to hand them right over to Andy to answer. \nAndreas Orth: Thanks. So let's start with the first one. So changes in payer mix. Specifically, in the United States, we're seeing little to no changes in payer mix. Remember that ONPATTRO is the vast majority Medicare. And at this point in time, GIVLAARI is pretty early days here, but largely commercial, and we're not seeing any material changes to those due to COVID. And then the second question, with OXLUMO, in terms of payer mix analogue, actually, neither are perfect but of the 2, it's certainly going to be less of a Medicare population, right? We think OXLUMO is more of a commercial and/or Medicaid insurance one. So that's, I guess, a little bit more similar to GIVLAARI, if that helps. \nOperator: Moving on to our next question, comes from Vincent Chen from Bernstein. \nVincent Chen: Well, probably a little far out, but going over to CNS side of things for a moment. I was wondering if I could ask you for sort of your latest thoughts on ALN-HTT in Huntington's, and how that might offer advantages over competitive programs in this space, most notably Roche and Ionis' tominersen. Are there reasons to expect the ALN-HTT and the siRNA platform from CNS will outperform the Roche-Ionis program from a perspective of sort of the degree of knockdown achieved, the breadth or the -- ultimately the efficacy? \nJohn Maraganore: So let me hand it over to Akshay. Thanks for the question, Vincent. I'll just start by saying that, obviously, the -- what we've seen with our platform in the CNS has been pretty consistent with what we've seen in the platform with liver. And when you compare an RNAi therapeutic approach in the liver compared to an antisense oligo-based approach, what you see is you see deeper, better knockdown and much greater durability in the liver. We've seen that all the way through marketed products. And we see similar profiles in nonhuman primates between antisense oligos and RNAi therapeutics. \n So by all accounts, we expect a deeper knockdown potential with our platform and a much more durable approach that would allow for less frequent intrathecal administration, which, of course, is a important -- is a burden in the administration of oligos in the CNS. But there's some more to that -- there's more to the ACT opportunity that I'm going to leave to Akshay to comment on specifically on exon 1. Akshay? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. And before I go to exon 1, the only thing I would add to what you said in terms of pharmacologic attributes shown on potency, durability, of course, but also just much better by distribution based on our preclinical findings. We think that the RNAi approach gives much better knockdown and deeper brain structures like the basal ganglia, which is very easy to get to for Huntington's predominantly. \n So those pharmacologic attributes and then there's the actual target strategy itself. And there's an abundance of literature now or significant literature suggesting that exon 1 itself has a very important role to play in the pathology of the disease and there are truncated transcripts that come off exon 1 that appear in and of themselves to be neurotoxic. And then there are protein aggregates made -- what protein made from the truncated exon 1 transcript that aggregates and causes pathology. \n So going for an exon 1 agnostic approach may not be the strongest, and we focused on a exon 1 approach so we can have the best approach to the target that the literature currently would support and the [indiscernible] support, and that along with the pharmacologic, actually, as we've discussed, I think, really sets us up for a very attractive profile. We look forward to going to the clinic. \nJohn Maraganore: Does that answer your question, Vincent? \nVincent Chen: Yes. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question. It comes from Luca Issi from RBC. \nLuca Issi: Congrats on the commercial execution here. Maybe going back to Cardi B for a second, but maybe with a little bit more of a commercial angle here. Do you think that actually APOLLO-B would be sufficient for doc to change their prescribing habits from Vyndaqel to ONPATTRO? Or do you think the most doc will actually need to wait for HELIOS-B, given that again, APOLLO-B is just power for 6 minutes walking, you're still dealing with an IV drug? Any thoughts there would be helpful. \n Maybe second question. We've seen a few of your competitors actually going after ENaC for cystic fibrosis. Wondering if one, you have any thoughts on that approach? And two, what's your appetite to potentially enter that race? \nJohn Maraganore: Okay. Well, great questions. I think, obviously, the first one, Andy, I'd like you to answer. I'll just start by reminding everybody that, obviously, the APOLLO-B study is a study of patisiran, which is a nonbranded name for ONPATTRO, which is an investigational agent right now, and it's being studied in patients with both wild-type and hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. And that study uses the 6-minute walk distance as the primary endpoint of 12 months. And then the HELIOS-B study with vutrisiran uses the -- uses CV hospitalization and mortality as a primary endpoint at 30 months treatment. And so that's an important distinction. \n But in general, and then Andy, you should comment, we do feel very encouraged that if APOLLO-B is positive and if we're able to get an approval with the FDA based on the study and other regulators, that this will be a very attractive alternative for the cardiology community to treat their patients with both hereditary and wild-type ATTR. And while the ultimate presentation of a TTR silencer with a quarterly or 6 monthly subcu approach will be certainly much more exciting in the future, in the meantime, ONPATTRO with its broader label will be an important treatment option for patients. Andy, do you want to comment a little bit on our perspective on that more -- in more detail? \nAndreas Orth: Sure, John. Happy to. So we're very excited about the APOLLO-B potential here and the launch into hereditary and wild-type cardiomyopathy. To note, in the United States today, cardiologists are currently having very strong experience with ONPATTRO in treating the polyneuropathy. And upon approval, we do expect a meaningful amount of physicians to choose a TTR silencer versus a stabilizer. And furthermore, there also will be physicians who don't decide to choose. And frankly, they use both. And so reimbursement will be something we'll be proactively looking to solve on that front as well. \nJohn Maraganore: Terrific. And then, Akshay, do you -- or maybe, Yvonne, do you want to comment a little bit on, from a portfolio standpoint, how we think about programs and ENaC, for example, and is that -- and whether or not that's an area that we would consider? \nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, sure, John. Look, I think what's been incredible about our platform is actually the kind of productivity that we've had. And we're increasingly demonstrating our ability to access tissues in addition to liver, CNS and ocular. And many of you may be aware that -- our [indiscernible] history with lung delivery as well with an RSV program many years ago. So we have a tremendous amount of opportunity in front of us. And clearly, we need to think how we prioritize the best opportunities for us. We have a lot on our plate to move forward from an execution perspective. But we remain open about continuing to explore the broad utility of our platform going forward. But nothing to share specifically on cystic fibrosis at this time. John, do you want to add anything? \nJohn Maraganore: No. I don't know, Akshay, anything you want to add to that? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: No. I mean part of the ALN COVID assets, obviously, lung delivery has come front and center. We have that preliminary data set about a year ago now showing we've achieved lung delivery, which is very exciting. And just as we've done with many other settings and organs, the idea of genetically validated targets comes into the mix. And we have knowledge of a number of very interesting genetically validated targets beyond ENaC itself and cystic fibrosis. So this really is the new [ vista ] that's forming before us, and it will be exciting to take it on beyond the COVID effort itself. \nOperator: We will now take our next question from Zhiqiang Shu. \nZhiqiang Shu: Congrats on the strong quarter here. Quick question. Yes. Quick question on patisiran, I guess, on APOLLO-B. Have you guys looked at any, I guess, clinical or translational data in terms of the correlation between baseline disease severity and the potential response to the drug? 6 minutes walk or hospitalization, I recall, the -- stabilizer actually has a different trend when it comes to different patient population. And then second question quickly on AGT program, given the drug will be -- potentially target a large population, patient population, have you guys started to think about partnership opportunities there? \nJohn Maraganore: Right. Well, let me start with -- let me just -- Akshay, you should take the APOLLO-B, very interesting APOLLO-B question. But let me just -- on the AGT comment real quickly. Our intent with the AGT program is to advance it to the market. We certainly are a company that as we bring the medicine like AGT forward, we're going to have an opportunity to -- at that stage of our growth in company to commercialize a medicine like that. If we, at that point in the future, choose to bring on a promotional partner, we may do that. But our key goal is to retain the program and develop it ourselves, and that's how we're focused on it. And so that's what we're doing there. But Akshay, do you want to answer the APOLLO-B question that was asked? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Sure. \nYvonne Greenstreet: Actually John, maybe if I could just comment really quickly on the point you made. I think the other thing to remember is with our sort of TTR suite of opportunities. We are actually building up a very robust commercial footprint in the cardiovascular arena, so that's something else that we can consider as we plan for AGT. \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Yes, absolutely. I agree completely. Thanks for jumping in on that, Yvonne. Akshay, do you want to then deal with the APOLLO-B question? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Zhiqiang, good question about APOLLO-B. Now of course, there's an ongoing blinded study. So we don't sort of look at all the data currently, and that's as it should be to maintain study integrity. So I can't comment on relationships between various parameters. I can tell you that there are very good associations between [ neuropath ] association stage and 6-minute walk distance. We know that from prior work, ours and other people's work. And we know how that relates to biomarkers, such as BNP and other imaging biomarkers. \n In terms of -- the other aspect to your question was outcomes with and without prior tafamidis. And there, we can look at older information from APOLLO itself, the original study for patisiran/ONPATTRO, the Phase III study. And what was very clear there actually is whether patients had previously been on a stabilizer, whether it was tafamidis or diflunisal or had never been on a stabilizer, their outcome was equivalent. And that is, on average, their mNIS+7, then your [ opti ] endpoint improved, their quality of life improved. \n So that's very encouraging for us that our mechanism of actions seems to be potent and whilst it wasn't a head-to-head study, everything pointed to ONPATTRO really having a profound impact and resulting in improvement of disease in the context of the APOLLO study. And we believe that's one of the very attractive features of the drug. We know from tafamidis, from the Phase III ATTRACT study that whilst clearly, there was benefit in terms of hospitalization and mortality, all the curves went down. It's just the curve for tafamidis didn't go down as much as it did for placebo, which is a good thing for patients. But sadly, disease progressed. It was quite clear whichever endpoint you looked at including 6-minute walk distance and walk distance declined over time in the active group as opposed to placebo. \n So if we can stabilize 6-minute walk distance, I think that's great. If we can actually improve 6-minute walk distance, even better. The recently published study by Professor Gilmore and others from the U.K. group in Jack imaging where they took a cohort of cardiomyopathy patients and they were given patisiran. At 1 year comparing to historic controls, they saw stabilization of 6-minute walk distance there and regression of amyloid, something that's -- neither of those things that have been seen with tafamidis up until now. \n So we think the fundamental mechanism of action to remove the pathogenic protein to a greater extent outcomes in neuropathy that we know well. And also some of the preliminary evidence emerging around the cardiomyopathy in use of ONPATTRO in investigational setting all suggest that we look forward to stabilizing disease and hopefully improving outcomes. \nJohn Maraganore: Zhiqiang, does that answer your question? \nZhiqiang Shu: Yes. \nOperator: At this time in moment, I would like to turn the conference back to the company for any additional or closing remarks. \nJohn Maraganore: Okay. Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on this call. Look, Alnylam is at a very exciting stage of its continued growth in development as a leading biotech. We're really pleased with our Q3 results and our execution from our commercial and R&D teams. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress at our R&D Day in December. Until then, I hope you all stay safe and healthy, and have a great day. Bye-bye now. \nOperator: And that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jeffrey Poulton",
            "content": "Thanks, Akshay, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting Alnylam's third quarter 2020 financial results. As Andy has already highlighted, it was a very strong quarter with outstanding results for both ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. \n Turning to our results first for ONPATTRO. We generated $82.5 million in global net ONPATTRO revenue for the quarter, which represents a return to growth driven by strong commercial execution and improving market conditions following Q2 which was negatively impacted by the pandemic. Global sales increased 24% versus the second quarter of 2020 and 79% compared with Q3 2019. U.S. sales of ONPATTRO increased 21% versus Q2 2020 with primary sources of growth from the following: Patient demand increased 14% driven by an improvement in patient compliance which returned to prepandemic levels as well as the addition of new patients during the quarter. \n Modest inventory stocking during the quarter compared with destocking during Q2, offset by a slight increase in gross to net sales reductions, favorably impacted Q3 growth by 7%. We ended the quarter with less than 2 weeks of inventory in the channel. We are really pleased with the strength of the results in the U.S. in the quarter, with Q3 sales representing the highest level since launch. \n In our international markets, ONPATTRO performance remained strong with growth of 27% versus Q2 of 2020, with primary sources of growth from the following: an increase in patient demand contributed 19% growth and was primarily from major markets in Europe, where we achieved recent PNR outcomes, including from Portugal. We also saw continued excellence from Japan. Source of new patients in our international markets remains balanced between patient switches from a TTR stabilizer and new patients naive to treatment. Additionally, there were onetime benefits associated with finalizing our price in France and with completing our initial access agreement in Canada, which contributed an additional 8% growth in the quarter. \n Turning to our results for GIVLAARI. We had a strong third quarter generating $16.7 million in global net revenue, representing 52% growth compared to the second quarter of 2020. This positive performance continues to be driven by ongoing launches in both the U.S. and Europe, and we now have more than 150 patients on commercial therapy globally. \n Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter. Net revenue from collaborations for the third quarter was $26.6 million primarily due to revenue recognized from our Vir and Regeneron collaborations. Gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 83% for the quarter, down from 93% in Q3 2019 primarily due to the current utilization of ONPATTRO full cost inventory while last year benefited from 0 cost ONPATTRO inventory as well as having a higher proportion of sales in the third quarter of 2020, coming from lower margins in international markets and a write-off of ONPATTRO inventory at our contract manufacturer. \n Our R&D expenses increased on a non-GAAP basis in the third quarter 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to the continued investment in advancing our late-stage pipeline programs. SG&A expenses increased on a non-GAAP basis in the third quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 primarily due to increased investment in commercial and medical affairs activities to support the ongoing launches of ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI and the launch of preparation activities for OXLUMO. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter decreased by approximately $12 million compared with the same period in 2019 driven by strong top line growth and moderate growth in operating expenses. We remain confident that 2019 represents our peak non-GAAP operating loss year, as we expect the trend of strong top line growth and moderate growth in operating expenses will continue for the remainder of the year. \n We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.8 billion, which includes $600 million in proceeds received in the second quarter of 2020 from the partial sale of future inclisiran royalties and issuance of common stock to Blackstone. \n Finally, turning to our financial guidance. We believe our results for the third quarter continue to demonstrate successful commercial execution in challenging circumstances. As a result of the strength of our Q3 ONPATTRO results, we are increasing our full year 2020 revenue guidance for ONPATTRO from $280 million to $300 million to $295 million to $310 million, representing a 4% increase from the midpoint of the prior range and the midpoint of the new range. \n Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and our guidance range for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses remain unchanged. However, we are expecting our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to end the year towards the upper end of our guidance range driven by an expected increase in Q4 in both R&D expense as we continue to make good progress in advancing key clinical stage programs and SG&A expense primarily driven by increased spend in support of our planned launch of OXLUMO. \n Please note we have revised the midpoint of our GAAP combined R&D and SG&A operating expense guidance range upward by $30 million primarily reflecting an increase associated with the contingent liability related to our arbitration with Ionis. \n Regarding cash, as mentioned in our second quarter call, we continue to believe our strategic financing collaboration with Blackstone adding up to $2 billion secures Alnylam's bridge towards a self-sustainable financial profile without the need for future equity financings. \n And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Yvonne to review our goals for the remainder of the year. Yvonne? Yes. In terms of where we are in inventory, Gena, at the end of the third quarter for ONPATTRO, we're less than 2 weeks. And based on the distribution agreements we have, that range is typically in the 1 to 3 weeks range. So again, we're right, maybe right in the middle of that at this point. Yes, sure. So just to remind you on the results that Andy commented on earlier and I did as well, we grew 21% in Q3 in the U.S. for ONPATTRO versus Q2, 14% of that was demand related, and that was a mix of new patients coming on to therapy and the increased compliance that we saw in Q3. And that returned in the U.S. to prepandemic levels, Mani. So I don't see no -- sort of a big impact of that on growth going forward. And just a reminder, outside the U.S., we didn't see the same impact on compliance in Q2 that we saw in the U.S. So outside the U.S., the health care systems seem to do a better job of maintaining patients on therapy and compliance wasn't impacted. So again, I don't see a big impact of increased compliance going forward on our growth rates."

            "name": "Yvonne Greenstreet",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. As we look to close out 2020, we have a number of very important and exciting milestones lined up. For starters, we plan to continue our global commercialization of both ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. We're also expecting 2 additional regulatory approvals by the end of the year for lumasiran and inclisiran in both the U.S. and Europe. We expect to launch OXLUMO in the U.S. by year-end. We plan to continue enrollment in our ATTR cardiomyopathy studies, specifically APOLLO-B with patisiran and HELIOS-B with vutrisiran. \n We look forward to presenting additional clinical results from the ongoing Phase I trial of ALN-AGT in hypertension at the AHA meeting on November 13. And our partner, Regeneron, plans to initiate a Phase I study for cemdisiran in combination with pozelimab as a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases. We also look forward to updating you on overall pipeline progress and strategy at our virtual R&D day event in December. \n As John noted earlier, these are very exciting times for Alnylam as we expect to exceed our original Alnylam 2020 guidance, exiting this year as a global multiproduct commercial company with a robust clinical pipeline for continued growth and an organic product engine delivering sustainable innovation. \n Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? No, John, I think you've covered it really well. Yes. No, that's great. I mean we were delighted that Regeneron have opted in. We're actually going to be leading the program, and we're very excited about that and obviously, share the economics with Regeneron, but we're very excited to be leading the first CNS program out of our platform. Yes, sure, John. Look, I think what's been incredible about our platform is actually the kind of productivity that we've had. And we're increasingly demonstrating our ability to access tissues in addition to liver, CNS and ocular. And many of you may be aware that -- our [indiscernible] history with lung delivery as well with an RSV program many years ago. So we have a tremendous amount of opportunity in front of us.

            "name": "John Maraganore",
            "content": "Thanks, Christine, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. We believe the third quarter and recent period highlight the tremendous progress Alnylam has made as a global commercial organization with a highly productive R&D platform. \n Starting with our commercial execution, we saw strong ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI performance in Q3, which Andy Orth will review momentarily. We have continued confidence for the rest of this year with another upward revision of our ONPATTRO revenue guidance range for 2020 and another beat for GIVLAARI relative to estimates. \n Akshay will review our recent R&D progress shortly, but the highlight in the recent period is the positive CHMP opinions recommending approval of OXLUMO or lumasiran and LEQVIO or inclisiran, which set us up with the potential to achieve 4 RNAi therapeutic approvals and launches in less than 3 years, a truly remarkable achievement. \n You'll also hear from Jeff, on our financial performance and our progress towards achieving a self-sustainable financial profile. We believe we're on our way. Indeed, at Alnylam, we're focused on continued global commercial execution on potentially transformational medicines, excellence in productivity from our organic R&D efforts while maintaining a clear line of sight towards financial self-sustainability. In fact, this is what we envisioned when we established our Alnylam 2020 goals back in 2015, that we'd be a multiproduct, global company with a deep clinical pipeline for future growth and an organic product engine for sustainable innovation. That moment is now upon us, and we couldn't be prouder of our achievements toward those variable goals, which we're on track to actually exceed. And we couldn't be more excited for the next phase of Alnylam's evolution. \n We will lay out our multiyear vision soon. And we look forward to delivering on our potential as a top-tier biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing medicines with transformative potential to patients around the world. \n Now before I hand it over to Andy, I'd like to mention that we plan to host a virtual R&D Day event on the mornings of December 15 and 16, where we'll be reviewing progress across our pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics. We hope you'll be able to join us online. \n So with that, let's now turn to a review of our commercial and medical affairs progress. Andy? Yes. So thank you, Gena. Let's -- I'll go to Andy and Jeff on the ONPATTRO question specifically. Regarding the lumasiran EAP, we're not giving out specifics on patients that are in the program. But I will say at a high level that, obviously, we do have patients in our expanded access program. And obviously, as lumasiran gets approved, we will be transitioning those patients onto commercial product on a country-by-country basis based on [ E&R ] being achieved. So that's where we'll leave that question. \n Andy, do you want to start? And then maybe, Jeff, you can comment on impact of inventory. But I think, Andy, you can give a bigger picture, Q4 expectations for ONPATTRO. Yes, that's a great question, Tazeen, and I'll let Akshay handle it. Let me just start by saying we're very excited about vutrisiran because it is obviously going to enable a once-quarterly subcutaneous dose administration and potentially with additional work, we believe that we can introduce a biannual dosing regimen for patients with hATTR. Initially, it will be for the polyneuropathy setting with the HELIOS-A study. And then obviously, the focus will be in HELIOS-B and cardiomyopathy, both hereditary and wild-type. So Akshay, do you want to comment specifically on Tazeen's questions around what will be available at the top line and what potential read-through there will be on cardiomyopathy from HELIOS-A? Thanks, Akshay. Does that -- Tazeen, does that answer your question? Yes. We're not going to provide that level of granularity, Tazeen. Our early period, as you know, is Q1 or Q2. But I think it's going to be early. Yes. Thanks, Paul, and great questions. I think for starters on the vutri q6 monthly, at a high level, it is certainly our belief that TTR lowering, combined with safety should support that approach. And we've been encouraged by engagement that we've had with regulators on that point. So I think that is certainly a path we would forward. And that would be consistent with other types of medicines and where dose regimens with a strong biomarker have been supported in future labeling. But obviously, that will require those data to be generated and then obviously submitted as part of an SNDA, and that would be the overall plan. \n Regarding OXLUMO and the market size, I'll let Andy comment a little bit on that further. But I think in general, when we look at the prevalence out there, we do believe that there are somewhere between 1,000 and 1,700 patients that are diagnosed and would be on label, if you will, patients that have mild to moderate PH1, which would be the initial label prior to then expanding it to include severe PH1. Andy, do you want to comment any further on the PH1 population and how we should think about lumasiran relative to GIVLAARI? Perfect. Does that answer your question, Paul? Great. Well, I'm going to have Akshay answer the second part -- second question. But regarding the first question, let me just give a high level and then, Andy, you can comment. Look, at a high level, it's our belief that the medical system is more adapted at this point than it was in Q2. This is -- I'm saying this globally from a global perspective. And for the most part, we have seen a return to medical procedures and diagnostic testing done in -- globally. And therefore, we believe that even with shutdown of countries that will occur -- could occur as we go into Q4 to deal with the second wave or third wave, depending on where you are, we do expect the medical system to stay relatively open, relative to what it was like in Q2. Andy, do you want to add any more color to that? Fantastic. And Akshay, do you want to answer the HELIOS-A question? Great. Does that answer your question? So I'm not sure I heard you clearly on the first part, Emily, could you repeat what area are you commenting on specifically? Alpha 1 antitrypsin. Okay. Got it. Absolutely. Yes. Look, I mean, we are excited about the potential for RNAi therapeutics to treat the liver disease associated with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and obviously have advanced a molecule alpha 1 -- ALN-AAT02 into development. Now earlier this year, we decided to partner that program together with Dicerna, who had their own independent effort as well. And so the combined effort between Alnylam and Dicerna now really is positioned to advance quite nicely and is in -- currently going to be -- is in a Phase I/II study. We'll be going into a Phase II/III in due course. \n So we're definitely excited about the opportunity, the way the partnership with Dicerna works is they will advance the program, 100% on their cost. We retain an opt-in right at the end of Phase III. So after all the risk is taken out, it's a free opt-in that we have to commercialize outside the U.S. market. So they'll keep the U.S., and we'll have the rest of world. So we are encouraging our colleagues at Dicerna to move swiftly with the program. And we do think that it becomes a very competitive opportunity to deal with the liver manifestations of the disease. Yvonne, anything else from your perspective to add as it relates to the Dicerna relationship? Right. Emily, does that answer your question? Yes. Thanks, Ted. Thanks -- first of all, for the comments, the congratulatory comments at the beginning. But on fitusiran, specifically, as you know, this is partnered, and as you mentioned, this is partnered with Sanofi. It's an RNAi therapeutic that targets antithrombin with the goal of increasing thrombin generation to improve hemostasis in patients with hemophilia A, hemophilia B with and without inhibitors. So it really is an attractive target product profile that we've constructed for the molecule. \n The program is in Phase III. It's being led by Sanofi. And we really rely on their continued execution of the program. So we hope to learn more in the next period. And so that's where it is. But I think for the most part, Sanofi really has been the driver of the program, and it's ultimately their call in terms of how they advance it. I don't know, Akshay or Yvonne, anything else to add to that from your perspectives? Yes. So we have -- a very important point. So we have reciprocal -- we have royalties on fitusiran that range from 15% to 30% tiered to sales. So we have a -- we do have a significant and attractive financial interest in the product success. No question about it. Yes. Terrific. Great questions. Let me just first clarify with APOLLO-B, which is the patisiran study in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR cardiomyopathy. That's a 12-month study. There is no interim analysis. You certainly are right regarding an interim analysis on HELIOS-B. So I just want to clarify what trial. Okay. That's what I wanted to clarify. Okay. So Akshay, do you want to comment on HELIOS-B a little bit in interim analysis? Akshay, are you on mute? Absolutely. Akshay, do you want to talk about the HSD Phase I? Yes, I'll just add to that, that we also have our upcoming R&D Day in December, and that will be an opportunity for us to do more of a deep dive on the HSD opportunity and the clinical plans for that program. But it is an exciting program because it is a genetically validated target for NASH. And we think it obviously holds great promise in that important indication. Okay. Great questions. I mean the simple answer is you won't see those cohorts next week because they haven't been dosed yet. But Akshay, do you want to comment a little bit on the next steps for those cohorts and just the completion of the Phase I? Yes. And I would just add, Maury, that again, our upcoming R&D Day, we will do a deep dive on the hypertension opportunity because we think it is obviously an exciting prospect for new innovation coming from the Alnylam pipeline. Yes. Thanks, Sonya. Well, I'm glad to get a question like this, and I'm sure Akshay is as well. Let me just say at the start and remind everybody that one of the exciting breakthroughs that we achieved over the last couple of years is the delivery, the efficient and highly durable delivery of RNAi therapeutics to the CNS and other tissues as well, including the eye and more recently the lung. So we are obviously quite excited about that because it opens up new prospects for our pipeline growth outside of the liver. \n And in the setting of the CNS itself, of course, it is really an opportunity to go after the many, many neurodegenerative diseases that are caused by gain-of-function mutations or gain-of-function expression of proteins in the CNS with a dose regimen that we think intrathecally can be given once every 6 months, if not less frequently. So it is a great opportunity for the company, and we've partnered with Regeneron on a 50-50 basis in that regard. Akshay, do you want to specifically talk about APP and the next steps? And Yvonne, do you want to comment a little bit on how this works within our Regeneron relationship vis-\u00e0-vis our lead, et cetera? That might be a useful context. Yes. Happy to, Alan. And let me start and then Akshay, you can comment as well. We're -- we continue to be committed to advancing our COVID program. Obviously, there's the opportunity of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which is an RNA genome, directly with an RNAi therapeutic is certainly an appropriate thing to do from a technology perspective and our recent advances in [ lung ] delivery obviously have come just in time to help us advance this program. \n We've done some work in the Syrian hamster model, which is an established model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. And we have seen antiviral activity in the model specifically. And we're encouraged by that. But we want to do more model work before we commit to specific IND timing and specific clinical development plan so that we can understand the best place to position this molecule in the context of emerging therapies for the treatment of COVID-19. \n And we're going to play the long game on this program as it relates to how it could play into the management of COVID-19 in the future, which we think will be an opportunity longer term for therapies, just like there is for diseases like flu. But that's how we're thinking about it, and those are the specific results. And we look forward to presenting those at some point in the future. Akshay, anything to add to that? Okay. Great. So yes, obviously, we are hoping that there is a completion and clarity on the election here in the coming days or coming weeks. And I think it's great to see our democracy going through the process of counting all the votes, which is the way democracies need to work. And so it's great to see that happening. And we certainly stand by to sort of see how it emerges overall. \n But I think that regardless of the outcome, whether Trump or Biden get elected, we believe that there's going to be a dialogue and continue to be a dialogue around drug pricing politically. But I think that Alnylam is very well positioned in that dialogue because of the type of innovation that we consistently deliver from our platform and I think the type of medicines that we bring forward, the type of ways that we've engaged with payers around sharing of risk and obviously, delivery of value ultimately. These are the types of approaches that we think will bode well for continued success and continued ability to get the value of our innovation recognized by governments and payers around the world. \n So we do think that we're in a good position to -- regardless of the outcome, regardless of the policies that emerge, to be able to continue to do what's right for patients first and foremost and obviously deliver on the value of that from our platform. So we think we're in a good place, Patrick, on that overall. We certainly have been active in helping different stakeholders in this discussion, and we will remain active as a company in this discussion. But we are generally optimistic, and maybe there will be some changes that come -- that occur, but we think we're very well equipped to do well through all of that. Yes, that's a great question, Leland. Let me just start by saying how proud I am of our access teams around the world with the great job they've done with ONPATTRO, the great job they're doing right now with GIVLAARI and right now, we have over 30, just about -- actually just about 30 value-based agreements that we signed with commercial payers in the U.S., and we continue to work with -- in global markets very effectively with the payer stakeholders. And we've shown a lot of -- we've demonstrated and brought a lot of innovation forward on these VBAs, both the general structure of them and how we share risk around performance of the product. But also on some of the new features that we've introduced, like the prevalence-based adjustment model that we've introduced on GIVLAARI. \n So with that as context, Andy, do you want to get more specific on OXLUMO? And obviously, we can't share all the details that we'll share when we launch the product, but maybe you can give some context on how our discussions are going. Okay. Those are great -- those are 2 great questions, Mani. Why don't we start with Jeff and then we'll have Akshay talk about the Cardi B, as we call them collectively strategery and how that relates to the interim. So Jeff, do you want to start first on the compliance question? And just before I hand it over to Akshay, I would just add that the side of care adjustments that we made in Q2 have, I think, bolstered any potential downside of pandemic resurgence, the third wave that might happen in the U.S., et cetera. So I think that we're very -- we're better sheltered in Q4 and beyond to not -- if things get much worse, to not have any significant impact from what we saw like in Q2. Akshay, do you want to now handle the more complicated but interesting question that Mani has asked? Yes. Absolutely agree. Does that answer your question, Mani? Those are great questions. I'm going to hand them right over to Andy to answer. So let me hand it over to Akshay. Thanks for the question, Vincent. I'll just start by saying that, obviously, the -- what we've seen with our platform in the CNS has been pretty consistent with what we've seen in the platform with liver. And when you compare an RNAi therapeutic approach in the liver compared to an antisense oligo-based approach, what you see is you see deeper, better knockdown and much greater durability in the liver. We've seen that all the way through marketed products. And we see similar profiles in nonhuman primates between antisense oligos and RNAi therapeutics. \n So by all accounts, we expect a deeper knockdown potential with our platform and a much more durable approach that would allow for less frequent intrathecal administration, which, of course, is a important -- is a burden in the administration of oligos in the CNS. But there's some more to that -- there's more to the ACT opportunity that I'm going to leave to Akshay to comment on specifically on exon 1. Akshay? Does that answer your question, Vincent? Okay. Well, great questions. I think, obviously, the first one, Andy, I'd like you to answer. I'll just start by reminding everybody that, obviously, the APOLLO-B study is a study of patisiran, which is a nonbranded name for ONPATTRO, which is an investigational agent right now, and it's being studied in patients with both wild-type and hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. And that study uses the 6-minute walk distance as the primary endpoint of 12 months. And then the HELIOS-B study with vutrisiran uses the -- uses CV hospitalization and mortality as a primary endpoint at 30 months treatment. And so that's an important distinction. \n But in general, and then Andy, you should comment, we do feel very encouraged that if APOLLO-B is positive and if we're able to get an approval with the FDA based on the study and other regulators, that this will be a very attractive alternative for the cardiology community to treat their patients with both hereditary and wild-type ATTR. And while the ultimate presentation of a TTR silencer with a quarterly or 6 monthly subcu approach will be certainly much more exciting in the future, in the meantime, ONPATTRO with its broader label will be an important treatment option for patients. Andy, do you want to comment a little bit on our perspective on that more -- in more detail? Terrific. And then, Akshay, do you -- or maybe, Yvonne, do you want to comment a little bit on, from a portfolio standpoint, how we think about programs and ENaC, for example, and is that -- and whether or not that's an area that we would consider? No. I don't know, Akshay, anything you want to add to that? Right. Well, let me start with -- let me just -- Akshay, you should take the APOLLO-B, very interesting APOLLO-B question. But let me just -- on the AGT comment real quickly. Our intent with the AGT program is to advance it to the market. We certainly are a company that as we bring the medicine like AGT forward, we're going to have an opportunity to -- at that stage of our growth in company to commercialize a medicine like that. If we, at that point in the future, choose to bring on a promotional partner, we may do that. But our key goal is to retain the program and develop it ourselves, and that's how we're focused on it. And so that's what we're doing there. But Akshay, do you want to answer the APOLLO-B question that was asked? Yes. Yes, absolutely. I agree completely. Thanks for jumping in on that, Yvonne. Akshay, do you want to then deal with the APOLLO-B question? Zhiqiang, does that answer your question? Okay. Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on this call. Look, Alnylam is at a very exciting stage of its continued growth in development as a leading biotech. We're really pleased with our Q3 results and our execution from our commercial and R&D teams. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress at our R&D Day in December. Until then, I hope you all stay safe and healthy, and have a great day. Bye-bye now."

            "name": "Andreas Orth",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by reviewing our commercial performance in the third quarter as well as our medical affairs progress. \n For ONPATTRO, we achieved $82.5 million in global net product revenue, delivering 24% growth versus Q2 primarily driven by increased patient demand. As of September 30, over 1,150 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO treatment worldwide. \n Turning to the U.S., we saw notable increases in demand and new patients starting therapy. Also, with many patients now having successfully transitioned to alternate sites of care, including home care, we benefited from strong patient compliance, which also contributed to the rebound in revenues. We continue to see progress with new prescribers in the U.S. with cardiologists making up more than half of new prescribing physicians. In the United States, we also continue to see a steady rate of concomitant use of ONPATTRO with TTR stabilizers and expect this trend to continue to grow. \n Turning to the rest of the world. We made very encouraging progress with ONPATTRO in the third quarter with $43.5 million in revenues from ex U.S. markets. As noted last quarter, we have secured access in all priority markets in Western Europe, including Portugal, following our Q3 launch. We are also pleased with the continued growth in Japan, a country of strength for ONPATTRO. An important dynamic observed in ex U.S. is patients switching to ONPATTRO from stabilizers for the potential to halt or reverse disease progression in hATTR patients with polyneuropathy. This dynamic represents greater than 50% of new ONPATTRO patients outside the U.S. \n Our medical affairs team also remains committed to addressing the challenge of raising disease awareness and improving diagnosis rates of hATTR amyloidosis, including with Alnylam Act, our third-party genetic screening initiative in the U.S., Canada and Brazil. As of October, greater than 30,000 samples have been submitted, out of which approximately 1,800 have tested positive for apathogenic TTR mutation. We are encouraged by the recovery in Alnylam Act genetic testing volumes we've seen in recent months, and we believe these volumes will continue into the fourth quarter. \n We've also seen continued recovery in the number of PYP scans conducted for detection of cardiac amyloid. As you know, hATTR amyloidosis is a multi-systemic disease. And in the U.S., detection of cardiac amyloid is often the first step in an overall diagnosis of the disease as many of these patients also have polyneuropathy. ONPATTRO continues to be recognized as a breakthrough for patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, and we're honored to have received the highly prestigious Prix Galien USA award just last week. \n Moving on to GIVLAARI. We achieved $16.7 million in global net product revenues in the quarter, with over 150 patients now on commercial drug. Our progress with patient access in the U.S. has been strong, having now finalized 10 value-based agreements, or VBAs, with U.S. payers. We currently have confirmed access for over 90% of covered U.S. lives. We've not experienced any payer headwinds with GIVLAARI to date, and we're pleased to see the majority of plans adopt medical policies without restrictions to the number of baseline attacks. \n The CEMEA region saw great progress as well, with a successful ongoing GIVLAARI launch in Germany and named patient sales in other countries, including France. We're off to a very strong start for market access in CEMEA. In France, GIVLAARI received an improvement of medical benefit, or ASMR score of II, concluding it offers significant additional therapeutic value. Additionally, GIVLAARI obtained a Considerable Added Benefit rating in Germany with only 15% of all orphan drugs achieving such a high rating, and we secured a strong HTA rating in Italy. We're also excited to soon get our launch underway in Canada, following the recent approval and look forward to the completion of the ongoing review of our NDA in Japan, which was submitted in September. \n Finally, our commercial affairs teams are prepared for the upcoming launch of OXLUMO, the brand name for lumasiran. With a positive CHMP opinion in hand in the EU and an FDA PDUFA date just weeks away on December 3, we look forward to soon bringing our third RNAi therapeutic to patients around the world. We are well prepared with our OXLUMO supply chain and are ready to deploy our trained U.S. field team upon approval to help get this important medicine to the underserved primary hyperoxaluria type 1 or PH1 community. As with our other launches and guided by our patient access philosophy, we are hard at work making sure that patients who need OXLUMO are able to access it. Constructive conversations are ongoing with payers regarding VBA arrangements and we look forward to updating you further upon launch. \n In conclusion, the third quarter highlighted the broad capabilities of our commercial and medical affairs operations, including the continued growth of ONPATTRO, the continued launch of GIVLAARI and the preparation for the launch of OXLUMO. And we'll be watching with excitement as Novartis prepares to launch LEQVIA or inclisiran, which will mark the entry of RNAi therapeutics into a highly prevalent chronic disease indication. \n With that, I will now turn it over to Akshay to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Akshay? Sure. Happy to. So as we noted, Q3, the growth was a mixture of both net new patient demand as well as a return to an increased compliance rate, specifically in the United States post that Q2 COVID impact. In Q4, we expect the growth to come primarily from that net new patient demand. And I'll turn it over to Jeff here on the inventory side. Sure, John. Thanks. And as you said here, we're at this point, expecting that number somewhere between 1,000 and 1,700 that would be addressable and on-label. And overall market opportunity, we do see luma becoming a $500 million brand as it launches globally. And furthermore, right, we're excited to get out there and continue to shape this market, which is largely, to this point, pretty underserved. So we'll be learning a lot as we go. Yes. You've got it right, John. And furthermore, yes, the health care systems learned how to navigate and are showing that now with increased patient flows coming through maintenance of therapy for all levels of all patients continuing. But we have learned as well how to navigate this both on a promotional basis and continuity of care. So we're in a much better position here to weather what may come. Sure, sure. So similar to ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI, we will and are pursuing an aggressive value-based agenda with all payers globally. And feedback from early days on that front has been exceptionally positive. So we expect similar results in terms of open access for OXLUMO as we had with GIVLAARI and ONPATTRO, which are really, really strong. So we'll continue our industry leadership here. Thanks. So let's start with the first one. So changes in payer mix. Specifically, in the United States, we're seeing little to no changes in payer mix. Remember that ONPATTRO is the vast majority Medicare. And at this point in time, GIVLAARI is pretty early days here, but largely commercial, and we're not seeing any material changes to those due to COVID. And then the second question, with OXLUMO, in terms of payer mix analogue, actually, neither are perfect but of the 2, it's certainly going to be less of a Medicare population, right? We think OXLUMO is more of a commercial and/or Medicaid insurance one. So that's, I guess, a little bit more similar to GIVLAARI, if that helps. Sure, John. Happy to. So we're very excited about the APOLLO-B potential here and the launch into hereditary and wild-type cardiomyopathy. To note, in the United States today, cardiologists are currently having very strong experience with ONPATTRO in treating the polyneuropathy. And upon approval, we do expect a meaningful amount of physicians to choose a TTR silencer versus a stabilizer. And furthermore, there also will be physicians who don't decide to choose. And frankly, they use both. And so reimbursement will be something we'll be proactively looking to solve on that front as well."

            "name": "Akshay Vaishnaw",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we're advancing our 2 product candidates, patisiran and vutrisiran. \n Whilst ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat the polyneuropathy associated with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, we committed to expanding the product's label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end, we're conducting the APOLLO-B Phase III study. We continue to enroll patients in APOLLO-B and continue to expect completion of enrollment in 2021 due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. During Q3, we saw a pickup in the pace of enrollment and are still aiming to make up for lost time that we experienced during Q2 due to the pandemic. \n We're also advancing vutrisiran for the treatment of ATTR. Vutrisiran is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection. Here, we're conducting 2 Phase III studies. The first Phase III study is HELIOS-A, which is evaluating patisiran in hATTR patients with polyneuropathy. Enrollment is complete in HELIOS-A, and we remain on track to report top line results early next year. \n The second Phase III study of vutrisiran is HELIOS-B, which has been conducted in hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy, and this study is actively enrolling. On our ATTR roundtable in September, we shared modeling data suggesting the potential for a biannual dosing regimen for vutrisiran, which can further differentiate vutrisiran from other products currently approved or in development. We are actively advancing our efforts to bring a q6 monthly dose of the regimen to the market in parallel with our ongoing development of the q3 monthly regimen. \n Moving now to GIVLAARI, which is approved in the U.S., EU, Brazil and in Canada to treat acute hepatic porphyria, we're pleased with continued base supporting a positive risk benefit profile. For example, during the third quarter, we presented new interim data from the Phase I/II OLE study of GIVLAARI, showing maintenance clinical activity with continuous monthly dosing with a further numeric reduction in the annualized attack rate. The safety profile remains consistent with no new safety findings. \n I'll now turn to recent progress with lumasiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic that we're developing for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 or PH1. We're also thrilled to receive last month a positive CHMP opinion, recommending approval of lumasiran for the treatment of PH1 in all age groups. \n Recently, we presented full results from the ILLUMINATE-B study of lumasiran pediatric patients less than 6 years old. In the study, treatment with lumasiran led to a 71% mean reduction in spot urinary oxalate:creatine ratio from baseline to month 6, which was the primary endpoint of the study. Lumasiran also demonstrated positive results across secondary end points, including 50% of patients that achieved urinary oxalate levels at or below 1.5x the upper limit of normal. The most common drug-related adverse events were mild and transient injection site reactions reported in 17% of patients. The overall efficacy and safety profile of lumasiran was consistent with that observed in adults and children 6 years or older in the ILLUMINATE-A study. \n In both ILLUMINATE-A and B studies, we continued seeing encouraging evidence towards certain clinical events such as nephrocalcinosis and renal stone events or RSE. In ILLUMINATE-A, we previously reported on encouraging results with improvements in nephrocalcinosis and exploratory endpoint. At ASM, we showed some initial results from ILLUMINATE-A on improved RSEs with continued dosing. Based on the preliminary analysis for exploratory endpoints in ILLUMINATE-B, treatment with lumasiran led to bilateral or unilateral improvements in nephrocalcinosis in 44% of patients, with no patients worsening and eGFRs remaining stable. These results were similar to effects on nephrocalcinosis seen in ILLUMINATE-A study. \n We now await regulatory decisions and continue to believe that lumasiran will be approved by the FDA by the PDUFA action date of December 3 and by the EMA later this year as well. In the meantime, we continue to enroll patients in the ILLUMINATE-C Phase III study of lumasiran for the treatment of advanced PH1 patients of all ages with data expected in 2021. \n As you know, we have 2 additional late-stage programs that are in development with partners. This includes inclisiran in development for hypocholesterolemia, partnering with Novartis which is in registration in the United States and the EU. We're delighted that inclisiran has also received a positive CHMP opinion recommending approval of the drug in the EU for the treatment of adults with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. If approved, it will be marketed under the brand name LEQVIO. \n Our late-stage programs also includes fitusiran in development for hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors, partnered with Sanofi. Fitusiran is under evaluation in the Phase III Atlas program. \n Now in addition to our late-stage clinical programs, we believe we have also been making great progress with our early and mid-phase programs. Our partner Vir has initiated dosing of ALN-HBV02 or VIR-2218 with interferon in a Phase II study in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection. We're very excited about the clinical data already presented for this molecule. As a reminder, Alnylam's retained the right to opt into a 50-50 share of the program prior to the start of Phase III. \n In our ALN-AGT program, we believe we have an opportunity to reimagine the treatment of hypertension, with tonic-controlled blood pressure. We look forward to presenting results from the Phase I study of ALN-AGT at the American Heart Association meeting next week. \n Also, in the recent period, we made progress with ALN-HSD, an investigational RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of NASH that is being advanced in collaboration with Regeneron. We were pleased to report today that we've initiated dosing in the Phase I study of ALN-HSD. \n We also continue to make strong progress on our many preclinical RNAi therapeutic opportunities beyond the liver. Notably, we continue to advance our CNS and ocular efforts with Regeneron. Our ALN-APP program remains on track for a CTA filing in mid-2021, and we're pleased that Regeneron has elected to exercise its co-development co-commercialization option on this program with Alnylam retaining the lead. \n ALN-COV is our investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the genome of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is partnered with Vir. Based on recent preclinical studies in a hamster model of COVID-19 infection, we've decided to generate additional animal model data prior to further program advancement. Accordingly, our IND filing time line will be delayed. \n As John previously mentioned, we look forward to highlighting all of this progress in an upcoming R&D day virtual event planned for December 15 and 16 later this year. \n With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results. Jeff? Yes. Thanks, John. So vis-\u00e0-vis HELIOS-A top line, we continue to believe that we'll have the data early next year. So that's very exciting. Our general habit when we present top line is to give the primary endpoint and relative secondaries and also, of course, the safety information on the study at a high level that's relevant to the report. We then report more fully on all the details at an upcoming scientific meeting after that. So those should be very informative as to how the study's done I think. \n And vis-\u00e0-vis the read-through into cardiomyopathy in HELIOS-B, if we harken back to APOLLO, the original APOLLO study with ONPATTRO, I think we learned a lot there about the impact on biomarkers, on the impact on [ echo ] findings in the heart in about 50% of the patients that had some evidence of cardiomyopathy within that study population for ONPATTRO. Now it remains to be determined exactly what proportion of patients have cardiac involvement here in HELIOS-A, but it will be exciting to see what the impacts have been on not just biomarkers, but other aspects of the disease in terms of the read-through, but very much dependent on the import population. Yes. Thanks, Anvita. We've got to remember that the primary goal of the study is to study the neuropathic aspects of the disease. So most of the endpoints are focused on that, certainly the primary endpoint and so forth. Now as I said before to a previous question, we will see how many cardiomyopathy patients or patients with true cardiomyopathy we have and report out all the data that we've collected, including biomarkers' echo. In terms of the primary functional outcome, as you put it, I guess the most important would be hospitalizations and deaths. But again, the study is not orientated towards kind of myopathy. So I don't know exactly how many of those events would have occurred, but we'll certainly be sharing them in due course. I think the only thing I'd add is to put the hemophilia landscape continues to need innovation. The adoption of Hemlibra shows that people are keen to find therapies other than multiple times a week intravenous factor replacement. And so I'm -- we're excited about fitusiran. And hopefully, there's a great home for it both in hemophilia A and B with and without inhibitors. But as John said, Sanofi would guide you on further progress with the program. The HELIOS-B interim analysis obviously is going to be very interesting to execute on. We've picked up enrollment very well this year after that slow Q2 with COVID. So as we further enroll in that study and also, importantly, completion of the APOLLO-B study, which will give important information on how our TTR reducing approaches impact cardiomyopathy. That information will be of strategic important, I think, in design of the interim analysis, which we're busy working on. And we'll share further details with you as enrollment picks up and we get more from APOLLO-B ultimately as the result reads out. \n With respect to your other question, Tessa, on ALN-AGT at American Heart next week. Yes, that's the first time we'll be sharing all the data that we have. There will be obviously safety. First and foremost, it's the first-in-human study. We'll also be sharing all the pharmacodynamic data on target knockdown and how that relates to change in blood pressure. We've reported that there are significant changes in blood pressure, but you'll see all the data in full, including dose dependence and the extent of change in systolic and diastolic, et cetera. \n And I think people will come away with the good insight into the frequency of dosing, and we obviously continue to believe that this will be an infrequently administered therapeutic for hypertension as we further develop it, which will give great advantage to this patient population where compliance is a huge, huge issue in about half the patients. So that's kind of a thumbnail on what's coming up next week. Yes. So that study is ongoing, will progress from healthy volunteers, dosing [ ascending ] fashion into a subset of patients with NASH itself. The target HSD, it doesn't circulate in the blood. So like a lot of our programs, we won't have direct biomarker data on the target itself, but there are a number of other downstream factors that we're looking at in terms of biomarkers, and we believe will be highly informative. We'll share more on that as the program progresses and the study progresses next year. And ultimately, I think what goes on in the liver in the NASH patients will be of great importance, both biochemically as well as radiological, and we'll share that as the study matures. Yes. So Maury, obviously, the study did get delayed in part through Q2 with COVID and so forth, which hit that study like so many others. We've picked up steam. We haven't commenced dosing as John said yet, but we're in place now to start dosing those cohorts and that will be ongoing through the rest of the year. And in due course, we'll report where we'll give a further update on the Phase I study early next year in terms of scientific meeting, where we can bring that information to everybody. But most importantly, next year, I think beyond the clear antipertensity effect, which we believe we've established and everyone will share in next week at AHA, the most important thing is to take that observation into the Phase II setting, and we're very busy aligning on the design of the Phase II effort and getting going with that next year. So that's the crucial next goal. Yes. So speaking of Regeneron and APP, it was great that they've partnered with us. We'll be taking the program with them into Phase I next year. We continue to guide that we'll enter Phase I in the middle of next year or so. And further guidance on when we'll actually see data will be given once we've gotten going with that Phase I study. \n And the other thing is, of course, this is a very interesting time with the aducanumab review ongoing, and there's a lot of excitement around what those data are showing. So it would be interesting to see the outcome of that on Friday. But we continue to believe in APP as a very important target for Alzheimer's disease and beyond. And not only can we tackle the a-beta deposits, we believe, in the extracellular space, but tackling the target outsource and turning off the tap, so to speak, and all the intraneuronal effects of a-beta will also be impacted. So we think this could have a really significant contribution to play. So excited to get into Phase I next year, and we'll update on data expectations after that. No, I think you covered it, John. That's exactly right. Would love to, John. The question, Mani, focused on APOLLO-B and the read-through to HELIOS-B. And I agree that that's a very important aspect of the work we're doing and the insights that we'll glean there will be very important for us. I'd also say that continuing work with patients from APOLLO itself and the open-label extension study gives us important insights into long-term outcomes on neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. We've had a number of studies ongoing out in the field and Dr. Gilmore from the U.K. group just published a paper in Jack imaging on reversal of amyloid deposition in TTR cardiomyopathy patients of the inherited type. And I think that says something important, and we continue to work with groups like that to understand what they're seeing and the outcomes that they're seeing both clinically and radiologically. \n HELIOS-A, as we discussed earlier, to your point, it's not as rich a data set for cardiomyopathy but there could be some important information there. And then APOLLO-B itself. And I think ultimately, we'll just have to see on the timings of all these data points and how they factor in. And as we get greater insight into the APOLLO-B readout, I think we can guide on what the exact HELIOS-B interim will be and use all these points of information to guide that. But I think we're fortunate because there's so much to teach us about what to expect ultimately from HELIOS-B and that should lead to a very informed structure around the interim. Yes. And before I go to exon 1, the only thing I would add to what you said in terms of pharmacologic attributes shown on potency, durability, of course, but also just much better by distribution based on our preclinical findings. We think that the RNAi approach gives much better knockdown and deeper brain structures like the basal ganglia, which is very easy to get to for Huntington's predominantly. \n So those pharmacologic attributes and then there's the actual target strategy itself. And there's an abundance of literature now or significant literature suggesting that exon 1 itself has a very important role to play in the pathology of the disease and there are truncated transcripts that come off exon 1 that appear in and of themselves to be neurotoxic. And then there are protein aggregates made -- what protein made from the truncated exon 1 transcript that aggregates and causes pathology. \n So going for an exon 1 agnostic approach may not be the strongest, and we focused on a exon 1 approach so we can have the best approach to the target that the literature currently would support and the [indiscernible] support, and that along with the pharmacologic, actually, as we've discussed, I think, really sets us up for a very attractive profile. We look forward to going to the clinic. No. I mean part of the ALN COVID assets, obviously, lung delivery has come front and center. We have that preliminary data set about a year ago now showing we've achieved lung delivery, which is very exciting. And just as we've done with many other settings and organs, the idea of genetically validated targets comes into the mix. And we have knowledge of a number of very interesting genetically validated targets beyond ENaC itself and cystic fibrosis. So this really is the new [ vista ] that's forming before us, and it will be exciting to take it on beyond the COVID effort itself. Sure. Yes. Zhiqiang, good question about APOLLO-B. Now of course, there's an ongoing blinded study. So we don't sort of look at all the data currently, and that's as it should be to maintain study integrity. So I can't comment on relationships between various parameters. I can tell you that there are very good associations between [ neuropath ] association stage and 6-minute walk distance. We know that from prior work, ours and other people's work. And we know how that relates to biomarkers, such as BNP and other imaging biomarkers. \n In terms of -- the other aspect to your question was outcomes with and without prior tafamidis. And there, we can look at older information from APOLLO itself, the original study for patisiran/ONPATTRO, the Phase III study. And what was very clear there actually is whether patients had previously been on a stabilizer, whether it was tafamidis or diflunisal or had never been on a stabilizer, their outcome was equivalent. And that is, on average, their mNIS+7, then your [ opti ] endpoint improved, their quality of life improved. \n So that's very encouraging for us that our mechanism of actions seems to be potent and whilst it wasn't a head-to-head study, everything pointed to ONPATTRO really having a profound impact and resulting in improvement of disease in the context of the APOLLO study. And we believe that's one of the very attractive features of the drug. We know from tafamidis, from the Phase III ATTRACT study that whilst clearly, there was benefit in terms of hospitalization and mortality, all the curves went down. It's just the curve for tafamidis didn't go down as much as it did for placebo, which is a good thing for patients. But sadly, disease progressed. It was quite clear whichever endpoint you looked at including 6-minute walk distance and walk distance declined over time in the active group as opposed to placebo. \n So if we can stabilize 6-minute walk distance, I think that's great. If we can actually improve 6-minute walk distance, even better. The recently published study by Professor Gilmore and others from the U.K. group in Jack imaging where they took a cohort of cardiomyopathy patients and they were given patisiran. At 1 year comparing to historic controls, they saw stabilization of 6-minute walk distance there and regression of amyloid, something that's -- neither of those things that have been seen with tafamidis up until now. \n So we think the fundamental mechanism of action to remove the pathogenic protein to a greater extent outcomes in neuropathy that we know well. And also some of the preliminary evidence emerging around the cardiomyopathy in use of ONPATTRO in investigational setting all suggest that we look forward to stabilizing disease and hopefully improving outcomes."

There will be a question-and-answer session to follow. Please be advised that this call is being taped at the company\u2019s request. I would now like to turn the call over to the company.\nChristine Lindenboom: Good morning. I\u2019m Christine Lindenboom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Alnylam. With me today on the phone are John Maraganore, Chief Executive Officer; Barry Greene, President; Akshay Vaishnaw, President of R&D, Jeff Poulton, Chief Financial Officer; and Yvonne Greenstreet, Chief Operating Officer; Andy Orth, Head of the US Business is also on the phone and available for Q&A. For those of you participating via conference call, the accompanying slides can be accessed by going to the event section of the Investor page of our website at www.alnylam.com/event. During today\u2019s call, as outlined in Slide 2, John will provide some introductory remarks and general context. Barry will provide an update on our commercial and medical affairs progress. Akshay will review recent clinical and pre-clinical updates, Jeff will review our financials and Yvonne will provide a brief summary of upcoming milestones before opening the call for your questions. I would like to remind you that this call will contain remarks concerning Alnylam\u2019s future expectations, plans and prospects, which constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of Safe Harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in our most recent quarterly report on file with the SEC. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of the date of this recording and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to provide such statements. With that, I would turn the call over to John.\nJohn Maraganore: Thanks Christine and thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. Let me start by expressing online support for Black Lives Matter and our support for the efforts to end systemically within our country. At Alnylam, we stand against all forms of discrimination and our core we believe in justice, equity and inclusion. We stand in support a peaceful protest aimed at achieving real and sustainable change. Enough is enough, and it is time to finally cure the refractory scourge of hate. I would also like to comment briefly on the Trump Administration\u2019s recent announcement on drug prices. While we fully support the need to reduce or even eliminate patient out of pocket costs for prescription drugs, the administration\u2019s proposal to potentially introduce a so called most favored nations, executive order is both unfortunate and misguided. Importing foreign price controls will harm American innovation and hurt our patients. Even if this executive order is finalized, we don\u2019t believe it will stand without results for a core business. As all of you know, the COVID-19 pandemic remains dynamic, uncertain, and unpredictable. That said, we continue to view the situation in the same framework we discussed last quarter, a pandemic phase in Q2, the recovery phase in Q3, and a new normal starting in Q4. While the pandemic continues or even worsen in many states in the US, we believe Alnylam\u2019s business is benefiting from our broad global presence. In spite of the ebbs and flows, we are seeing healthcare systems now remaining open, and we don\u2019t currently expect to repeat shutdown of health care systems, like what was seen in Q2, especially in the April, May timeframe. Our confidence in the second half is reflected in an upward revisions in our ONPATTRO revenue guidance range. Overall, we are really proud of our field teams around the world and their ability to adapt quickly and safely to meet the needs of patients embodying our challenge accepted mentality. We are extremely pleased with global ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI top line performance in Q2, which Barry will elaborate on shortly. We are also proud of the significant progress we made across our pipeline in the quarter as Akshay will discuss. Another highlight for the quarter was our landmark strategic financing collaboration and increase around royalty monetization. We completed with Blackstone, Life Sciences worth up to $2 billion. We believe this collaboration secures our bridge toward a self sustainable financial profile without the need for any future equity financing. Before I share my closing remarks, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the news we announced earlier this morning about Barry Greene\u2019s planned departure from Alnylam at the end of quarter. Barry and I have been working side by side for over 20-years, first at Millennium and then for 17-years at Alnylam and I know that I speak for everyone at Alnylam in thanking Barry for his exceptional contributions and dedication to the company. We all owe him tremendous gratitude for his outstanding leadership and track record that have contributed to the delivery of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of medicines for patients. I have no doubt Barry will continue to be a highly impactful leader in the Life Sciences. I\u2019m grateful for his agreement to consult with Alnylam as needed for a two year period, and I wish him all the very best in his next endeavors. We are also very pleased to share that Yvonne Greenstreet, our current Chief Operating Officer will step into the expanded roles of President and Chief Operating Officer on October 1st. We believe Yvonne is uniquely suited to this opportunity, given her strong command of our business, strategic leadership and proven ability to drive results. We are initiating a search for a Chief Commercial Officer and during the search we anticipate no impact through our ongoing commercial execution. Please join me in wishing Barry well as he pursues the next chapter of a remarkable career and congratulating Yvonne on her expanded role at Alnylam. I like to finish with my perspective on the big picture of the company. We continue to lead the advancement of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of medicines. And we remain on track to achieve and exceed our Alnylam 2020 goals, exiting 2020 as a multi-product global commercial company with a deep clinical pipeline for future growth and they a robust and organic product engine for sustainable innovation. Without a doubt we are excited for the promising future that Alnylam is poised to deliver as a top tier biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing medicines with transformative potential for patients around the world. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry for one last time Barry to review our commercial progress and medical affairs activities in more detail. Barry the it away.\nBarry Greene: Thanks John and good morning, everyone. Before I provide the quarterly highlights, I would like to make some brief remarks about my planned transition for Alnylam. First, congratulations again for [indiscernible] remarkable person and deserves the presidency overall. I know that Yvonne will make sure that Alnylam continues to be a company doing the right things and focusing on patients and I\u2019m counting on it. For me it has been a tremendous privilege to serve as president of Alnylam for such a long period of time. I\u2019m very proud of what we have been able to accomplish during my 17-years having built a global fully integrated multiproduct company. There is recognition for excellence in R&D and recently of our commercial strength as well. Now, decision to transition is based on the desire to assume a new leadership opportunity in next chapter of my career. I\u2019m fully confident Alnylam will achieve its ambitious goals with quality and excellence, with a great team we have in place. I will continue to support Alnylam throughout this transition and have no doubts about the company\u2019s future prospects as a top tier biopharmaceutical company. [Technical Difficulty] for ONPATTRO we achieved 66.5 million in global net product revenues as a June 30th, over 1050 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO treating worldwide representing an increase of over a hundred patients in the end of Q1. A very impressive accomplishment in the height of the global pandemic during Q2. Let\u2019s start with some more color on the US as anticipated. The COVID-19 pandemic has impact on our business in the second quarter, the patient demand decreasing due to reduced adherence as some patients skip doses, experience dose delays while move into new parasites. Also hasn\u2019t dissipated the pace of new patients gene therapy slow in the US during the quarters in reduce generic testing diagnosis and patient flow through the healthcare system. Finally, our US business was also impacted by inventory destocking and increase [Technical Difficulty] in quarter, Jeff will provide more color on these details later in the call. While our focus today is on Q2 as we enter Q3 are now seeing what looks like a healthy return of generic testing and patient flow through the U.S Health Care System, even in states where COVID-19 patients are rising. In fact, our July online estimate was nearly January numbers we saw earlier in the year, a really good sign. In the second quarter we continue to see great progress -. In the second quarter, 40% of - came from new writers a unique mix of neurologist and cardiologist. In US the [Technical Difficulty] ONPATTRO with future stabilizers in the quarter. We believe this trend will continue to grow as physicians seek progression of polyneuropathy on stabilizers and treat the different manifestations of HTTR Amyloidosis. Now turning to the rest of the world, we made very positive progress with ONPATTRO in the second quarter. [indiscernible] and relative to US benefited from continued geographic expansions with launches in Spain, Italy and other countries. In addition, we saw relative strength in ex-US partners including Europe and relative to fair management of the pandemic. As John noted this is a nice validation of a decision to building a global fully integrated business. But today\u2019s announcement of achieving pricing and reimbursement agreement in France, we are pleased to report that access has been secured in all priority markets in Western Europe. Notably, our [indiscernible] in all major European markets in under two years post approval by the EMA. This is a much faster rate than most orphan medicines are able to achieve. Japan was again a country of strength from ONPATTRO. Japan has now become our second largest country after US for our ONPATTRO [indiscernible] and we expect, continued growth in patient [indiscernible] a larger therapy. In medical care side, our team remains committed to addressing the challenge of raising disease awareness, improving diagnostics of [indiscernible] doses, including [pozelimab] (Ph) a third-party genetic screening initiatives in the US, Canada and Brazil. As of July over 27,000 samples have been submitted out of which over 1,600 positive for pathogenic mutation. With this tracking at store 6% to 8% positivity rate. These numbers show the testing slowdown in Q2 we mentioned on our last earnings call. The good news is third-party mark those numbers to picked up near January levels. In the month of July, we are really pleased with the progress in our launch, most of which has been - virtually, we achieved 11 billion in global net product revenues, we received over 85 start firms in the US with over 100 patients globally on commercial treatment from launch through June 30th. As we have now begun to open Ex-US territories and also because currently 25% to 30% of US patients come from outside to start from channel will discontinue providing start for metrics. In future quarters as we did last year for ONPATTRO. In the US, we observe a broad prescribing mixed including [indiscernible] and other specialties both in for - centers of excellence and industry. Of notes 76% of our Q2 starts were from new writers. Our progress and value based agreements has been extremely strong with [indiscernible] completed in US payers. We now have confirmed access for over 35% of covering the size cost in other government payers. [indiscernible] very large today pleased to see plans adopt medical policies not more restrictive than our regular medication. In three years, we saw strong initial performance as well with a successful and admitted virtual launch in Germany, as well as being patient sales and other countries, including French cohort 18 programs. We have been positively encouraged by the sponsors of European payers despite the COVID-19 pandemic of those -- an improvement of medical benefits or ASMR core score two in France, concluded that offers significant additional therapeutic value. This is an most accomplishment since contest to commercial an SMR rating 2019. Our medical affairs team has also focused on improving awareness and diagnosis of HP. Through viral mass we can report at 937 tests admitted to patients with HIV patients as of mid July, through a continued 10% positivity rate. Of a notable diagnosis trend emergence is the robust use of urinary PPG test, inform diagnosis, and the expectation identification efforts, new ***4*** efforts uniquely enhanced by this non-genetic testing method. Of course, we are now also preparing for the launch of the mastermind later this year. Importantly, we will be leveraging our existing commercial infrastructure for this launch small additions of resources for fuel based teams, when we get approval,[Technical difficulty] virtualization medically third party therapeutic receptive markets. In conclusion, the second quarter was challenging to prevent damage, particularly United States, who did much better than the downside case we anticipated as we enter in Q2, the credit goes for our teams around the world who face the obstacles to deliver these medicines for efficiency. With that I will now turn the call over to Akshay, to give you recent R&D pipeline progress. Akshay.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Good morning, everyone. And thank you, Barry. I should say thank you, Barry for guiding me by helping build our company, and most of all working so tirelessly to help all the patients we seek to serve. So with that, I will start without efforts in ATTR Amyloidosis where we are advancing are two product candidates patisiran and givosiran. ONPATTRO currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat polyneuropathy associated with HSD [indiscernible] doses. We are connected to expanding the products label to include the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end we continue to enroll patients in APOLLO-B and continue to expect its completion of enrollment in 2021. We have seen enrollment pick up over the last month as clinical sites start to open up around the world. In addition, we are also advancing vutrisiran an investigational RNAi therapeutic delivered by quarterly subcutaneous injection that is also in development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis. Here we are conducting two Phase III studies. The first is HELIOS-A which is evaluating vutrisiran in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. Enrollment is complete in HELIOS-A, and we remain on track to report top line results early next year. The second Phase III study of vutrisiran is HELIOS-B, which has been conducted in inherited and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy. As we proposed B site activation enrollment and HELIOS-B are now picking up. If HELIOS-B is positive, it could allow vutrisiran entry into the very large wild-type ATTR amyloidosis market opportunity with the product label that includes cardiovascular outcomes. Let\u2019s move to GIVLAARI, which is approved in the US, EU and now in Brazil to treat Acute Hepatic Porphyria in adults. Of course, the highlight for GIVLAARI in the recent periods was our Brazilian approval. And we are continuing our geographic expansion for this product with MAA submitted in Switzerland and Israel and plans to submission in Japan in the coming months. During the second quarter, we also present a new 12-month interim data from the Envision Phase III study, demonstrating sustained efficacy and acceptable safety to 12-months of treatment with evidence for potentially improved efficacy overtime. In addition, we are proud to publish have pivotal results from the Envision Phase III study in the New England Journal of Medicine. This is our nice paper on RNAi therapeutic published in the journal. I will now turn to recent progress with lumasiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic that we are developing for the treatment of Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1, or PH1. At the ERA EDTA meeting in June, we reported the full set of positive results from an ILLUMINATE A which demonstrated that lumasiran significantly reduced ureaoxide levels, the cause of progressive kidney failure in PH1. In addition lumasiran showed new encouraging safety profile. Our overall lumasiran program also includes our ILLUMINATE B study in pediatric patients under six years of age, enrollment is complete and we remain on track report top line results soon in the mid-2020. ILLUMINATE C study in sever PH1 continues to enroll and is being proceeding well, even during the pandemics. We completed our NDA and MAA submissions in the second quarter. The FDA granted pontoon review for the NDA and has set an action date of December 3, 2020. EMA has gone to the accelerated assessment of the MAA. As you know, we have two additional late-stage programs that are in development with partners. It includes inclisiran in development for hypercholesterolemia partnered with Novartis, which is currently under review for approval in the US and EU. If NDA and MAA filing has been accepted, and Novartis expect initial approval in the U.S in late 2020. Novartis indicated that they remain on track for approval this year with a December action date in the US Now late stage pipeline also includes for FITUSIRAN in development for hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors, partnered with Sanofi. Sanofi has recently disclosed that two of the ATLAS Phase III studies have completed enrollment and that they remain on track to report top line ATLAS Phase III in the first half of 2021. Sanofi also presented new positive results from an interim analysis of the phase III study FITUSIRAN showing impressive reductions in the annualized bleeding rate with encouraging safety. Now in addition to our late-stage clinical programs, we believe we have also been making great progress without early and mid-stage programs. The highlights for the quarter was the positive top line results from our ALN-AGT Phase I study in patients with hypertension, specifically ALN-AGT demonstrate over 90% knockdown of angiotensinogen and greater than 10 millimeters of mercury lower in systolic blood pressure with the durability that caused of quarterly or even less frequent dosing regimen. We were also encouraged by the tolerability profile of ALN-AGT. We now look forward to presenting more complete data from the ongoing Phase I study and the Scientific Meeting in the second half assuming abstract acceptance. We are very excited about the potential for ALN-AGT to reimagine the treatment of high hypertension with tonic controlled blood pressure that we believe could result in important benefits to patients. Our next clinical program is ALN-HSD and investigational RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of NASH, for which we recently filed a CTA. This program is being advanced in collaboration with Regeneron. We are also making strong progress on our many RNAi therapeutic opportunities beyond the liver. For our COVID-19 RNAi therapeutic collaboration with VIA, we selected the development candidate LNCRE or VIA2783 with potent and highly cross-reactive activity towards SAARS COVID-2 the virus that causes COVID-19. We continue to expect an RND filing around year end 2020. We are also pleased to announce today that Regeneron is elected to opt in to the ALN-APP program. We aim to get an R&D filed for ALN-APP in mid-2021 and this is expected to be our first - program to enter clinical development. And with that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results. Jeff.\nJeffrey Poulton: Thanks Akshay and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be presenting Alnylam\u2019s Q2 2020 results. As Barry has already highlighted it was a very strong quarter of commercial execution with outstanding results for both on ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. Turning to our results first for ONPATTRO generated 66.5 million in global net ONPATTRO revenue for the quarter, which was impacted by the pandemic, particularly in the US, with global growth being flat versus the first quarter of 2020 and a 74% increase compared to Q2 2019. US growth decreased 13% during the quarter compared with Q1 and was primarily impacted by the following. 4% decrease in demand from reduced patient adherence due to the COVID-19 pandemic as Barry previously mentioned. An 8% reduction due to inventory destocking during the quarter, an ending inventory now at 1.5 half weeks in the distribution channel at the end of Q2, and a 1% decrease due to a modest increase in gross to net deductions in the quarter. We continue to expect gross to net deductions will remain in the mid-20s globally for on ONPATTRO in 2020. In our international markets performance was very strong in spite of the pandemic of growth of 16% versus Q1. Growth in Europe was highlighted by strength and recently launched markets in Italy and Spain, while in Asia, growth in Japan remains robust, with Japan now representing our second largest market for ONPATTRO based on dollar sales as Barry mentioned. First time this quarter the contribution of our international markets to global ONPATTRO sales exceeded the US contribution. We are pleased to have a strong and global brand, which we believe is beneficial to long-term growth. Turning to our results for GIVLAARI. We had a strong second quarter, generating 11 million global net revenue in the quarter, representing over 100% growth compared to the first quarter. This growth was driven by ongoing success of US launch where we did not experience reductions in patient adherence at the same level as ONPATTRO, as well as an additional contribution from our international markets with a successful launch in Germany and the name patient sales in other countries, including France. Our combined product sales for ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI was 77.5 for the quarter, representing 6% growth versus Q1, a strong result given the challenges associated with COVID-19 in the quarter. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter. Net revenue from collaborations for the second quarter was 26.4 million a significant increase from last year, primarily due to revenue recognized from our Regeneron and VIR collaborations. Gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 81% for the quarter, down from 90% in Q2 2019, primarily due to the current utilization of ONPATTRO full cost inventory, while last year benefited from zero cost ONPATTRO inventory, as well as having a higher proportion of sales in the second quarter of 2020 coming from lower margin international markets, and a write-off of ONPATTRO inventory at our contract manufacture. Our R&D expenses decreased on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to non-recurring expenses in 2019 and license fees related to the execution of our collaboration agreement with Regeneron, as well as the decrease in expenses associated with materials manufactured for clinical trials. Conversely, SG&A expenses increased modestly on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased investment in commercial and medical affairs activity to support the ongoing launches of ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI an initial launch preparation activities for the lumasiran. Importantly, our non-GAAP operating loss for the second quarter decreased by approximately 40 million compared with the same period in 2019, driven by a combination of strong top line growth and very moderate growth and operating expenses. We remain confident that 2019 represents our peak non-GAAP operating last year, as we expect the trend of strong top line growth, and moderate growth and operating expenses will continue for the balance of the year. At the end of the quarter with cash and investments of 1.95 billion, which includes 600 million in proceeds received in the second quarter from the partial sale of future increase around royalties, and issuance of common stock of Blackstone. Finally, turning to our financial guidance, we believe our results for the second quarter demonstrate the strength of a commercial teams in challenging circumstances as a result of the strong commercial performance of ONPATTRO that exceeded our initial expectations. Back in the earlier phase of the pandemic in May, we are further revising our full-year revenue guidance from ONPATTRO with an increase in the midpoint of our guidance as we narrow the range from 270 million to 300 million to 280 to 300 million. Guidance range for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses as well as our guidance for net revenues and collaborations remain unchanged. Please note that we have revised the midpoint of our GAAP combined R&D and SG&A operating expense guidance downward by $25 million, reflecting a reduction in expected stock based compensation during the year. Regarding cash we believe our strategic financing collaboration of Blackstone, adding up to $2 billion in cash secures Alnylam\u2019s bridge towards a self-sustainable financial profile without the need for future equity financing. And with that I will now turn the call over to Yvonne to review our goals for the remainder of the year. Yvonne.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Jeff. And hello everyone. Looking ahead to the second half of 2020. We have a number of important milestones lined up. Of course, we plan to continue our global commercialization of both on ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. We are looking forward to GIVLAARI launch in Brazil and an upcoming NDA filing for GIVLAARI in Japan. We are also expecting two additional regulatory approvals by the end of the year for the lumasiran and inclisiran. We plan to continue enrollments in our ATTR cardiomyopathy studies, specifically, APOLLO-B with patisiran and HELIOS-B with vutrisiran. With lumasiran, we are on track to share top line results from the ILLUMINATE-B Phase III study in mid 2020. And of course, we will also continue advancing the rest of our pipeline, as well as exciting preclinical assets. And we will highlight these milestones throughout the years as they occur. Among these will be our presentation of additional clinical results from the ongoing Phase I trial of ALN-AGT in hypertension, a program we are very excited about. We also plan to initiate the Phase I trial that ALN-HSD for NASH, having now filed the CCA for that program. And our partner Regeneron plans to initiate the Phase I study of vutrisiran in combination with poelimab having now filed the CCA for that study. We also hope that you will join us for our remaining RNAi roundtable focused on lumasiran, the vutrisiran and our TCR program later in August and September. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate for our Q&A session. Christine.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Yvonne. I just wanted to quickly acknowledge the sound issue with Barry\u2019s prepared remarks, there were some storms that are rolling through his area that impacted the audio quality and we will plan to have Barry rerecord his remarks for the replay of this call. So Operator, let\u2019s now open the call for questions to those out there and we would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each and then get back in the queue If you have any additional questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Paul Matteis from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPaul Matteis: Great. Thanks so much. And congrats, Barry. You are definitely going to be missed and Yvonne, congratulations to you as well. I guess, just a couple of quick commercial things. So on the dynamics that impacted on patisran this quarter, you grew patients on drug, but revenues were down. As you think about the inventory net price, as you expand globally and compliance in the second half, given the pandemic, can you just help us understand how these variables are looking maybe in July and, and what you expect later this year, and then just on the commercial transition, it would be helpful if you could comment on your competence at this more disruptive GIVLAARI launch. This is obviously a launch that requires a lot of blocking and tackling and finding patients, and you are really in the midst of the ramp up. So how do you kind of manage that the transition in the midst of that? Thanks so much.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Paul thanks. Great question. So let\u2019s start Jeff with you and then maybe Andy or if you can comment as well on some of them emerging Q3 dynamics in our conference there. So Jeff, do you want to start.\nJeffrey Poulton: Yes. Sure. I think Barry made a couple of comments in his prepared remarks that we did start to see some encouraging signs towards the end of the second into the third quarter notably on genetic testing. [indiscernible] we saw recovery rates that were close to what they were prior to the pandemic setting in. I think we are also seeing improvements in adherence, which was the major headwind that we saw in the earlier part of the quarter in the US. And then lastly, I think there was a question about stocking and there were at the lower end of the range. So our distribution partners contractually hold between one and three weeks and we are at one and a half weeks right now. So there could be some additional build in the second half of the year.\nJohn Maraganore: Great. And Andy do you want to comment a little bit further on the dynamics here as we entered the third quarter.\nAndy Orth: Sure and Paul as you mentioned here, even a midst the Mitch healthcare shutdown in the US we were able to increase the patients on ONPATTRO. It was the adherence, which was the main driver of the demand impact as Jeff just mentioned as well. And in June and July, we have seen dramatic progress in both the resumption of patient flows to the healthcare system and the [indiscernible] volumes and other things we metrics as well as the adherence rates, improving across all the sites of care.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. And I would just add on ONPATTRO that, for example, Paul, you know, PYP scans is an important way that patients get diagnosed with this disease and if they have polyneuropathy, then they become appropriate patients for ONPATTRO and our July PYP scans were comparable to what we saw in January, for example, this is what things that we can track across the country. So that is a good sign. But let\u2019s turn to the GIVLAARI question. Barry, do you want to comment a little bit more on the GIVLAARI question in terms of our confidence in the second half of the launch given the ebbs and flows of the pandemic.\nBarry Greene: Absolutely. Yes. So, Paul, great question on GIVLAARI. You know, I will remind you that in these kinds of rare diseases where diagnosis rates are very low, because physicians aren\u2019t really looking. Patients come from three different buckets. They come from patient transition from EDP, patients known sites and the brand new newly diagnosed patients. And as we mentioned, at the beginning of the pandemic, we were highly prepared with digitization virtualization already for GIVLAARI given the diverse prescriber base and the fact that patients can be anywhere in the world. So we in fact have done virtual launches and we have done very well and have not been really detriment, as we have seen based upon results to our success in getting to healthcare providers and educating them reaching out to patient advocacy groups and patients who are prescribed to access new payers. So all clearly have been going very well. I guess the other comment I will have is the fact that the healthcare providers now due to the COVID situation are also being forced to get online is actually aided the strategy we have had the digital virtual interactions, because now they are more used to it, they are willing to do it and you\u2019ve had really remarkable outcomes in secret programs, the numbers that you had never seen before when they were local in life. So, while not getting as good as in person, we have really taken advantage to help patients as best we can during this time.\nJohn Maraganore: And I will just one last point on GIVLAARI, which is that we do benefit from a drug that has been proven in clinical studies to decrease hospitalizations related to the annualized attack rate reductions that we see. And that that obviously is good in this current circumstance. So, Paul does that answer your questions?\nPaul Matteis: Absolutely. Yes it does. Thanks so much for the added color. I appreciate it.\nJohn Maraganore: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Alicia Young from Cantor. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAlethia Young: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats Barry and Yvonne we look forward to working with you further, it is always a pleasure. So, I just wanted to ask a little bit about kind of a little bit [indiscernible] here. How you are thinking about the hemophilia landscape into patisran, and how that is positioned in light of what is going on with gene therapy. I know it is a Sanofi product but I just wanted to kind of get your perspective on that since we are getting relatively close to data? Thank you.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes, absolutely. Let me make some comments and then I would welcome and welcome Akshay\u2019s perspectives as well. Obviously the hemophilia market is a multi-product, multi-company market there are many players already, there are over a dozen products that are available for patients with hemophilia A or B with and without inhibitors, which is great. You know patisran really fits in as the only once monthly subcutaneous medicine that shows ABR levels annualized bleeding levels that are a round one. And that really is a unique positioning for the product in our view, and Sanofi\u2019s view. And so if that holds up in the Phase III trials and the safety continues to hold up, as was encouragingly shown in their updated open label study. This could be a very important medicine in that landscape and offer competitive profile compared to and [indiscernible] as the potentially only really effective once monthly subcutaneous medicine. Akshay, do you want to comment any further on that?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes, it is a very interesting and dynamic time in the hemophilia landscape and lead better the gene therapy, but I think, at premium with all of these approaches of course is safety, this is a very delicate population, where there have been significant safety events in the past, and I think both would [indiscernible] gene therapy this would continue to be a discussion. Obviously, they\u2019ve completed their Phase III studies. And the primary in Phase III studies with the - a therapy, but durability of effects with gene therapy, the long-term safety, including the potential for oncogenesis, this remains a question in our opinion, there have been recent - studies that showed that very late long-term, cancer events can occur with gene therapy hemophilia. But look, it is a good time for patients to have more therapies come on, as John said, a therapy for hemophilia A and B that is convenient and safe once a month sub Q would obviously be very attractive when we think the vutrisiran can offer that both for on-demand peripheral access and inhibitor patients, and even beyond that in the other bleeding disorders. So perhaps a unique and differentiated offering and we eagerly await Phase III data.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes, early next year, as you said Alethia, which is exciting. Does that answer your question?\nAlethia Young: Yes. Very helpful. Thank you, guys.\nJohn Maraganore: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now move to our next question from Anupam Rama from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAnupam Rama: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. And for APOLLO-B what is the primary end point analysis, there is a 12-month extension in the trial. Will you be continuing that on a blinded basis, so that you will be able to get sort of outcome data in the Placebo controlled manner, or will you really be relying on vutrisiran to get some of those outcomes beyond 12-month and or Barry you know always in-line with the [indiscernible].\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Alright, so, Akshay, I think the APOLLO-B question is right up your alley.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. The principal focus for APOLLO-B as you said, Anupam, is on the 12-month analysis and vutrisiran will be coming in close succession after that read of the 12-month read out for patisiran in APOLLO-B and circles, that will form the principle demonstration of our [indiscernible] approaches and what they can do in terms of morbidity and mortality in the long-term.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes, I will just add, obviously, we are capturing mortality and see the hospitalization data in APOLLO-B Anupam. So we will obviously collect those data and see with a report, one year\u2019s worth of treatment is probably not in the powers to show something there, but we will certainly be collecting those data. And those type of data may inform how we think about the interim analysis for HELIOS-B, which is our vutrisiran study. And that is obviously going to be a nice, helpful set of data as we consider what that IA looks like.\nAnupam Rama: Thanks for taking the question.\nJohn Maraganore: Thanks Anupam.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTazeen Ahmad: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. A quick one. As it relates to ONPATTRO sales with Ex-US now higher than the US, did you relate that at least near-term as an impact from COVID? And do you expect that trend to continue for the duration of COVID as a meaningful factor, at least here in the US? And then I do want to get your early thoughts about what Regeneron opting in for your ALN-APP program. Your plan on starting development of that program, can you give us a little bit of color on what you think the opportunity could be in IGA neuropathy.\nJohn Maraganore: Okay. So let me start with the second half, which the second part of the question which I think was mixed to different programs in it Tazeen, and then Barry you should answer the first question.\nTazeen Ahmad: Yes, sorry, yes.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Regarding APP. That is our amyloid precursor protein program that they opted into and that is going to that is on track to have a filed IND or CTA in middle 2021. That will be our first CNS program. So the opted into that program that is different than [indiscernible] which is our C5 program, which they already have opted into this part of our original agreement with them, which is currently in a Phase II study in IGA nephropathy, what they are also doing is they are doing combination studies with some [indiscernible] which is their anti C5 antibody to get the benefit of a infrequent subcutaneously delivered treatment for many compliment mediated diseases PNH and [indiscernible] amongst others. So that is, that is that part of the question Tazeen. Barry, do you want to answer the first one on US rest of world on ONPATTRO and how we see that going forward.\nBarry Greene: Absolutely just provided the call. We have upped our guidance, reflecting our belief sets that we are in recovery phase. So in particular, we believe that we are going to continue to see growth in the U S I will remind you this as a neutral market of the US is really a pure patient find market right now. And its patients are again flowing through the healthcare systems. We are finding the proportion of patients that are registered with polyneuropathies. So we continue to see growth in US. In terms of rest of the world, many countries continued benefits by patients on site, as well as finding new patients. And then we are opening new territory. So every time a country opens we benefit by EAPs in those countries and patients down the site. So again, we see growth in all regions around the world.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. And Jeff, anything you\u2019d want to add to that or Andy.\nJeffrey Poulton: Nothing for me to add.\nJohn Maraganore: Andy?\nAndy Orth: Agreed. I think Berry got it.\nYvonne Greenstreet: I think the increasing use of combination therapy in the US that I think is a very interesting one for us. I think we are beginning to see physicians appreciate the profile on ONPATTRO in this mixed population phenotype. So isn\u2019t that something to keep an eye on as well?\nJohn Maraganore: Yes, absolutely.\nTazeen Ahmad: Okay. I\u2019m sorry, I mangled my second question. I did want to ask why APP would start development Ex-US?\nJohn Maraganore: There is no plan to do it in Ex-US necessarily Tazeen. We often start studies in different parts of the world, including sometimes in the US, so there is no - it is a plan to do an Ex-US per se.\nTazeen Ahmad: Okay.\nJohn Maraganore: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Maury Raycroft from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMaury Raycroft: Hi everyone. Good morning and congrats on the progress and thanks for taking my question. First one is just on Apollo B. So, when you open your floor to the endpoint in the Phase III Apollo A, that ONPATTRO or shared activity in cardio mass in that types. I\u2019m wondering if you are collecting data from the commercial patient ONPATTRO that provides read through to Apollo B and when you present those data at some point and can you comment on some key base point similarity between patients using drug commercial this is low enrollment Apollo B.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. That is a great question. I\u2019m going to maybe provide some context maybe, Akshay you can comment as well and Berry. We are obviously in the original Apollo study, Apollo A as you said. There were very encouraging exploratory data generated in patients with cardiomyopathy pre-specified cardiomyopathy that are hypothesis generating, they form the foundation of our confidence in Apollo B. And I think to your point, there has been some interesting data that have been generated investigationally in the field in patients that have polyneuropathy, but also with cardiomyopathy where patisiran is being used specifically looking at cardiac amyloid imaging and some of the data that have been, in one case published by a Dutch Group. And then the national amyloidosis center in the UK is presented some data are really quite encouraging and give us give us encouragement for Apollo B, of course, we will await the results of that study before we can comment definitively on the patisiran activity in cardiac patients. Akshay, anything to add to that from your perspective.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: No, I think you have covered it John.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes, great. And I will just add that, they are all always investigational studies that are done by individual centers or groups of physicians that that might explore these types of features. And that is something which does occur out there. Barry, anything else to add on the commercial side?\nBarry Greene: No. I think you covered as well.\nJohn Maraganore: Terrific. Thank you. Maury does that answer your question?\nMaury Raycroft: Yes it does and it is very helpful. And just a quick follow-up for AGT. So, when your top line data you guys recorded on 48 patients for that and you are going to have additional data at the end of this year. I think you can enroll up to 184 for that study, just wondering if you can comment more on how many patients you plan on enrolling, and I think how much cold data could you see at the end of the year?\nJohn Maraganore: Yes, I mean, we a lot of these things where studies are engineered with optional cohorts that allow us to add additional subjects patients in this case to the study design. I think we still haven\u2019t decided at what point we will have completed that study. But we are still answering important questions, including potentially on combination with other antihypertensive meds to explore that in the study, both from activity and safety perspective. Akshay, anything else to add to that\nAkshay Vaishnaw: No, I think you covered that. Yep.\nJohn Maraganore: Great. Does that help Maury?\nMaury Raycroft: Yes that helps. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJohn Maraganore: Thanks Maury.\nOperator: And we will now move to our next question from Ritu Baral from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRitu Baral: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. Barry, great to work with you over the years and best of luck and Yvonne. Really. Congratulations. Looking forward to working with you more. I would like to ask about trends in home administration for ONPATTRO, I guess is there any difference between what you are seeing in the US and Europe and what is being done in the US as far as allowances for COVID and, and reimbursements and uptake is something we see - that will be better going forward to stabilizing US?\nJohn Maraganore: It is a great question. Barry, do you want to give the global view and then maybe, and Andy you could add additional color or the US dynamics on that?\nBarry Greene: Yes, absolutely. And great question; home infusion has been critical care of site that you utilize though this pandemic. So, if you see a reason on home use was about 17%, pre-pandemic and it is doubled to about 35% in the age of pandemic. France. In fact, these cohort patients confusion, and one of the sites reported infectivity with COVID is very important. And that comment you have the US has also doubled from 9% to about 20. And then globally, in countries that allow them to the US, Brazil, Canada, most of the European countries, we have effectively been able to move patients to home infusions. There are times where a dose is delayed or a dose skip in that transition, but as we, as we have now got the capabilities down, most of the patients are moving without dose interruption -. And it has been a very important [Technical difficulty].\nRitu Baral: And is that still growing. Is that still growing like the home infusion rate?\nAndy Orth: Yes. And maybe I can touch on the US without specifically and the yes, as Barry mentioned, we doubled it from nine to 20, essentially from the end of 2019 to currently. And we expect that to continue to grow. Our teams have been in sight of care optimization mode since the onset of COVID. I mean that both homecare as well as more local infusion centers if they were going to larger institutions. So we expect our patients and physicians to continue to take advantage of home care.\nRitu Baral: And could you just got to reimbursement [indiscernible] question for that, yes.\nBarry Greene: So just in terms of growth, as the pandemic ebbs and flows, both the United States and other countries we have seen patients move to home infusion. And then when possible back to a local infusion center. Keep in mind patients really like getting out of the house and social aspect of infusion center [Technical difficulty] infusion centers.\nJohn Maraganore: Right, thanks Barry. Ritu, does that answer your question?\nRitu Baral: Yes. And I just wanted to - could you just review reimbursements like -.\nJohn Maraganore: Reimbursement out of it?\nRitu Baral: Yes.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Do you want to handle that, Andy?\nAndy Orth: Yes, certainly. So the reimbursement clearly on the commercial side of our population is very straightforward. And we have many patients, they are taking advantage of it. But we also know right that CMS released in late June, regulation that allowed a temporary reimbursement scheme for Medicare Part B patients. And we also have many hospitals that are beginning to take advantage of that. And that is an area where we expect to see more growth and utilization of that going forward.\nJohn Maraganore: Does that answers your question Ritu?\nRitu Baral: Yes. Thank you so much.\nJohn Maraganore: Great.\nOperator: We will now move to our next question from David Lebowitz from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Lebowitz: Thank you very much for taking my question. Given your experience thus far, GIVLAARI. Have you I guess made any decisions on lumasiran, what you might want to keep and what you might want to modify as far as the launch given the similarities of the markets?\nJohn Maraganore: Yes, great, great question. Let me make some initial comments and then Barry, you should comment as well. I mean, obviously lumasiran like GIVLAARI is addressing a very devastating disease. That is an ultra rare orphan population based on prevalence, as with GIVLAARI, there are 100 diagnosis rates and PH1 are also well known and so there is a need for patient finding work. We have a commitment, as you know, David to be focused on the value that our medicines deliver. And we have been very successful in that approach proactively engaging with payers, forming value based agreements. And that effort will occur with all medicines in our pipeline, including lumasiran and so as we begin to get ready for launch and get ready for this important new medicine to come in the playbook that we develop for ONPATTRO, the playbook that we have been executing on for GIVLAARI is one that we will absolutely be using for lumasiran. Of course, we will be leveraging, importantly leveraging the existing infrastructure that we have built now globally for the company. Barry, anything to add to that.\nBarry Greene: The only color, I would add is that we have gotten very, very good now as to digital virtual inside of care optimization, that was necessary to COVID, [Technical Difficulty] launch of a disease like PH1 where again, the diagnosis rates 50%, there are 50% of patients out there are home diagnosed to being able to reach them to virtual meet means to be highly advantageous.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Thanks Barry. David does that answer your question?\nDavid Lebowitz: Fine, yes. Thank you for taking my questions.\nJohn Maraganore: Okay. thank you.\nOperator: We will now move to our next question from Vincent Chen from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nVincent Chen: Thank you very much for taking the question. Two quick ones, one conversely oriented and one the R&D side. First for GIVLAARI we realize that you are not going to provide any guidance. I\u2019m curious what you are seeing as far as the trajectory of start forms coming out Q2 and going into Q3. I know incremental start from slowed in Q2 relative to Q1, I imagine some of these is because you have initial blow of patients in Q1 somebody who is impacted from COVID but adversely impact from Q2, just trying to get a sense for reasonable near-term run rate might look like between those two. And then second on the R&D side, a quick one on ALN-APP IND filing. In terms of watching very closely for moving to the DNS delivery, which could open up a range of very large and higher net engagement, it seems like taken some time. What are the gaiting factors on the ALN-APP, R&D filings, what less done before you can enter human trials.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes, those are great questions. Let me start with the first one. Akshay you will get the second one just a minute. But your question on GIVLAARI, I mean, we are, we are extremely pleased with the performance that we saw in Q2 even though we were going through the pandemic. And keep in mind Vincent that the star forms that we saw in Q1 of course, were benefited greatly by patients that were either in the US, EAP or that were known to side sort of that initial bolus, if you will. But we do expect growth from that point and we are saying continue to grow in the US About 25% of our patients in the US are also coming outside of our patient hub. And therefore they are not on the star form metric, if you will. And that accounts for the over a hundred patients that we believe are now on GIVLAARI commercial treatment. Now that includes a small part of the US. Whereas we said, in our prepared remarks we are now going to stop providing star for metrics for GIVLAARI just like we did with ONPATTRO last year, because we now have a global source of patients, not just the US alone. And we still have a significant number of patients that are coming outside of our patient hub. But you will see the growth in our total patient number quarter-by-quarter GIVLAARI, and we are optimistic with that growth in the US and also in other markets around the world. Now Europe of course has now been launched in Germany and the name patient sales or many countries. So I think that we don\u2019t need to say anything more about GIVLAARI. Do you want to know Akshay talk about APP and what is between now and our filing.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Sure, yes I mean. We are delighted with the progress Vincent, it is about a year since we singed the [indiscernible] next year is exciting and we think represents the progress. What we have to do now is simply complete the toxicology and CNC packages. We have already had the good engagement with regulators. And so we are looking forward to defining that IND in due course in mid 2021.\nJohn Maraganore: Does that help Vincent?\nVincent Chen: Yes. Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nJohn Maraganore: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: And will now move to our next question from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSalveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. In the context of competitive dynamics in the TNH. How you are thinking about your upcoming study looking into setting what would be meaningful to differentiated share or where you sit in between paradigm and just a comment on based on your work in a certain part of tissues where you feel most optimistic?\nJohn Maraganore: Great. Thanks Salveen. Well, let me start and then Akshay you can comment as well. On the first question with the combo work that Regeneron is leading with some vutrisiran and pozelimab. I mean, look there is no Sub cue alternatives that is currently approved today. This is an opportunity to having a Sub cue treatment for intermediate diseases with a very infrequent dose regimen. Even with potential for formulation of the two, of the two drugs, we feel very encouraged by data that that from both animal studies, but even from human studies, that would suggest that combination of an RNAi based approach with an antibody approach would provide very significant protection against the complement pathway with an infrequent Sub cue dose regimen. So, I will stop here. Akshay Maybe you comment on that, but also on our extrahepatic work and where we are most confident these days.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes, so certainly, in frequent presentation, I also think that we have the opportunity to have the most complete blockade of the continent system and hopefully the best efficacy profile now. The current drugs already have good efficacy, but we would like to see no breakthroughs for these patients and for them to be able to maintain their hemoglobin levels without need for any transfusion at all. And we think complete blockade in the form of a combination products could offer that. Looking beyond TNH and at the extrahepatic pipeline, we just touched on the CNS. It is indeed exciting. But within a year of announcing that deal with Regeneron, CNS and ocular cloud, we have now announced that we will be finding IND next shift from nervous systems. That will be the first of many, we think we have very exciting phase and also the compartment as well. And most recently, of course, we share data on long delivery. So, I can\u2019t really say one is my favorite. But that is a recurring theme for us over the years has been that when we have had strong, replicable data in animal systems, first in rodents, and then in the non-human primate, that then has invariably led to translation into not in the human setting. And so with all three compartments, as designed to hit the clinic, we are looking forward to replicating successes of our work in the liver with evidence of knockdown clinical efficacy and safety in the brain, in the eye, in the lung et cetera. And we are not going to stop there, because there are many other efforts ongoing for other compartments, which we will get to in due course. So, that is just a little bit on the extrahepatic thinking.\nJohn Maraganore: I would just add to that part that what is exciting about the CNS opportunity, of course, is that there are many neurodegenerative diseases that are gain of function polyneuropathy, with genetic validation. And we have shown in human primates, some exciting data that we fully expect will replicate in the human setting based on our past experiences. And what is really key there is a durability that we see, that is going to be important because with infrequently administered drugs, being able to have significant knockdown of the pathogenic protein within frequent dose administration is going to be something which is highly differentiated. Not only for the EAP program that will be the first one to go but the Huntington\u2019s program that will come shortly thereafter, programs that were obviously advancing in diseases like ALS and Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s, et cetera. So this is really going to be an exciting story for the company and we do expect starting in 2021 to have one to two INDs per year that are coming out of that CNS Ocular Regeneron pipeline together with them. So it is an exciting new frontier for the company.\nSalveen Richter: Great. Thank you.\nJohn Maraganore: Thanks Salveen.\nOperator: And we will now take our next question from Gena Wang from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGena Wang: Thank you for taking my questions. And of course very agree working with you past many, many years. My best wishes to your next journey. Yvonne just want to looking forward to working with you more. I have two questions. One is ONPATTRO just wondering if you can share how much revenue is contributed from Japan, and for vutrisiran when the COVID-19 impact on collecting the data?\nJohn Maraganore: Great, great questions. So let\u2019s, Jeff, why don\u2019t you answer the first question and then Akshay you can answer the HELIOS-A question, secondly. Go ahead, Jeff.\nJeffrey Poulton: Yes. If I heard the question correctly. The question was about Japanese contributions ONPATTRO revenue in the quarter, we don\u2019t break out the detail by countries, Gena. But Japan was a meaningful contributor to the growth that we saw outside the US in the quarter and we highlighted in the prepared remarks that Japan now has become the second largest market for ONPATTRO on a dollar sales basis based on the Q2 results.\nJohn Maraganore: And Akshay, do you want to comment a little on the vutrisiran, management of the study?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes, I mean, both for vutrisiran and vutrisiran in the respective Cardiomyopathy study, maintaining study integrity officers been at the priority during this COVID period, and we have used a variety of approaches successfully telemedicine where physicians and priced off speak to patients over the phone and other means, we have had home administration of drugs. And there is of course, the ability to take blood samples at home and finally for key visits that required in clinic assessments that we was building a little bit of buffer around the timing of events that don\u2019t have to come in exactly on a given date, there can be a few days or a few weeks before or after, depending on the endpoint. So using these different means. It is not been trivial but we have certainly maintained study integrity, and we are pleased with that. And we are also pleased with the fact that the things working up as we have seen on the commercial side, we are seeing very good pickup in enrollment well in these studies.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes and I would just like to, because I think Gena your question was also focused on HELIOS A, which of course was completed. Yes, completed enrollment, we are still on track for early 2021 data from that. And we have obviously all the things that are actually course have been critical in terms of making sure that we have maintained it integrity and no missed doses or minimal miss doses during the course of that study. So that is what applies to, HELIOS A.\nGena Wang: Thank you.\nJohn Maraganore: Great. Thanks Gena.\nOperator: We will now move to our next question from Alan Carr from Needham and Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAlan Carr: Hi, thanks for taking questions and congratulations Barry on the seat. So you mentioned, that you have submitted IND for the [indiscernible] NASH and I wonder if you can give us any update on your new plans and strategy how differentiated in total.\nJohn Maraganore: Great. Thanks Alan. So Akshay that question was on ALA-HSD and NASH and or plans, do you want to comment future?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Alan, we are excited to follow the IND CTA and get going with this program. We are excited about the target because it is a genetically validated target and uniquely So I think in the NASH landscape compared to many of the other targets that have been addressed to date, most of which have fallen short, unfortunately. And HSB17B13 seems to be a gateway to the later consequences of the accumulation of hepatic fat. So 50% knockdown because know heterozygous loss of function protects people from NASH. We think even 50% knockdown should be sufficient that we know from our liver programs we can do a lot better than that. And we know we can achieve that 50% from animal work without a candidate. So is great to get this to the clinic. Phase I will be all about safety and we will collect a number of exploratory biomarkers. HSB17B13 is not a target that is secreted into the circulation, but we have some very good extraordinary biomarkers that will help assess the target engagement. And then from that, you will go into, into Phase II and that is where we will have a dose and regimen selected, which I imagine will be a load those given rather infrequently given the protocol of the drug, we are seeing animals once every three months or six months or so. And that is where we will test the key hypothesis of preventing progression to NASH itself. That those details have to come from that way, you know, we have to focus on the Phase I.\nAlan Carr: Okay. That is all my question.\nJohn Maraganore: Thanks Alan.\nOperator: We will now take our next question from Mani Foroohar from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMani Foroohar: Thanks for taking my question and congrats Barry, Yvonne as well. Although with Barry gone I guess Yvonne you are going to be in much better [indiscernible] bout ONPATTRO obviously there was a little bit of a decline in terms of patient adherence, which not surprising. I know the [indiscernible] assets is very unique it has pharmacokinetics or is there other drugs, but is there an avenue to any catch up dosing patients potentially getting back temporarily on an IV dosing schedule that could be a little more frequent than what is labeled? I.e., could be recapture something that loss revenue, what do you think people will end up back on the label dose on frequency. And then secondarily in thinking about HELIOS-B, you talked about potential inference. And that would look like, how do you think about timing first to make a decision on whether or not to take that voluntary interim? And on what time horizon, might you be just telling us, hey, we are going to take an interim or not, in terms of just giving us some sense of when you should expect that event?\nJohn Maraganore: Yes, those are great questions. Maybe on the first question Mani, I mean your question makes sense, of course. But I think that is our expectation that patients would stay on label and due to her weekly dosing, we have no reason to believe that that would change whatsoever. And we have heard nothing about that in the field. So, but I think the good news is that adherence rates, with some miss doses that occurred in Q2, are showing great strength as we enter Q3, and we don\u2019t expect to see any significant impact, like was expect we experienced during the pandemic phase. So, I think that is really behind us at this point in time. Andy do you want to comment any further on that, I think I covered it. But you might have some other perspective.\nAndy Orth: No, John, you covered it. Right. Everything we are hearing is a resumption to the original schedule for any folks who were paused for whatever reason.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. And then your second question on HELIOS-B. Also, one that makes a lot of sense. But very specifically at HELIOS-B. We will do an interim analysis, we made the commitment to do that. Now we have left it open with the agency on exactly how that will be designed. And we are not we are not going to come against our timing. And I will just say again, that one of the benefits of the APOLLO-B is that as we read our data from that study, it will inform how we should think about the interim analysis for HELIOS-B specifically. Akshay, do you have anything also to add to that.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: No, nothing to add.\nMani Foroohar: Thanks guys.\nJohn Maraganore: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now take our final question from Navin Jacob from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: hi everyone. Thanks for taking the question. This is [indiscernible] on for Navin Jacob. Just on ONPATTRO, Yvonne mentioned combination therapy and you previously stated that just on both - ONPATTRO. Can you give us an update, what percentage patients on both now and can tell if anything on the outcomes of these patients versus patients on just monotherapy. And then just on pricing, just mentioned some reduction in growth summit. How should we think about pricing trends as the year goes on? Thanks very much.\nJohn Maraganore: Okay, so let me start on the combination use of common uses that is occurring out there, as we hear from the marketplace, these are use words to specific data being generated, we are just aware that patients that have a mixed phenotype, or the dot polyneuropathy, are receding on Castro. And in some cases, those patients are also on a future stabilizer. So, we are just aware of that. And we have market research that says that it is somewhere in the range of 15% to 30% now and it could double by the end of the year. We just recently published some data on combination use with from our previous Phase II open label study, and that published paper showed that the combination was safe and the level of [indiscernible] knockdown was as good as monotherapy. But there was no formal assessment of - it was empowered to show anything on the efficacy side. So I don\u2019t think anything can be concluded at this point in time about any improved activity. But Andy do you want to comment a little bit further on dynamic on contaminant use that we are seeing in the marketplace. I\u2019m sorry, Andy just one thing is I want to highlight also that this is really a US phenomenon. We don\u2019t see this in the rest of the world. But Andy go ahead.\nAndy Orth: That is right. Yes, happy to. So since the fourth quarter of 2019. In the US, we have been seeing growing evidence of reimbursement from ONPATTRO were used concomitantly with TTR stabilizer products, which at the end of the day is a positive for patients with multiple manifestations of the disease. And barring any unforeseen changes to the COVID or other we expect the concomitant us to continue to increase in the US over time for patients whose disease manifestations include polyneuropathy. And as John said, right outside of the US is more of a switch dynamic.\nJohn Maraganore: Right. And then your pricing question, Jeff, do you want to handle that?\nJeffrey Poulton: Yes, sure. The comment on ONPATTRO for Q2 was that there was a very modest increase in gross to nuts relative to Q1, which created a slight headwind and growth quarter-to-quarter. Now there is variability and growth for next quarter-to-quarter we have talked about that on the last several calls. It is just based on the way the accounting works and the estimates and the truth of those estimates, but we are very confident that the full-year gross the nets from ONPATTRO will be very consistent with what we experienced in 2019. And the expectation is mid 20s for the year.\nJohn Maraganore: Right. Does that answer your questions?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Thanks very much.\nJohn Maraganore: Good. Okay. So with that, we are going to close our call. Thank everyone for joining us on the call and again for all of our employees for their dedication and their hard work. Of course, Barry, we wish you all the best in your next chapter and Yvonne, so excited for you in this expanded role at Alnylam. So with that we look forward to updating you in future calls on our progress. And please stay safe and please stay healthy. Bye, Bye now.\nJeffrey Poulton: Bye everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jeffrey Poulton",
            "content": "Thanks Akshay and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be presenting Alnylam\u2019s Q2 2020 results. As Barry has already highlighted it was a very strong quarter of commercial execution with outstanding results for both on ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. Turning to our results first for ONPATTRO generated 66.5 million in global net ONPATTRO revenue for the quarter, which was impacted by the pandemic, particularly in the US, with global growth being flat versus the first quarter of 2020 and a 74% increase compared to Q2 2019. US growth decreased 13% during the quarter compared with Q1 and was primarily impacted by the following. 4% decrease in demand from reduced patient adherence due to the COVID-19 pandemic as Barry previously mentioned. An 8% reduction due to inventory destocking during the quarter, an ending inventory now at 1.5 half weeks in the distribution channel at the end of Q2, and a 1% decrease due to a modest increase in gross to net deductions in the quarter. We continue to expect gross to net deductions will remain in the mid-20s globally for on ONPATTRO in 2020. In our international markets performance was very strong in spite of the pandemic of growth of 16% versus Q1. Growth in Europe was highlighted by strength and recently launched markets in Italy and Spain, while in Asia, growth in Japan remains robust, with Japan now representing our second largest market for ONPATTRO based on dollar sales as Barry mentioned. First time this quarter the contribution of our international markets to global ONPATTRO sales exceeded the US contribution. We are pleased to have a strong and global brand, which we believe is beneficial to long-term growth. Turning to our results for GIVLAARI. We had a strong second quarter, generating 11 million global net revenue in the quarter, representing over 100% growth compared to the first quarter. This growth was driven by ongoing success of US launch where we did not experience reductions in patient adherence at the same level as ONPATTRO, as well as an additional contribution from our international markets with a successful launch in Germany and the name patient sales in other countries, including France. Our combined product sales for ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI was 77.5 for the quarter, representing 6% growth versus Q1, a strong result given the challenges associated with COVID-19 in the quarter. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter. Net revenue from collaborations for the second quarter was 26.4 million a significant increase from last year, primarily due to revenue recognized from our Regeneron and VIR collaborations. Gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was 81% for the quarter, down from 90% in Q2 2019, primarily due to the current utilization of ONPATTRO full cost inventory, while last year benefited from zero cost ONPATTRO inventory, as well as having a higher proportion of sales in the second quarter of 2020 coming from lower margin international markets, and a write-off of ONPATTRO inventory at our contract manufacture. Our R&D expenses decreased on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to non-recurring expenses in 2019 and license fees related to the execution of our collaboration agreement with Regeneron, as well as the decrease in expenses associated with materials manufactured for clinical trials. Conversely, SG&A expenses increased modestly on a non-GAAP basis in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased investment in commercial and medical affairs activity to support the ongoing launches of ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI an initial launch preparation activities for the lumasiran. Importantly, our non-GAAP operating loss for the second quarter decreased by approximately 40 million compared with the same period in 2019, driven by a combination of strong top line growth and very moderate growth and operating expenses. We remain confident that 2019 represents our peak non-GAAP operating last year, as we expect the trend of strong top line growth, and moderate growth and operating expenses will continue for the balance of the year. At the end of the quarter with cash and investments of 1.95 billion, which includes 600 million in proceeds received in the second quarter from the partial sale of future increase around royalties, and issuance of common stock of Blackstone. Finally, turning to our financial guidance, we believe our results for the second quarter demonstrate the strength of a commercial teams in challenging circumstances as a result of the strong commercial performance of ONPATTRO that exceeded our initial expectations. Back in the earlier phase of the pandemic in May, we are further revising our full-year revenue guidance from ONPATTRO with an increase in the midpoint of our guidance as we narrow the range from 270 million to 300 million to 280 to 300 million. Guidance range for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses as well as our guidance for net revenues and collaborations remain unchanged. Please note that we have revised the midpoint of our GAAP combined R&D and SG&A operating expense guidance downward by $25 million, reflecting a reduction in expected stock based compensation during the year. Regarding cash we believe our strategic financing collaboration of Blackstone, adding up to $2 billion in cash secures Alnylam\u2019s bridge towards a self-sustainable financial profile without the need for future equity financing. And with that I will now turn the call over to Yvonne to review our goals for the remainder of the year. Yvonne. Yes. Sure. I think Barry made a couple of comments in his prepared remarks that we did start to see some encouraging signs towards the end of the second into the third quarter notably on genetic testing. [indiscernible] we saw recovery rates that were close to what they were prior to the pandemic setting in. I think we are also seeing improvements in adherence, which was the major headwind that we saw in the earlier part of the quarter in the US. And then lastly, I think there was a question about stocking and there were at the lower end of the range. So our distribution partners contractually hold between one and three weeks and we are at one and a half weeks right now. So there could be some additional build in the second half of the year. Nothing for me to add. Yes. If I heard the question correctly. The question was about Japanese contributions ONPATTRO revenue in the quarter, we don\u2019t break out the detail by countries, Gena. But Japan was a meaningful contributor to the growth that we saw outside the US in the quarter and we highlighted in the prepared remarks that Japan now has become the second largest market for ONPATTRO on a dollar sales basis based on the Q2 results. Yes, sure. The comment on ONPATTRO for Q2 was that there was a very modest increase in gross to nuts relative to Q1, which created a slight headwind and growth quarter-to-quarter. Now there is variability and growth for next quarter-to-quarter we have talked about that on the last several calls. It is just based on the way the accounting works and the estimates and the truth of those estimates, but we are very confident that the full-year gross the nets from ONPATTRO will be very consistent with what we experienced in 2019. And the expectation is mid 20s for the year. Bye everyone."

            "name": "Andy Orth",
            "content": "Sure and Paul as you mentioned here, even a midst the Mitch healthcare shutdown in the US we were able to increase the patients on ONPATTRO. It was the adherence, which was the main driver of the demand impact as Jeff just mentioned as well. And in June and July, we have seen dramatic progress in both the resumption of patient flows to the healthcare system and the [indiscernible] volumes and other things we metrics as well as the adherence rates, improving across all the sites of care. Agreed. I think Berry got it. Yes. And maybe I can touch on the US without specifically and the yes, as Barry mentioned, we doubled it from nine to 20, essentially from the end of 2019 to currently. And we expect that to continue to grow. Our teams have been in sight of care optimization mode since the onset of COVID. I mean that both homecare as well as more local infusion centers if they were going to larger institutions. So we expect our patients and physicians to continue to take advantage of home care. Yes, certainly. So the reimbursement clearly on the commercial side of our population is very straightforward. And we have many patients, they are taking advantage of it. But we also know right that CMS released in late June, regulation that allowed a temporary reimbursement scheme for Medicare Part B patients. And we also have many hospitals that are beginning to take advantage of that. And that is an area where we expect to see more growth and utilization of that going forward. No, John, you covered it. Right. Everything we are hearing is a resumption to the original schedule for any folks who were paused for whatever reason. That is right. Yes, happy to. So since the fourth quarter of 2019. In the US, we have been seeing growing evidence of reimbursement from ONPATTRO were used concomitantly with TTR stabilizer products, which at the end of the day is a positive for patients with multiple manifestations of the disease. And barring any unforeseen changes to the COVID or other we expect the concomitant us to continue to increase in the US over time for patients whose disease manifestations include polyneuropathy.

            "name": "Yvonne Greenstreet",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. And hello everyone. Looking ahead to the second half of 2020. We have a number of important milestones lined up. Of course, we plan to continue our global commercialization of both on ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. We are looking forward to GIVLAARI launch in Brazil and an upcoming NDA filing for GIVLAARI in Japan. We are also expecting two additional regulatory approvals by the end of the year for the lumasiran and inclisiran. We plan to continue enrollments in our ATTR cardiomyopathy studies, specifically, APOLLO-B with patisiran and HELIOS-B with vutrisiran. With lumasiran, we are on track to share top line results from the ILLUMINATE-B Phase III study in mid 2020. And of course, we will also continue advancing the rest of our pipeline, as well as exciting preclinical assets. And we will highlight these milestones throughout the years as they occur. Among these will be our presentation of additional clinical results from the ongoing Phase I trial of ALN-AGT in hypertension, a program we are very excited about. We also plan to initiate the Phase I trial that ALN-HSD for NASH, having now filed the CCA for that program. And our partner Regeneron plans to initiate the Phase I study of vutrisiran in combination with poelimab having now filed the CCA for that study. We also hope that you will join us for our remaining RNAi roundtable focused on lumasiran, the vutrisiran and our TCR program later in August and September. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate for our Q&A session. Christine. I think the increasing use of combination therapy in the US that I think is a very interesting one for us. I think we are beginning to see physicians appreciate the profile on ONPATTRO in this mixed population phenotype. So isn\u2019t that something to keep an eye on as well?"
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "John Maraganore",
            "content": "Thanks Christine and thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. Let me start by expressing online support for Black Lives Matter and our support for the efforts to end systemically within our country. At Alnylam, we stand against all forms of discrimination and our core we believe in justice, equity and inclusion. We stand in support a peaceful protest aimed at achieving real and sustainable change. Enough is enough, and it is time to finally cure the refractory scourge of hate. I would also like to comment briefly on the Trump Administration\u2019s recent announcement on drug prices. While we fully support the need to reduce or even eliminate patient out of pocket costs for prescription drugs, the administration\u2019s proposal to potentially introduce a so called most favored nations, executive order is both unfortunate and misguided. Importing foreign price controls will harm American innovation and hurt our patients. Even if this executive order is finalized, we don\u2019t believe it will stand without results for a core business. As all of you know, the COVID-19 pandemic remains dynamic, uncertain, and unpredictable. That said, we continue to view the situation in the same framework we discussed last quarter, a pandemic phase in Q2, the recovery phase in Q3, and a new normal starting in Q4. While the pandemic continues or even worsen in many states in the US, we believe Alnylam\u2019s business is benefiting from our broad global presence. In spite of the ebbs and flows, we are seeing healthcare systems now remaining open, and we don\u2019t currently expect to repeat shutdown of health care systems, like what was seen in Q2, especially in the April, May timeframe. Our confidence in the second half is reflected in an upward revisions in our ONPATTRO revenue guidance range. Overall, we are really proud of our field teams around the world and their ability to adapt quickly and safely to meet the needs of patients embodying our challenge accepted mentality. We are extremely pleased with global ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI top line performance in Q2, which Barry will elaborate on shortly. We are also proud of the significant progress we made across our pipeline in the quarter as Akshay will discuss. Another highlight for the quarter was our landmark strategic financing collaboration and increase around royalty monetization. We completed with Blackstone, Life Sciences worth up to $2 billion. We believe this collaboration secures our bridge toward a self sustainable financial profile without the need for any future equity financing. Before I share my closing remarks, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the news we announced earlier this morning about Barry Greene\u2019s planned departure from Alnylam at the end of quarter. Barry and I have been working side by side for over 20-years, first at Millennium and then for 17-years at Alnylam and I know that I speak for everyone at Alnylam in thanking Barry for his exceptional contributions and dedication to the company. We all owe him tremendous gratitude for his outstanding leadership and track record that have contributed to the delivery of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of medicines for patients. I have no doubt Barry will continue to be a highly impactful leader in the Life Sciences. I\u2019m grateful for his agreement to consult with Alnylam as needed for a two year period, and I wish him all the very best in his next endeavors. We are also very pleased to share that Yvonne Greenstreet, our current Chief Operating Officer will step into the expanded roles of President and Chief Operating Officer on October 1st. We believe Yvonne is uniquely suited to this opportunity, given her strong command of our business, strategic leadership and proven ability to drive results. We are initiating a search for a Chief Commercial Officer and during the search we anticipate no impact through our ongoing commercial execution. Please join me in wishing Barry well as he pursues the next chapter of a remarkable career and congratulating Yvonne on her expanded role at Alnylam. I like to finish with my perspective on the big picture of the company. We continue to lead the advancement of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of medicines. And we remain on track to achieve and exceed our Alnylam 2020 goals, exiting 2020 as a multi-product global commercial company with a deep clinical pipeline for future growth and they a robust and organic product engine for sustainable innovation. Without a doubt we are excited for the promising future that Alnylam is poised to deliver as a top tier biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing medicines with transformative potential for patients around the world. With that, I will turn the call over to Barry for one last time Barry to review our commercial progress and medical affairs activities in more detail. Barry the it away. Yes. Paul thanks. Great question. So let\u2019s start Jeff with you and then maybe Andy or if you can comment as well on some of them emerging Q3 dynamics in our conference there. So Jeff, do you want to start. Great. And Andy do you want to comment a little bit further on the dynamics here as we entered the third quarter. Yes. And I would just add on ONPATTRO that, for example, Paul, you know, PYP scans is an important way that patients get diagnosed with this disease and if they have polyneuropathy, then they become appropriate patients for ONPATTRO and our July PYP scans were comparable to what we saw in January, for example, this is what things that we can track across the country. So that is a good sign. But let\u2019s turn to the GIVLAARI question. Barry, do you want to comment a little bit more on the GIVLAARI question in terms of our confidence in the second half of the launch given the ebbs and flows of the pandemic. And I will just one last point on GIVLAARI, which is that we do benefit from a drug that has been proven in clinical studies to decrease hospitalizations related to the annualized attack rate reductions that we see. And that that obviously is good in this current circumstance. So, Paul does that answer your questions? Thank you. Yes, absolutely. Let me make some comments and then I would welcome and welcome Akshay\u2019s perspectives as well. Obviously the hemophilia market is a multi-product, multi-company market there are many players already, there are over a dozen products that are available for patients with hemophilia A or B with and without inhibitors, which is great. You know patisran really fits in as the only once monthly subcutaneous medicine that shows ABR levels annualized bleeding levels that are a round one. And that really is a unique positioning for the product in our view, and Sanofi\u2019s view. And so if that holds up in the Phase III trials and the safety continues to hold up, as was encouragingly shown in their updated open label study. This could be a very important medicine in that landscape and offer competitive profile compared to and [indiscernible] as the potentially only really effective once monthly subcutaneous medicine. Akshay, do you want to comment any further on that? Yes, early next year, as you said Alethia, which is exciting. Does that answer your question? Alright. Thank you. Yes. Alright, so, Akshay, I think the APOLLO-B question is right up your alley. Yes, I will just add, obviously, we are capturing mortality and see the hospitalization data in APOLLO-B Anupam. So we will obviously collect those data and see with a report, one year\u2019s worth of treatment is probably not in the powers to show something there, but we will certainly be collecting those data. And those type of data may inform how we think about the interim analysis for HELIOS-B, which is our vutrisiran study. And that is obviously going to be a nice, helpful set of data as we consider what that IA looks like. Thanks Anupam. Okay. So let me start with the second half, which the second part of the question which I think was mixed to different programs in it Tazeen, and then Barry you should answer the first question. Yes. Regarding APP. That is our amyloid precursor protein program that they opted into and that is going to that is on track to have a filed IND or CTA in middle 2021. That will be our first CNS program. So the opted into that program that is different than [indiscernible] which is our C5 program, which they already have opted into this part of our original agreement with them, which is currently in a Phase II study in IGA nephropathy, what they are also doing is they are doing combination studies with some [indiscernible] which is their anti C5 antibody to get the benefit of a infrequent subcutaneously delivered treatment for many compliment mediated diseases PNH and [indiscernible] amongst others. So that is, that is that part of the question Tazeen. Barry, do you want to answer the first one on US rest of world on ONPATTRO and how we see that going forward. Yes. And Jeff, anything you\u2019d want to add to that or Andy. Andy? Yes, absolutely. There is no plan to do it in Ex-US necessarily Tazeen. We often start studies in different parts of the world, including sometimes in the US, so there is no - it is a plan to do an Ex-US per se. Okay. Thank you. Yes. That is a great question. I\u2019m going to maybe provide some context maybe, Akshay you can comment as well and Berry. We are obviously in the original Apollo study, Apollo A as you said. There were very encouraging exploratory data generated in patients with cardiomyopathy pre-specified cardiomyopathy that are hypothesis generating, they form the foundation of our confidence in Apollo B. And I think to your point, there has been some interesting data that have been generated investigationally in the field in patients that have polyneuropathy, but also with cardiomyopathy where patisiran is being used specifically looking at cardiac amyloid imaging and some of the data that have been, in one case published by a Dutch Group. And then the national amyloidosis center in the UK is presented some data are really quite encouraging and give us give us encouragement for Apollo B, of course, we will await the results of that study before we can comment definitively on the patisiran activity in cardiac patients. Akshay, anything to add to that from your perspective. Yes, great. And I will just add that, they are all always investigational studies that are done by individual centers or groups of physicians that that might explore these types of features. And that is something which does occur out there. Barry, anything else to add on the commercial side? Terrific. Thank you. Maury does that answer your question? Yes, I mean, we a lot of these things where studies are engineered with optional cohorts that allow us to add additional subjects patients in this case to the study design. I think we still haven\u2019t decided at what point we will have completed that study. But we are still answering important questions, including potentially on combination with other antihypertensive meds to explore that in the study, both from activity and safety perspective. Akshay, anything else to add to that Great. Does that help Maury? Thanks Maury. It is a great question. Barry, do you want to give the global view and then maybe, and Andy you could add additional color or the US dynamics on that? Right, thanks Barry. Ritu, does that answer your question? Reimbursement out of it? Yes. Do you want to handle that, Andy? Does that answers your question Ritu? Great. Yes, great, great question. Let me make some initial comments and then Barry, you should comment as well. I mean, obviously lumasiran like GIVLAARI is addressing a very devastating disease. That is an ultra rare orphan population based on prevalence, as with GIVLAARI, there are 100 diagnosis rates and PH1 are also well known and so there is a need for patient finding work. We have a commitment, as you know, David to be focused on the value that our medicines deliver. And we have been very successful in that approach proactively engaging with payers, forming value based agreements. And that effort will occur with all medicines in our pipeline, including lumasiran and so as we begin to get ready for launch and get ready for this important new medicine to come in the playbook that we develop for ONPATTRO, the playbook that we have been executing on for GIVLAARI is one that we will absolutely be using for lumasiran. Of course, we will be leveraging, importantly leveraging the existing infrastructure that we have built now globally for the company. Barry, anything to add to that. Yes. Thanks Barry. David does that answer your question? Okay. thank you. Yes, those are great questions. Let me start with the first one. Akshay you will get the second one just a minute. But your question on GIVLAARI, I mean, we are, we are extremely pleased with the performance that we saw in Q2 even though we were going through the pandemic. And keep in mind Vincent that the star forms that we saw in Q1 of course, were benefited greatly by patients that were either in the US, EAP or that were known to side sort of that initial bolus, if you will. But we do expect growth from that point and we are saying continue to grow in the US About 25% of our patients in the US are also coming outside of our patient hub. And therefore they are not on the star form metric, if you will. And that accounts for the over a hundred patients that we believe are now on GIVLAARI commercial treatment. Now that includes a small part of the US. Whereas we said, in our prepared remarks we are now going to stop providing star for metrics for GIVLAARI just like we did with ONPATTRO last year, because we now have a global source of patients, not just the US alone. And we still have a significant number of patients that are coming outside of our patient hub. But you will see the growth in our total patient number quarter-by-quarter GIVLAARI, and we are optimistic with that growth in the US and also in other markets around the world. Now Europe of course has now been launched in Germany and the name patient sales or many countries. So I think that we don\u2019t need to say anything more about GIVLAARI. Do you want to know Akshay talk about APP and what is between now and our filing. Does that help Vincent? Alright. Thank you. Great. Thanks Salveen. Well, let me start and then Akshay you can comment as well. On the first question with the combo work that Regeneron is leading with some vutrisiran and pozelimab. I mean, look there is no Sub cue alternatives that is currently approved today. This is an opportunity to having a Sub cue treatment for intermediate diseases with a very infrequent dose regimen. Even with potential for formulation of the two, of the two drugs, we feel very encouraged by data that that from both animal studies, but even from human studies, that would suggest that combination of an RNAi based approach with an antibody approach would provide very significant protection against the complement pathway with an infrequent Sub cue dose regimen. So, I will stop here. Akshay Maybe you comment on that, but also on our extrahepatic work and where we are most confident these days. I would just add to that part that what is exciting about the CNS opportunity, of course, is that there are many neurodegenerative diseases that are gain of function polyneuropathy, with genetic validation. And we have shown in human primates, some exciting data that we fully expect will replicate in the human setting based on our past experiences. And what is really key there is a durability that we see, that is going to be important because with infrequently administered drugs, being able to have significant knockdown of the pathogenic protein within frequent dose administration is going to be something which is highly differentiated. Not only for the EAP program that will be the first one to go but the Huntington\u2019s program that will come shortly thereafter, programs that were obviously advancing in diseases like ALS and Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s, et cetera. So this is really going to be an exciting story for the company and we do expect starting in 2021 to have one to two INDs per year that are coming out of that CNS Ocular Regeneron pipeline together with them. So it is an exciting new frontier for the company. Thanks Salveen. Great, great questions. So let\u2019s, Jeff, why don\u2019t you answer the first question and then Akshay you can answer the HELIOS-A question, secondly. Go ahead, Jeff. And Akshay, do you want to comment a little on the vutrisiran, management of the study? Yes and I would just like to, because I think Gena your question was also focused on HELIOS A, which of course was completed. Yes, completed enrollment, we are still on track for early 2021 data from that. And we have obviously all the things that are actually course have been critical in terms of making sure that we have maintained it integrity and no missed doses or minimal miss doses during the course of that study. So that is what applies to, HELIOS A. Great. Thanks Gena. Great. Thanks Alan. So Akshay that question was on ALA-HSD and NASH and or plans, do you want to comment future? Thanks Alan. Yes, those are great questions. Maybe on the first question Mani, I mean your question makes sense, of course. But I think that is our expectation that patients would stay on label and due to her weekly dosing, we have no reason to believe that that would change whatsoever. And we have heard nothing about that in the field. So, but I think the good news is that adherence rates, with some miss doses that occurred in Q2, are showing great strength as we enter Q3, and we don\u2019t expect to see any significant impact, like was expect we experienced during the pandemic phase. So, I think that is really behind us at this point in time. Andy do you want to comment any further on that, I think I covered it. But you might have some other perspective. Yes. And then your second question on HELIOS-B. Also, one that makes a lot of sense. But very specifically at HELIOS-B. We will do an interim analysis, we made the commitment to do that. Now we have left it open with the agency on exactly how that will be designed. And we are not we are not going to come against our timing. And I will just say again, that one of the benefits of the APOLLO-B is that as we read our data from that study, it will inform how we should think about the interim analysis for HELIOS-B specifically. Akshay, do you have anything also to add to that. Thank you. Okay, so let me start on the combination use of common uses that is occurring out there, as we hear from the marketplace, these are use words to specific data being generated, we are just aware that patients that have a mixed phenotype, or the dot polyneuropathy, are receding on Castro. And in some cases, those patients are also on a future stabilizer. So, we are just aware of that. And we have market research that says that it is somewhere in the range of 15% to 30% now and it could double by the end of the year. We just recently published some data on combination use with from our previous Phase II open label study, and that published paper showed that the combination was safe and the level of [indiscernible] knockdown was as good as monotherapy. But there was no formal assessment of - it was empowered to show anything on the efficacy side. So I don\u2019t think anything can be concluded at this point in time about any improved activity. But Andy do you want to comment a little bit further on dynamic on contaminant use that we are seeing in the marketplace. I\u2019m sorry, Andy just one thing is I want to highlight also that this is really a US phenomenon. We don\u2019t see this in the rest of the world. But Andy go ahead. Right. And then your pricing question, Jeff, do you want to handle that? Right. Does that answer your questions? Good. Okay. So with that, we are going to close our call. Thank everyone for joining us on the call and again for all of our employees for their dedication and their hard work. Of course, Barry, we wish you all the best in your next chapter and Yvonne, so excited for you in this expanded role at Alnylam. So with that we look forward to updating you in future calls on our progress. And please stay safe and please stay healthy. Bye, Bye now."

            "content": "Thanks John and good morning, everyone. Before I provide the quarterly highlights, I would like to make some brief remarks about my planned transition for Alnylam. First, congratulations again for [indiscernible] remarkable person and deserves the presidency overall. I know that Yvonne will make sure that Alnylam continues to be a company doing the right things and focusing on patients and I\u2019m counting on it. For me it has been a tremendous privilege to serve as president of Alnylam for such a long period of time. I\u2019m very proud of what we have been able to accomplish during my 17-years having built a global fully integrated multiproduct company. There is recognition for excellence in R&D and recently of our commercial strength as well. Now, decision to transition is based on the desire to assume a new leadership opportunity in next chapter of my career. I\u2019m fully confident Alnylam will achieve its ambitious goals with quality and excellence, with a great team we have in place. I will continue to support Alnylam throughout this transition and have no doubts about the company\u2019s future prospects as a top tier biopharmaceutical company. [Technical Difficulty] for ONPATTRO we achieved 66.5 million in global net product revenues as a June 30th, over 1050 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO treating worldwide representing an increase of over a hundred patients in the end of Q1. A very impressive accomplishment in the height of the global pandemic during Q2. Let\u2019s start with some more color on the US as anticipated. The COVID-19 pandemic has impact on our business in the second quarter, the patient demand decreasing due to reduced adherence as some patients skip doses, experience dose delays while move into new parasites. Also hasn\u2019t dissipated the pace of new patients gene therapy slow in the US during the quarters in reduce generic testing diagnosis and patient flow through the healthcare system. Finally, our US business was also impacted by inventory destocking and increase [Technical Difficulty] in quarter, Jeff will provide more color on these details later in the call. While our focus today is on Q2 as we enter Q3 are now seeing what looks like a healthy return of generic testing and patient flow through the U.S Health Care System, even in states where COVID-19 patients are rising. In fact, our July online estimate was nearly January numbers we saw earlier in the year, a really good sign. In the second quarter we continue to see great progress -. In the second quarter, 40% of - came from new writers a unique mix of neurologist and cardiologist. In US the [Technical Difficulty] ONPATTRO with future stabilizers in the quarter. We believe this trend will continue to grow as physicians seek progression of polyneuropathy on stabilizers and treat the different manifestations of HTTR Amyloidosis. Now turning to the rest of the world, we made very positive progress with ONPATTRO in the second quarter. [indiscernible] and relative to US benefited from continued geographic expansions with launches in Spain, Italy and other countries. In addition, we saw relative strength in ex-US partners including Europe and relative to fair management of the pandemic. As John noted this is a nice validation of a decision to building a global fully integrated business. But today\u2019s announcement of achieving pricing and reimbursement agreement in France, we are pleased to report that access has been secured in all priority markets in Western Europe. Notably, our [indiscernible] in all major European markets in under two years post approval by the EMA. This is a much faster rate than most orphan medicines are able to achieve. Japan was again a country of strength from ONPATTRO. Japan has now become our second largest country after US for our ONPATTRO [indiscernible] and we expect, continued growth in patient [indiscernible] a larger therapy. In medical care side, our team remains committed to addressing the challenge of raising disease awareness, improving diagnostics of [indiscernible] doses, including [pozelimab] (Ph) a third-party genetic screening initiatives in the US, Canada and Brazil. As of July over 27,000 samples have been submitted out of which over 1,600 positive for pathogenic mutation. With this tracking at store 6% to 8% positivity rate. These numbers show the testing slowdown in Q2 we mentioned on our last earnings call. The good news is third-party mark those numbers to picked up near January levels. In the month of July, we are really pleased with the progress in our launch, most of which has been - virtually, we achieved 11 billion in global net product revenues, we received over 85 start firms in the US with over 100 patients globally on commercial treatment from launch through June 30th. As we have now begun to open Ex-US territories and also because currently 25% to 30% of US patients come from outside to start from channel will discontinue providing start for metrics. In future quarters as we did last year for ONPATTRO. In the US, we observe a broad prescribing mixed including [indiscernible] and other specialties both in for - centers of excellence and industry. Of notes 76% of our Q2 starts were from new writers. Our progress and value based agreements has been extremely strong with [indiscernible] completed in US payers. We now have confirmed access for over 35% of covering the size cost in other government payers. [indiscernible] very large today pleased to see plans adopt medical policies not more restrictive than our regular medication. In three years, we saw strong initial performance as well with a successful and admitted virtual launch in Germany, as well as being patient sales and other countries, including French cohort 18 programs. We have been positively encouraged by the sponsors of European payers despite the COVID-19 pandemic of those -- an improvement of medical benefits or ASMR core score two in France, concluded that offers significant additional therapeutic value. This is an most accomplishment since contest to commercial an SMR rating 2019. Our medical affairs team has also focused on improving awareness and diagnosis of HP. Through viral mass we can report at 937 tests admitted to patients with HIV patients as of mid July, through a continued 10% positivity rate. Of a notable diagnosis trend emergence is the robust use of urinary PPG test, inform diagnosis, and the expectation identification efforts, new ***4*** efforts uniquely enhanced by this non-genetic testing method. Of course, we are now also preparing for the launch of the mastermind later this year. Importantly, we will be leveraging our existing commercial infrastructure for this launch small additions of resources for fuel based teams, when we get approval,[Technical difficulty] virtualization medically third party therapeutic receptive markets. In conclusion, the second quarter was challenging to prevent damage, particularly United States, who did much better than the downside case we anticipated as we enter in Q2, the credit goes for our teams around the world who face the obstacles to deliver these medicines for efficiency. With that I will now turn the call over to Akshay, to give you recent R&D pipeline progress. Akshay. Absolutely. Yes. So, Paul, great question on GIVLAARI. You know, I will remind you that in these kinds of rare diseases where diagnosis rates are very low, because physicians aren\u2019t really looking. Patients come from three different buckets. They come from patient transition from EDP, patients known sites and the brand new newly diagnosed patients. And as we mentioned, at the beginning of the pandemic, we were highly prepared with digitization virtualization already for GIVLAARI given the diverse prescriber base and the fact that patients can be anywhere in the world. So we in fact have done virtual launches and we have done very well and have not been really detriment, as we have seen based upon results to our success in getting to healthcare providers and educating them reaching out to patient advocacy groups and patients who are prescribed to access new payers. So all clearly have been going very well. I guess the other comment I will have is the fact that the healthcare providers now due to the COVID situation are also being forced to get online is actually aided the strategy we have had the digital virtual interactions, because now they are more used to it, they are willing to do it and you\u2019ve had really remarkable outcomes in secret programs, the numbers that you had never seen before when they were local in life. So, while not getting as good as in person, we have really taken advantage to help patients as best we can during this time. Absolutely just provided the call. We have upped our guidance, reflecting our belief sets that we are in recovery phase. So in particular, we believe that we are going to continue to see growth in the U S I will remind you this as a neutral market of the US is really a pure patient find market right now. And its patients are again flowing through the healthcare systems. We are finding the proportion of patients that are registered with polyneuropathies. So we continue to see growth in US. In terms of rest of the world, many countries continued benefits by patients on site, as well as finding new patients. And then we are opening new territory. So every time a country opens we benefit by EAPs in those countries and patients down the site. So again, we see growth in all regions around the world. No. I think you covered as well. Yes, absolutely. And great question; home infusion has been critical care of site that you utilize though this pandemic. So, if you see a reason on home use was about 17%, pre-pandemic and it is doubled to about 35% in the age of pandemic. France. In fact, these cohort patients confusion, and one of the sites reported infectivity with COVID is very important. And that comment you have the US has also doubled from 9% to about 20. And then globally, in countries that allow them to the US, Brazil, Canada, most of the European countries, we have effectively been able to move patients to home infusions. There are times where a dose is delayed or a dose skip in that transition, but as we, as we have now got the capabilities down, most of the patients are moving without dose interruption -. And it has been a very important [Technical difficulty]. So just in terms of growth, as the pandemic ebbs and flows, both the United States and other countries we have seen patients move to home infusion. And then when possible back to a local infusion center. Keep in mind patients really like getting out of the house and social aspect of infusion center [Technical difficulty] infusion centers. The only color, I would add is that we have gotten very, very good now as to digital virtual inside of care optimization, that was necessary to COVID, [Technical Difficulty] launch of a disease like PH1 where again, the diagnosis rates 50%, there are 50% of patients out there are home diagnosed to being able to reach them to virtual meet means to be highly advantageous."

            "name": "Akshay Vaishnaw",
            "content": "Yes. Good morning, everyone. And thank you, Barry. I should say thank you, Barry for guiding me by helping build our company, and most of all working so tirelessly to help all the patients we seek to serve. So with that, I will start without efforts in ATTR Amyloidosis where we are advancing are two product candidates patisiran and givosiran. ONPATTRO currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat polyneuropathy associated with HSD [indiscernible] doses. We are connected to expanding the products label to include the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end we continue to enroll patients in APOLLO-B and continue to expect its completion of enrollment in 2021. We have seen enrollment pick up over the last month as clinical sites start to open up around the world. In addition, we are also advancing vutrisiran an investigational RNAi therapeutic delivered by quarterly subcutaneous injection that is also in development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis. Here we are conducting two Phase III studies. The first is HELIOS-A which is evaluating vutrisiran in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. Enrollment is complete in HELIOS-A, and we remain on track to report top line results early next year. The second Phase III study of vutrisiran is HELIOS-B, which has been conducted in inherited and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy. As we proposed B site activation enrollment and HELIOS-B are now picking up. If HELIOS-B is positive, it could allow vutrisiran entry into the very large wild-type ATTR amyloidosis market opportunity with the product label that includes cardiovascular outcomes. Let\u2019s move to GIVLAARI, which is approved in the US, EU and now in Brazil to treat Acute Hepatic Porphyria in adults. Of course, the highlight for GIVLAARI in the recent periods was our Brazilian approval. And we are continuing our geographic expansion for this product with MAA submitted in Switzerland and Israel and plans to submission in Japan in the coming months. During the second quarter, we also present a new 12-month interim data from the Envision Phase III study, demonstrating sustained efficacy and acceptable safety to 12-months of treatment with evidence for potentially improved efficacy overtime. In addition, we are proud to publish have pivotal results from the Envision Phase III study in the New England Journal of Medicine. This is our nice paper on RNAi therapeutic published in the journal. I will now turn to recent progress with lumasiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic that we are developing for the treatment of Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1, or PH1. At the ERA EDTA meeting in June, we reported the full set of positive results from an ILLUMINATE A which demonstrated that lumasiran significantly reduced ureaoxide levels, the cause of progressive kidney failure in PH1. In addition lumasiran showed new encouraging safety profile. Our overall lumasiran program also includes our ILLUMINATE B study in pediatric patients under six years of age, enrollment is complete and we remain on track report top line results soon in the mid-2020. ILLUMINATE C study in sever PH1 continues to enroll and is being proceeding well, even during the pandemics. We completed our NDA and MAA submissions in the second quarter. The FDA granted pontoon review for the NDA and has set an action date of December 3, 2020. EMA has gone to the accelerated assessment of the MAA. As you know, we have two additional late-stage programs that are in development with partners. It includes inclisiran in development for hypercholesterolemia partnered with Novartis, which is currently under review for approval in the US and EU. If NDA and MAA filing has been accepted, and Novartis expect initial approval in the U.S in late 2020. Novartis indicated that they remain on track for approval this year with a December action date in the US Now late stage pipeline also includes for FITUSIRAN in development for hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors, partnered with Sanofi. Sanofi has recently disclosed that two of the ATLAS Phase III studies have completed enrollment and that they remain on track to report top line ATLAS Phase III in the first half of 2021. Sanofi also presented new positive results from an interim analysis of the phase III study FITUSIRAN showing impressive reductions in the annualized bleeding rate with encouraging safety. Now in addition to our late-stage clinical programs, we believe we have also been making great progress without early and mid-stage programs. The highlights for the quarter was the positive top line results from our ALN-AGT Phase I study in patients with hypertension, specifically ALN-AGT demonstrate over 90% knockdown of angiotensinogen and greater than 10 millimeters of mercury lower in systolic blood pressure with the durability that caused of quarterly or even less frequent dosing regimen. We were also encouraged by the tolerability profile of ALN-AGT. We now look forward to presenting more complete data from the ongoing Phase I study and the Scientific Meeting in the second half assuming abstract acceptance. We are very excited about the potential for ALN-AGT to reimagine the treatment of high hypertension with tonic controlled blood pressure that we believe could result in important benefits to patients. Our next clinical program is ALN-HSD and investigational RNAi therapeutics for the treatment of NASH, for which we recently filed a CTA. This program is being advanced in collaboration with Regeneron. We are also making strong progress on our many RNAi therapeutic opportunities beyond the liver. For our COVID-19 RNAi therapeutic collaboration with VIA, we selected the development candidate LNCRE or VIA2783 with potent and highly cross-reactive activity towards SAARS COVID-2 the virus that causes COVID-19. We continue to expect an RND filing around year end 2020. We are also pleased to announce today that Regeneron is elected to opt in to the ALN-APP program. We aim to get an R&D filed for ALN-APP in mid-2021 and this is expected to be our first - program to enter clinical development. And with that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results. Jeff. Yes, it is a very interesting and dynamic time in the hemophilia landscape and lead better the gene therapy, but I think, at premium with all of these approaches of course is safety, this is a very delicate population, where there have been significant safety events in the past, and I think both would [indiscernible] gene therapy this would continue to be a discussion. Obviously, they\u2019ve completed their Phase III studies. And the primary in Phase III studies with the - a therapy, but durability of effects with gene therapy, the long-term safety, including the potential for oncogenesis, this remains a question in our opinion, there have been recent - studies that showed that very late long-term, cancer events can occur with gene therapy hemophilia. But look, it is a good time for patients to have more therapies come on, as John said, a therapy for hemophilia A and B that is convenient and safe once a month sub Q would obviously be very attractive when we think the vutrisiran can offer that both for on-demand peripheral access and inhibitor patients, and even beyond that in the other bleeding disorders. So perhaps a unique and differentiated offering and we eagerly await Phase III data. Yes. The principal focus for APOLLO-B as you said, Anupam, is on the 12-month analysis and vutrisiran will be coming in close succession after that read of the 12-month read out for patisiran in APOLLO-B and circles, that will form the principle demonstration of our [indiscernible] approaches and what they can do in terms of morbidity and mortality in the long-term. No, I think you have covered it John. No, I think you covered that. Yep. Sure, yes I mean. We are delighted with the progress Vincent, it is about a year since we singed the [indiscernible] next year is exciting and we think represents the progress. What we have to do now is simply complete the toxicology and CNC packages. We have already had the good engagement with regulators. And so we are looking forward to defining that IND in due course in mid 2021. Yes, so certainly, in frequent presentation, I also think that we have the opportunity to have the most complete blockade of the continent system and hopefully the best efficacy profile now. The current drugs already have good efficacy, but we would like to see no breakthroughs for these patients and for them to be able to maintain their hemoglobin levels without need for any transfusion at all. And we think complete blockade in the form of a combination products could offer that. Looking beyond TNH and at the extrahepatic pipeline, we just touched on the CNS. It is indeed exciting. But within a year of announcing that deal with Regeneron, CNS and ocular cloud, we have now announced that we will be finding IND next shift from nervous systems. That will be the first of many, we think we have very exciting phase and also the compartment as well. And most recently, of course, we share data on long delivery. So, I can\u2019t really say one is my favorite. But that is a recurring theme for us over the years has been that when we have had strong, replicable data in animal systems, first in rodents, and then in the non-human primate, that then has invariably led to translation into not in the human setting. And so with all three compartments, as designed to hit the clinic, we are looking forward to replicating successes of our work in the liver with evidence of knockdown clinical efficacy and safety in the brain, in the eye, in the lung et cetera. And we are not going to stop there, because there are many other efforts ongoing for other compartments, which we will get to in due course. So, that is just a little bit on the extrahepatic thinking. Yes, I mean, both for vutrisiran and vutrisiran in the respective Cardiomyopathy study, maintaining study integrity officers been at the priority during this COVID period, and we have used a variety of approaches successfully telemedicine where physicians and priced off speak to patients over the phone and other means, we have had home administration of drugs. And there is of course, the ability to take blood samples at home and finally for key visits that required in clinic assessments that we was building a little bit of buffer around the timing of events that don\u2019t have to come in exactly on a given date, there can be a few days or a few weeks before or after, depending on the endpoint. So using these different means. It is not been trivial but we have certainly maintained study integrity, and we are pleased with that. And we are also pleased with the fact that the things working up as we have seen on the commercial side, we are seeing very good pickup in enrollment well in these studies. Yes. Alan, we are excited to follow the IND CTA and get going with this program. We are excited about the target because it is a genetically validated target and uniquely So I think in the NASH landscape compared to many of the other targets that have been addressed to date, most of which have fallen short, unfortunately. And HSB17B13 seems to be a gateway to the later consequences of the accumulation of hepatic fat. So 50% knockdown because know heterozygous loss of function protects people from NASH. We think even 50% knockdown should be sufficient that we know from our liver programs we can do a lot better than that. And we know we can achieve that 50% from animal work without a candidate. So is great to get this to the clinic. Phase I will be all about safety and we will collect a number of exploratory biomarkers. HSB17B13 is not a target that is secreted into the circulation, but we have some very good extraordinary biomarkers that will help assess the target engagement. And then from that, you will go into, into Phase II and that is where we will have a dose and regimen selected, which I imagine will be a load those given rather infrequently given the protocol of the drug, we are seeing animals once every three months or six months or so. And that is where we will test the key hypothesis of preventing progression to NASH itself. That those details have to come from that way, you know, we have to focus on the Phase I. No, nothing to add."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that this call is being taped at the company's request.\n I would now like to turn the call over to the company. \nChristine Lindenboom: Good morning. I'm Christine Lindenboom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at Alnylam. With me today on the phone are John Maraganore, Chief Executive Officer; Barry Greene, President; Akshay Vaishnaw, President of R&D; Jeff Poulton, Chief Financial Officer; and Yvonne Greenstreet, Chief Operating Officer.\n For those of you participating via conference call, the accompanying slides can be accessed by going to the Events section of the Investors page of our website, on alnylam.com/events.\n During today's call, as outlined on Slide 2, John will provide some introductory remarks and general context; Barry will provide an update on our commercial and medical affairs progress; Akshay will review recent clinical and preclinical updates; Jeff will review our financials; and Yvonne will provide a brief summary of upcoming milestones before opening the call for your questions.\n I'd like to remind you that this call will contain remarks [ concerning ] Alnylam's future expectations, plans and prospects, which constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as well as various other important factors, including those discussed in our most recent annual report, quarterly report and 8-K current reports on file with the SEC.\n In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our views only as the date of this recording and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. We specifically disclaim any obligation to provide such statements.\n With that, I'll now turn the call over to John. \nJohn Maraganore: Thanks, Christine, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. I think it goes without saying that the first quarter of 2020 has been unlike any that we have faced as a company, as individuals or as a society. We find ourselves in an unprecedented situation as the world confronts its ongoing public health crisis with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n Let me begin by acknowledging the tremendous impact this disease has had on so many people, including our communities, families, friends and coworkers. And also, let me recognize that heroic efforts of our health care workers everywhere during this crisis. I'm also especially proud of the amazing work by our Alnylam team and their ongoing efforts to bring medicines to patients around the world, including our work on potential RNAi therapeutics for COVID-19. Together, we are in the fight against this virus.\n With that, let me start this morning's call with our COVID-19 planning framework. Later, Barry will discuss commercial and supply chain implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and Akshay will discuss the pandemic's impact on our clinical trials and the steps we're taking to mitigate this.\n As you know, the COVID-19 pandemic represents a very fluid global crisis that changes almost daily. There is significant uncertainty about how this situation will unfold, but for now, our Alnylam planning framework is based on the following 3 phases. First, the current pandemic phase, which we believe will likely encompass most of the second quarter. Second, a recovery phase, which we believe will likely encompass most of the third quarter, where we will see a gradual resumption of activities, including at hospitals and clinics, and reopening of businesses with precautionary measures. And then a new normal phase, potentially starting in the fourth quarter, where we hope to see a return toward normalcy. You'll hear us refer to these 3 phases throughout our presentation this morning.\n Now rest assured that Alnylam is prepared for times like this; \"Challenge Accepted\" is part of our RNA. And we are making adjustments as needed across our operations for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve and also for the safety of our employees.\n Now in light of the current situation, despite our strong conviction for Alnylam's prospects in 2020 and beyond, we have decided to lower our 2020 guidance for ONPATTRO by 5%. We believe that this is a prudent decision, not because of any underlying lack of confidence in ONPATTRO's growth and long-term prospects, but simply due to the near-term uncertainties that we're all facing. We also intend to moderate our spend this year and are lowering our expense guidance as well, and Jeff will talk about this in just a minute.\n Now amid all of this unprecedented public health crisis, Alnylam continues to fire on all cylinders, advancing our pipeline and bringing RNAi therapeutics to patients. ONPATTRO continues to demonstrate steady and continued growth globally with a very strong Q1, which we're very proud of. We're also pleased to have completed our first full quarter as a multiproduct, global commercial company with GIVLAARI showing impressive performance in the U.S. And then with lumasiran, we've submitted regulatory filings in the U.S. and Europe with approval anticipated later this year.\n We also made significant progress across our TTR franchise expansion opportunity, completing enrollment in the HELIOS-A Phase III study of vutrisiran and continuing enrollment in APOLLO-B and the HELIOS-B Phase III studies of patisiran and vutrisiran, respectively. In addition to these achievements across our late-stage pipeline, our early-stage programs continue to advance. For example, we're announcing positive top line results this morning from our ongoing Phase I study of ALN-AGT, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting angiotensinogen for the treatment of hypertension. \n We're very excited about the potential of ALN-AGT, as hypertension is the #1 modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a safe and effective infrequently dosed therapy could provide much-needed innovation in a highly prevalent condition. We are also doing our part to help address the COVID-19 pandemic, and we're proud to be part of an entire industry advancing science and innovation toward this common goal. Our approach includes targeting the RNA genome with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. And earlier this week, we announced the selection of a development candidate, ALN-COV, also referred to as VIR-2703, with potent and highly cross-reactive activity. And also we announced plans, together with our partners at Vir, for an accelerated filing of an IND at or around year-end 2020. This would break all records from time from program initiation to filing of an IND.\n Finally, let me finish with a bigger picture for Alnylam as we look forward to the rest of the year and beyond. Alnylam continues to lead advancement of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of medicines, and we're very much on track to achieving, and in fact exceeding, our Alnylam 2020 strategic goals that we originally announced in early 2015. Indeed, we believe we're on track to exit 2020 as a multiproduct, global commercial company with a deep clinical pipeline for future growth and a robust and organic product engine for sustainable innovation.\n A few weeks ago, we announced a landmark strategic financing collaboration with Blackstone worth up to $2 billion. This deal, one of the largest-ever financings in biotech history, provides Alnylam with very significant capital that we believe secures our bridge towards achieving a self-sustainable financial profile without the need to access the equity markets ever in the future. With a significantly strengthened cash position, along with the multiple drivers for potential top line revenue growth and disciplined expense management, we are more confident than ever that we can build a top-tier biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing medicines with transformative potential to patients around the world.\n So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Barry to review our commercial progress and medical affairs activities in more detail. Barry? \nBarry Greene: Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. I hope everybody is healthy and staying safe. I'll begin by reviewing our commercial performance in the first quarter. For ONPATTRO, we achieved $66.7 million in global net product revenues, representing nearly 20% quarter-on-quarter growth. As of March 31, we're delighted that over 950 patients are on commercial ONPATTRO treatments worldwide. In the United States, we continue to see progress with both repeat and new prescribers. And in the first quarter, we had 22 new prescribers. As for the mix of these U.S. prescribers, 57% of start forms submitted in the first quarter came from neurologists, 26% from cardiologists and 17% from other physician specialties. Fortunately for patients, we're seeing a treatment that's increasingly handled by multidisciplinary teams that include neurology, cardiology and other physician specialties, and we expect this mix to continue to evolve.\n In the United States, we also continued to see increased concomitant use for ONPATTRO with TTR stabilizers. And recent market research suggests we've got about 15% to 30% of patients with hATTR amyloidosis polyneuropathy are receiving the common treatment as we expect this pattern in the U.S. to grow. Overall adherence to therapy remains very strong at over 90% in the first quarter, which we believe is an encouraging sign and consistent with the APOLLO Phase III data. Regarding U.S. market access, we continue to avoid any of the payer headwinds often reported with other orphan drug launches. Our VBA strategy continues to be very well received.\n Now turning to the rest of the world. We're again very pleased with ONPATTRO performance. Japan delivered another very strong quarter of growth, and we continue to anticipate it will be our second-largest country after the U.S. for ONPATTRO revenue and patients on therapy exiting 2020. In the CEMEA region, we observed strength in France, Germany and the U.K. in the first quarter and continue to expand our footprint with recent launches in Italy, Sweden, Israel, Turkey and Spain.\n Our team also remains committed to addressing the challenge of raising disease awareness and improving diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis, including with Alnylam Act, our third-party genetic screening initiative in the United States and Canada and now recently in Brazil. As of April, almost 25,000 samples have been submitted, out of which over 1,500 have tested positive for a pathogenic TTR mutation. As with most diagnostics and tests across therapeutic areas, we've seen some slowdown in testing as the pandemic phase set in, but we expect sample numbers to return to near pandemic numbers as recovery phase in Q3 begins and beyond into the new normal.\n Moving to GIVLAARI, for acute hepatic porphyria, or AHP, we achieved $5.3 million in U.S. net product revenues, with strong performance in our first full quarter of launch. We've received over 60 start forms in the United States with over 50 patients on commercial treatment from launch through March 31. We're pleased to see that patients are getting on drug within 1 to 2 weeks after the physician has submitted a start form. We're also seeing patients initiate therapy outside of start forms, a strong sign that providers appreciate the strong access environment Alnylam is establishing for their patients. To that point, similar to our experience with ONPATTRO, we've not experienced any major payer headwinds with GIVLAARI in the United States to date. Again, our VBA-based approach is looking successful here. And we're pleased to report that we've already had 1 signed VBA for GIVLAARI and our discussions with multiple payers interested in the VBA approach are progressing well.\n Another highlight of patient access is that payers are adopting medical policies that are generally consistent with the approved GIVLAARI label, without restrictions to a number of baseline attacks. Now outside the United States, we're pleased to announce the approval in the EU of GIVLAARI in the first quarter and expect to open up key commercial geographies this year, with our initial European launch underway in Germany in Q2 and named patient sales occurring elsewhere in the region. Again, our team is focused on improving awareness and diagnosis of AHP in the patient and physician communities. Through Alnylam Act, we can report 809 tests submitted and 84 patients with positive AHP mutations as of April, representing about a 10% hit rate in samples tested.\n Let me finish with more color around our supply chain and commercial activities in the face of COVID-19. As John mentioned, we expect 2020 to be comprised of the pandemic period through most of Q2, a recovery phase in Q3 and a new normal starting in Q4. Our supply chain remains intact, and we're confident we have sufficient inventory of commercial products, drug product, drug substance as well as raw materials for ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI and for lumasiran as we begin to prepare for that launch. We have comprehensive mitigation measures in place to reduce any potential supply chain exposure, if needed.\n Our global field operations have largely shifted to virtual interactions with HCPs, payers and patients, with the exception of Japan, where our field employees are still able to conduct in-person meetings subject to local restrictions. I want to note that for some time, Alnylam has been developing digital and virtual tools. So we were well prepared for virtual interactions. We expect these virtual interactions and engagements to continue through the pandemic phase and into recovery phase. And while live face-to-face interactions are preferable in many cases, these new virtual tools will be part of the new normal. We believe some of the changes are actually very positive, and we think they can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of HCP interactions for our field force going forward.\n Our teams also have been successful helping patients receive their ONPATTRO infusions or GIVLAARI injections at appropriate sites of care as determined with their physicians, including home setting, which is particularly important during this pandemic period. For ONPATTRO, home infusion has become broadly available in most countries, thanks in part to the recognition of value by physicians, payers and regulators. In the -- in U.S., a recent rule change by CMS created options for our Medicare patients to have coverage for home-based administration. Looking at the proportion of treatments received across academic centers, local centers and in the home, we've seen a significant shift toward home care from Q4 2019 into Q1 2020 as the pandemic response expands globally.\n We believe, particularly in the United States, we'll continue to see patients shift to home care for local infusion centers in Q2 and beyond. For ONPATTRO, we believe adherence will likely decrease during the pandemic phase in Q2 due in part to some skipped doses or dose delays caused by patients moving to new care sites, including home care. We will continue with site-of-care optimization through the recovery phase as patients regain comfort returning to hospitals and clinics for treatment or decide to continue with in-home administration if that's an option for them.\n Finally, we also anticipate that the pace of new patients [ instituting ] therapy will slow during Q2, given reduced genetic testing and diagnosis and patient flow through the health care systems. Thus, we expect some negative impact in Q2 with ONPATTRO revenues, potentially decreasing by about 10% versus Q1. And then we expect improvement and growth in the second half of the year as health care systems return in recovery and into a new normal.\n Let me highlight here that the midpoint of our ONPATTRO revenue guidance represents expected year-on-year growth of greater than 70%, and we remain highly confident in our growth trajectory in all regions. We're playing the long game here, and our goal is to continue to build an industry-leading TTR franchise.\n Now let me turn to GIVLAARI. AHP patients who experience debilitating porphyria attacks often require urgent care or hospitalization. So in this sense, new patient starts and continuity of GIVLAARI treatment are particularly important, given the impact of COVID-19 on urgent care and hospital sites. Given the ENVISION results, which show reduction in AHP attacks requiring urgent care visits or hospitalizations, we expect less of an impact on GIVLAARI adherence and new patient starts during the pandemic phase relative to ONPATTRO.\n In summary, I'll reiterate that we're not simply waiting for the pandemic to pass, we're taking numerous steps to do what's right for patients and to mitigate impact on our business during the pandemic phase. We're very confident about our growth in the recovery phase and beyond, and also continue to see a very bright long-term prospects for our broader ATTR franchise and other marketed products like GIVLAARI.\n As we've heard from -- as you heard from us many times, we're up for the ever-changing environment and will be stronger for it; as John said, challenge accepted.\n With that, I'll now turn over to Akshay to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Akshay? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Thanks, Barry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we are working diligently to advance our 2 product candidates, patisiran and vutrisiran. While ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat polyneuropathy associated with hATTR amyloidosis, we're committed to expanding the product's label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both inherited and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end, we are conducting the APOLLO-B Phase III study. While we continue to enroll patients in APOLLO-B, we have announced today that due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, we expect completion of enrollment to shift into 2021. But rest assured, we'll work very hard to make up any lost time as we enter the recovery and new normal phases in Q3 and Q4 of this year.\n We're also advancing vutrisiran, which is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection and is also in development for ATTR amyloidosis. Here, we are conducting 2 Phase III studies. The first is HELIOS-A, which is evaluating vutrisiran in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. Enrollment is now complete in HELIOS-A, and we remain on track to report top line results early next year.\n Second Phase III study of vutrisiran is HELIOS-B, which is being conducted in inherited wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy. Enrollment is ongoing in the study, which is still in relatively early stages, having just initiated in December of last year. We do expect some enrollment delays here as well in the pandemic phase during Q2.\n I'll now turn to recent progress with lumasiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic that we are developing for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria Type 1, or PH1, in the ILLUMINATE development program. This includes ILLUMINATE-A, our pivotal study in adult and adolescent patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, where we reported positive top line results in December. We now plan to present full results from the ILLUMINATE-A study in June as the OxalEurope Meeting has been postponed once again. Our lumasiran Phase III program also includes our ILLUMINATE-B study in pediatric patients under 6 years of age. Enrollment is complete, and we remain on track to report top line results in mid-2020. We're continuing enrollment in the ILLUMINATE-C study in patients with advanced PH1 disease across all age groups.\n We recently completed the rolling submission of our NDA and submitted our MAA for lumasiran. This was our first NDA and MAA submitted with our staff working virtually, and I'm proud that our teams were able to do this in less than 4 months after our top line results. We expect a regulatory decision on lumasiran approval by the end of 2020.\n As you know, we have 2 additional late-stage programs that are in development with partners. It includes inclisiran in development for hypercholesterolemia, now partnered with Novartis, which is in registration in the U.S. and EU, where both NDA and MAA filing has been accepted, and where we expect initial approval in late 2020.\n We also included fitusiran in development for hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors, partnered with Sanofi. Sanofi has recently disclosed that 2 of the ATLAS Phase III trials have now completed enrollment. So we can expect top line results from the ATLAS Phase III trials in the first half of 2021 as Sanofi has guided.\n In addition to our late-stage clinical programs, we believe we have also been making great progress in our early and mid-stage programs. This includes ALN-AGT in development for hypertension, resistant hypertension, blood pressure that is not adequately controlled with 3 or more antihypertensive drugs, affects an estimated 11 million people in the United States alone. These patients are at substantially high risk of stroke, heart failure, renal failure and other tissue damage. Hypertension is the #1 modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and we believe ALN-AGT has the potential to offer significant benefit to patients by addressing the need for improved blood pressure control.\n In our press release this morning, we announced positive initial top line ALN-AGT results from 48 patients with essential hypertension in the ongoing Phase I study. ALN-AGT was administered as a single subcutaneous dose and achieved an over 90% knockdown of angiotensinogen, or AGT. In addition, ALN-AGT was associated with an over 10 millimeters of mercury reduction of mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure at [ BK ] relative to placebo. The durability of AGT knockdown and blood pressure effects appears to be supportive of our once-quarterly and perhaps a biannual dose regimen, similar to the results we achieved in the initial Phase I study of inclisiran. The safety and tolerability profile of ALN-AGT is also encouraging, with no drug-related serious adverse events. We plan on presenting these data at the medical meeting in the second half of 2020. In the meantime, we're very excited about these initial top line results that support further development of ALN-AGT in Phase II studies that we expect to start next year. \n Turning to our COVID-19 RNAi therapeutics effort in collaboration with our partners at Vir, we've now selected a development candidate, ALN-COV or VIR-2703, with potent and highly cross-reactive activity towards SARS-CoV-2. In oral-based assays, ALN-COV was shown to block viral replication by up to 3 long order with the picomolar EC50. To our knowledge, this is the most potent direct antiviral for SARS-CoV-2 reported to date, high cross-reactivity toward over 4,300 viral isolates, including the 2003 SARS virus, shows that we are targeting a highly conserved region for virus that is likely to be maintained for the current pandemic and potentially future coronavirus outbreak.\n Our plan is to advance inhalational administration of ALN-COV for treatment and/or prevention of COVID-19. We plan to soon discuss this program with the FDA and other regulators, and we expect to file an IND at or around year-end 2020. Finally, I'd like to wrap up by addressing the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our clinical operations activities and the steps we are taking to mitigate it.\n Of course, the top priority here is ensuring patients' safety while continuing to conduct our trials in a vigorous way, since these investigational trials are supporting the advancement of potentially life-saving or life-transforming therapies.\n All of our protocols and statistical analyses plans include measures to account for missing data, and we continue to work with sites and CRO partners to minimize missing data and ensure studies continue with as little interruption as possible.\n We're pleased to see regulatory agencies issue pragmatic guidance acknowledging possibility for protocol deviations, missing data, et cetera. As such, we're capturing the impact of COVID-19 on these parameters, which we will incorporate into our study documentation. We're also taking steps in all of our studies to minimize patient exposure to the virus and keep patients on study. We've done this by expanding our efforts around home care, widening visit windows, collecting labs locally or at home and doing remote collection of adverse events. During the pandemic phase, we expect to continue to see impact on new patient enrollment and, to a lesser degree, delayed or missed doses in some of our studies. As we have said, we'll do everything we can to minimize these impacts and make up for any lost time as we enter the recovery and new normal phases.\n In summary, while there are some disruptions in clinical development activities during the pandemic phase, we've successfully implemented many mitigation steps to minimize impacts on our programs, and we expect any shifts in our time line to be effectively managed and short-lived.\n And with that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results. Jeff? \nJeffrey Poulton: Thanks, Akshay, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting Alnylam's Q1 2020 results. As Barry has already highlighted, it was a very strong quarter of commercial execution with outstanding results for both ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. I will focus my comments on 3 topics today:\n Q1 product sales results for ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI, summary of our full P&L results for the quarter and comments on our guidance for 2020.\n Turning to our results first for ONPATTRO, where we had another quarter of continued and steady global growth. We generated $66.7 million in net revenue for the quarter, representing 19% growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 154% growth compared with Q1 2019. U.S. growth during the quarter was negatively impacted by modest destocking in Q1 2020 compared with modest stocking in Q4 2019. Inventory in the distribution channel in the U.S. is between 2 and 2.5 weeks at the end of Q1.\n U.S. growth during the quarter benefited from a lower level of gross to net deductions following the increase in Q4 2019 that we highlighted on our year-end earnings call. We continue to expect gross to net deductions will remain in the mid-20s as a percentage of global gross sales for ONPATTRO in 2020. Growth in our international markets was very strong during the quarter and was broadly driven across many markets in Europe as well as strength in Japan. We think this clearly reflects the benefit of having a strong and growing global brand.\n Turning to our results for GIVLAARI. We had a strong first full quarter of sales, generating $5.3 million in net revenue in Q1 following a late 2019 launch in the U.S., as covered in Barry's prior remarks. We anticipate seeing a contribution from our international markets in the second quarter with a launch in Germany. It is worth noting that we believe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our Q1 product sales results for ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI was minimal.\n Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter. Net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was $27.5 million, a significant increase from last year primarily due to revenue recognized from our Regeneron collaboration. Gross margin was 82% for the quarter, down from 87% in Q1 '19 primarily due to the current utilization of ONPATTRO full cost inventory while last year benefited from 0 cost ONPATTRO inventory.\n Our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for the quarter increased 40% versus the prior year. Key drivers were the increased investment in advancing our late-stage pipeline programs and increased investment in SG&A to support ongoing launches of ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. Our non-GAAP net operating loss for the quarter increased by 12% versus the same period in 2019.\n However, we remain confident that 2019 represents our peak non-GAAP net operating loss year, as we expect more moderate operating expense growth for the balance of the year and strong top line growth in the second half of 2020.\n We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $1.4 billion. We expect to see an increase in our cash balance in Q2 as we received $600 million in cash in early April following the close of the Blackstone strategic financing collaboration.\n Now turning to our financial guidance. We believe our results for the first quarter demonstrate the strength of our commercial teams in challenging circumstances.\n However, as Barry noted earlier, we do expect an impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. So we have decided to lower our 2020 ONPATTRO revenue guidance from $285 million to $315 million to $270 million to $300 million. This represents a 5% decrease at the midpoint of the guidance range but still represents more than 70% planned growth versus 2019. In parallel, we are implementing further discipline in our operations to moderate our spend and are lowering our guidance range for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to $1 billion to $1.075 billion from $1.025 billion to $1.125 billion.\n Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations remains unchanged at $100 million to $150 million. Regarding cash, we believe our $2 billion strategic financing collaboration with Blackstone secures Alnylam's bridge towards a self-sustainable financial profile without the need for future equity financings.\n And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Yvonne to review our goals for the remainder of the year. Yvonne? \nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. While 2020 presents challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it promises to be an important and exciting year in Alnylam's efforts to build a top-tier biopharma company. For starters, we plan to continue our global commercialization of ONPATTRO as well as the global launch of GIVLAARI, including in Europe following our recent EMA approval. We are also expecting 2 additional regulatory approvals by the end of the year for lumasiran and inclisiran.\n We're also executing on 6 late-stage programs in 9 distinct clinical trials. We plan to continue enrollment in our ATTR cardiomyopathy study, specifically APOLLO-B with patisiran and HELIOS-B with vutrisiran. With lumasiran, we look forward to presenting 4 results from the ILLUMINATE-A Phase III study and top line results from the ILLUMINATE-B Phase III study. And of course we'll also continue advancing the rest of our pipeline as well as exciting preclinical efforts, and we'll highlight these milestones throughout the year as they occur. Notably, we aim to deliver 2 new IND filings in 2020, namely ALN-HSD for NASH and very, very importantly, ALN-COV for COVID-19 from our product engine.\n Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? \nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Yvonne. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Gena Wang with Barclays. \nByongsoo Kim: This is Peter Kim for Gena Wang. Congratulations on the [ uptake ]. For your revised ONPATTRO guidance, I know you gave a lot of color, but I was still wondering how much of that do you expect is coming from, I guess, new patients, like break new patients versus existing patients? And also, I think you mentioned that you're seeing some patterns of skipping dose among existing patients. And I was wondering if you have any sense on how this may continue in various different phases that you laid out. \nJohn Maraganore: Yes, Peter, those are great questions. Let me -- I'm going to hand it over to Barry in just a second, but let me just start by saying again what we expect as part of our planning framework is to see impact in Q2 and then, starting in Q3 and Q4, recovery back toward normalcy.\n So we do view the impact of all this to be short-lived. And of course, obviously, this short-lived effect has to be put in the context of the broader efforts we have in advancing our TTR franchise, which, of course we view as a very significant and growing opportunity. So Barry, do you want to specifically talk to Peter's particular questions, which I thought were quite good? \nBarry Greene: Yes. Peter, let me give you some color. And just to say that each country handles -- is handling the pandemic phase very differently. So this is broad color, but every country is a little bit different. The reason that we believe that Q2 will have impact is the site-of-care changes that were made by patients across the world. When a patient moved from an academic center to home care or a local infusion center, it requires that patient and their health care provider to help us activate that change. And as you know, many of the health care providers were absorbed in fighting the pandemic itself. So we could see, instead of 3 weeks, it might have taken 4 or 5 weeks for a patient to change.\n We're generally through all of those changes in countries where we've launched: U.S., Germany, France. So I don't see much more change coming. Patients are where they're going to be. And I will note that many academic centers did stay open and patients continued to move to those centers. I think in the United States in Q2, we'll continue to see a move towards home infusion because some academic centers are asking the patients to make that move. And just to give you a little bit more flavor, in the United States, we had about 9% home use, we moved about 16% in late April. And I see that percent moving up even more as we continue to move patients to home infusion. Hope that helps from a color perspective. \nOperator: We'll move on to our next question from David Lebowitz with Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Lebowitz: With respect to GIVLAARI, are the patients that are, I guess, now on drug, are these mostly for patients that were on prior trials or have transitioned over from EAP programs? Or are these new patients that were found in other genetic efforts? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. That's a great question, David. Obviously, we're very happy with our first full quarter of GIVLAARI performance in the U.S., and we're now looking forward to the launch that has initiated in Germany and also named patient sales that we have in Europe. So we're excited about where Q2 can take us with GIVLAARI as well. The straight answer to your question is these are all patients outside of our -- largely outside of our EAP program and largely outside of clinical studies.\n The patients that were in the clinical studies are still in the clinical studies in the open-label stage. And the EAP patients that we had in the U.S. by the time we launched was very, very small, low single digits, because of the fact that we achieved approval before -- ahead of schedule. So these are all brand-new patients. \nOperator: We'll take your next question from Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America. \nTazeen Ahmad: Maybe a quick one on your early data for hypertension. Can you give us, in the context of the competitive landscape, what a roughly 10-millimeter mercury reduction means? And how -- can you just define what the next steps are for that program? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Great, Tazeen. We're obviously very excited about the potential for ALN-AGT in hypertension. This is an area that is crying for innovation that's been lacking for decades. Akshay, do you want to answer the question specifically? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Sure. With respect to the first one, the greater than 10-millimeter drop that we described, frankly, is a very impressive result relative to most of the drugs at this stage of development. So we are very excited about that. But the impact and the contribution, I think, is not just from the change in -- degree of blood pressure change that we've described, but it's also this infrequent administration, which increasingly looks to us like it could be quarterly or every 6 months or beyond. And the whole pattern seems to be repeating the vutrisiran profile in terms of durability of effect. So that's very exciting.\n That's clearly important given that 50% of patients come off their meds within months to years of starting antihypertensive treatment. And then finally, the other issues that, of course, with clamped control of angiotensinogen, we would get tonic and control of blood pressure. And current medications do not give that. You tend to get cyclical effects as you take your tablets and then as the tablet wears off, the blood pressure changes back to the pathological range again, and then you take your tablet again and then it improves. And that kind of seesawing pharmacology is not desirable and puts patients at risk. \n So it's certainly the millimeters of mercury is impressive. But beyond that, there are other factors that we're also very pleased about.\n In terms of next steps, we're busy planning Phase II. And obviously, we are heavily engaged with regulators in making sure we do that in a way that is both important for the development of the drug, but also where regulators are supportive of the path ahead. So we see a lot of good potential for this drug moving forward. \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Thanks, Akshay. We're very excited about it, Tazeen. \nOperator: Next question comes from Paul Matteis with Stifel. \nPaul Matteis: Great. Again, a couple of questions in AGT, if you don't mind. Were these patients on ACE inhibitors or ARBs? And I guess, can you just tell us a little bit more about safety? There's historically been some concerns with Dual Ras Blockade, hyperkalemia, things like that.\n And then second, with drugs like aliskiren and also I think ACE and ARB combination studies, Dual Ras Blockade has a history of showing a blood pressure benefit, but not necessarily a benefit on outcome. So maybe you can comment on biologically why you think this early POC data is going to translate ultimately to the, hopefully, an impact on mortality? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Great questions, Paul. Akshay, you get them. \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. So with respect to safety, Paul, patients were on a stable antihypertensive regimen, but they had to come off their drug to be in the study. So there was no combination use as such with background therapy with ALN-AGT on top. This was a clean hypothesis test of ALN-AGT alone in patients with essential hypertension.\n At the overall safety profile, as I mentioned during the formal part of the presentation, is very encouraging. We saw no serious adverse events. And overall, we continue to be very, very encouraged by the safety so far.\n With respect to the path forward, Dual Ras Blockade certainly has had some interesting data in the past, there are antihypertensive effects, but there are also some safety issues that people have wondered about, particularly with respect to renal function. One of the things that we are very excited about is the focused pharmacodynamic effect of the -- of our drug on the liver.\n And one reason why previous combinations of ACE inhibitors and ARBs may have been nephrotoxic is -- are local effects in the kidney of those drugs. And so with angiotensin -- ALN-AGT acting on liver alone, because of the GalNAc targeting system, will spare the kidney of any effects directly there.\n And so we are hopeful that it'll have an impressive safety profile as well as an impressive antihypertensive profiling combination. Of course, we're going to evaluate all these moving forward. \nOperator: Next question comes from Maury Raycroft with Jefferies. \nSwapnil Malekar: This is Swapnil on Maury. Congratulations on a very successful quarter. Just a couple of questions on early stage. So for the 2703 program, where you say 99.9% active in 4,300 genomes. Can you talk a little bit about the applicability of this drug in now and different mutated forms of the virus? And then I have a follow-on. \nJohn Maraganore: Yes, great. Akshay, do you want to handle that with our COVID program? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Sure. So as we've been in discovery phase with the COVID program, of course, we've tracked the viral genomes as the sequences have come online, and with over 4,300 sequences available now and studying our target site against those sequences, we're very, very confident that this site appears to be highly constrained, not prone to mutation, and we have a match in almost all of those genomes, as reflected in the 99.99% number. Equally, the cross-reactivity to the previous SARS virus from the early 2000 SARS-CoV-1, it also suggests that the target site's highly constrained. So hence my comment that we anticipate this drug will be highly applicable during this current crisis and likely future crisis, and it's not likely to be prone to mutation readily. \nSwapnil Malekar: Okay. And just one follow-up on the HBV data that was recently presented, like is there like any ongoing work or strategies from a combination perspective with Vir? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. No, absolutely, I mean, as Vir has guided, the next step with the HBV program is further Phase II studies in combination with interferon, which is the initial focus. But then additional agents will be explored as well, including proprietary agents that are in the Vir pipeline. So we're quite excited about the data that Vir recently presented with the HBV molecule, 2218 as they call it. And obviously, it represents a significant opportunity for Alnylam because we have the right to opt in for 50-50 at the end of Phase II just prior to Phase III. So it gives us a way for free up until then to see how the data mature and to be able to come in with what could be a very attractive asset for the future of the company. \nOperator: Next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor. \nAlethia Young: My question is on ONPATTRO and rest of world. The trends look pretty strong on certainly a dollar-denominated growth basis. So I guess I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about whether the U.K. or what specific markets are driving that? And when you think about the mix of kind of the potential slowing that's in your guidance now, do you think it's kind of evenly balanced between the U.S. and ex U.S.? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes, that's a great question, Alethia. And yes, we're really pleased with the rest of world performance that we've seen with ONPATTRO, and it just is a real testament to our commercial team's execution in those parts of the world.\n Barry, do you want to answer the specifics for Alethia? \nBarry Greene: Yes. Yes. Thanks. And I agree with John completely. So Alethia, I'll remind you that when we think about hereditary TTR amyloidosis patients and where they come from, we've communicated previously that they really come from 3 different streams. There's patients on drug via EAP or free groups program, there's patients known to sites and then there's pure new patient finding, which requires patients to flow through the health care system obviously to get diagnosed. Somewhere between 10% and 15% of patients with preserved injection fracture, heart failure patients are due to TTR. So those patients have to show up to be appropriately diagnosed.\n So when we think about outside the United States, we have the benefit in U.K., Italy and others for patients coming from all 3 buckets. Those patients are -- can be naive patients where ONPATTRO is given front line. Those patients can also be patients that move from free of goods, the EAP or others to commercial goods or patients that get switched from stabilizer. We saw a lot of that in France, for example. France has a lot of experience with patients progressing on stabilizers and has the opposite experience with ONPATTRO.\n And then, of course, Japan is also a market where patients are coming from patients known to site and then new de novo found patients. Really in the United States, since it was the first launch in 2018, we've largely worked through those first 2 buckets. In the U.S., the market is dependent on patients flowing through our health care systems so that they can be appropriately diagnosed.\n So we feel good about the growth across all 4 regions as Brazil is getting up online as well. So you can see that in the United States, the dynamic is find new patients, put them on ONPATTRO, add to a previously prescribed stabilizer, whereas all other parts of the world are still benefiting from all 3 of those streams of patients. Hope that helps. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Anupam Rama with JPMorgan. \nAnupam Rama: Thanks for all the color on how you guys are thinking about managing through the COVID-19 pandemic, and I hope everyone at the company is doing well. Just a quick question from us on the full data for ILLUMINATE-A at ERA-EDTA, what potential new analyses should we be expecting sort of beyond the top line that we already know? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Thanks, Anupam. And thanks for your kind words at the beginning. I really appreciate that. Akshay, do you want to comment on the ILLUMINATE-A top line? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. I mean I think we'll present the full data set, obviously the primary endpoint, the change in -- for urinary and plasma parameters around oxalate study, say, and 24-hour safety, of course, will be very important. And the proportions of patients coming to near normal or normal, these are important parameters as well. So it's going to be a comprehensive data presentation, just as we did last year with the givosiran data where we had initial top line and then the... \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. And I would just add to that, Anupam, that obviously, we have a lot of data that we can share and we will share it in a very complete and transparent way as we always do. So we're looking forward to doing that. It's -- would have hoped to have done it in March with the OxalEurope Meeting, but that got shifted and then canceled once and twice. So the ERA-EDTA organizers have been kind enough to allow us to present there, and that's what we're going to do. \nOperator: Next question comes from Vincent Chen with Bernstein. \nVincent Chen: Congratulations on the progress. One more just to revisit the question on rest of world ONPATTRO. In the geographies where you've launched, how much of the patients are coming from the EAP or from the pool of patients who are already known to sites? I guess what portion of the patients who were previously known to sites got on to the EAP? And then how far are you through the process of transitioning both to EAP patients and the -- I guess patients who are known to sites on to commercial drug in some of the major geographies you outlined?\n And then one more, just in the guidance, do you anticipate any delays to the timing of OUS reimbursement decisions related to COVID? \nJohn Maraganore: So those are 2 great questions. I think I'm going to have Barry answer them. I think the first one, you're going -- you're looking for a level of precision that I think we're not going to share. But Barry, maybe you can provide some color on that. And certainly on the payer question in other countries, you might want to comment on that, Barry, as well. \nBarry Greene: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, John. And great question. So as I mentioned, in the United States, it's pure new patient finding. That's the stage that the United States is in.\n As we launch in Europe, most of the European countries have rules that move patients very quickly from an EAP or free of charge program on to a paid program. So that happens quickly in most countries across Europe. And we are getting patients from all 3 buckets, all 3 work streams of patients. Now I will highlight, and as you know, Europe had significant experience with stabilizers and saw patients progress with stabilizers in the polyneuropathy frame but also in the cardiomyopathy side. So the desire to move a patient on to a drug like ONPATTRO that has an opportunity of stopping disease progression, in many cases reversing things like polyneuropathy, has highly attractive profile. So in Europe, patients are coming from all 3 of those streams.\n In Japan, where we did not have an EAP, patients are coming from patients known to site and newly found patients. So both of those are coming. Again, many patients are being switched off of stabilizers, but there are new patients being found in the endemic regions of Japan and we're benefiting from finding those patients and getting them on ONPATTRO.\n In terms of payer, for ONPATTRO, we haven't seen any significant delays. In the United States, there's really been no delays in the GIVLAARI VBA. And there have been slight, call it a week or 2, delays and rescheduling of P&R discussions across countries in Europe, but nothing significant that leads to any of the change to guidance we're providing. The change really is the impact to our health care systems and the inability for patients to get into those academic centers. So that's reflected in the new guidance. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ritu Baral with Cowen. \nRitu Baral: So let's go first to the APOLLO-B and HELIOS-A studies. Since those are more mature studies, what should we be thinking about as far as lost data, anything that can be recouped on telemedicine and how that might impact powering? Or any flexibility around collection of those datas as we think about the integrity of the data set? And then my quick follow-up is, can you explain the GIVLAARI time to fill, this 1 to 2 weeks? Because I mean that's the goal of most orphan launches like 6 months out. So why is it so fast, so early? And could it stretch back out, or is this just how it is going forward? \nJohn Maraganore: Well, let me quickly answer your second question, and then Akshay can prepare to answer your first question. Basically, our teams have gotten better and better from the ONPATTRO experience to being able to do this much more rapidly with GIVLAARI. I think it also reflects the confidence around reimbursement that we have built within the system. So we're really happy with that. We see no reason why it should stretch out at this point. We're very much really operating and using our patient hub effectively to get patients onto treatment as soon as those start forms come in within just a couple of weeks. So very happy about that. Don't see that changing.\n So Akshay, do you want to handle the question on the clinical trials, which I thought was very good? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: Sure. Yes. So in terms of the endpoint structure, we don't see any changes anticipated in the primary endpoint of the overall strategy and the endpoint structure. So I think we feel secure there. Vis-\u00e0-vis APOLLO-B, as we mentioned today earlier that the main issue's that -- at certain sites, there's been some slowdown in enrollments and we've shifted out the completion of enrollment to next year. More details to come on that from the end of this year. \n And with respect to the overall issue of maintaining study integrity and patient continuity, I would say the way we've been able to do that is widening assessment windows, getting patients on home administration, which we've done very successfully in the case of both drugs, and allowing remote collection of both adverse events and labs. So along with the -- showing some flexibility around visit windows. And by the way, all of these things that I'm mentioning are supported by regulators in various guidance documents. And so we feel comfortable there. We've documented it all very carefully as the rationale for that. And so I think, yes, certainly some slowdown in enrollment for APOLLO-B, but overall endpoint integrity and study integrity, we are looking good. \nOperator: Next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. \nUnknown Analyst: A few here. So how is ONPATTRO being prescribed in the mixed phenotype right now, given some increased evidence with combination use with Pfizer's VYNDAQEL? And then just secondly, if you can talk to any numbers around the contribution of cardiologists in the prescriber mix and some of the Q-over-Q trends you're seeing, just given some competitors and noted some declines in new diagnostics. \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Those are great questions. Let me just start by saying that, of course, ONPATTRO is being prescribed for treating the polyneuropathy that's present in patients. Where we see combination use, we believe it's because ONPATTRO is being given for the polyneuropathy appropriately and that the stabilizer's being used or given to treat the cardiomyopathy. So that is what we appear to be seeing. But your question, Barry, maybe you should answer the rest of the question. \nBarry Greene: Yes. Absolutely. So I agree with John completely. What John just described is the U.S. dynamic, not the rest of the world dynamic. In the U.S., what we're seeing is cardiologists working with neurologists in these multi-discipline teams and amyloid centers popping up. And we see this as very good news that the neurologists have a renewed sense of urgency to prescribe ONPATTRO for the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis. The dynamics we see, and it's both stabilizers, both [ taf ] and [ diflunisal ], depending on insurance and ability to pay, so we're seeing ONPATTRO added in the United States to a patient with a stabilizer that's seeing maybe a new care center. They understand the mixed phenotype nature of the disease and are adding ONPATTRO.\n For other parts of the world, we are seeing mostly patients switched off of the stabilizer for the treatment of polyneuropathy for hATTR amyloidosis. \nOperator: Next question comes from Ted Tenthoff with Piper Sandler. \nEdward Tenthoff: Congrats on a really good quarter. Two questions, if I may, real quickly. Firstly, I appreciate all the hard work you guys are doing with Vir to combat SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. In addition to this antiviral program, which is advancing towards the clinic, what other efforts are you doing with Vir? I think the partnership is a little bit more expansive. If you could explain that. And then one real quick one for Jeff. I think you mentioned that you've taken down $600 million from Blackrock (sic) [ Blackstone ]. I believe that's $100 million upfront. Did you take any debt down yet? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Great questions, Ted. Let me just quickly answer your first one and then give it over to Jeff. In addition to the work we're doing targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome directly, which is the ALN-COV program that's now aiming for an IND by the end of the year, we also are targeting, and this is still preclinical, we're targeting ACE2, which is the known receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, as well as TMPRSS2, which is a protease that cleaves to spike protein and activates it for binding to ACE2. \n So we do have these host factor programs going on in addition to the direct antiviral strategy that we're developing. Those are further back, we're obviously going to explore them appropriately. When you target a host factor, you have to think about the safety of the on-target effect and what does that mean. But obviously, we do think that these are important things to explore preclinically. And if the data supports it, we'll take them into development.\n So Jeff, do you want to answer the Blackstone question on the debt? \nJeffrey Poulton: Yes. Sure. The $600 million that's come in to date at close was $100 million in equity and $500 million for the first installment on the royalty monetization. We have not taken any debt down. We would expect to take the first $200 million down at the end of this year. \nJohn Maraganore: Thanks, John. And just as a reminder, the first $500 million has not been -- is not in the Q1 numbers. It's been received, but it will be in Q2. \nOperator: Next question comes from Mani Foroohar with SVB Leerink. \nMani Foroohar: I want to follow up on an earlier question on ALN-AGT. Paul obviously hit on some of the historical challenges around safety for oral therapies that are not targeted the way your GalNAc platform is. Can you give us a little bit of a sense of -- from a commercial perspective, how you think about the opportunity and what that means in terms of clinical trial design? Should a comparator arm be ALN-AGT versus doublet with existing approved orals, ALN-AGT versus single therapy with something like, for example, a losartan? And what does that mean in terms of where in the clinical algorithm ALN-AGT will fall, in terms of after orals first line, like how does that clinical trial design interplay with your own commercial strategy and potential target population? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Well, that's a great question, Mani. You should have been in our development review meeting yesterday to participate in the discussion because it is still an evolving strategic question as to which angle we want to pursue. Of course, all that will be very much data-driven with our Phase I data that's obviously looking really exciting, but also with the Phase II data that emerges. So it probably would be too soon to say exactly where we will go, but we can certainly provide some context on sort of the range of opportunities.\n And so maybe I'll turn it over, first, to Akshay to comment, and then maybe Barry, you'll have some perspective as well to share. So Akshay? \nAkshay Vaishnaw: With the preliminary data that we have to hand, we really think there's a very wide opportunity for this drug. So if we think about it -- even if we just start with the resistant hypertension segment, which is in some sense the apex of unmet need in hypertension, we're looking at probably hundreds of millions of people around the world, double-digit number of millions in the U.S. alone. And that number is consistently growing. And there, I think the approach would be that ALN-AGT would have to be developed in the context of background therapy to get proper control in those patients.\n So you built that at one extreme. At the other end, you have patients with mild or moderate or even severe hypertension form who require a monotherapy, but -- and that's an even larger number than the resistant segment. But as we know, over 50% of them fall off therapy for one or more reasons. And there, an infrequent administration once every 6 months or something like that, like inclisiran, would provide consistent control and a return on clinical benefit, both for patients, health care systems and payers. So there's another opportunity there.\n And then ultimately, we know that the Ras blockers or Ras pathway agents are involved in providing cardiac benefit, not just from the direct effect on hypertension, but also via issues like cardiac remodeling. And so there are yet other opportunities in the long run to think about as well, cardiac remodeling and heart failure associated with hypertension and [indiscernible]. So there's just an enormous set of possibilities here, all in the face of a drug that could be administered very infrequently and would give tonic consistent clamp control of the key pathogenic parameters [ in ] blood pressure. So that's just sort of painting the landscape. There's a lot more things you can do, and obviously, we'll share our [ sources for you ]. \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. And before, Barry, you comment, just wanted to remind you, Mani, that we've shown preclinically some very impressive effects on cardiac function with knockdown of AGT in animal models. So that's very encouraging to see. Barry, any -- do you want to add any commentary on the commercial side? \nBarry Greene: Yes. Just the only thing I'd add, and I think you and Akshay covered the opportunities incredibly well, we will approach the commercialization with the innovation that we've shown for at least our first 2 launches. And we've got some time to develop this drug of course, we have to get into Phase II and then Phase III. But we will launch with that value-based agreement concept around the world. And I would argue that if you have an efficacious safe and infrequently administered drug that clamps blood pressure to the numbers we've suggested, it's a drug that has an opportunity to lower catastrophic risk at a population level, and that's something I'm confident we can get paid for. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Do Kim with BMO Capital Markets. \nUnknown Analyst: This is [ D.K. ] on for Do. Congratulations on the Q1 update. I just have 2 quick questions. First one, I just want to piggyback off the AGT in terms of the long-term strategy there? Is it reasonable to think that a partnership, possibly ex-U.S., could transpire in the future given how capital intensive in can be to kind of commercialize for such a large population?\n And my second question has to do with lumasiran. Given that there could be an end of the year launch, similar to GIVLAARI, can you give us a sense of how the pre-commercial efforts have been going? How have your market access discussions been going with payers? Do you foresee a similar ease of somewhat what you saw with GIVLAARI in terms of converting patients into the commercial product? Or are there some gating steps that we should be thinking about? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. I mean -- listen, I mean for starters, and maybe, Yvonne, you want to comment on the partnering side of it, I mean we're very bullish on AGT as a product that we would take all the way. We're a company, as we look out in the '25 and beyond period of time, where we're going to want to have a potential blockbuster product like AGT, whether we complement our promotional efforts in some way with another type of company, something we could imagine contemplating in the future.\n Yvonne, do you want to comment any further on that for the AGT program? \nYvonne Greenstreet: No, John, you've covered it. I mean we really think it's a very exciting program for us. And we have time to think it through. As we look out to the 2025 period, this could be a really nice additional growth driver for Alnylam. And we'll enjoy being able to progress that most likely within Alnylam, but it gives us the optionality to consider partnering approaches at the right point in time. But for now, thinking about it very much as an Alnylam opportunity. \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. That's great. And Barry, do you want to comment on the really great question about access and GIVLAARI? \nBarry Greene: Sure. Yes. Just one comment back on AGT. As you are aware, with the APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B studies, seeing success there, we'll have a very significant cardiovascular footprint, which positions us well to move into the world of AGT. So I'm excited about that.\n In terms of -- I think there was a question about what we're doing for lumasiran. So right now, in this stage of development, we're doing disease awareness, health care provider, patient advocacy group disease awareness. We have virtual and digital setup for lumasiran. So patients, health care providers can get information on websites about understanding PH1 and its impact. Clearly, the regulatory discussion that determines the label, will be important for other activities that we pursue and then the engagement with payers. We have talked to payers at a high level about the data and our value-based agreement approach, and they are very excited to work with us for PH1. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Alan Carr with Needham. \nAlan Carr: Coming back to your guidance, I'm just trying to get a better sense of whether or not this is based on an actual pattern you see in the second quarter. Is it just an abundance of caution in terms of what you expect to happen? You've mentioned some reduction in patient visits and that sort of thing with ONPATTRO, but can I have a little more detail about whether this is just cautious or something you're seeing? And then if you [ stick ] to OpEx, can you provide some more detail on exactly what you are cutting back on spending? \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Well, let me just -- the guidance change, Alan, let me just start by saying, of course, this really reflects what we believe to be the impact of the pandemic phase in Q2. And obviously, we expect things in Q3 and Q4 to really come back to -- more to normalcy. And obviously, we believe that our teams are really well equipped to navigate through even the Q2 period as well, as we've demonstrated in performance in Q1. But Jeff, maybe you can comment on that and also the final question as well. \nJeffrey Poulton: Yes. Sure. As it relates to the reduction in ONPATTRO guidance, Barry, I think, very well highlighted the reasons for us reducing the guidance by 5%, and we have seen some of those impacts in April, and that's why we anticipate Q2 having the most impact for the year.\n As it relates to the spend guidance, I'd say there's really 2 drivers of the reduction. One is just natural savings as a result of the pandemic and the environment that we're operating in. Certainly, things like travel are significantly reduced.\n But secondly, we have made some prioritization decisions to delay certain activities that we think are not going to have significant impact on the business either in the short or the long term. The midpoint of the revised operating expense guidance reflects 8% growth versus 2019. So I do think it reflects very good discipline as we think about the move towards being a profitable company. We've consistently talked about the drivers for that being both top line growth and discipline in the way we manage our operating expenses. And so I'm proud of the organization, frankly, that we're sort of moving quickly towards that. And again, 8% growth year-over-year, I think, reflects very, very good discipline in managing in an uncertain environment. \nJohn Maraganore: Yes. I'm also proud of the organization, Jeff, as you know, and pleased with your leadership in this regard, for sure. \nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will hand it over to the speakers for additional or closing remarks. \nJohn Maraganore: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on this call. And again, I want to thank all of our Alnylam employees for their dedication and continued hard work. This is certainly a difficult time, but we're really pleased with our ability to march forward and deliver R&D and commercial progress with the \"Challenge Accepted\" spirit that is in the Alnylam RNA. So we look forward to updating you on our next -- on our continued progress in the coming weeks and months. And until then, I hope that all of you stay safe and healthy. Bye-bye now. \nOperator: That concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jeffrey Poulton",
            "content": "Thanks, Akshay, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting Alnylam's Q1 2020 results. As Barry has already highlighted, it was a very strong quarter of commercial execution with outstanding results for both ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. I will focus my comments on 3 topics today:\n Q1 product sales results for ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI, summary of our full P&L results for the quarter and comments on our guidance for 2020.\n Turning to our results first for ONPATTRO, where we had another quarter of continued and steady global growth. We generated $66.7 million in net revenue for the quarter, representing 19% growth in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 154% growth compared with Q1 2019. U.S. growth during the quarter was negatively impacted by modest destocking in Q1 2020 compared with modest stocking in Q4 2019. Inventory in the distribution channel in the U.S. is between 2 and 2.5 weeks at the end of Q1.\n U.S. growth during the quarter benefited from a lower level of gross to net deductions following the increase in Q4 2019 that we highlighted on our year-end earnings call. We continue to expect gross to net deductions will remain in the mid-20s as a percentage of global gross sales for ONPATTRO in 2020. Growth in our international markets was very strong during the quarter and was broadly driven across many markets in Europe as well as strength in Japan. We think this clearly reflects the benefit of having a strong and growing global brand.\n Turning to our results for GIVLAARI. We had a strong first full quarter of sales, generating $5.3 million in net revenue in Q1 following a late 2019 launch in the U.S., as covered in Barry's prior remarks. We anticipate seeing a contribution from our international markets in the second quarter with a launch in Germany. It is worth noting that we believe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our Q1 product sales results for ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI was minimal.\n Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter. Net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was $27.5 million, a significant increase from last year primarily due to revenue recognized from our Regeneron collaboration. Gross margin was 82% for the quarter, down from 87% in Q1 '19 primarily due to the current utilization of ONPATTRO full cost inventory while last year benefited from 0 cost ONPATTRO inventory.\n Our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for the quarter increased 40% versus the prior year. Key drivers were the increased investment in advancing our late-stage pipeline programs and increased investment in SG&A to support ongoing launches of ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI. Our non-GAAP net operating loss for the quarter increased by 12% versus the same period in 2019.\n However, we remain confident that 2019 represents our peak non-GAAP net operating loss year, as we expect more moderate operating expense growth for the balance of the year and strong top line growth in the second half of 2020.\n We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $1.4 billion. We expect to see an increase in our cash balance in Q2 as we received $600 million in cash in early April following the close of the Blackstone strategic financing collaboration.\n Now turning to our financial guidance. We believe our results for the first quarter demonstrate the strength of our commercial teams in challenging circumstances.\n However, as Barry noted earlier, we do expect an impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. So we have decided to lower our 2020 ONPATTRO revenue guidance from $285 million to $315 million to $270 million to $300 million. This represents a 5% decrease at the midpoint of the guidance range but still represents more than 70% planned growth versus 2019. In parallel, we are implementing further discipline in our operations to moderate our spend and are lowering our guidance range for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses to $1 billion to $1.075 billion from $1.025 billion to $1.125 billion.\n Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations remains unchanged at $100 million to $150 million. Regarding cash, we believe our $2 billion strategic financing collaboration with Blackstone secures Alnylam's bridge towards a self-sustainable financial profile without the need for future equity financings.\n And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Yvonne to review our goals for the remainder of the year. Yvonne? Yes. Sure. The $600 million that's come in to date at close was $100 million in equity and $500 million for the first installment on the royalty monetization. We have not taken any debt down. We would expect to take the first $200 million down at the end of this year. Yes. Sure. As it relates to the reduction in ONPATTRO guidance, Barry, I think, very well highlighted the reasons for us reducing the guidance by 5%, and we have seen some of those impacts in April, and that's why we anticipate Q2 having the most impact for the year.\n As it relates to the spend guidance, I'd say there's really 2 drivers of the reduction. One is just natural savings as a result of the pandemic and the environment that we're operating in.

And so I'm proud of the organization, frankly, that we're sort of moving quickly towards that. And again, 8% growth year-over-year, I think, reflects very, very good discipline in managing in an uncertain environment."

            "content": "Thanks, Jeff, and hello, everyone. While 2020 presents challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it promises to be an important and exciting year in Alnylam's efforts to build a top-tier biopharma company. For starters, we plan to continue our global commercialization of ONPATTRO as well as the global launch of GIVLAARI, including in Europe following our recent EMA approval. We are also expecting 2 additional regulatory approvals by the end of the year for lumasiran and inclisiran.\n We're also executing on 6 late-stage programs in 9 distinct clinical trials. We plan to continue enrollment in our ATTR cardiomyopathy study, specifically APOLLO-B with patisiran and HELIOS-B with vutrisiran. With lumasiran, we look forward to presenting 4 results from the ILLUMINATE-A Phase III study and top line results from the ILLUMINATE-B Phase III study. And of course we'll also continue advancing the rest of our pipeline as well as exciting preclinical efforts, and we'll highlight these milestones throughout the year as they occur. Notably, we aim to deliver 2 new IND filings in 2020, namely ALN-HSD for NASH and very, very importantly, ALN-COV for COVID-19 from our product engine.\n Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? No, John, you've covered it. I mean we really think it's a very exciting program for us. And we have time to think it through. As we look out to the 2025 period, this could be a really nice additional growth driver for Alnylam. And we'll enjoy being able to progress that most likely within Alnylam, but it gives us the optionality to consider partnering approaches at the right point in time. But for now, thinking about it very much as an Alnylam opportunity."

            "name": "John Maraganore",
            "content": "Thanks, Christine, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. I think it goes without saying that the first quarter of 2020 has been unlike any that we have faced as a company, as individuals or as a society. We find ourselves in an unprecedented situation as the world confronts its ongoing public health crisis with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n Let me begin by acknowledging the tremendous impact this disease has had on so many people, including our communities, families, friends and coworkers. And also, let me recognize that heroic efforts of our health care workers everywhere during this crisis. I'm also especially proud of the amazing work by our Alnylam team and their ongoing efforts to bring medicines to patients around the world, including our work on potential RNAi therapeutics for COVID-19. Together, we are in the fight against this virus.\n With that, let me start this morning's call with our COVID-19 planning framework. Later, Barry will discuss commercial and supply chain implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and Akshay will discuss the pandemic's impact on our clinical trials and the steps we're taking to mitigate this.\n As you know, the COVID-19 pandemic represents a very fluid global crisis that changes almost daily. There is significant uncertainty about how this situation will unfold, but for now, our Alnylam planning framework is based on the following 3 phases. First, the current pandemic phase, which we believe will likely encompass most of the second quarter. Second, a recovery phase, which we believe will likely encompass most of the third quarter, where we will see a gradual resumption of activities, including at hospitals and clinics, and reopening of businesses with precautionary measures. And then a new normal phase, potentially starting in the fourth quarter, where we hope to see a return toward normalcy. You'll hear us refer to these 3 phases throughout our presentation this morning.\n Now rest assured that Alnylam is prepared for times like this; \"Challenge Accepted\" is part of our RNA. And we are making adjustments as needed across our operations for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve and also for the safety of our employees.\n Now in light of the current situation, despite our strong conviction for Alnylam's prospects in 2020 and beyond, we have decided to lower our 2020 guidance for ONPATTRO by 5%. We believe that this is a prudent decision, not because of any underlying lack of confidence in ONPATTRO's growth and long-term prospects, but simply due to the near-term uncertainties that we're all facing. We also intend to moderate our spend this year and are lowering our expense guidance as well, and Jeff will talk about this in just a minute.\n Now amid all of this unprecedented public health crisis, Alnylam continues to fire on all cylinders, advancing our pipeline and bringing RNAi therapeutics to patients. ONPATTRO continues to demonstrate steady and continued growth globally with a very strong Q1, which we're very proud of. We're also pleased to have completed our first full quarter as a multiproduct, global commercial company with GIVLAARI showing impressive performance in the U.S. And then with lumasiran, we've submitted regulatory filings in the U.S. and Europe with approval anticipated later this year.\n We also made significant progress across our TTR franchise expansion opportunity, completing enrollment in the HELIOS-A Phase III study of vutrisiran and continuing enrollment in APOLLO-B and the HELIOS-B Phase III studies of patisiran and vutrisiran, respectively. In addition to these achievements across our late-stage pipeline, our early-stage programs continue to advance. For example, we're announcing positive top line results this morning from our ongoing Phase I study of ALN-AGT, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting angiotensinogen for the treatment of hypertension. \n We're very excited about the potential of ALN-AGT, as hypertension is the #1 modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a safe and effective infrequently dosed therapy could provide much-needed innovation in a highly prevalent condition. We are also doing our part to help address the COVID-19 pandemic, and we're proud to be part of an entire industry advancing science and innovation toward this common goal. Our approach includes targeting the RNA genome with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. And earlier this week, we announced the selection of a development candidate, ALN-COV, also referred to as VIR-2703, with potent and highly cross-reactive activity. And also we announced plans, together with our partners at Vir, for an accelerated filing of an IND at or around year-end 2020. This would break all records from time from program initiation to filing of an IND.\n Finally, let me finish with a bigger picture for Alnylam as we look forward to the rest of the year and beyond. Alnylam continues to lead advancement of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class of medicines, and we're very much on track to achieving, and in fact exceeding, our Alnylam 2020 strategic goals that we originally announced in early 2015. Indeed, we believe we're on track to exit 2020 as a multiproduct, global commercial company with a deep clinical pipeline for future growth and a robust and organic product engine for sustainable innovation.\n A few weeks ago, we announced a landmark strategic financing collaboration with Blackstone worth up to $2 billion. This deal, one of the largest-ever financings in biotech history, provides Alnylam with very significant capital that we believe secures our bridge towards achieving a self-sustainable financial profile without the need to access the equity markets ever in the future. With a significantly strengthened cash position, along with the multiple drivers for potential top line revenue growth and disciplined expense management, we are more confident than ever that we can build a top-tier biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing medicines with transformative potential to patients around the world.\n So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Barry to review our commercial progress and medical affairs activities in more detail. Barry? Yes, Peter, those are great questions. Let me -- I'm going to hand it over to Barry in just a second, but let me just start by saying again what we expect as part of our planning framework is to see impact in Q2 and then, starting in Q3 and Q4, recovery back toward normalcy.\n So we do view the impact of all this to be short-lived. And of course, obviously, this short-lived effect has to be put in the context of the broader efforts we have in advancing our TTR franchise, which, of course we view as a very significant and growing opportunity. So Barry, do you want to specifically talk to Peter's particular questions, which I thought were quite good? Yes. That's a great question, David. Obviously, we're very happy with our first full quarter of GIVLAARI performance in the U.S., and we're now looking forward to the launch that has initiated in Germany and also named patient sales that we have in Europe. So we're excited about where Q2 can take us with GIVLAARI as well. The straight answer to your question is these are all patients outside of our -- largely outside of our EAP program and largely outside of clinical studies.\n The patients that were in the clinical studies are still in the clinical studies in the open-label stage. And the EAP patients that we had in the U.S. by the time we launched was very, very small, low single digits, because of the fact that we achieved approval before -- ahead of schedule. So these are all brand-new patients. Yes. Great, Tazeen. We're obviously very excited about the potential for ALN-AGT in hypertension. This is an area that is crying for innovation that's been lacking for decades. Akshay, do you want to answer the question specifically? Yes. Thanks, Akshay. We're very excited about it, Tazeen. Yes. Great questions, Paul. Akshay, you get them. Yes, great. Akshay, do you want to handle that with our COVID program? Yes. No, absolutely, I mean, as Vir has guided, the next step with the HBV program is further Phase II studies in combination with interferon, which is the initial focus. But then additional agents will be explored as well, including proprietary agents that are in the Vir pipeline. So we're quite excited about the data that Vir recently presented with the HBV molecule, 2218 as they call it. And obviously, it represents a significant opportunity for Alnylam because we have the right to opt in for 50-50 at the end of Phase II just prior to Phase III. So it gives us a way for free up until then to see how the data mature and to be able to come in with what could be a very attractive asset for the future of the company. Yes, that's a great question, Alethia. And yes, we're really pleased with the rest of world performance that we've seen with ONPATTRO, and it just is a real testament to our commercial team's execution in those parts of the world.\n Barry, do you want to answer the specifics for Alethia? Yes. Thanks, Anupam. And thanks for your kind words at the beginning. I really appreciate that. Akshay, do you want to comment on the ILLUMINATE-A top line? Yes. And I would just add to that, Anupam, that obviously, we have a lot of data that we can share and we will share it in a very complete and transparent way as we always do. So we're looking forward to doing that. It's -- would have hoped to have done it in March with the OxalEurope Meeting, but that got shifted and then canceled once and twice. So the ERA-EDTA organizers have been kind enough to allow us to present there, and that's what we're going to do. So those are 2 great questions. I think I'm going to have Barry answer them. I think the first one, you're going -- you're looking for a level of precision that I think we're not going to share. But Barry, maybe you can provide some color on that. And certainly on the payer question in other countries, you might want to comment on that, Barry, as well. Well, let me quickly answer your second question, and then Akshay can prepare to answer your first question. Basically, our teams have gotten better and better from the ONPATTRO experience to being able to do this much more rapidly with GIVLAARI. I think it also reflects the confidence around reimbursement that we have built within the system. So we're really happy with that. We see no reason why it should stretch out at this point. We're very much really operating and using our patient hub effectively to get patients onto treatment as soon as those start forms come in within just a couple of weeks. So very happy about that. Don't see that changing.\n So Akshay, do you want to handle the question on the clinical trials, which I thought was very good? Yes. Those are great questions. Let me just start by saying that, of course, ONPATTRO is being prescribed for treating the polyneuropathy that's present in patients. Where we see combination use, we believe it's because ONPATTRO is being given for the polyneuropathy appropriately and that the stabilizer's being used or given to treat the cardiomyopathy. So that is what we appear to be seeing. But your question, Barry, maybe you should answer the rest of the question. Yes. Great questions, Ted. Let me just quickly answer your first one and then give it over to Jeff. In addition to the work we're doing targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome directly, which is the ALN-COV program that's now aiming for an IND by the end of the year, we also are targeting, and this is still preclinical, we're targeting ACE2, which is the known receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, as well as TMPRSS2, which is a protease that cleaves to spike protein and activates it for binding to ACE2. \n So we do have these host factor programs going on in addition to the direct antiviral strategy that we're developing. Those are further back, we're obviously going to explore them appropriately. When you target a host factor, you have to think about the safety of the on-target effect and what does that mean. But obviously, we do think that these are important things to explore preclinically. And if the data supports it, we'll take them into development.\n So Jeff, do you want to answer the Blackstone question on the debt? Thanks, John. And just as a reminder, the first $500 million has not been -- is not in the Q1 numbers. It's been received, but it will be in Q2. Yes. Well, that's a great question, Mani. You should have been in our development review meeting yesterday to participate in the discussion because it is still an evolving strategic question as to which angle we want to pursue. Of course, all that will be very much data-driven with our Phase I data that's obviously looking really exciting, but also with the Phase II data that emerges. So it probably would be too soon to say exactly where we will go, but we can certainly provide some context on sort of the range of opportunities.\n And so maybe I'll turn it over, first, to Akshay to comment, and then maybe Barry, you'll have some perspective as well to share. So Akshay? Yes. And before, Barry, you comment, just wanted to remind you, Mani, that we've shown preclinically some very impressive effects on cardiac function with knockdown of AGT in animal models. So that's very encouraging to see. Barry, any -- do you want to add any commentary on the commercial side? Yes. I mean -- listen, I mean for starters, and maybe, Yvonne, you want to comment on the partnering side of it, I mean we're very bullish on AGT as a product that we would take all the way. We're a company, as we look out in the '25 and beyond period of time, where we're going to want to have a potential blockbuster product like AGT, whether we complement our promotional efforts in some way with another type of company, something we could imagine contemplating in the future.\n Yvonne, do you want to comment any further on that for the AGT program? Yes. That's great. And Barry, do you want to comment on the really great question about access and GIVLAARI? Yes. Well, let me just -- the guidance change, Alan, let me just start by saying, of course, this really reflects what we believe to be the impact of the pandemic phase in Q2. And obviously, we expect things in Q3 and Q4 to really come back to -- more to normalcy. And obviously, we believe that our teams are really well equipped to navigate through even the Q2 period as well, as we've demonstrated in performance in Q1. But Jeff, maybe you can comment on that and also the final question as well. Yes. I'm also proud of the organization, Jeff, as you know, and pleased with your leadership in this regard, for sure. Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on this call. And again, I want to thank all of our Alnylam employees for their dedication and continued hard work. This is certainly a difficult time, but we're really pleased with our ability to march forward and deliver R&D and commercial progress with the \"Challenge Accepted\" spirit that is in the Alnylam RNA. So we look forward to updating you on our next -- on our continued progress in the coming weeks and months. And until then, I hope that all of you stay safe and healthy. Bye-bye now."

            "name": "Barry Greene",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. I hope everybody is healthy and staying safe. I'll begin by reviewing our commercial performance in the first quarter. For ONPATTRO, we achieved $66.7 million in global net product revenues, representing nearly 20% quarter-on-quarter growth. As of March 31, we're delighted that over 950 patients are on commercial ONPATTRO treatments worldwide. In the United States, we continue to see progress with both repeat and new prescribers. And in the first quarter, we had 22 new prescribers. As for the mix of these U.S. prescribers, 57% of start forms submitted in the first quarter came from neurologists, 26% from cardiologists and 17% from other physician specialties. Fortunately for patients, we're seeing a treatment that's increasingly handled by multidisciplinary teams that include neurology, cardiology and other physician specialties, and we expect this mix to continue to evolve.\n In the United States, we also continued to see increased concomitant use for ONPATTRO with TTR stabilizers. And recent market research suggests we've got about 15% to 30% of patients with hATTR amyloidosis polyneuropathy are receiving the common treatment as we expect this pattern in the U.S. to grow. Overall adherence to therapy remains very strong at over 90% in the first quarter, which we believe is an encouraging sign and consistent with the APOLLO Phase III data. Regarding U.S. market access, we continue to avoid any of the payer headwinds often reported with other orphan drug launches. Our VBA strategy continues to be very well received.\n Now turning to the rest of the world. We're again very pleased with ONPATTRO performance. Japan delivered another very strong quarter of growth, and we continue to anticipate it will be our second-largest country after the U.S. for ONPATTRO revenue and patients on therapy exiting 2020. In the CEMEA region, we observed strength in France, Germany and the U.K. in the first quarter and continue to expand our footprint with recent launches in Italy, Sweden, Israel, Turkey and Spain.\n Our team also remains committed to addressing the challenge of raising disease awareness and improving diagnosis of hATTR amyloidosis, including with Alnylam Act, our third-party genetic screening initiative in the United States and Canada and now recently in Brazil. As of April, almost 25,000 samples have been submitted, out of which over 1,500 have tested positive for a pathogenic TTR mutation. As with most diagnostics and tests across therapeutic areas, we've seen some slowdown in testing as the pandemic phase set in, but we expect sample numbers to return to near pandemic numbers as recovery phase in Q3 begins and beyond into the new normal.\n Moving to GIVLAARI, for acute hepatic porphyria, or AHP, we achieved $5.3 million in U.S. net product revenues, with strong performance in our first full quarter of launch. We've received over 60 start forms in the United States with over 50 patients on commercial treatment from launch through March 31. We're pleased to see that patients are getting on drug within 1 to 2 weeks after the physician has submitted a start form. We're also seeing patients initiate therapy outside of start forms, a strong sign that providers appreciate the strong access environment Alnylam is establishing for their patients. To that point, similar to our experience with ONPATTRO, we've not experienced any major payer headwinds with GIVLAARI in the United States to date. Again, our VBA-based approach is looking successful here. And we're pleased to report that we've already had 1 signed VBA for GIVLAARI and our discussions with multiple payers interested in the VBA approach are progressing well.\n Another highlight of patient access is that payers are adopting medical policies that are generally consistent with the approved GIVLAARI label, without restrictions to a number of baseline attacks. Now outside the United States, we're pleased to announce the approval in the EU of GIVLAARI in the first quarter and expect to open up key commercial geographies this year, with our initial European launch underway in Germany in Q2 and named patient sales occurring elsewhere in the region. Again, our team is focused on improving awareness and diagnosis of AHP in the patient and physician communities. Through Alnylam Act, we can report 809 tests submitted and 84 patients with positive AHP mutations as of April, representing about a 10% hit rate in samples tested.\n Let me finish with more color around our supply chain and commercial activities in the face of COVID-19. As John mentioned, we expect 2020 to be comprised of the pandemic period through most of Q2, a recovery phase in Q3 and a new normal starting in Q4. Our supply chain remains intact, and we're confident we have sufficient inventory of commercial products, drug product, drug substance as well as raw materials for ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI and for lumasiran as we begin to prepare for that launch. We have comprehensive mitigation measures in place to reduce any potential supply chain exposure, if needed.\n Our global field operations have largely shifted to virtual interactions with HCPs, payers and patients, with the exception of Japan, where our field employees are still able to conduct in-person meetings subject to local restrictions. I want to note that for some time, Alnylam has been developing digital and virtual tools. So we were well prepared for virtual interactions. We expect these virtual interactions and engagements to continue through the pandemic phase and into recovery phase. And while live face-to-face interactions are preferable in many cases, these new virtual tools will be part of the new normal. We believe some of the changes are actually very positive, and we think they can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of HCP interactions for our field force going forward.\n Our teams also have been successful helping patients receive their ONPATTRO infusions or GIVLAARI injections at appropriate sites of care as determined with their physicians, including home setting, which is particularly important during this pandemic period. For ONPATTRO, home infusion has become broadly available in most countries, thanks in part to the recognition of value by physicians, payers and regulators. In the -- in U.S., a recent rule change by CMS created options for our Medicare patients to have coverage for home-based administration. Looking at the proportion of treatments received across academic centers, local centers and in the home, we've seen a significant shift toward home care from Q4 2019 into Q1 2020 as the pandemic response expands globally.\n We believe, particularly in the United States, we'll continue to see patients shift to home care for local infusion centers in Q2 and beyond. For ONPATTRO, we believe adherence will likely decrease during the pandemic phase in Q2 due in part to some skipped doses or dose delays caused by patients moving to new care sites, including home care. We will continue with site-of-care optimization through the recovery phase as patients regain comfort returning to hospitals and clinics for treatment or decide to continue with in-home administration if that's an option for them.\n Finally, we also anticipate that the pace of new patients [ instituting ] therapy will slow during Q2, given reduced genetic testing and diagnosis and patient flow through the health care systems. Thus, we expect some negative impact in Q2 with ONPATTRO revenues, potentially decreasing by about 10% versus Q1. And then we expect improvement and growth in the second half of the year as health care systems return in recovery and into a new normal.\n Let me highlight here that the midpoint of our ONPATTRO revenue guidance represents expected year-on-year growth of greater than 70%, and we remain highly confident in our growth trajectory in all regions. We're playing the long game here, and our goal is to continue to build an industry-leading TTR franchise.\n Now let me turn to GIVLAARI. AHP patients who experience debilitating porphyria attacks often require urgent care or hospitalization. So in this sense, new patient starts and continuity of GIVLAARI treatment are particularly important, given the impact of COVID-19 on urgent care and hospital sites. Given the ENVISION results, which show reduction in AHP attacks requiring urgent care visits or hospitalizations, we expect less of an impact on GIVLAARI adherence and new patient starts during the pandemic phase relative to ONPATTRO.\n In summary, I'll reiterate that we're not simply waiting for the pandemic to pass, we're taking numerous steps to do what's right for patients and to mitigate impact on our business during the pandemic phase. We're very confident about our growth in the recovery phase and beyond, and also continue to see a very bright long-term prospects for our broader ATTR franchise and other marketed products like GIVLAARI.\n As we've heard from -- as you heard from us many times, we're up for the ever-changing environment and will be stronger for it; as John said, challenge accepted.\n With that, I'll now turn over to Akshay to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Akshay? Yes. Peter, let me give you some color. And just to say that each country handles -- is handling the pandemic phase very differently. So this is broad color, but every country is a little bit different. The reason that we believe that Q2 will have impact is the site-of-care changes that were made by patients across the world. When a patient moved from an academic center to home care or a local infusion center, it requires that patient and their health care provider to help us activate that change. And as you know, many of the health care providers were absorbed in fighting the pandemic itself. So we could see, instead of 3 weeks, it might have taken 4 or 5 weeks for a patient to change.\n We're generally through all of those changes in countries where we've launched: U.S., Germany, France. So I don't see much more change coming. Patients are where they're going to be. And I will note that many academic centers did stay open and patients continued to move to those centers. I think in the United States in Q2, we'll continue to see a move towards home infusion because some academic centers are asking the patients to make that move. And just to give you a little bit more flavor, in the United States, we had about 9% home use, we moved about 16% in late April. And I see that percent moving up even more as we continue to move patients to home infusion. Hope that helps from a color perspective. Yes. Yes. Thanks. And I agree with John completely. So Alethia, I'll remind you that when we think about hereditary TTR amyloidosis patients and where they come from, we've communicated previously that they really come from 3 different streams. There's patients on drug via EAP or free groups program, there's patients known to sites and then there's pure new patient finding, which requires patients to flow through the health care system obviously to get diagnosed. Somewhere between 10% and 15% of patients with preserved injection fracture, heart failure patients are due to TTR. So those patients have to show up to be appropriately diagnosed.\n So when we think about outside the United States, we have the benefit in U.K., Italy and others for patients coming from all 3 buckets. Those patients are -- can be naive patients where ONPATTRO is given front line. Those patients can also be patients that move from free of goods, the EAP or others to commercial goods or patients that get switched from stabilizer. We saw a lot of that in France, for example. France has a lot of experience with patients progressing on stabilizers and has the opposite experience with ONPATTRO.\n And then, of course, Japan is also a market where patients are coming from patients known to site and then new de novo found patients. Really in the United States, since it was the first launch in 2018, we've largely worked through those first 2 buckets. In the U.S., the market is dependent on patients flowing through our health care systems so that they can be appropriately diagnosed.\n So we feel good about the growth across all 4 regions as Brazil is getting up online as well. So you can see that in the United States, the dynamic is find new patients, put them on ONPATTRO, add to a previously prescribed stabilizer, whereas all other parts of the world are still benefiting from all 3 of those streams of patients. Hope that helps. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, John. And great question. So as I mentioned, in the United States, it's pure new patient finding. That's the stage that the United States is in.\n As we launch in Europe, most of the European countries have rules that move patients very quickly from an EAP or free of charge program on to a paid program. So that happens quickly in most countries across Europe. And we are getting patients from all 3 buckets, all 3 work streams of patients. Now I will highlight, and as you know, Europe had significant experience with stabilizers and saw patients progress with stabilizers in the polyneuropathy frame but also in the cardiomyopathy side. So the desire to move a patient on to a drug like ONPATTRO that has an opportunity of stopping disease progression, in many cases reversing things like polyneuropathy, has highly attractive profile. So in Europe, patients are coming from all 3 of those streams.\n In Japan, where we did not have an EAP, patients are coming from patients known to site and newly found patients. So both of those are coming. Again, many patients are being switched off of stabilizers, but there are new patients being found in the endemic regions of Japan and we're benefiting from finding those patients and getting them on ONPATTRO.\n In terms of payer, for ONPATTRO, we haven't seen any significant delays. In the United States, there's really been no delays in the GIVLAARI VBA. And there have been slight, call it a week or 2, delays and rescheduling of P&R discussions across countries in Europe, but nothing significant that leads to any of the change to guidance we're providing. The change really is the impact to our health care systems and the inability for patients to get into those academic centers. So that's reflected in the new guidance. Yes. Absolutely. So I agree with John completely. What John just described is the U.S. dynamic, not the rest of the world dynamic. In the U.S., what we're seeing is cardiologists working with neurologists in these multi-discipline teams and amyloid centers popping up. And we see this as very good news that the neurologists have a renewed sense of urgency to prescribe ONPATTRO for the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis. The dynamics we see, and it's both stabilizers, both [ taf ] and [ diflunisal ], depending on insurance and ability to pay, so we're seeing ONPATTRO added in the United States to a patient with a stabilizer that's seeing maybe a new care center. They understand the mixed phenotype nature of the disease and are adding ONPATTRO.\n For other parts of the world, we are seeing mostly patients switched off of the stabilizer for the treatment of polyneuropathy for hATTR amyloidosis. Yes. Just the only thing I'd add, and I think you and Akshay covered the opportunities incredibly well, we will approach the commercialization with the innovation that we've shown for at least our first 2 launches. And we've got some time to develop this drug of course, we have to get into Phase II and then Phase III. But we will launch with that value-based agreement concept around the world. And I would argue that if you have an efficacious safe and infrequently administered drug that clamps blood pressure to the numbers we've suggested, it's a drug that has an opportunity to lower catastrophic risk at a population level, and that's something I'm confident we can get paid for. Sure. Yes. Just one comment back on AGT. As you are aware, with the APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B studies, seeing success there, we'll have a very significant cardiovascular footprint, which positions us well to move into the world of AGT. So I'm excited about that.\n In terms of -- I think there was a question about what we're doing for lumasiran. So right now, in this stage of development, we're doing disease awareness, health care provider, patient advocacy group disease awareness. We have virtual and digital setup for lumasiran. So patients, health care providers can get information on websites about understanding PH1 and its impact. Clearly, the regulatory discussion that determines the label, will be important for other activities that we pursue and then the engagement with payers. We have talked to payers at a high level about the data and our value-based agreement approach, and they are very excited to work with us for PH1."

            "name": "Akshay Vaishnaw",
            "content": "Thanks, Barry, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we are working diligently to advance our 2 product candidates, patisiran and vutrisiran. While ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat polyneuropathy associated with hATTR amyloidosis, we're committed to expanding the product's label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both inherited and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end, we are conducting the APOLLO-B Phase III study. While we continue to enroll patients in APOLLO-B, we have announced today that due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, we expect completion of enrollment to shift into 2021. But rest assured, we'll work very hard to make up any lost time as we enter the recovery and new normal phases in Q3 and Q4 of this year.\n We're also advancing vutrisiran, which is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection and is also in development for ATTR amyloidosis. Here, we are conducting 2 Phase III studies. The first is HELIOS-A, which is evaluating vutrisiran in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. Enrollment is now complete in HELIOS-A, and we remain on track to report top line results early next year.\n Second Phase III study of vutrisiran is HELIOS-B, which is being conducted in inherited wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy. Enrollment is ongoing in the study, which is still in relatively early stages, having just initiated in December of last year. We do expect some enrollment delays here as well in the pandemic phase during Q2.\n I'll now turn to recent progress with lumasiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic that we are developing for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria Type 1, or PH1, in the ILLUMINATE development program. This includes ILLUMINATE-A, our pivotal study in adult and adolescent patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, where we reported positive top line results in December. We now plan to present full results from the ILLUMINATE-A study in June as the OxalEurope Meeting has been postponed once again. Our lumasiran Phase III program also includes our ILLUMINATE-B study in pediatric patients under 6 years of age. Enrollment is complete, and we remain on track to report top line results in mid-2020. We're continuing enrollment in the ILLUMINATE-C study in patients with advanced PH1 disease across all age groups.\n We recently completed the rolling submission of our NDA and submitted our MAA for lumasiran. This was our first NDA and MAA submitted with our staff working virtually, and I'm proud that our teams were able to do this in less than 4 months after our top line results. We expect a regulatory decision on lumasiran approval by the end of 2020.\n As you know, we have 2 additional late-stage programs that are in development with partners. It includes inclisiran in development for hypercholesterolemia, now partnered with Novartis, which is in registration in the U.S. and EU, where both NDA and MAA filing has been accepted, and where we expect initial approval in late 2020.\n We also included fitusiran in development for hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors, partnered with Sanofi. Sanofi has recently disclosed that 2 of the ATLAS Phase III trials have now completed enrollment. So we can expect top line results from the ATLAS Phase III trials in the first half of 2021 as Sanofi has guided.\n In addition to our late-stage clinical programs, we believe we have also been making great progress in our early and mid-stage programs. This includes ALN-AGT in development for hypertension, resistant hypertension, blood pressure that is not adequately controlled with 3 or more antihypertensive drugs, affects an estimated 11 million people in the United States alone. These patients are at substantially high risk of stroke, heart failure, renal failure and other tissue damage. Hypertension is the #1 modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and we believe ALN-AGT has the potential to offer significant benefit to patients by addressing the need for improved blood pressure control.\n In our press release this morning, we announced positive initial top line ALN-AGT results from 48 patients with essential hypertension in the ongoing Phase I study. ALN-AGT was administered as a single subcutaneous dose and achieved an over 90% knockdown of angiotensinogen, or AGT. In addition, ALN-AGT was associated with an over 10 millimeters of mercury reduction of mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure at [ BK ] relative to placebo. The durability of AGT knockdown and blood pressure effects appears to be supportive of our once-quarterly and perhaps a biannual dose regimen, similar to the results we achieved in the initial Phase I study of inclisiran. The safety and tolerability profile of ALN-AGT is also encouraging, with no drug-related serious adverse events. We plan on presenting these data at the medical meeting in the second half of 2020. In the meantime, we're very excited about these initial top line results that support further development of ALN-AGT in Phase II studies that we expect to start next year. \n Turning to our COVID-19 RNAi therapeutics effort in collaboration with our partners at Vir, we've now selected a development candidate, ALN-COV or VIR-2703, with potent and highly cross-reactive activity towards SARS-CoV-2. In oral-based assays, ALN-COV was shown to block viral replication by up to 3 long order with the picomolar EC50. To our knowledge, this is the most potent direct antiviral for SARS-CoV-2 reported to date, high cross-reactivity toward over 4,300 viral isolates, including the 2003 SARS virus, shows that we are targeting a highly conserved region for virus that is likely to be maintained for the current pandemic and potentially future coronavirus outbreak.\n Our plan is to advance inhalational administration of ALN-COV for treatment and/or prevention of COVID-19. We plan to soon discuss this program with the FDA and other regulators, and we expect to file an IND at or around year-end 2020. Finally, I'd like to wrap up by addressing the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our clinical operations activities and the steps we are taking to mitigate it.\n Of course, the top priority here is ensuring patients' safety while continuing to conduct our trials in a vigorous way, since these investigational trials are supporting the advancement of potentially life-saving or life-transforming therapies.\n All of our protocols and statistical analyses plans include measures to account for missing data, and we continue to work with sites and CRO partners to minimize missing data and ensure studies continue with as little interruption as possible.\n We're pleased to see regulatory agencies issue pragmatic guidance acknowledging possibility for protocol deviations, missing data, et cetera. As such, we're capturing the impact of COVID-19 on these parameters, which we will incorporate into our study documentation. We're also taking steps in all of our studies to minimize patient exposure to the virus and keep patients on study. We've done this by expanding our efforts around home care, widening visit windows, collecting labs locally or at home and doing remote collection of adverse events. During the pandemic phase, we expect to continue to see impact on new patient enrollment and, to a lesser degree, delayed or missed doses in some of our studies. As we have said, we'll do everything we can to minimize these impacts and make up for any lost time as we enter the recovery and new normal phases.\n In summary, while there are some disruptions in clinical development activities during the pandemic phase, we've successfully implemented many mitigation steps to minimize impacts on our programs, and we expect any shifts in our time line to be effectively managed and short-lived.\n And with that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results. Jeff? Sure. With respect to the first one, the greater than 10-millimeter drop that we described, frankly, is a very impressive result relative to most of the drugs at this stage of development. So we are very excited about that. But the impact and the contribution, I think, is not just from the change in -- degree of blood pressure change that we've described, but it's also this infrequent administration, which increasingly looks to us like it could be quarterly or every 6 months or beyond. And the whole pattern seems to be repeating the vutrisiran profile in terms of durability of effect. So that's very exciting.\n That's clearly important given that 50% of patients come off their meds within months to years of starting antihypertensive treatment. And then finally, the other issues that, of course, with clamped control of angiotensinogen, we would get tonic and control of blood pressure. And current medications do not give that. You tend to get cyclical effects as you take your tablets and then as the tablet wears off, the blood pressure changes back to the pathological range again, and then you take your tablet again and then it improves. And that kind of seesawing pharmacology is not desirable and puts patients at risk. \n So it's certainly the millimeters of mercury is impressive. But beyond that, there are other factors that we're also very pleased about.\n In terms of next steps, we're busy planning Phase II. And obviously, we are heavily engaged with regulators in making sure we do that in a way that is both important for the development of the drug, but also where regulators are supportive of the path ahead. So we see a lot of good potential for this drug moving forward. Yes. So with respect to safety, Paul, patients were on a stable antihypertensive regimen, but they had to come off their drug to be in the study. So there was no combination use as such with background therapy with ALN-AGT on top. This was a clean hypothesis test of ALN-AGT alone in patients with essential hypertension.\n At the overall safety profile, as I mentioned during the formal part of the presentation, is very encouraging. We saw no serious adverse events. And overall, we continue to be very, very encouraged by the safety so far.\n With respect to the path forward, Dual Ras Blockade certainly has had some interesting data in the past, there are antihypertensive effects, but there are also some safety issues that people have wondered about, particularly with respect to renal function. One of the things that we are very excited about is the focused pharmacodynamic effect of the -- of our drug on the liver.\n And one reason why previous combinations of ACE inhibitors and ARBs may have been nephrotoxic is -- are local effects in the kidney of those drugs. And so with angiotensin -- ALN-AGT acting on liver alone, because of the GalNAc targeting system, will spare the kidney of any effects directly there.\n And so we are hopeful that it'll have an impressive safety profile as well as an impressive antihypertensive profiling combination. Of course, we're going to evaluate all these moving forward. Sure. So as we've been in discovery phase with the COVID program, of course, we've tracked the viral genomes as the sequences have come online, and with over 4,300 sequences available now and studying our target site against those sequences, we're very, very confident that this site appears to be highly constrained, not prone to mutation, and we have a match in almost all of those genomes, as reflected in the 99.99% number. Equally, the cross-reactivity to the previous SARS virus from the early 2000 SARS-CoV-1, it also suggests that the target site's highly constrained. So hence my comment that we anticipate this drug will be highly applicable during this current crisis and likely future crisis, and it's not likely to be prone to mutation readily. Yes. I mean I think we'll present the full data set, obviously the primary endpoint, the change in -- for urinary and plasma parameters around oxalate study, say, and 24-hour safety, of course, will be very important. And the proportions of patients coming to near normal or normal, these are important parameters as well. So it's going to be a comprehensive data presentation, just as we did last year with the givosiran data where we had initial top line and then the... Sure. Yes. So in terms of the endpoint structure, we don't see any changes anticipated in the primary endpoint of the overall strategy and the endpoint structure. So I think we feel secure there. Vis-\u00e0-vis APOLLO-B, as we mentioned today earlier that the main issue's that -- at certain sites, there's been some slowdown in enrollments and we've shifted out the completion of enrollment to next year. More details to come on that from the end of this year. \n And with respect to the overall issue of maintaining study integrity and patient continuity, I would say the way we've been able to do that is widening assessment windows, getting patients on home administration, which we've done very successfully in the case of both drugs, and allowing remote collection of both adverse events and labs. So along with the -- showing some flexibility around visit windows. And by the way, all of these things that I'm mentioning are supported by regulators in various guidance documents. And so we feel comfortable there. We've documented it all very carefully as the rationale for that. And so I think, yes, certainly some slowdown in enrollment for APOLLO-B, but overall endpoint integrity and study integrity, we are looking good. With the preliminary data that we have to hand, we really think there's a very wide opportunity for this drug. So if we think about it -- even if we just start with the resistant hypertension segment, which is in some sense the apex of unmet need in hypertension, we're looking at probably hundreds of millions of people around the world, double-digit number of millions in the U.S. alone. And that number is consistently growing. And there, I think the approach would be that ALN-AGT would have to be developed in the context of background therapy to get proper control in those patients.\n So you built that at one extreme. At the other end, you have patients with mild or moderate or even severe hypertension form who require a monotherapy, but -- and that's an even larger number than the resistant segment. But as we know, over 50% of them fall off therapy for one or more reasons. And there, an infrequent administration once every 6 months or something like that, like inclisiran, would provide consistent control and a return on clinical benefit, both for patients, health care systems and payers. So there's another opportunity there.\n And then ultimately, we know that the Ras blockers or Ras pathway agents are involved in providing cardiac benefit, not just from the direct effect on hypertension, but also via issues like cardiac remodeling. And so there are yet other opportunities in the long run to think about as well, cardiac remodeling and heart failure associated with hypertension and [indiscernible]. So there's just an enormous set of possibilities here, all in the face of a drug that could be administered very infrequently and would give tonic consistent clamp control of the key pathogenic parameters [ in ] blood pressure. So that's just sort of painting the landscape. There's a lot more things you can do, and obviously, we'll share our [ sources for you ]."

Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Christine, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. 2021 was another year of tremendous success at Alnylam, in which we delivered impressive commercial performance and made significant advancements across our broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutics. To start, our commercial products, ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO saw continued growth, primarily due to strong patient demand. In total, we achieved $662 million in net product revenue, representing year-over-year growth of 83%, delivering at the upper end of our guidance range. We\u2019re also excited to have ended the year with a U.S. approval of the fourth RNAi therapeutic discovered by Alnylam, Leqvio, which is partnered with Novartis. We also advanced our pipeline programs at all stages of development. This includes our TTR franchise, where we recently presented full 18-month results from the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study of vutrisiran, Akshay will review these shortly. We also completed enrollment in our two pivotal Phase 3 studies in ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B. Furthermore, we advanced vutrisiran into Phase 2 with the initiation of KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2, representing what we believe to be an opportunity to re-imagine the treatment of hypertension. Additionally, we advanced two more prevalent disease programs towards the clinic, including our first CNS program. Looking towards 2022 and beyond, we view a few strategic goals as key potential growth drivers for Alnylam. First is the potential expansion of our TTR franchise. In the near-term, with the potential approval of vutrisiran and the Phase 3 readout of APOLLO-B with vutrisiran, and over time, as we aim to become the global leader in delivering impactful and highly differentiated medicines to patients. The second key growth driver is our expansion beyond rare diseases into prevalent diseases. And the third growth driver for the company comes from our sustainable innovation engine comprised of new platform enhancements, opportunities with extrahepatic delivery and our ability to find new genetically validated targets, which offers the potential to drive further pipeline expansion to 2025 and beyond. Based on these opportunities, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver on our Alnylam P5x25 goals, making Alnylam a top biotech company developing and commercializing transformative medicines for rare and common diseases for patients around the world, driven by a high-yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering excellent financial results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks, Yvonne, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re very pleased with our fourth quarter performance. The ongoing pandemic had considerable impact on our ability to engage customers via face-to-face interactions. However, our ability to leverage data and analytics for our promotional efforts and improvements in our virtual interaction capabilities have enabled us to finish 2021 with significant year-over-year growth. For ONPATTRO, we achieved $139 million in global net product revenues in the fourth quarter, representing 15% quarter-on-quarter growth compared with the third quarter and 53% growth compared with Q4 2020. And we achieved $475 million in global ONPATTRO revenues for the full year. As of December 31, over 2,050 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO treatment worldwide, with patient compliance remaining consistent above 90%. In the U.S., sales of ONPATTRO increased 17% versus Q3 and were primarily impacted by the following: patient demand, which increased 4% driven by the addition of new patients on therapy with patient compliance remaining consistent above 90% as noted. Inventory stocking in the distribution channel during the fourth quarter. Compared with destocking in Q3, favorably impacted U.S. reported growth by 15% during the quarter. This was expected given the low level of inventory in the channel at the end of the third quarter. We ended the year with approximately two weeks of inventory in the distribution channel, which is at the midpoint of our expectations. In our international markets, ONPATTRO fourth quarter performance remained strong, with growth of 14% versus Q3, primarily driven by increased patient demand broadly across Europe, Canada and Japan, as well as favorability in gross net deductions, positively impacting net pricing for the quarter. We also continue to observe a good balance of first-line use and switches from stabilizers. Moving to GIVLAARI. We achieved $41 million in global net product revenues in the fourth quarter, representing 28% quarter-on-quarter growth compared with Q3 and 84% growth versus Q4 2020. And we achieved $128 million in global GIVLAARI revenues for the full year. As of December 31, over 350 patients were on commercial GIVLAARI treatment worldwide. We are pleased with the steady ongoing launch of GIVLAARI. In the U.S., sales of GIVLAARI increased 35% and versus Q3 2021 and were primarily impacted by the following: patient demand, which increased 8%, driven by an increase in patients on therapy with patient treatment compliance at over 90%; and increase in inventory stocking in the quarter, which favorably impacted growth by approximately 20%. In addition to a decrease in gross to net sales deductions, which contributed an additional 6% growth. We also continue to make strong progress with value-based agreements with over 12 finalized to date with commercial payers. In our international markets, GIVLAARI delivered 10% growth in the fourth quarter compared with Q3, with the growth primarily driven by new patient adds in key Western European markets, notably Spain and Italy. In the UK, we received a positive opinion from NICE and look forward to our launch in the UK in early this year. Moving now to OXLUMO. We achieved $19 million in global net product revenues in the fourth quarter, representing a 29% increase compared with Q3 and ended our first full year since launch with $60 million in global revenues. As of December 31, over 140 patients were on commercial OXLUMO treatment worldwide. In the U.S., sales of OXLUMO increased 9% versus Q3 2021 and were primarily impacted by the following: patient demand increased 15% driven by an increase in patients on therapy and patient treatment compliance at over 90%. Reported growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately 6% from a decrease in inventory stocking in the distribution channel during the quarter. Additionally, we have finalized 11 DDAs to date with commercial payers. OXLUMO growth in our international markets was 40% during the fourth quarter compared with Q3. Q4 growth benefited from an increase in patients on therapy in our established markets, progress in geographic expansion and favorability in gross to net deductions positively impacting net pricing for the quarter. We also continue to be pleased by the broad utilization of OXLUMO across age groups and eGFR categories. In conclusion, despite the ongoing pandemic, particularly the effects of Omicron since late November of last year, I\u2019m proud of the performance our team delivered, a strong fourth quarter and a strong year across all our three commercial brands with 83% revenue growth versus the prior year. Furthermore, we\u2019re excited about the potential upcoming launch of vutrisiran, which has a PDUFA date of April 14. If approved, we believe vutrisiran will offer an important option for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults with its quarterly subcu injection dosing regimen and will further strengthen our franchise leadership in this important growth category. With that, I will now turn it over to Akshay to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Akshay?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Thanks, Tolga, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we\u2019re advancing two late-stage clinical product candidates, patisiran and vutrisiran. Also ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat the polyneuropathy associated with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. We\u2019re committed to expanding the product\u2019s label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end, we are conducting the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study with, which we expect to report top line results in the middle of this year. We\u2019re also advancing vutrisiran, which is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection and is also in development for ATTR amyloidosis as well as the newly announced exciting opportunity in Stargardt disease. In ATTR, we\u2019re conducting two Phase 3 studies. The first is HELIOS-A evaluating vutrisiran in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. In 2021, we presented positive nine-month results from the study. We showed the study met its primary and secondary endpoints of nine months with an acceptable safety profile. These data form the basis for our regulatory submissions to both the FDA and EMA, and we look forward to a potential U.S. approval with the upcoming PDUFA date of April 14, 2022. Additionally, just a few weeks ago, we presented the positive full results for the 18-month endpoints from the study. As a reminder, HELIOS-A is a randomized open-label study in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis polyneuropathy. The study enrolled 164 patients who were randomized 3:1 to receive vutrisiran at a dose of 25 milligrams administered subcutaneously once every three months or patisiran administered intravenously in once every three weeks at a dose of 0.3 mg per kg as a reference comparator. To start, serum TTR reduction in the vutrisiran group was rapid and sustained over a period of 18 months. Specifically, vutrisiran achieved a mean steady-state serum TTR reduction from baseline of 88%. We\u2019re also very pleased to see low interpatient variability in TTR reduction over the time period. As expected, the TTR reduction achieved with vutrisiran was statistically non-inferior to that observed in the patisiran reference arm. This is important as we would expect, but a comparable level of TTR reduction by vutrisiran and patisiran should result in a comparable level of clinical impact. We\u2019re delighted to HELIOS-A met all secondary endpoints measured at 18 months, including the statistically significant improvements in neuropathy as measured by the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score, or mNIS+7, quality life, gait speed, nutritional status and overall disability relative to external placebo data from the APOLLO Phase 3 study of patisiran. Furthermore, at 18 months, vutrisiran also demonstrated improvement compared to extend placebo in the exploratory cardiac endpoint NT-proBNP and trend towards improvement in echocardiographic parameters as well as improvement compared to baseline in cardiac update of technetium on scintigraphy imaging, collectively providing evidence to suggest that vutrisiran treatment may potentially result in improvement of cardiac manifestations of disease. Looked at in aggregate and as expected, the treatment effect of vutrisiran at 18 months across an array of end points is quite similar to that observed with patisiran. These observations, including especially the exploratory cardiac data underscore our confidence in the potential of both the patisiran and vutrisiran in ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. This, of course, is being evaluated in the ongoing Phase 3 studies, APOLLO-B with patisiran and HELIOS-B with vutrisiran. Let\u2019s now review the safety results at 18 months. Vutrisiran demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile by 18 month three patients on the vutrisiran arm or 2.5% discontinued the study due to adverse events. The single new discontinuation since month nine was in the event of cardiac failure considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator. By month 18, there were two deaths, neither of which was considered relative \u2013 related to study drug. There were two serious adverse events deemed related to vutrisiran by the study investigators consisting of dyslipidemia and urinary tract infection. These deaths and related SAEs all occurred by month nine that have been previously reported. Treatment emergent adverse events occurring in 10% or more of patients included four pain in extremity, diarrhea, peripheral edema, urinary tract infection, arthralgia and dizziness, with the exception of pain and extremity in arthralgia, each of these events occurred at a similar or lower rate as compared with external placebo. Injection site reactions were reported in five patients or 4.1% and were all mild and transient with no hepatic safety concerns. We\u2019re very pleased with the totality of the results and the profile of vutrisiran that continues to evolve. We believe that based on these data, vutrisiran, if approved, will present an exciting commercial opportunity, providing an attractive treatment option for patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy around the world. Of course, this is just the start for vutrisiran, and we\u2019re also conducting another Phase 3 study, HELIOS-B, which is our ongoing Phase 3 cardiac outcome study with vutrisiran in hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. We were excited to complete enrollment in the third quarter of 2021 with over 600 patients, well ahead of schedule due to strong enrollment. HELIOS-B has a 30-month endpoint of all-cause mortality and CV events and we expect the full results in early 2024. The study design includes the potential for an interim analysis, and we will consider this following results from the APOLLO-B study and engagement with regulatory authorities. As I alluded to earlier, we also recently announced a promising new near-term opportunity for vutrisiran in Stargardt disease, providing the potential to expand the use of vutrisiran to treat an inherited and progressive ocular disease. This stems from our realization that the vutrisiran mechanism of action via reducing vitamin A, can in turn potentially reduce the buildup of toxic metabolites in the eye that lead to vision loss in Stargardt disease. We believe this represents an important expansion opportunity for vutrisiran in an area of high unmet medical need where those therapies exist today. We intend to start a Phase 3 study in late 2022. In addition to our late-stage clinical programs, we believe we\u2019ve also been making great progress with our early and mid-stage programs. As we\u2019ve highlighted for a bit now, a key growth driver for Alnylam is our expansion beyond rare diseases into prevalent disease. Our program for hypertension is a great example. Zilebesiran, formerly known as ALN-AGT, is our investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the genetically validated target angiotensinogen in development for the treatment of hypertension. Zilebesiran is being evaluated in the Phase 2 KARDIA program. The first of the 2 studies, KARDIA-1 is currently enrolling and is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran as a monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The second of these studies KARDIA-2, was initiated in the fourth quarter and is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran as an add-on therapy in patients with hypertension despite treatment with standard of care. We also continue to gather data from the ongoing Phase 1 study and recently presented updated data at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions. Here, single doses of investigational zilebesiran resulted in sustained AGT and blood pressure reductions through six months, supporting quarterly and potentially biannual dosing. We also observed that blood pressure response to low salt intake under the peak pharmacodynamic effect of zilebesiran was consistent with augmented pharmacology with no hypotensive cardiac adverse events reported. Additionally, coadministration with Irbesartan result in additional blood pressure lowering without signals of renal toxicity. Zilebesiran was generally well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events or study withdrawals supporting continued development. Another key growth driver for Alnylam in the years to come will be our organic product engine driving sustainable innovation. Here, we made strong progress in the fourth quarter. We moved two programs towards the clinic with recent CTA filings for ALN-XDH in gout, and very excitingly, our first CNS program, ALN-APP, for the potential treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. We\u2019re thrilled to announce date that the Phase 1 study for ALN-APP has now been initiated, and we look forward to starting the Phase 1 trial for ALN-XDH early this year. There are just a few highlights amongst the many exciting programs being advanced by our organic research engine, and we look forward to updating you all on this progress throughout the year. With that, let me now turn the call over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff?\nJeff Poulton: Thanks, Akshay, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be presenting Alnylam\u2019s Q4 and full year 2021 financial results, which underscore Alnylam\u2019s strong commercial capabilities and operational excellence and reflect another impressive quarter of progress on our journey towards building a self-sustainable financial profile aligned with our P5x25 goals. After commenting on our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, I will also provide our financial guidance for 2022. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter and full year. Total product revenues for 2021 were $662 million or 83% growth versus 2020, with all three marketed products contributing material year-over-year growth. Net revenue from collaborations for the fourth quarter was approximately $60 million, which included recognition of a $25 million milestone due from Novartis following the December FDA approval of Leqvio. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 34% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with our mid and late-stage pipeline, including investment in our two Phase II studies for zilebesiran in hypertension, KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2, an ongoing investment in our two ATTR Phase 3 studies in cardiomyopathy, APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 17% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to increased investment in commercial and medical affairs activities to continue supporting ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI and the first full year of OXLUMO commercialization as well as legal expenses associated with the ongoing Department of Justice investigation. Our non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were approximately $1.2 billion in 2021, representing 16% growth versus 2020 as we continue to advance our pipeline and deliver strong top line growth while maintaining discipline in how we invest in our operations. Our non-GAAP operating loss for 2021 was $528 million, representing a $121 million improvement compared with 2020 as we continue to progress on our journey toward building a self-sustainable financial profile aligned with our P5x25 goals. Finally, we ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.4 billion compared to $1.9 billion at the end of 2020. The increase was primarily due to receipt of the second $500 million payment from Blackstone associated with monetizing 50% of the future sales of Leqvio, $500 million from drawdown on our credit facility and more than $200 million from the exercise of employee equity awards, offset by cash used in our operations to support overall growth. We continue to believe that our current cash balance will bridge us to a financial self-sustainability profile and enviable position in today\u2019s market environment. Now turning to our financial guidance for 2022, which does reflect the potential impact of the ongoing pandemic, particularly during the first half of the year. Starting with net product revenues, we are providing combined net product revenue guidance for ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI, OXLUMO, and vutrisiran, assuming approval by the PDUFA date in April. We anticipate combined net product revenues for these four products will be between $900 million and $1 billion, with the midpoint of the range representing 44% growth compared to 2021. We also anticipate that our Q1 2022 combined product revenues will be down modestly compared with Q4 2021. While we do expect an increase in patient demand during Q1, driven by an increase in patients on therapy across our products. We expect this will be more than offset by headwinds associated with the stocking gross to net benefits that occurred in Q4, not recurring in Q1. Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties is a range between $175 million and $225 million, with the midpoint of the range representing 10% growth from 2021. Growth in 2022 is expected to become primarily from our collaboration with Regeneron and royalties and milestones from Novartis based on Leqvio sales. Our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses is a range between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. The midpoint of the guidance range represents a projected 18% increase compared with 2021. We anticipate SG&A growth will be lower than our growth in R&D in 2022 as we seek to generate operating leverage from our existing commercial infrastructure to support our three current commercial products and a potential launch of vutrisiran. We expect a higher rate of growth for R&D driven by increased investment in KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2, our two ongoing Phase 2 zilebesiran studies in hypertension plus increased investment in our preclinical portfolio as we continue to drive additional innovative organic growth opportunities. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones in 2022. To start, we plan to continue commercializing our three existing marketed products, ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. We plan to continue advancing our ATTR franchise. With vutrisiran, we look forward to the potential approval and U.S. launch of the fifth RNAi therapeutic with a PDUFA date of April 14. Approval in the EU is anticipated midyear with subsequent launches in key markets to follow pending finalization of pricing and reimbursement. With patisiran, we look forward to top line results from the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study in mid-2022. Next, we have an exciting readout coming up with cemdisiran where we plan to report Phase 2 monotherapy results in IgA nephropathy in early 2022. For zilebesiran, the KARDIA-1 trial is expected to complete enrollment in mid-2022. For ALN-HBV02, partnered with VIR and also known as VIR-2218, we look forward to Phase 2 combination results in the early part of the year. And for ALN-XDH we\u2019re excited to get that Phase 1 study started shortly with top line results for both this program and ALN-APP expected in late 2022. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, we will now open the call for your questions. To those dialed in, we would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each and then get back in the queue if you have additional questions.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Ritu Baral with Cowen.\nRitu Baral: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask, as you think about the vutrisiran approval and the vutrisiran label, how should we be thinking about potential inclusion of KARDIA subgroup data within the label? And should we expect any additional HELIOS-A cardiac data set presented at upcoming meetings that could either give us more insight into potential APOLLO-B placebo, whether that\u2019s Alnylam data, whether it\u2019s third-party data, et cetera? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks for your question, Ritu. I\u2019ll just start off by saying that we\u2019re really excited about the potential launch of vutrisiran later this year, because we really believe that vutrisiran has a compelling proposition really with its quarterly subcutaneous regimen allowing patients essentially freedom from their disease. And just one important point that I\u2019d like to make, we do see the launch of vutrisiran is adding to our overall TTR franchise. We don\u2019t see it as a net zero-sum game. And we also recognize that we\u2019re still early with respect to accessing hATTR patients for polyneuropathy given that ONPATTRO has been able to secure about 2,050 patients, and there are about 30,000 patients worldwide that are still awaiting treatment. You probably are aware, I know this we too, that what we feel so pleased about is that we\u2019ve been able to essentially replicate with HELIOS-A, both the nine months and the 18-month data, what we found in APOLLO. And I think this is an incredible achievement actually when you think about these studies being run at different times. So the patient population was very similar, and the results, as I said, we are very consistent between HELIOS-A and APOLLO. But perhaps, Akshay, I\u2019ll ask you to comment on your views about the cardiac data and what we could expect there and what might be on the label.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. No. Thanks, Yvonne. We were obviously very excited about the exploratory cardiac data, whether it\u2019s the BNP, the echocardiographic and those essentially, as you said, were very similar to what we\u2019ve seen in APOLLO, but most importantly, some new information on technician scan showing \u2013 than the potential amyloid mobilization with reduction in uptake in technetium. So that\u2019s really exciting new information. And again, adds to our confidence in our subsequent work in APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B. So we continue to feel very good about the potential for both ONPATTRO, patisiran and vutrisiran in the cardiac context in those studies. As far as the label is concerned, whilst those exploratory data, we believe are exciting and speak a lot about the potential for the drug. HELIOS-A was designed and executed exactly as closely as possible to APOLLO, and we expect a very similar label frankly, Ritu. The data that I\u2019m talking about, we\u2019ve largely shared, but there\u2019ll be additional data coming out at meetings through the year, further going into the HELIOS set. But to your specific question, I don\u2019t know that those data will shed light on the natural history of the cardiomyopathy and the other features you\u2019re alluding to, as we look forward to the APOLLO-B data, which will be handled to food in the middle of the year, actually. So, I think that\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave it.\nRitu Baral: Got it. Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: And Ritu, just as a reminder, with respect to HELIOS-A, of course, the patient population is hATTR with cardiomyopathy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays.\nGena Wang: Thank you for taking my questions. Just one question regarding the guidance assumption. I assume the main driver would be the ATTR franchise. Wondering if you can give a little bit more color regarding the assumption you have for ONPATTRO and vutrisiran for 2022?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, that\u2019s a great question, Gena. This is a very important part of our go-forward growth opportunity, TTR franchise, we believe that we will be the leaders in this area in terms of meeting the needs of all patients with TTR over time. Tolga, perhaps you could speak specifically to how we\u2019re thinking about vutrisiran and ONPATTRO. I know that one the things that we\u2019re really pleased about actually is the stickiness that we\u2019re seeing with ONPATTRO with a greater than 90% adherence, which actually is remarkable for a therapy that\u2019s administered intravenously every three weeks. As I said before, I think the profile of vutrisiran is particularly compelling. As I think \u2013 as I said, the important point here is that we see the launch of vutrisiran in polyneuropathy is growing the overall TTR franchise. And clearly, that will continue to grow over time, assuming, of course, positive data for both ONPATTRO and vutrisiran from APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B, respectively. But perhaps, Tolga, you could provide some additional perspectives on how you see ONPATTRO and vutrisiran over the course of this year?\nTolga Tanguler: Sure, sure. Good morning, everyone. Listen, I mean, I think you really made the point around the fact that we \u2013 the guidance we have provided assumes an accelerated growth for our TTR franchise. That\u2019s our anchor franchise. Also, at the same time, our other ultrarare disease products will certainly be contributing to that and punching above their weight. When it comes to vutrisiran, Yvonne is spot on. I mean this is not going to be a zero-sum game. We do anticipate a number of patients that may not have been benefiting from ONPATTRO will certainly find the profile that we have very appealing, subcutaneous three months and then subsequently six months. We believe that\u2019s going to accelerate overall growth profile. And also, as you also pointed out, we are barely scratching the surface in terms of the number of patients that are being diagnosed and treated. We have 30,000 patients across the world, and a very small number of those are being treated despite the fact that there are three products available out there. So with the product profile, if approved, for vutrisiran polyneuropathy indication, we certainly see an accelerated growth in the U.S. after the PDUFA date April 14. And then subsequently also, we do anticipate two launches in Japan and Germany later in the fourth quarter, which probably will not contribute as much, but it\u2019s going to help the momentum.\nGena Wang: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tazeen Ahmad with Bank of America.\nTazeen Ahmad: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Could I ask one on KARDIA-1. You do have your top-line results, Phase 2 that are due by this year-end as you mentioned. What should we be looking for what you would consider to be clinically meaningful data there? And what would be a good comp on the competitive landscape to kind of judge effectiveness against? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. No, thank you for that question, Tazeen. As I\u2019m sure you all know, we are really very excited about the potential that zilebesiran has in addressing patients with hypertension. Just to remind you, we\u2019ve already demonstrated what we need to demonstrate from an efficacy perspective for an approval in our Phase 1 study, after just a single dose, we\u2019re able to affect blood pressure lowering of between 10 millimeters and 20 millimeters of mercury, which is actually tremendous. Clearly, we need to deliver only two Phase 2 studies and then move forward into Phase 3. But I think from my perspective, what\u2019s really kind of exciting about zilebesiran is, firstly, the size of the opportunity in a very prevalent population, 1.2 billion people across the world have hypertension, but also the very straightforward path to regulatory approval here. And clearly, KARDIA-1 is a key step along that journey. So, I\u2019ll ask Akshay now to maybe speak a bit more specifically about what we\u2019re looking for with respect to outcomes from KARDIA-1. And then I will turn it over to Tolga to provide some views on the competitive landscape.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Great. So as Yvonne said, I think we should once again recall really the very dramatic and impressive results from the Phase 1 study with over 20-millimeter mercury drop in blood systolic blood pressure at the top dose and maintained out through six months. Now the KARDIA-1 study will hope to replicate the blood pressure results we saw in the Phase 1 study. Historically, anything above a 5-millimeter mercury drop in blood pressure seems to be notable and people would advance those kinds of drugs into further development. We would hope to do better than that based on what I just told you. Now whether we\u2019ll see exactly what we saw in the Phase 1 study, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m confident we can do better than that in KARDIA-1 than the 5-millimeter threshold I just said. I think the other thing to remember about what\u2019s clinically meaningful with the angiotensinogen approach and why maybe sort of not entirely right to just compare it to a blood pressure reduction number is the way blood pressure is being reduced with zilebesiran. So yes, absolute reduction in blood pressure is important but preventing fluctuations in blood pressure and having a smooth and tonic control of blood pressure is important to patients, and we hope zilebesiran can do that, yet inside think of that from KARDIA-1. And restoring the physiological nighttime dipping, but that blood pressure patients often lose, that will be important. So there\u2019s so much more to zilebesiran than just a star blood pressure reduction number is the way it\u2019s done and the features I talked about as well as the adherence advantages with having a potentially once every three or six-month administration of the drug. So, I\u2019ll stop there. Lots to look forward to, I think, in KARDIA-1. But Tolga, do you want to say something about the landscape?\nTolga Tanguler: Sure. I mean, look, this is clearly a highly genericized class, but this is why I think Alnylam\u2019s underlying technology is so exciting that allows us to really rethink the entire \u2013 how to actually manage medicine. In this, despite the fact that there are easily accessible genericized products in this category, we still have 40 million Americans that are suffering hypertensive-related diseases. And the U.S. is spending about $100 billion according to ACC for that. So, I believe from a category perspective, this approach is going to be a tremendous benefit to the broader society. And we are, obviously, when it comes to different therapy areas, we are obviously ahead of that curve right now in terms of providing an entirely new class of medicine.\nYvonne Greenstreet: That\u2019s great. Thanks, Akshay and Tolga. Tazeen, does that answer your question?\nTazeen Ahmad: Yes. Thanks for the color, Yvonne.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Matteis with Stifel.\nPaul Matteis: Great. Thanks so much and congratulations on all the progress and getting close to $1 billion in product revenues, a big milestone. I wanted to ask a question on APOLLO-B. I guess there\u2019s right or wrong debate in the investor community on the trial design and powering and how to make sense of the BridgeBio result. I guess now that you\u2019ve digested their data, can you just point us to the one to two reasons why you\u2019re confident that on 6-minute walk tests, you\u2019ll see decline for placebo and APOLLO-B and that you\u2019re confident in your powering assumptions? Thanks so much.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thank you, Paul. That\u2019s a great question. So look, we\u2019re very confident, and we\u2019ve reiterated this point about our track record in executing studies in the TTR space. And we believe that we put all the mechanisms and we have the expertise in place to design studies, train the sites, work with vendors, et cetera, to make sure we have delivered the highest quality data. Now you probably know as much about the BridgeBio data as we do. So, we\u2019re not going to really speak to BridgeBio specifically. But I\u2019ll hand it over to Akshay to reprice our perspectives on APOLLO-B.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Thanks, Yvonne. So Paul, I mean, I think, yes, you know the same data as us, but it\u2019s hardly, I think we\u2019d all agree a full explication of the data, right? We would love a full presentation. There\u2019s lots more to understand. So, we have partial glimpses, I think, a variety of different explanations over time have been offered by BridgeBio colleagues. That\u2019s obviously for them to speak further to their study, but context, bias, trading effects on network distance, all of these have been mentioned by BridgeBio leaders. So more for them to comment there. The one thing that struck us about their data, at least what\u2019s public is that the 6-minute walk distance didn\u2019t seem to perform and yet other parameters, BNP and KCCQ showed exactly or very similar to what happened in the ATTRACT study at 12 months. So it\u2019s hard to reconcile that. And I think there are explanations or putative explanations around trading effects, contacts, bias, et cetera. You should be borne in mind because of the three parameters BNP, KCCQ and 6-minute walk distance, the last one would be influenced by those kinds of features. And so again, that\u2019s what we say see and say from the outside more for them to comment than I think us. For our part, we\u2019ve worked in this area for over a decade. We have designed studies in the TTR basis, significant Phase 3 studies. We\u2019ve replicated data across studies. I think the HELIOS-A example, where we were just discussing earlier in the call, where the design of the study execution and the data delivery looks so similar to what happened in APOLLO, and APOLLO was designed in 2013 or executed in 2013. So it shows that we \u2013 I think we take great care, and we know how to test hypotheses in the space very diligently and rigorously. And so we continue to feel very confident in our APOLLO-B work and how we\u2019ve designed it and powered it conservatively to hit the primary endpoint of 6-minute walk distance. And we\u2019ll have the data all too soon, middle of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nAlethia Young: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on all the progress over 2021. I guess just talking about maybe the trend lines between patisiran and vutrisiran potential approval and launch. I mean, do you expect kind of the ramp speed to be about the same? Or do you think the vutrisiran has the potential to have a faster ramp speed since he\u2019s already if you kind of know about the class of drugs and the subcu things?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thank you, Alethia. That\u2019s a great question. I mean, look, we\u2019ve been really pleased with the performance of ONPATTRO. We\u2019ve demonstrated steady and continuous growth since the launch in 2018. So, we\u2019re delighted with the contribution that, that has made to patients, but also to building Alnylam. Look, vutrisiran just has such a compelling profile given its quarterly subcu regimen, hopefully soon to become a six-monthly regimen. And we do believe that we have a real opportunity to grow the polyneuropathy market with vutrisiran and then subsequently assuming positive results from HELIOS-B, cardiomyopathy as well. But Tolga, perhaps I\u2019ll hand this question over to you. I mean how do you see vutrisiran and ONPATTRO performing in the market over the next year or so?\nTolga Tanguler: Right. Hi, Alethia. Thank you for that question. And thanks, Yvonne. Look, we\u2019re able to grow that franchise at 55% after third year of its launch. So clearly, the progress we made on, in terms of growth has been good. Next year, we will continue to obviously grow ONPATTRO until vutrisiran is in the market. Based on the profile that Yvonne indicated, we would anticipate the source of business we have is essentially mainly coming from academic centers, as is now the business is evolving more into the community centers. And I think the profile that vutrisiran has to offer will be very attractive to those physicians that are looking some different profile. And also, particularly in Europe, where the stabilizers are also indicated for polyneuropathy, a good portion of our growth has been coming from stabilizers, which are, as you know, daily oral tablets. Now instead of having an infusion without any premed and three month subcutaneous injection, clearly, is a very attractive profile for those patients that may still be on the stabilizer. So overall, we certainly see a modest accelerated growth that we\u2019ve been able to post versus last year. And we will see that in an accelerated fashion. That\u2019s the best way I would be able to describe it to you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, I\u2019ll talk that\u2019s great. So very excited about the TTR franchise overall. vutrisiran affords the opportunity to \u2013 for physicians and patients to start treatment earlier in patients with polyneuropathy and obviously, in the U.S., patients who have the mixed phenotype as well. And then as Tolga said, potential for earlier switch, just given the much reduced treatment burden of vutrisiran. So hopefully, that\u2019s answered your question, Alethia?\nAlethia Young: It does. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anupam Rama with JPMorgan.\nAnupam Rama: Hey guys, thanks so much for taking the question. I have a quick question on the net product guidance. So what is assumed specifically for OUS growth and sort of geographic expansion driving growth versus a deeper penetration in the U.S. in some of your core countries that you\u2019ve kind of outlined in the slides for ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO? Thanks so much.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Anupam, that\u2019s a great question. Look, if you think about the different products, ONPATTRO been on the market now for three years, less opportunity for geographical expansion because we\u2019ve actually managed to work our way through the various pricing reimbursement systems ex-U.S. very well, and we have incredibly good coverage in the U.S. as well. GIVLAARI, clearly earlier in its launch, and we see their continued geographic expansion. Just recently, the NICE approval in the U.K. speaks to that point. And OXLUMO, we\u2019re really 2021 was our first full year since launch. I think what we\u2019re particularly pleased about there is really broad utilization across all age groups, disease severity. And I think we\u2019re benefiting in Europe with respect to OXLUMO with the centers of excellence that you see there, which meant the patients already being diagnosed as well as being able to transition patients from our expanded access program, and those were dynamics that we clearly didn\u2019t have in the U.S. And as we look forward, I think we see continued geographical expansion for the more recently launched products, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO as well as continued penetration. And for ONPATTRO, we see across the world, increased patient demand to new prescribers. And so we expect to see continued penetration in the U.S. and outside the U.S. But what I\u2019ll do, maybe I\u2019ll hand it over to Jeff to provide a little bit more color on how we\u2019re thinking about the year ahead. Jeff?\nJeff Poulton: Thanks, Yvonne. Good question Anupam. We\u2019re not breaking out specific geographic detail. But I think Yvonne outlined the sort of the key elements of what\u2019s going to drive our ex-U.S. growth. And it really depends on time on the market. The longer the products have been on the market ex-U.S., the more it\u2019s about naive patient finding. And in the case of our ATTR franchise, there\u2019s still a big switch element. Products that have been on the market a shorter amount of time still will benefit from additional geographic expansion. So in this case, OXLUMO will be the one that will benefit the most from that going forward. So that answers the question.\nAnupam Rama: Thanks so much guys.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. Thanks for the additional color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.\nSalveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So you have two data reads this year in tissue targets outside the liver. Could you just speak to the ALN-APP and HSD readouts? And whether you could establish a proof-of-concept with these reads and what you\u2019re specifically looking for clinically?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. Thank you for that question, Salveen. Look, I\u2019m particularly excited about the opportunity to extend the power of the R&I platform outside the liver. I think this opens up a whole new horizon for Alnylam we think about our growth over the next several years. And as you said, ALN-APP we\u2019re very excited to be moving that forward in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. HSD is obviously a liver director target. I think what we\u2019re excited about with respect with HSD is the size of the NASH patient population. And therefore, this is a much more prevalent disease opportunity. So I\u2019m going to hand it over to actually to, first of all, just very briefly describe what we\u2019re expecting to see out of our ALN-APP proof-of-concept study, we\u2019ll be getting clinical data at the end of this year and then also the ongoing Phase 1 study with HSD and NASH. So Akshay, over to you to maybe address those two programs.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Thanks, Salveen. So with respect to ALN-HSD, which, in fact, is a liver target therapeutic and HSDs was exclusively present in hepatocytes. So for NASH, some of the key readouts beyond safety, of course, which is very important, will be evidence of knockdown, and we\u2019re taking biopsies in this study. So you can\u2019t detect HSD in the circulation. And hopefully, the biopsies will support kind of knockdown we\u2019re getting. We\u2019re obviously confident in that, given what we\u2019ve seen with many other liver-directed therapeutics without GalNAc conjugate system. And in addition to that, we would welcome seeing changes in transaminases. They\u2019re often abnormal in patients with NASH, and some improvements there would be encouraging, of course, as would changes in the biopsy because we won\u2019t get definitive biopsies. It\u2019s a small study and a definitive readout that some changes in the histological parameters of NASH relating to inflammation and/or fibrosis would be exciting to see. But again, a small study, short-term treatment. So it would be, frankly, very surprising if we see that, but we would love to see that if we could. So that\u2019s for HSD. For APP, CNS-directed therapeutic for Alzheimer\u2019s and for cerebral amyloid angiopathy. First and foremost, safety. This is our first foray into the central nervous system with our novel conjugate system for neuronal tissues. And then beyond safety, we\u2019ll be looking for and \u2013 knockdown tissue target engagement. And so APP, amyloid rise protein generates a host of fragments that are detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, and we\u2019ll be looking for changes in those degradation fragments from the proteolytic breakdown of APP, one of which most importantly is a itself. So that\u2019s what we look forward to from those two studies, but agreed exciting times and great to see the RNAi going beyond the liver.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Akshay. And probably of course, we announced today that our Phase I study has kicked off with an ALN-APP. So we\u2019re looking forward to the data that actually described at the end of this year. So terrific progress. We\u2019re very, very pleased.\nSalveen Richter: Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Maury Raycroft with Jefferies.\nMaury Raycroft: Hi, good morning. Congrats on the progress and thanks for taking my question. I have a question on APOLLO-B. For the study, you\u2019ve got 14 sites in the U.S. and then 52 sites ex-U.S. listed. Just wondering if you can say what proportion of patients in APOLLO-B are going to be from the United States versus ex-U.S.? And then as a follow-up, can you talk about sites overlapping between your APOLLO-B sites and the BridgeBio sites?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Maury. I think I\u2019m going to pass that question right across to Akshay.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. So Maury, I mean, I think as we\u2019ve shown before, the performance of our drugs at least in our definitive experiences in hATTR-PN both in the shape of the original APOLLO study with vutrisiran, and now with vutrisiran, in the context of hATTR-PN show very similar effects regardless of geography, frankly. And that\u2019s been published, you can go and look it up, et cetera. So that\u2019s important to bear in mind because of the centrality of TTR to these diseases, whether it\u2019s PN or other disorders like cardiomyopathy as we believe. So we\u2019re looking forward to similar data consistency of effect regardless of geography in APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B eventually regardless of the site split. And with regard to overlap of size, we don\u2019t get into those details. But because largely, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that relevant, frankly, again, because of the strength of our hypothesis, we believe that TTR targeting approach is the most potent way to address this disease and the consistency of our prior data speak to that. And again, the encouraging exploratory cardiac data from HELIOS-A to further attach to exciting information we\u2019re looking forward from APOLLO-B later in the year, including I\u2019d remind everybody the potential of cardiac mobilization that we saw with the technician date in HELIOS-A. But I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks, Maury.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Follow-up question.\nMaury Raycroft: Well, maybe a quick follow-up. I guess, if there are overlapping sites between the two studies, are you getting firsthand insight into the training effect in bias issues that you\u2019ve discussed in an walk test? And have you been able to mitigate some of those issues?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. The bias issues and the training issues, we have reflected commentary from BridgeBio. We don\u2019t see any such issue in our studies, either historically or otherwise. And with respect to our studies, we take great care in understanding the natural history of these diseases, in carefully designing the study, in conservatively powering and designing the statistical approach to the study and then selecting the right contract research organizations to work with who have experience with the kind of endpoints and managing the kind of sites we want to work with. And then during the study diligently following up and making sure sites are performing per expectations. That\u2019s a sophisticated approach. That\u2019s one we\u2019ve honed over a decade. We\u2019ve done multiple Phase III studies, all of which have been positive up until now across a range of drugs, including multiple drugs in the TTR space. For BridgeBio, this was their first Phase 3 study, and they would have to answer how many of those kinds of things were put in place. And they have made the commentary about contacts, bias, training effects, et cetera. And so I\u2019ll leave it there Maury. Thanks.\nMaury Raycroft: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Akshay. Look, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this call. 2021 was a remarkable year for Alnylam. I mean we made significant progress, both commercially and scientifically and we\u2019re very excited about 2022, which is shaping up to build further on that as we continue to fire on all cylinders. Thank you, everybody, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tolga Tanguler",
            "content": "Thanks, Yvonne, and good morning, everyone. We\u2019re very pleased with our fourth quarter performance. The ongoing pandemic had considerable impact on our ability to engage customers via face-to-face interactions. However, our ability to leverage data and analytics for our promotional efforts and improvements in our virtual interaction capabilities have enabled us to finish 2021 with significant year-over-year growth. For ONPATTRO, we achieved $139 million in global net product revenues in the fourth quarter, representing 15% quarter-on-quarter growth compared with the third quarter and 53% growth compared with Q4 2020. And we achieved $475 million in global ONPATTRO revenues for the full year. As of December 31, over 2,050 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO treatment worldwide, with patient compliance remaining consistent above 90%. In the U.S., sales of ONPATTRO increased 17% versus Q3 and were primarily impacted by the following: patient demand, which increased 4% driven by the addition of new patients on therapy with patient compliance remaining consistent above 90% as noted. Inventory stocking in the distribution channel during the fourth quarter. Compared with destocking in Q3, favorably impacted U.S. reported growth by 15% during the quarter. This was expected given the low level of inventory in the channel at the end of the third quarter. We ended the year with approximately two weeks of inventory in the distribution channel, which is at the midpoint of our expectations. In our international markets, ONPATTRO fourth quarter performance remained strong, with growth of 14% versus Q3, primarily driven by increased patient demand broadly across Europe, Canada and Japan, as well as favorability in gross net deductions, positively impacting net pricing for the quarter. We also continue to observe a good balance of first-line use and switches from stabilizers. Moving to GIVLAARI. We achieved $41 million in global net product revenues in the fourth quarter, representing 28% quarter-on-quarter growth compared with Q3 and 84% growth versus Q4 2020. And we achieved $128 million in global GIVLAARI revenues for the full year. As of December 31, over 350 patients were on commercial GIVLAARI treatment worldwide. We are pleased with the steady ongoing launch of GIVLAARI. In the U.S., sales of GIVLAARI increased 35% and versus Q3 2021 and were primarily impacted by the following: patient demand, which increased 8%, driven by an increase in patients on therapy with patient treatment compliance at over 90%; and increase in inventory stocking in the quarter, which favorably impacted growth by approximately 20%. In addition to a decrease in gross to net sales deductions, which contributed an additional 6% growth. We also continue to make strong progress with value-based agreements with over 12 finalized to date with commercial payers. In our international markets, GIVLAARI delivered 10% growth in the fourth quarter compared with Q3, with the growth primarily driven by new patient adds in key Western European markets, notably Spain and Italy. In the UK, we received a positive opinion from NICE and look forward to our launch in the UK in early this year. Moving now to OXLUMO. We achieved $19 million in global net product revenues in the fourth quarter, representing a 29% increase compared with Q3 and ended our first full year since launch with $60 million in global revenues. As of December 31, over 140 patients were on commercial OXLUMO treatment worldwide. In the U.S., sales of OXLUMO increased 9% versus Q3 2021 and were primarily impacted by the following: patient demand increased 15% driven by an increase in patients on therapy and patient treatment compliance at over 90%. Reported growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately 6% from a decrease in inventory stocking in the distribution channel during the quarter. Additionally, we have finalized 11 DDAs to date with commercial payers. OXLUMO growth in our international markets was 40% during the fourth quarter compared with Q3. Q4 growth benefited from an increase in patients on therapy in our established markets, progress in geographic expansion and favorability in gross to net deductions positively impacting net pricing for the quarter. We also continue to be pleased by the broad utilization of OXLUMO across age groups and eGFR categories. In conclusion, despite the ongoing pandemic, particularly the effects of Omicron since late November of last year, I\u2019m proud of the performance our team delivered, a strong fourth quarter and a strong year across all our three commercial brands with 83% revenue growth versus the prior year. Furthermore, we\u2019re excited about the potential upcoming launch of vutrisiran, which has a PDUFA date of April 14. If approved, we believe vutrisiran will offer an important option for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adults with its quarterly subcu injection dosing regimen and will further strengthen our franchise leadership in this important growth category. With that, I will now turn it over to Akshay to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Akshay? Sure, sure. Good morning, everyone. Listen, I mean, I think you really made the point around the fact that we \u2013 the guidance we have provided assumes an accelerated growth for our TTR franchise. That\u2019s our anchor franchise. Also, at the same time, our other ultrarare disease products will certainly be contributing to that and punching above their weight. When it comes to vutrisiran, Yvonne is spot on. I mean this is not going to be a zero-sum game. We do anticipate a number of patients that may not have been benefiting from ONPATTRO will certainly find the profile that we have very appealing, subcutaneous three months and then subsequently six months. We believe that\u2019s going to accelerate overall growth profile. And also, as you also pointed out, we are barely scratching the surface in terms of the number of patients that are being diagnosed and treated. We have 30,000 patients across the world, and a very small number of those are being treated despite the fact that there are three products available out there. So with the product profile, if approved, for vutrisiran polyneuropathy indication, we certainly see an accelerated growth in the U.S. after the PDUFA date April 14. And then subsequently also, we do anticipate two launches in Japan and Germany later in the fourth quarter, which probably will not contribute as much, but it\u2019s going to help the momentum. Sure. I mean, look, this is clearly a highly genericized class, but this is why I think Alnylam\u2019s underlying technology is so exciting that allows us to really rethink the entire \u2013 how to actually manage medicine. In this, despite the fact that there are easily accessible genericized products in this category, we still have 40 million Americans that are suffering hypertensive-related diseases. And the U.S. is spending about $100 billion according to ACC for that. So, I believe from a category perspective, this approach is going to be a tremendous benefit to the broader society. And we are, obviously, when it comes to different therapy areas, we are obviously ahead of that curve right now in terms of providing an entirely new class of medicine. Right. Hi, Alethia. Thank you for that question. And thanks, Yvonne. Look, we\u2019re able to grow that franchise at 55% after third year of its launch. So clearly, the progress we made on, in terms of growth has been good. Next year, we will continue to obviously grow ONPATTRO until vutrisiran is in the market. Based on the profile that Yvonne indicated, we would anticipate the source of business we have is essentially mainly coming from academic centers, as is now the business is evolving more into the community centers. And I think the profile that vutrisiran has to offer will be very attractive to those physicians that are looking some different profile. And also, particularly in Europe, where the stabilizers are also indicated for polyneuropathy, a good portion of our growth has been coming from stabilizers, which are, as you know, daily oral tablets. Now instead of having an infusion without any premed and three month subcutaneous injection, clearly, is a very attractive profile for those patients that may still be on the stabilizer. So overall, we certainly see a modest accelerated growth that we\u2019ve been able to post versus last year. And we will see that in an accelerated fashion. That\u2019s the best way I would be able to describe it to you."

            "content": "Thanks, Akshay, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be presenting Alnylam\u2019s Q4 and full year 2021 financial results, which underscore Alnylam\u2019s strong commercial capabilities and operational excellence and reflect another impressive quarter of progress on our journey towards building a self-sustainable financial profile aligned with our P5x25 goals. After commenting on our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, I will also provide our financial guidance for 2022. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter and full year. Total product revenues for 2021 were $662 million or 83% growth versus 2020, with all three marketed products contributing material year-over-year growth. Net revenue from collaborations for the fourth quarter was approximately $60 million, which included recognition of a $25 million milestone due from Novartis following the December FDA approval of Leqvio. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 34% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with our mid and late-stage pipeline, including investment in our two Phase II studies for zilebesiran in hypertension, KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2, an ongoing investment in our two ATTR Phase 3 studies in cardiomyopathy, APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 17% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to increased investment in commercial and medical affairs activities to continue supporting ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI and the first full year of OXLUMO commercialization as well as legal expenses associated with the ongoing Department of Justice investigation. Our non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were approximately $1.2 billion in 2021, representing 16% growth versus 2020 as we continue to advance our pipeline and deliver strong top line growth while maintaining discipline in how we invest in our operations. Our non-GAAP operating loss for 2021 was $528 million, representing a $121 million improvement compared with 2020 as we continue to progress on our journey toward building a self-sustainable financial profile aligned with our P5x25 goals. Finally, we ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.4 billion compared to $1.9 billion at the end of 2020. The increase was primarily due to receipt of the second $500 million payment from Blackstone associated with monetizing 50% of the future sales of Leqvio, $500 million from drawdown on our credit facility and more than $200 million from the exercise of employee equity awards, offset by cash used in our operations to support overall growth. We continue to believe that our current cash balance will bridge us to a financial self-sustainability profile and enviable position in today\u2019s market environment. Now turning to our financial guidance for 2022, which does reflect the potential impact of the ongoing pandemic, particularly during the first half of the year. Starting with net product revenues, we are providing combined net product revenue guidance for ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI, OXLUMO, and vutrisiran, assuming approval by the PDUFA date in April. We anticipate combined net product revenues for these four products will be between $900 million and $1 billion, with the midpoint of the range representing 44% growth compared to 2021. We also anticipate that our Q1 2022 combined product revenues will be down modestly compared with Q4 2021. While we do expect an increase in patient demand during Q1, driven by an increase in patients on therapy across our products. We expect this will be more than offset by headwinds associated with the stocking gross to net benefits that occurred in Q4, not recurring in Q1. Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties is a range between $175 million and $225 million, with the midpoint of the range representing 10% growth from 2021. Growth in 2022 is expected to become primarily from our collaboration with Regeneron and royalties and milestones from Novartis based on Leqvio sales. Our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses is a range between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion. The midpoint of the guidance range represents a projected 18% increase compared with 2021. We anticipate SG&A growth will be lower than our growth in R&D in 2022 as we seek to generate operating leverage from our existing commercial infrastructure to support our three current commercial products and a potential launch of vutrisiran. We expect a higher rate of growth for R&D driven by increased investment in KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2, our two ongoing Phase 2 zilebesiran studies in hypertension plus increased investment in our preclinical portfolio as we continue to drive additional innovative organic growth opportunities. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones in 2022. To start, we plan to continue commercializing our three existing marketed products, ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. We plan to continue advancing our ATTR franchise. With vutrisiran, we look forward to the potential approval and U.S. launch of the fifth RNAi therapeutic with a PDUFA date of April 14. Approval in the EU is anticipated midyear with subsequent launches in key markets to follow pending finalization of pricing and reimbursement. With patisiran, we look forward to top line results from the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study in mid-2022. Next, we have an exciting readout coming up with cemdisiran where we plan to report Phase 2 monotherapy results in IgA nephropathy in early 2022. For zilebesiran, the KARDIA-1 trial is expected to complete enrollment in mid-2022. For ALN-HBV02, partnered with VIR and also known as VIR-2218, we look forward to Phase 2 combination results in the early part of the year. And for ALN-XDH we\u2019re excited to get that Phase 1 study started shortly with top line results for both this program and ALN-APP expected in late 2022. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? Thanks, Yvonne. Good question Anupam. We\u2019re not breaking out specific geographic detail. But I think Yvonne outlined the sort of the key elements of what\u2019s going to drive our ex-U.S. growth. And it really depends on time on the market. The longer the products have been on the market ex-U.S., the more it\u2019s about naive patient finding. And in the case of our ATTR franchise, there\u2019s still a big switch element. Products that have been on the market a shorter amount of time still will benefit from additional geographic expansion. So in this case, OXLUMO will be the one that will benefit the most from that going forward. So that answers the question."

            "name": "Akshay Vaishnaw",
            "content": "Thanks, Tolga, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we\u2019re advancing two late-stage clinical product candidates, patisiran and vutrisiran. Also ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat the polyneuropathy associated with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. We\u2019re committed to expanding the product\u2019s label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end, we are conducting the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study with, which we expect to report top line results in the middle of this year. We\u2019re also advancing vutrisiran, which is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection and is also in development for ATTR amyloidosis as well as the newly announced exciting opportunity in Stargardt disease. In ATTR, we\u2019re conducting two Phase 3 studies. The first is HELIOS-A evaluating vutrisiran in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. In 2021, we presented positive nine-month results from the study. We showed the study met its primary and secondary endpoints of nine months with an acceptable safety profile. These data form the basis for our regulatory submissions to both the FDA and EMA, and we look forward to a potential U.S. approval with the upcoming PDUFA date of April 14, 2022. Additionally, just a few weeks ago, we presented the positive full results for the 18-month endpoints from the study. As a reminder, HELIOS-A is a randomized open-label study in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis polyneuropathy. The study enrolled 164 patients who were randomized 3:1 to receive vutrisiran at a dose of 25 milligrams administered subcutaneously once every three months or patisiran administered intravenously in once every three weeks at a dose of 0.3 mg per kg as a reference comparator. To start, serum TTR reduction in the vutrisiran group was rapid and sustained over a period of 18 months. Specifically, vutrisiran achieved a mean steady-state serum TTR reduction from baseline of 88%. We\u2019re also very pleased to see low interpatient variability in TTR reduction over the time period. As expected, the TTR reduction achieved with vutrisiran was statistically non-inferior to that observed in the patisiran reference arm. This is important as we would expect, but a comparable level of TTR reduction by vutrisiran and patisiran should result in a comparable level of clinical impact. We\u2019re delighted to HELIOS-A met all secondary endpoints measured at 18 months, including the statistically significant improvements in neuropathy as measured by the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score, or mNIS+7, quality life, gait speed, nutritional status and overall disability relative to external placebo data from the APOLLO Phase 3 study of patisiran. Furthermore, at 18 months, vutrisiran also demonstrated improvement compared to extend placebo in the exploratory cardiac endpoint NT-proBNP and trend towards improvement in echocardiographic parameters as well as improvement compared to baseline in cardiac update of technetium on scintigraphy imaging, collectively providing evidence to suggest that vutrisiran treatment may potentially result in improvement of cardiac manifestations of disease. Looked at in aggregate and as expected, the treatment effect of vutrisiran at 18 months across an array of end points is quite similar to that observed with patisiran. These observations, including especially the exploratory cardiac data underscore our confidence in the potential of both the patisiran and vutrisiran in ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. This, of course, is being evaluated in the ongoing Phase 3 studies, APOLLO-B with patisiran and HELIOS-B with vutrisiran. Let\u2019s now review the safety results at 18 months. Vutrisiran demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile by 18 month three patients on the vutrisiran arm or 2.5% discontinued the study due to adverse events. The single new discontinuation since month nine was in the event of cardiac failure considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator. By month 18, there were two deaths, neither of which was considered relative \u2013 related to study drug. There were two serious adverse events deemed related to vutrisiran by the study investigators consisting of dyslipidemia and urinary tract infection. These deaths and related SAEs all occurred by month nine that have been previously reported. Treatment emergent adverse events occurring in 10% or more of patients included four pain in extremity, diarrhea, peripheral edema, urinary tract infection, arthralgia and dizziness, with the exception of pain and extremity in arthralgia, each of these events occurred at a similar or lower rate as compared with external placebo. Injection site reactions were reported in five patients or 4.1% and were all mild and transient with no hepatic safety concerns. We\u2019re very pleased with the totality of the results and the profile of vutrisiran that continues to evolve. We believe that based on these data, vutrisiran, if approved, will present an exciting commercial opportunity, providing an attractive treatment option for patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy around the world. Of course, this is just the start for vutrisiran, and we\u2019re also conducting another Phase 3 study, HELIOS-B, which is our ongoing Phase 3 cardiac outcome study with vutrisiran in hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. We were excited to complete enrollment in the third quarter of 2021 with over 600 patients, well ahead of schedule due to strong enrollment. HELIOS-B has a 30-month endpoint of all-cause mortality and CV events and we expect the full results in early 2024. The study design includes the potential for an interim analysis, and we will consider this following results from the APOLLO-B study and engagement with regulatory authorities. As I alluded to earlier, we also recently announced a promising new near-term opportunity for vutrisiran in Stargardt disease, providing the potential to expand the use of vutrisiran to treat an inherited and progressive ocular disease. This stems from our realization that the vutrisiran mechanism of action via reducing vitamin A, can in turn potentially reduce the buildup of toxic metabolites in the eye that lead to vision loss in Stargardt disease. We believe this represents an important expansion opportunity for vutrisiran in an area of high unmet medical need where those therapies exist today. We intend to start a Phase 3 study in late 2022. In addition to our late-stage clinical programs, we believe we\u2019ve also been making great progress with our early and mid-stage programs. As we\u2019ve highlighted for a bit now, a key growth driver for Alnylam is our expansion beyond rare diseases into prevalent disease. Our program for hypertension is a great example. Zilebesiran, formerly known as ALN-AGT, is our investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the genetically validated target angiotensinogen in development for the treatment of hypertension. Zilebesiran is being evaluated in the Phase 2 KARDIA program. The first of the 2 studies, KARDIA-1 is currently enrolling and is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran as a monotherapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The second of these studies KARDIA-2, was initiated in the fourth quarter and is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran as an add-on therapy in patients with hypertension despite treatment with standard of care. We also continue to gather data from the ongoing Phase 1 study and recently presented updated data at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions. Here, single doses of investigational zilebesiran resulted in sustained AGT and blood pressure reductions through six months, supporting quarterly and potentially biannual dosing. We also observed that blood pressure response to low salt intake under the peak pharmacodynamic effect of zilebesiran was consistent with augmented pharmacology with no hypotensive cardiac adverse events reported. Additionally, coadministration with Irbesartan result in additional blood pressure lowering without signals of renal toxicity. Zilebesiran was generally well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events or study withdrawals supporting continued development. Another key growth driver for Alnylam in the years to come will be our organic product engine driving sustainable innovation. Here, we made strong progress in the fourth quarter. We moved two programs towards the clinic with recent CTA filings for ALN-XDH in gout, and very excitingly, our first CNS program, ALN-APP, for the potential treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. We\u2019re thrilled to announce date that the Phase 1 study for ALN-APP has now been initiated, and we look forward to starting the Phase 1 trial for ALN-XDH early this year. There are just a few highlights amongst the many exciting programs being advanced by our organic research engine, and we look forward to updating you all on this progress throughout the year. With that, let me now turn the call over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff? Yes. No. Thanks, Yvonne. We were obviously very excited about the exploratory cardiac data, whether it\u2019s the BNP, the echocardiographic and those essentially, as you said, were very similar to what we\u2019ve seen in APOLLO, but most importantly, some new information on technician scan showing \u2013 than the potential amyloid mobilization with reduction in uptake in technetium. So that\u2019s really exciting new information. And again, adds to our confidence in our subsequent work in APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B. So we continue to feel very good about the potential for both ONPATTRO, patisiran and vutrisiran in the cardiac context in those studies. As far as the label is concerned, whilst those exploratory data, we believe are exciting and speak a lot about the potential for the drug. HELIOS-A was designed and executed exactly as closely as possible to APOLLO, and we expect a very similar label frankly, Ritu. The data that I\u2019m talking about, we\u2019ve largely shared, but there\u2019ll be additional data coming out at meetings through the year, further going into the HELIOS set. But to your specific question, I don\u2019t know that those data will shed light on the natural history of the cardiomyopathy and the other features you\u2019re alluding to, as we look forward to the APOLLO-B data, which will be handled to food in the middle of the year, actually. So, I think that\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave it. Yes. Great. So as Yvonne said, I think we should once again recall really the very dramatic and impressive results from the Phase 1 study with over 20-millimeter mercury drop in blood systolic blood pressure at the top dose and maintained out through six months. Now the KARDIA-1 study will hope to replicate the blood pressure results we saw in the Phase 1 study. Historically, anything above a 5-millimeter mercury drop in blood pressure seems to be notable and people would advance those kinds of drugs into further development. We would hope to do better than that based on what I just told you. Now whether we\u2019ll see exactly what we saw in the Phase 1 study, I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m confident we can do better than that in KARDIA-1 than the 5-millimeter threshold I just said. I think the other thing to remember about what\u2019s clinically meaningful with the angiotensinogen approach and why maybe sort of not entirely right to just compare it to a blood pressure reduction number is the way blood pressure is being reduced with zilebesiran. So yes, absolute reduction in blood pressure is important but preventing fluctuations in blood pressure and having a smooth and tonic control of blood pressure is important to patients, and we hope zilebesiran can do that, yet inside think of that from KARDIA-1. And restoring the physiological nighttime dipping, but that blood pressure patients often lose, that will be important. So there\u2019s so much more to zilebesiran than just a star blood pressure reduction number is the way it\u2019s done and the features I talked about as well as the adherence advantages with having a potentially once every three or six-month administration of the drug. So, I\u2019ll stop there. Lots to look forward to, I think, in KARDIA-1. But Tolga, do you want to say something about the landscape? Yes. Thanks, Yvonne. So Paul, I mean, I think, yes, you know the same data as us, but it\u2019s hardly, I think we\u2019d all agree a full explication of the data, right? We would love a full presentation. There\u2019s lots more to understand. So, we have partial glimpses, I think, a variety of different explanations over time have been offered by BridgeBio colleagues. That\u2019s obviously for them to speak further to their study, but context, bias, trading effects on network distance, all of these have been mentioned by BridgeBio leaders. So more for them to comment there. The one thing that struck us about their data, at least what\u2019s public is that the 6-minute walk distance didn\u2019t seem to perform and yet other parameters, BNP and KCCQ showed exactly or very similar to what happened in the ATTRACT study at 12 months. So it\u2019s hard to reconcile that. And I think there are explanations or putative explanations around trading effects, contacts, bias, et cetera. You should be borne in mind because of the three parameters BNP, KCCQ and 6-minute walk distance, the last one would be influenced by those kinds of features. And so again, that\u2019s what we say see and say from the outside more for them to comment than I think us. For our part, we\u2019ve worked in this area for over a decade. We have designed studies in the TTR basis, significant Phase 3 studies. We\u2019ve replicated data across studies. I think the HELIOS-A example, where we were just discussing earlier in the call, where the design of the study execution and the data delivery looks so similar to what happened in APOLLO, and APOLLO was designed in 2013 or executed in 2013. So it shows that we \u2013 I think we take great care, and we know how to test hypotheses in the space very diligently and rigorously. And so we continue to feel very confident in our APOLLO-B work and how we\u2019ve designed it and powered it conservatively to hit the primary endpoint of 6-minute walk distance. And we\u2019ll have the data all too soon, middle of the year. Yes. Thanks, Salveen. So with respect to ALN-HSD, which, in fact, is a liver target therapeutic and HSDs was exclusively present in hepatocytes. So for NASH, some of the key readouts beyond safety, of course, which is very important, will be evidence of knockdown, and we\u2019re taking biopsies in this study. So you can\u2019t detect HSD in the circulation. And hopefully, the biopsies will support kind of knockdown we\u2019re getting. We\u2019re obviously confident in that, given what we\u2019ve seen with many other liver-directed therapeutics without GalNAc conjugate system. And in addition to that, we would welcome seeing changes in transaminases. They\u2019re often abnormal in patients with NASH, and some improvements there would be encouraging, of course, as would changes in the biopsy because we won\u2019t get definitive biopsies. It\u2019s a small study and a definitive readout that some changes in the histological parameters of NASH relating to inflammation and/or fibrosis would be exciting to see. But again, a small study, short-term treatment. So it would be, frankly, very surprising if we see that, but we would love to see that if we could. So that\u2019s for HSD. For APP, CNS-directed therapeutic for Alzheimer\u2019s and for cerebral amyloid angiopathy. First and foremost, safety. This is our first foray into the central nervous system with our novel conjugate system for neuronal tissues. And then beyond safety, we\u2019ll be looking for and \u2013 knockdown tissue target engagement. And so APP, amyloid rise protein generates a host of fragments that are detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, and we\u2019ll be looking for changes in those degradation fragments from the proteolytic breakdown of APP, one of which most importantly is a itself. So that\u2019s what we look forward to from those two studies, but agreed exciting times and great to see the RNAi going beyond the liver. Yes. So Maury, I mean, I think as we\u2019ve shown before, the performance of our drugs at least in our definitive experiences in hATTR-PN both in the shape of the original APOLLO study with vutrisiran, and now with vutrisiran, in the context of hATTR-PN show very similar effects regardless of geography, frankly. And that\u2019s been published, you can go and look it up, et cetera. So that\u2019s important to bear in mind because of the centrality of TTR to these diseases, whether it\u2019s PN or other disorders like cardiomyopathy as we believe. So we\u2019re looking forward to similar data consistency of effect regardless of geography in APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B eventually regardless of the site split. And with regard to overlap of size, we don\u2019t get into those details. But because largely, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that relevant, frankly, again, because of the strength of our hypothesis, we believe that TTR targeting approach is the most potent way to address this disease and the consistency of our prior data speak to that. And again, the encouraging exploratory cardiac data from HELIOS-A to further attach to exciting information we\u2019re looking forward from APOLLO-B later in the year, including I\u2019d remind everybody the potential of cardiac mobilization that we saw with the technician date in HELIOS-A. But I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks, Maury. Yes. The bias issues and the training issues, we have reflected commentary from BridgeBio. We don\u2019t see any such issue in our studies, either historically or otherwise. And with respect to our studies, we take great care in understanding the natural history of these diseases, in carefully designing the study, in conservatively powering and designing the statistical approach to the study and then selecting the right contract research organizations to work with who have experience with the kind of endpoints and managing the kind of sites we want to work with. And then during the study diligently following up and making sure sites are performing per expectations. That\u2019s a sophisticated approach. That\u2019s one we\u2019ve honed over a decade. We\u2019ve done multiple Phase III studies, all of which have been positive up until now across a range of drugs, including multiple drugs in the TTR space. For BridgeBio, this was their first Phase 3 study, and they would have to answer how many of those kinds of things were put in place. And they have made the commentary about contacts, bias, training effects, et cetera. And so I\u2019ll leave it there Maury. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, Christine, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. 2021 was another year of tremendous success at Alnylam, in which we delivered impressive commercial performance and made significant advancements across our broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutics. To start, our commercial products, ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO saw continued growth, primarily due to strong patient demand. In total, we achieved $662 million in net product revenue, representing year-over-year growth of 83%, delivering at the upper end of our guidance range. We\u2019re also excited to have ended the year with a U.S. approval of the fourth RNAi therapeutic discovered by Alnylam, Leqvio, which is partnered with Novartis. We also advanced our pipeline programs at all stages of development. This includes our TTR franchise, where we recently presented full 18-month results from the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study of vutrisiran, Akshay will review these shortly. We also completed enrollment in our two pivotal Phase 3 studies in ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B. Furthermore, we advanced vutrisiran into Phase 2 with the initiation of KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2, representing what we believe to be an opportunity to re-imagine the treatment of hypertension. Additionally, we advanced two more prevalent disease programs towards the clinic, including our first CNS program. Looking towards 2022 and beyond, we view a few strategic goals as key potential growth drivers for Alnylam. First is the potential expansion of our TTR franchise. In the near-term, with the potential approval of vutrisiran and the Phase 3 readout of APOLLO-B with vutrisiran, and over time, as we aim to become the global leader in delivering impactful and highly differentiated medicines to patients. The second key growth driver is our expansion beyond rare diseases into prevalent diseases. And the third growth driver for the company comes from our sustainable innovation engine comprised of new platform enhancements, opportunities with extrahepatic delivery and our ability to find new genetically validated targets, which offers the potential to drive further pipeline expansion to 2025 and beyond. Based on these opportunities, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver on our Alnylam P5x25 goals, making Alnylam a top biotech company developing and commercializing transformative medicines for rare and common diseases for patients around the world, driven by a high-yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering excellent financial results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga? Thanks for your question, Ritu. I\u2019ll just start off by saying that we\u2019re really excited about the potential launch of vutrisiran later this year, because we really believe that vutrisiran has a compelling proposition really with its quarterly subcutaneous regimen allowing patients essentially freedom from their disease. And just one important point that I\u2019d like to make, we do see the launch of vutrisiran is adding to our overall TTR franchise. We don\u2019t see it as a net zero-sum game. And we also recognize that we\u2019re still early with respect to accessing hATTR patients for polyneuropathy given that ONPATTRO has been able to secure about 2,050 patients, and there are about 30,000 patients worldwide that are still awaiting treatment. You probably are aware, I know this we too, that what we feel so pleased about is that we\u2019ve been able to essentially replicate with HELIOS-A, both the nine months and the 18-month data, what we found in APOLLO. And I think this is an incredible achievement actually when you think about these studies being run at different times. So the patient population was very similar, and the results, as I said, we are very consistent between HELIOS-A and APOLLO. But perhaps, Akshay, I\u2019ll ask you to comment on your views about the cardiac data and what we could expect there and what might be on the label. And Ritu, just as a reminder, with respect to HELIOS-A, of course, the patient population is hATTR with cardiomyopathy. Yes, that\u2019s a great question, Gena. This is a very important part of our go-forward growth opportunity, TTR franchise, we believe that we will be the leaders in this area in terms of meeting the needs of all patients with TTR over time. Tolga, perhaps you could speak specifically to how we\u2019re thinking about vutrisiran and ONPATTRO. I know that one the things that we\u2019re really pleased about actually is the stickiness that we\u2019re seeing with ONPATTRO with a greater than 90% adherence, which actually is remarkable for a therapy that\u2019s administered intravenously every three weeks. As I said before, I think the profile of vutrisiran is particularly compelling. As I think \u2013 as I said, the important point here is that we see the launch of vutrisiran in polyneuropathy is growing the overall TTR franchise. And clearly, that will continue to grow over time, assuming, of course, positive data for both ONPATTRO and vutrisiran from APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B, respectively. But perhaps, Tolga, you could provide some additional perspectives on how you see ONPATTRO and vutrisiran over the course of this year? Yes. No, thank you for that question, Tazeen. As I\u2019m sure you all know, we are really very excited about the potential that zilebesiran has in addressing patients with hypertension. Just to remind you, we\u2019ve already demonstrated what we need to demonstrate from an efficacy perspective for an approval in our Phase 1 study, after just a single dose, we\u2019re able to affect blood pressure lowering of between 10 millimeters and 20 millimeters of mercury, which is actually tremendous. Clearly, we need to deliver only two Phase 2 studies and then move forward into Phase 3. But I think from my perspective, what\u2019s really kind of exciting about zilebesiran is, firstly, the size of the opportunity in a very prevalent population, 1.2 billion people across the world have hypertension, but also the very straightforward path to regulatory approval here. And clearly, KARDIA-1 is a key step along that journey. So, I\u2019ll ask Akshay now to maybe speak a bit more specifically about what we\u2019re looking for with respect to outcomes from KARDIA-1. And then I will turn it over to Tolga to provide some views on the competitive landscape. That\u2019s great. Thanks, Akshay and Tolga. Tazeen, does that answer your question? Thank you. Thank you, Paul. That\u2019s a great question. So look, we\u2019re very confident, and we\u2019ve reiterated this point about our track record in executing studies in the TTR space. And we believe that we put all the mechanisms and we have the expertise in place to design studies, train the sites, work with vendors, et cetera, to make sure we have delivered the highest quality data. Now you probably know as much about the BridgeBio data as we do. So, we\u2019re not going to really speak to BridgeBio specifically. But I\u2019ll hand it over to Akshay to reprice our perspectives on APOLLO-B. Thank you, Alethia. That\u2019s a great question. I mean, look, we\u2019ve been really pleased with the performance of ONPATTRO. We\u2019ve demonstrated steady and continuous growth since the launch in 2018. So, we\u2019re delighted with the contribution that, that has made to patients, but also to building Alnylam. Look, vutrisiran just has such a compelling profile given its quarterly subcu regimen, hopefully soon to become a six-monthly regimen. And we do believe that we have a real opportunity to grow the polyneuropathy market with vutrisiran and then subsequently assuming positive results from HELIOS-B, cardiomyopathy as well. But Tolga, perhaps I\u2019ll hand this question over to you. I mean how do you see vutrisiran and ONPATTRO performing in the market over the next year or so? Yes, I\u2019ll talk that\u2019s great. So very excited about the TTR franchise overall. vutrisiran affords the opportunity to \u2013 for physicians and patients to start treatment earlier in patients with polyneuropathy and obviously, in the U.S., patients who have the mixed phenotype as well. And then as Tolga said, potential for earlier switch, just given the much reduced treatment burden of vutrisiran. So hopefully, that\u2019s answered your question, Alethia? Thanks, Anupam, that\u2019s a great question. Look, if you think about the different products, ONPATTRO been on the market now for three years, less opportunity for geographical expansion because we\u2019ve actually managed to work our way through the various pricing reimbursement systems ex-U.S. very well, and we have incredibly good coverage in the U.S. as well. GIVLAARI, clearly earlier in its launch, and we see their continued geographic expansion. Just recently, the NICE approval in the U.K. speaks to that point. And OXLUMO, we\u2019re really 2021 was our first full year since launch. I think what we\u2019re particularly pleased about there is really broad utilization across all age groups, disease severity. And I think we\u2019re benefiting in Europe with respect to OXLUMO with the centers of excellence that you see there, which meant the patients already being diagnosed as well as being able to transition patients from our expanded access program, and those were dynamics that we clearly didn\u2019t have in the U.S. And as we look forward, I think we see continued geographical expansion for the more recently launched products, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO as well as continued penetration. And for ONPATTRO, we see across the world, increased patient demand to new prescribers. And so we expect to see continued penetration in the U.S. and outside the U.S. But what I\u2019ll do, maybe I\u2019ll hand it over to Jeff to provide a little bit more color on how we\u2019re thinking about the year ahead. Jeff? Yes. Thanks for the additional color. Yes. Thank you for that question, Salveen. Look, I\u2019m particularly excited about the opportunity to extend the power of the R&I platform outside the liver. I think this opens up a whole new horizon for Alnylam we think about our growth over the next several years. And as you said, ALN-APP we\u2019re very excited to be moving that forward in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. HSD is obviously a liver director target. I think what we\u2019re excited about with respect with HSD is the size of the NASH patient population. And therefore, this is a much more prevalent disease opportunity. So I\u2019m going to hand it over to actually to, first of all, just very briefly describe what we\u2019re expecting to see out of our ALN-APP proof-of-concept study, we\u2019ll be getting clinical data at the end of this year and then also the ongoing Phase 1 study with HSD and NASH. So Akshay, over to you to maybe address those two programs. Thanks, Akshay. And probably of course, we announced today that our Phase I study has kicked off with an ALN-APP. So we\u2019re looking forward to the data that actually described at the end of this year. So terrific progress. We\u2019re very, very pleased. Thanks, Maury. I think I\u2019m going to pass that question right across to Akshay. Follow-up question. Thanks, Akshay. Look, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this call. 2021 was a remarkable year for Alnylam. I mean we made significant progress, both commercially and scientifically and we\u2019re very excited about 2022, which is shaping up to build further on that as we continue to fire on all cylinders. Thank you, everybody, and have a great day."

In the third quarter and recent period, we made continued progress bringing our commercial RNAi therapeutics to patients around the world. We advanced our clinical pipeline of over a dozen potential transformative medicine programs and we delivered on the promise of sustainable innovation, with RNAi, with our industry-leading platform and our preclinical efforts. Of course, a highlight for the period was the positive top line 18-month results from the HELIOS-A Phase III study of Vutrisiran that we announced just yesterday. And Akshay will review those results very shortly. As we announced this morning, after much thoughtful consideration and planning, I've decided that this is the right time to begin a smooth transition of leadership at Alnylam. I've decided that this is the time for me to begin a new chapter in my career of yet again pushing the bounds of biomedical innovation by helping entrepreneurs and companies advance new modalities to improve the lives of patients. I couldn't be more pleased that Yvonne Greenstreet has agreed to help lead Alnylam in a planned transition that will occur at the end of this year. Of course, I am so honored to have the opportunity to build Alnylam over the last 19 years in RNAi therapeutics to patients around the world. I am so proud of what we've accomplished and I'm so thankful for the opportunity to have worked with our past and present Alnylam team to build this incredibly special company. I have no doubt that Alnylam will continue to soar in the years to come, helping patients with its transformative science and medicines. So with that, let me turn it over to Yvonne to make some remarks as well. Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. We've been so fortunate as Alnylam to have had your tremendous leadership, John, over these last 19 years. And I know I speak for the entire Alnylam team in thanking you for your commitment, passion and excellence. You have been the architect and the inspiration behind our success at this stage and I'm so grateful that you've given me the opportunity to advance Alnylam in its next exciting chapter. And I couldn't be more excited about Alnylam's prospects going forward with Alnylam P5x25. This is our clear road map for delivering RNAi therapeutics to help patients around the world and deliver value to our shareholders. And in the coming year, we expect to bring our fifth RNAi therapeutic to market and potentially expand our TTR franchise opportunity significantly. We expect steady and continued growth of our three directly marketed products with excellence in our commercial performance while also advancing sustainable innovation from our organic product engine, including our first extrahepatic program. These are very bright days for Alnylam. And I really encourage you to join us at our upcoming R&D Day on November 19 to hear some of exciting new progress. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Thank you, Yvonne and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our third quarter performance, particularly with ONPATTRO but also with our two ultrarare medicines, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, where we're still in launch phases and seeing some continued impact from the pandemic, particularly for GIVLAARI. For ONPATTRO, we achieved $120 million in global net product revenues, representing approximately 6% quarter-on-quarter growth compared with the second quarter. We ended the quarter with over 1,875 patients on commercial treatments. In the U.S., we continue to see strength on many fronts, including 12% growth in demand and notable growth in new prescribers. We have also continued to see encouraging signs of the health care system reopening. As an example, we've also seen an uptick in face-to-face interactions between our field team and HCPs in the third quarter, resulting in the second highest number of Start Forms for ONPATTRO in the U.S. in any quarter since launch. Further, patient diagnosis is evolving well, with continued growth in the use of PYP scans which is often the start of the patient journey towards hATTR polyneuropathy diagnosis. Treatment compliance has returned to pre-COVID levels and remained stable at over 90%, a remarkable result for an infused medicine. We also have confirmed access over 98% of covered U.S. lives with no payer headwinds. Now with regard to the rest of the world, market access has been achieved in over 30 countries worldwide and notable highlight in Q3 was achieving of pricing and reimbursement in Ireland which is a country with endemic disease due to the T60A mutation. We're also observing a good balance of first-line use and switches from other products, including stabilizers in rest of world markets. Moving to GIVLAARI. We continue to execute on this product's launch, having achieved $32 million in global net product revenues in the third quarter, representing approximately 4% quarter-on-quarter growth compared with Q2. As of September 30, we attained over 300 patients worldwide on commercial therapy. We observed a steady quarter-on-quarter patient growth rate of over 10%, driven primarily by geographic expansion and we're optimistic GIVLAARI will continue to perform well over time. In the U.S., we continue to make strong progress toward establishing Value-Based Agreements with over 10 finalized to date with commercial payers. We also have confirmed access for over 94% of covered U.S. lives with no pushback or headwinds. We continue to make great progress with market access efforts outside of the U.S. with recent launches in Japan and Spain and achievement of pricing and reimbursement in the U.K. and France. Moving now to OXLUMO which is also still in the launch phase. We achieved $15 million in global net product revenues in the third quarter which represented a decrease of approximately 9% from Q2 revenues. This decrease reflects the transition of the initial bolus of commercial patients from their monthly loading doses to their quarterly maintenance dosing. As we previously highlighted, is a dynamic expected to following launch. As of September 30, we attained over 120 patients on commercial OXLUMO treatment globally, representing over approximately 25 patient growth versus Q2. We believe this demonstrates that notwithstanding the decrease in revenues during the quarter, OXLUMO's fundamental growth remains strong. Our market access efforts are also progressing well. Now with over 10 VBAs finalized to date with commercial payers and confirmed access for over 85% of covered U.S. lives with no payer headwinds. Geographic expansion of OXLUMO is moving along steadily with two important launches underway, in Germany and France, supported by timely execution of the transitions to commercial drugs for patients previously treated through early access programs. In the CEMEA region, we continue to be pleased by the broad utilization of OXLUMO across age groups and eGFR categories at this early stage of the launch. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our third quarter commercial results with strong ONPATTRO performance and continued launch execution on GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. With that, I will now turn it over to Akshay to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Akshay?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Thanks, Tolga and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis where we're advancing two clinical stage product candidates, patisiran and Vutrisiran. Whilst ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat the  hATTR amyloidosis, we're committed to expanding the product's label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end, we're conducting the APOLLO-B Phase III study which is fully enrolled with over 300 patients and where we expect to report top line results in mid-2022. We're also advancing Vutrisiran which is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection and is also in development for ATTR amyloidosis. Here, we're conducting two Phase III studies. The first is HELIOS-A, evaluating Vutrisiran in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. Earlier this year, we presented positive 9-month results from the study which showed that the study met its primary and secondary end points at nine months. These data form the basis for our regulatory submissions to both the FDA and EMA. The FDA has accepted the submission and has signed a PDUFA date to Vutrisiran of April 14, 2022 and the EMA has validated our MAA submission. Patient dosing in HELIOS-A continued past the 9-month mark. And yesterday, we are happy to report positive top line results from the 18-month time point of the HELIOS-A study which I will now review. Please note that we plan to present the full 18-month results from the study at a medical congress in early 2022 and as such, we'll need to limit our discussion to the top line results only. These results mark an important step in bringing Vutrisiran a low dose once quarterly and potentially biannual subcutaneously administered therapy to patients living with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and as well as progressing our efforts to build an industry-leading franchise of medicines for the treatment of these patients. As a reminder, HELIOS-A is a randomized open-label study in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The study enrolled 164 patients who were randomized 3:1 to receive Vutrisiran at a dose of 25 milligrams administered subcutaneously once every three months or patisiran administered intravenously once every three weeks at a dose of 0.3 mg per kg. The primary endpoint was measured at nine months and was the change from baseline in the mNIS+7 neuropathy impairment score as compared to the external placebo group from the APOLLO Phase III study. We're delighted to report today that the HELIOS-A met all secondary endpoints measured at 18 months, including statistically significant improvements in progression of neuropathy as measured by the mNIS+7 score, quality of life, gate speed, nutritional status and overall disability relative to the placebo data from the APOLLO Phase III study of Vutrisiran. The final secondary endpoint, reduction in serum TTRF levels with Vutrisiran demonstrated non-inferiority relative to the within-study patisiran arm as expected. These results build on the positive 9-month Vutrisiran data we shared earlier this year and demonstrated that the reduction of neurological improvement and improvement in quality of life in patients with hATTR amyloidosis seen at nine months is maintained at 18 months. Furthermore, at 18 months, Vutrisiran treated patients showed quantitative improvement across a variety of exploratory endpoints evaluated in both the intent-to-treat population as well as a prespecified cardiac subpopulation. Improvements were seen in a number of exploratory endpoints, including the biomarker NT-proBNP, a measure of cardiac stress and certain echocardiographic parameters relative to the external placebo group. Other echocardiographic endpoints showed trends toward improvement but did not reach significance due to the small sample size. Finally, in a cohort of 48 patients, treatment with Vutrisiran was associated with an improvement in technetium uptake that is reduced tracer uptake in the heart relative to baseline in a majority of patients. This is the largest study conducted to date using imaging to characterize the impact of a TTR silencer on cardiac amyloid. Whilst it's important to recognize that these are exploratory data, that these patients have predominantly polyneuropathy, we believe these results are very encouraging with respect to providing potential evidence for reduced cardiac amyloid burden with Vutrisiran treatment. Vutrisiran's potential impact on cardiac manifestations of the disease is currently being studied in the HELIOS-B trial. Let's now review the safety results during the 18-month treatment period. Vutrisiran demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile. Study discontinuations occurred in three patients or 2.5% and were due to adverse events in the Vutrisiran arm by month 18. The single new discontinuation since month nine was in an event of cardiac failure considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator. By month 18, there were two deaths, neither of which were considered related to study drug. There were two serious adverse events deemed related to Vutrisiran by the study investigator consisting of dyslipidemia and a urinary tract infection. Deaths and related SAEs all occurred by month nine and have been previously reported. Treatment emergent adverse events occurring 10% or more of patients included 4, diarrhea, pain in extremity, peripheral edema, arthralgia, dizziness, urinary tract infections with the exception of pain in extremity and arthralgia, each of these events occurred at a similar or lower rate as compared with the external placebo. Injection site reactions were reported in 5 patients or 4.1% and were all mild and transient. There were no hepatic safety concerns. In summary, Vutrisiran has demonstrated an encouraging efficacy and safety profile in HELIOS-A through 18 months. Moreover, within the realm of reproducing clinical trial data, we're delighted to see the extent to which HELIOS-A results with Vutrisiran recapitulate the APOLLO data with patisiran. As previously noted, the other Phase III Vutrisiran study is HELIOS-B which is our ongoing Phase III cardiac outcome study with Vutrisiran in hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy. We were excited in the third quarter to complete enrollment in the study with over 600 patients, well ahead of schedule due to strong enrollment demand. Beyond patisiran and Vutrisiran, the newest addition to our ATTR amyloidosis franchise is the preclinical program, ALN-TTRsc04. Using our IKARIA platform, we've generated a new TTR targeting siRNA, ALN-TTRsc04 that we believe could support an annual dosing regimen with greater than 90% TTR knockdown. ALN-TTRsc04 is planned to enter clinical development with an IND filing at or around year-end 2022. Let's now move on to lumasiran. Our RNAi therapeutic approved late last year in the EU and U.S. as the first treatment for primary hyperoxaluria type one or PH1. In the third quarter, we were pleased to announce positive top line results from the ILLUMINATE-C Phase III study of lumasiran and we announced today that we plan to present full results from the study at the American Society of Nephrology meeting being held next week. We also now intend to submit supplemental regulatory filings with the FDA and EMA in late 2021, with the goal of further strengthening the labeling supporting OXLUMO. We're also excited about the potential of lumasiran for patients with recurrent renal stones and later this year, we plan to start a Phase II trial to evaluate that potential. Now in addition to our late-stage programs, we believe we're also making great progress with our early and mid-stage programs. Whilst I can't cover all these programs due to limited time today, one of the exciting parts of our story is the expansion of RNAi therapeutics beyond rare diseases into prevalent disease opportunities. Our program for high potential is a great example. Zilebesiran, formerly known as ALN-AGT is our investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the genetically validated target angiotensinogen in development for the treatment of hypertension. We look forward to presenting additional clinical results from the Phase I study at the American Heart Association meeting later this month, including in patients on a low-salt diet and in patients receiving co-administration with the conventional RAAS inhibitor, irbesartan. We also recently initiated our KARDIA Phase II program with zilebesiran. The first of the two studies, KARDIA-1 is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran as a monotherapy in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. This study is currently enrolling patients. In late 2021, we plan on initiating KARDIA-2 which is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran as add-on therapy in patients with hypertension despite treatment with standard of care. We also continue to harness our organic product engine with the goal of achieving sustainable innovation with two to four INDs per year. To this end, we're on track to file a CTA for ALN-XDH in development for the treatment of gout in late 2021. We're also on track to file a CTA for ALN-XDH in development for the treatment of gout in late 2021. We're also on track to file a CTA for ALN-APP in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy late 2021. We're very excited about our APP program as it's the first investigational RNAi therapeutic for our CNS platform which was also a feature at the OTS Meeting this past month. We believe that our initial human data for ALN-APP expected next year, if positive, could open the frontiers of RNAi therapeutics for many CNS diseases and also herald with potential growth of our broader extrahepatic efforts. Now in closing and on a personal note, John, thank you for your remarkable leadership over the last 19 years, as Alnylam built a whole new class of medicines, RNAi therapeutics. It has been my great privilege to work with you. You will leave us in a remarkably strong position as we build towards P5x25 and beyond, my friend. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeff?\nJeff Poulton: Thanks, Akshay and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting Alnylam's Q3 2021 financial results which reflect another quarter of progress on our journey towards building a self-sustainable financial profile aligned with our P5x25 goals. Turning to our results first for ONPATTRO. We generated $120.3 million in net revenue for the quarter representing 6% growth from the second quarter of 2021 and 46% growth compared with Q3 2020. U.S. ONPATTRO sales decreased 2% versus Q2 2021 and were impacted by the following: demand growth was 12%, consistent with Q2, primarily driven by an increase in patients on therapy and greater than 90% patient treatment compliance. Demand growth was offset by inventory destocking in Q3 compared with stocking in Q2, representing an approximate 10% headwind to reported Q3 growth and higher gross-to-net deductions which negatively impacted reported Q3 growth by approximately 3%. In our international markets, ONPATTRO performance remained strong with growth of 12% versus Q2 2021, primarily driven by increased patient demand broadly across markets in Europe, Canada and Japan. Turning to our results for GIVLAARI. We generated $31.8 million in net revenue in Q3 representing 4% growth compared to the second quarter of 2021 and 91% growth versus Q3 2020. U.S. GIVLAARI sales were flat versus Q2 2021 and were impacted by the following: demand growth was 9%, primarily due to an increased patients on therapy and greater than 90% patient treatment compliance. Demand growth was offset by inventory destocking in Q3 compared with stocking in Q2, negatively impacting Q3 reported growth by approximately 8%. With OXLUMO, we generated $14.9 million in net revenue in the quarter, representing a 9% decrease compared with Q2. As Tolga previously mentioned, despite patient growth of approximately 25% in the quarter, sales decreased due to the transition of the initial bolus of commercial patients from monthly loading dose to quarterly maintenance dose regimens. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter with the following highlights: total combined product sales in the second quarter were $167 million, representing 68% growth versus Q3 2020. Net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was $20.1 million, a decrease from Q3 last year, primarily due to less revenue recognized from our collaboration with Vir. Our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for the quarter increased 12% versus Q3 2020. Key drivers of the increase continued to be additional R&D investment in advancing our early, mid and late-stage pipeline programs and increased SG&A investment to support our three commercial brands, including the launch of OXLUMO. Non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter decreased by approximately $20 million versus the same period in 2020, driven by strong top line growth and more moderate growth in operating expenses, continuing our progress towards achieving profitability. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $2.3 billion as of September 30, 2021, compared to $1.9 billion as of December 30, 2020. Notably, the third quarter included the second $500 million payment from Blackstone for the monetization of 50% of inclisiran royalties. Lastly, turning to our full year 2021 financial guidance. We are reiterating our guidance for combined product sales, $640 million to $665 million; for net revenue from collaborations and royalties, $150 million to $200 million; and for non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses, $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion. Let me now turn to a review of upcoming milestones. We are very excited about the positive 18-month data from HELIOS-A for hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy and plan to present the full results at a medical conference in early 2022. With zilebesiran, as Akshay mentioned, we plan to present additional data from the Phase I study at the AHA meeting later this month and plan to initiate the KARDIA-2 Phase II combination study later this year as well. From lumasiran, we plan to initiate a Phase II study for renal stone events in late 2021. This Phase II study will be important for life cycle management of OXLUMO with the potential to enable a Phase III trial to significantly expand the overall opportunity. We also intend to submit supplemental regulatory filings with the FDA and the EMA in late 2021, based on the results from the ILLUMINATE-C study with the goal of strengthening the labeling supporting OXLUMO. Turning to cemdisiran for complement-mediated diseases. Our partner, Regeneron, plans to initiate a Phase III study of cemdisiran and pozelimab combination and myasthenia gravis. With ALN-HSD, as Akshay mentioned, we expect to report initial safety results in healthy volunteers from the Phase I study at our upcoming R&D Day. We're very excited to file our first CNS CTA for ALN-APP in late 2021 setting us up for potential initial clinical proof-of-concept data in late 2022. And as another step toward expanding our prevalent disease opportunities, we plan to advance ALN-XDH in development for the treatment of gout toward a CTA filing in late 2021. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, we will now open the call for your questions. To those dialed in, we would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each and then get back in the queue if you have additional questions.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Maury Raycroft for Jefferies.\nMaury Raycroft: Hi good morning everyone and congrats on the updates and congrats on the CEO transition to both John and Yvonne. I look forward to our next steps. For my question for the HELIOS-A data, just wondering if you can contextualize what you have relative to APOLLO-A? And are there any new observations that could inform the APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B studies can read out? And I'm just wondering, just checking based on the data, do you plan to make any supplemental filings for Vutrisiran?\nJohn Maraganore: So Maury, let me start by just thanking you and your congratulatory comments. But the question here really goes right to Akshay. Akshay, take it away.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Maury, obviously, the current data now with Vutrisiran only further strengthen our belief in the drug, the data look outstanding in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. These new exploratory data with the cardiac endpoints are extremely encouraging. We're very excited about the technetium scan observations that show reduced uptake of the technetium. And in addition to the previously reported finding at nine months which we see again an 18 months improvement, in proBNP, improvement in aspects to the echocardiogram and these new -- the technetium data, I think this all bodes well for the performance of Vutrisiran in HELIOS-B and strengthens our hypothesis that TTR lowering is an important way to address TTR-related cardiac disorders. And so our confidence in APOLLO-B, of course, also goes up significantly because of these observations. So I'll stop there and happy to take any other questions.\nJohn Maraganore: Does that answer your question, Maury?\nMaury Raycroft: Yes. And just wondering if you do plan on supplementing the Vutrisiran filing?\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Just real quickly on that, obviously, the -- for the European filing, we will be including these 18-month data in the European filing that was agreed to by the  but with the FDA, there's no needed up in that filing.\nMaury Raycroft: Ok, thank you for taking my question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays.\nGena Wang: Thank you for taking my question. Yvonne, congrats on the new position. And John, we will surely miss you. My best wishes to your next journey. And I hope our roads will cross again in the near future. So I have a 2-part question on the ATTR franchise. So the first one is regarding the HELIOS-A, just wondering regarding the 30% cardio subpopulation, based on your definition on the cardio subpopulation which NYHA class this patient will belong to? And then another short question regarding APOLLO-B. I understand that patients will be allowed to take tafamidis at some point in the study. So is there any set time restriction before allowing these patients to take a tafamidis? And this is referring to the 70% patient population that would not be on tafamadis on the baseline?\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Thank you, Gena. Akshay, do you want to handle both questions?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. So with respect to HELIOS-A, we'll present the full data, Gena, at an upcoming medical meeting. But suffice it to say, the vast majority of patients would have New York Heart Association one or two level disease. With respect to APOLLO-B and tafamidis, Pushkal Garg is with us. Pushkal, do you want to comment on that?\nPushkal Garg: Sure. Thanks, Akshay. Gena, to your question about TAF drop-ins, ethically patients can drop in or position to do that but they're discouraged from doing that in the first 12 months. And our statistical analysis plan also accounts for the potential for drop-ins. So we feel good about the design of the study and accommodating that.\nGena Wang: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tazeen Ahmad with Bank of America.\nTazeen Ahmad: Good morning guys, thank you for taking my question. John, you've been a terrific CEO. We will certainly miss you, we wish you the best in your future endeavors and look forward to working with Yvonne. Just a clarification question. Are you just going to be joining the Scientific Advisory Board? Or you going to be staying on with the full Board of Directors. And then a quick question. How is enrollment progressing in the KARDIA-1 trial?\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Thank you, Tazeen. Thanks for your very warm comments. And you're going to love working with Yvonne. She is nothing short of terrific. I wouldn't be staying on the Scientific Advisory Board because I cannot do anything other than love the science of Alnylam and can't wait to continue to be involved with the great science and progress that we're making here in the company. As you can imagine, being on boards for a former CEO is always a complicated thing. And I just think it's a lot better for Yvonne if I'm not on the board and I just focus on the science which I'll do and I'll torture Akshay instead, leave Yvonne in good place. But no, it's a decision that I made because I think it's very difficult for former CEOs to stay on boards. And obviously, I will participate in the company on the Scientific Advisory Board. But Akshay, do you want to comment on KARDIA?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes, KARDIA-1 enrollment is going well. Generally speaking, Tazeen, we let the trial progress and we have clear line of sight on the last patient in before we give further guidance. But it's going very well. I mean this is hypertension as also there are 1.2 billion patients around the world. So it's an eminently enrollable study and it is going well.\nYvonne Greenstreet: I mean, John, if I could just add that I'm looking forward to actually what is going to be quite a sort of reasonable transition period here. I'm not actually taking on the role as CEO until January one next year and John will be staying on as an adviser for the 3-or-so months following that period. So we're going to be seeing quite often of each other, still I think take a period of time.\nJohn Maraganore: I think so. Thanks, Tazeen. Does that answer your question? Questions?\nTazeen Ahmad: Yes. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ted Tenthoff with Piper Sandler.\nTed Tenthoff: Great. Thanks and my sincere congratulations too, I wish you nothing but personal and professional success. It's such a pleasure for a long time. And Yvonne, congrats. It's a really exciting  that's important for the company. So I wanted to ask a little bit on pipelines in terms of ? And maybe, again, that's just still too much summer from the upcoming R&D day. But can you give us a little bit more insight into how you anticipate developing on that asset with Regeneron?\nJohn Maraganore: So Ted, you were coming in and out which asset with Regeneron specifically?\nTed Tenthoff: ALN-APP.\nJohn Maraganore: APP, fantastic. Okay. Yes. No, I mean, let me just start by saying one of the really exciting next frontiers for Alnylam is the broader extrahepatic delivery opportunities. And you'll hear a lot about that at our upcoming R&D Day and I think you're going to be really pleased with what you hear. And of course, the program that's pushing that frontier is ALN-APP which targets amyloid precursor protein. And we are really excited that the IND should be filed or CTA in this case will be filed by the end of the year and we do expect to have human data next year from that program which will be really important because if we can reproduce the 70%, 80% lowering of APP and Abeta fragments that we have observed so durably in the primate that would be a major milestone for the entire field and frankly, for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in the future. So we really look forward to that. Now specifically on the development plans, maybe I can point it over to Pushkal to maybe make some high-level comments. Pushkal?\nPushkal Garg: Sure. Thanks, John. So with regard to ALN-APP, as Akshay mentioned in his comments, we're going to be filing the IND later this year to take that molecule forward. It has -- we think it has broad applicability across -- if it meets its proof of concept, as John highlighted, in Alzheimer's disease as well as another very, very disabling and fatal condition, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, both of which APP has been strongly implicated in. The initial study that we're planning to do will be opening the IND and CTA in early onset Alzheimer's disease which is a well-characterized population of patients with severe unmet need. And then based on the results there, where we will be looking initially for safety, tolerability as well as pharmacologic activity, we'll be able to branch into a broader Phase II and III program in those two diseases. So that's our plan.\nJohn Maraganore: Does that answer your question, Ted?\nTed Tenthoff: Sure, John. Thanks everybody.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.\nSalveen Richter: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. John, it has been a pleasure working with you. You'll be missed here and Yvonne, congratulations on the new role. In terms of APOLLO-B and this tafamidis drop-in here, how do you account for this in the statistical plan, just given that patients still do that the option to pursue it, notwithstanding discouragement? And then secondly, on the CNS platform, maybe help us understand just where you stand in the ability to deliver to that tissue?\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Well, let me have Pushkal answer the APOLLO-B question and then Akshay can answer the APP question. But let me just start, Salveen, first of all, by thanking you for your comments at the beginning, of course but also just reminding you that, obviously, in the design both the HELIOS-B and APOLLO-B study. We come at this with enormous experience in doing clinical studies in ATTR amyloidosis. And we come at this, of course, with a very solid track record, as you know, from our overall clinical development team and designing very robust, typically highly overpowered studies, I might say, as you can note from our traditional P values. So with that as background, Pushkal, do you want to answer Salveen's specific question?\nPushkal Garg: Sure. Salveen, I think, I understand why you're asking your question, again, as John highlighted, as we designed the study, we were obviously very cognizant of the availability of tafamidis and the potential for drop-in. There was an allowance for a certain amount of baseline tafamidis use on entry into the study as we talked about and we modeled out a variety of parameters. The studies do allow for patients to drop in on TAF, particularly guiding after the first year. And as you'll recall, in APOLLO-B, the primary endpoint is a 12-month endpoint of 6-minute walk test. The other thing to remember is that as we think about the geographic deployment of the study, we all sort of aware of where TAF is available to patients. And so through an operational -- through the way we operationally manage the study, we can also have some control about the availability of TAF and the potential risks around drop-in. And then also statistically, we assumed some very conservative assumptions, as John highlighted, we're very thoughtful about how we design these studies. And so we considered very conservative assumptions in terms of drop-in and made sure that our powering considerations were robust to even the worst-case scenario. So we feel very, very comfortable with that. And then finally, our analysis plan also takes into account the potential for drop-ins and there are analytic methods where we can, for example, sensor drop-ins and look at analysis with and without drop-ins, et cetera. And I'll just highlight that we monitor this very closely, as does our DMC and we feel very, very confident and good that the numbers are -- continue to be low and we're monitoring that and we feel very comfortable with the overall conduct of the study.\nJohn Maraganore: Great. Thank you, Pushkal. Akshay, the question on APP?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. So we're very excited about CNS delivery approaches we have in hand, we shared at OTS that we've got a novel conjugate that's a lipid-based system, C16. And we've shown reproducibly, both in small animals, rodents and in nonhuman primates that we get widespread delivery in the central nervous system with potent knockdown, 80% or greater durable knockdown of up to a year and against multiple targets. And these targets we've looked at cell-specific markets, so we know we get knockdown in all the major cell types in the nervous system, the neuron, the ascites microglial cells. And anatomically, the  looks very encouraging indeed with knockdown in deep brain structures which I know has been a challenge for other modalities, cortical structures, cerebella structures in the spinal cord. So with that kind of preclinical pharmacology package, one has to be excited and therefore the ALN-APP program which we discussed just a few minutes ago, really is in the vanguard of what's to come and we look forward to exciting data from that program in 2022 with biomarker lockdown, hopefully.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Matteis with Stifel.\nPaul Matteis: Great. Thanks so much. And I'll echo what everyone else said, John, about working with you and Yvonne, congratulations. I wanted to ask a few more questions just about the transition and why now. And I guess one thing that I noticed going back to the last quarter press release was that Mike Bonney was named Executive Chair really recently and it had to do with legal and compliance functions. And I guess I wanted to just kind of understand, is there anything beyond what was disclosed here? As it just relates to kind of John, your vision strategically, the board's vision strategically? Was there -- I guess, really just flat out, was there any kind of disagreement at all on where Alnylam is going? Or is this purely just voluntary? And do you feel like it's the right time? And I guess if you do feel like it's really just the right time, why not wait until after APOLLO-B, given how big of a value-creating event that could be for Alnylam?\nJohn Maraganore: Paul, thanks for the question and your kind words at the beginning. And let me try to be really clear. This was my decision. I want to begin a new chapter. I've been running this company for 19 years, came here when there were 6 employees as the founding CEO, $17.5 million post-money valuation and took it to $25 billion and obviously, 1,600 employees in 20 countries around the world. And four approved medicines. So after a 19-year tenure like that, it's not unreasonable to say, \"Okay, things are really good. Things are going great, might want to not be a running CEO for the next 19 years.\" And in terms of timing, yes, I could have waited until next year, I could have waited until two years. I could have waited until 30 years but I'd probably be dead. So at some point, you just got to make the call about when to make a transition. And I couldn't be more excited about where the company is right now. And I couldn't be more excited about the fact that Yvonne is here as my successor. I mean if I waited for a year and Yvonne got lured to go someplace else, I'd have no successor. So I have to keep kicking the can down the road. So the bottom line is this is the right time. There's never a great time, of course but I think this is the right time. And in terms of value creation, I'm still a major shareholder of the company. And I want to stay a major shareholder of the company. And I'm obviously going to benefit from the very, in my view, very likely outcome of APOLLO-B which I think will be a very defining event for the company. Does that answer your question? I don't know, Yvonne, if you want to say something?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Well, I just want to add that John and I created the P5x25 goals together. And as you all know, this lays out the very bold vision that we have at the company, delivering transformative medicines to patients around the world with both rare and more prevalent diseases from our amazing product engine as well as delivering excellent financial performance. And we put the strategy together. And going forward, I'm fully committed to progressing the strategy. I think it serves us well as a road map to guide us through the next chapter. And I kind of plan to execute fully against this plan without any loss of momentum.\nPaul Matteis: If I can just ask one follow-up. Given that Barry left a year ago and John, now you're deciding it's time. Yvonne, again, congrats, do you expect the rest of the management team to remain in place?\nJohn Maraganore: I mean, absolutely, Paul. I mean, we have a very committed team of leaders here in the company. And I have no reason to believe that any changes are going to happen. But we also have a really strong bench. We have a strong group of people that are right underneath these leaders that we have right now. And so we are in a very, very strong position as a result of all that. And I have every confidence that this company will continue to perform unbelievably well for the future. No doubt about it in my mind.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ritu Baral from Cowen.\nRitu Baral: Thanks for taking the question and Yvonne, congrats, really looking forward to working with you and John, we'll miss you but that Lyric Opera offer still stands on my part.\nJohn Maraganore: All right. I'm in. I'm in.\nRitu Baral: All right. I wanted to ask without getting you in trouble with maybe ACC, I wanted to ask about the potential technetium data that we're going to be seeing out of HELIOS-A next year and especially how that could be important for differentiation and marketing potentially going forward. I guess, one, can you walk us through like the units of that scan and what's a meaningful burden reduction? And are we going to get that same data of APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B?\nJohn Maraganore: Okay. Great. So let me have Akshay answer. You asked the question about differentiation as well. So I'm going to have Tolga way out of that, part of it. Let me start though with Akshay commenting on the -- without getting into trouble with ACC if that's where we present it. So Akshay, go ahead.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes, Ritu, we will have to wait for the full data to share in more detail. But at a high level, what I would say is, this is a -- there's the metric evaluation tool where you look at the extent of tracer uptake into the heart and what we've done in a significant number of -- actually, the largest number of patients in the study of this kind of ever looked at pre and post-treatment and we're very encouraged by the fact that the majority show reduction in tracer uptake with technetium. Now that's not a clinically approvable endpoint today. What we know scientifically is that we're encouraged by this because the data would suggest that this could be potential evidence for reduction in cardiac amyloid and that, of course, would be very exciting. So we'll share the full data set with you in due course. But the data can only be supportive and encouraging of what's to come in APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B and our overall belief that reduction of TTR levels with our drugs, patisiran and lumasiran hopefully, will convert significant clinical benefit for patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy.\nJohn Maraganore: And Tolga, do you want to comment a little bit. Sorry, go ahead, Ritu.\nRitu Baral: Akshay, will those two trials also generate technetium cohort data?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. The technetium is an optional assessment in that. Not all patients will have it and of course, the availability will vary at sites around the world. But yes, there'll be some technetium data. More importantly, I think in those studies, Ritu will be the clinical endpoints, of course, right which 6-minute-walk distance for APOLLO-B and mortality and hospitalization for Helios-B.\nJohn Maraganore: And Tolga, do you want to comment a little bit on Ritu's question around the potential differentiation of these data as it relates to the competitive landscape and so forth?\nTolga Tanguler: Sure. I mean, first of all, obviously, we are very pleased with the ONPATTRO performance and how we've been able to expand our prescriber base and increase our Start Forms. Now there will be patients and physicians who are an waiting and see category. And I believe with a combination of efficacy safety and once quarterly in the future and possibly semiannual subcutaneous treatment regimen, along with -- coupled with the strong commercial capabilities that we already built. I believe this product will enable us to further expand the franchise that we already established, especially in markets where increased convenience, for instance, in Japan, we have limited home infusion availability. The switch dynamic will certainly increase as well as in the EU, where increased convenience could accelerate to switch dynamic from a stabilizer to increase our category share of first line versus other treatment options\nYvonne Greenstreet: And I'd just like to add one point on that just to emphasize that our commercial organization has done a fantastic job but we have something like 1,875 patients that are currently on commercial treatment. We have an opportunity that's much, much larger than that. If you look at the patients that would be appropriate for ONPATTRO and hopefully, shortly Vutrisiran. You're looking at over 30,000 patients. So we really are at the beginning of this journey that I think, going to just continue to pick up steam as time goes on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anupam Rama with JPMorgan.\nAnupam Rama: Hey guys, thank you so much taking y question. John, sad to see you go but it's been really cool to see everything you built, man and wishing you the best. Yvonne, congrats and look forward to seeing you at the conference in January. On patisiran and APOLLO-B, more of a market research question, what does your market research say about a knockdown agent within every 3-week IV regimen in a 6-minute-walk distance endpoint? How does that kind of fit in versus tafamidis, if particularly in wild-type cardiomyopathy, where we know they have hospitalizations and mortality type of data?\nJohn Maraganore: Thanks, Anupam and I will miss you in January but I'll perhaps be the audience watching Yvonne. But getting back to your question on differentiation and specifically the question on how does it all play out, I'll let Tolga answer in just a minute. But let me just start by saying that obviously, if we generate positive results out of APOLLO-B and if the drug is approved for the wild-type and hereditary ATTR cardiomyopathy segment, those are, of course, important ifs. We think that the profile of a TTR silencer, the mechanism of action of a TTR silencer will be a valued part of the treatment options that are available for patients with this disease. And we certainly believe, based on market research we've done that Tolga can comment on, that, that type of availability certainly for patients that may be progressing in their ongoing treatment with a stabilizer drug if they're on a stabilizer drug. That type of treatment option may be important for the patients, again, assuming positive APOLLO-B data and positive approval. So that's at least the foundational aspect of it. Tolga, do you want to add anything more to that as well?\nTolga Tanguler: No, John. I mean, essentially, what we shared earlier as well based on some of the market research studies we've done, we've certainly seen the early indicators of cardiomyopathy or cardiac data, secondary endpoints tend to be seen very favorably by the cardiologist if the product is obviously approved. And obviously, given the profile of the product, they being a quarterly subcutaneous injection clearly addresses the adherence issue which, again, would be another important indicator.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Pushkal, do you want to comment?\nPushkal Garg: Sure. I think it's an important question. I think maybe just a couple of points to reiterate around ONPATTRO, I mean and the profile of tafamidis I think it's important to recognize that patients on tafamidis even coming out of the ATTR-ACT study continue to decline in terms of their 6-minute walk test. And so we think there's an opportunity, again, based on the data we've seen more broadly with silencing to potentially have a very differentiated clinical profile. The other point around this and we're starting to see some evidence of that, while there haven't been head-to-head studies, it was interesting, for example, that there was a recent abstract presented at the EU, TTR meeting that looked at technetium scans in patients given the silencer and patients given tafamidis. And Akshay mentioned early on that we've seen evidence of improvements or reduced uptake on technetium scanning with a silencer. And in this case with Vutrisiran and HELIOS-A in that study, they looked at patients on ONPATTRO and saw similar results. And interestingly, in that say, with tafamidis patients and stabilize their patients that they did not see those kinds of improvements. So again, a small study -- academic study. But I think as we start to look at the totality of data that's emerging on our class of silencers versus stabilizers, we are starting to see differentiation. And we'll see then when we get the results from APOLLO-B how those materialize, clinical trial data.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: By the way, just to keep the record straight, I was referring to HELIOS-B, not APOLLO-B. So sorry about the subcutaneous one.\nJohn Maraganore: Does that answer your question, Anupam.\nAnupam Rama: Yes. Thanks so much for taking the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor.\nAlethia Young: Heys guys, thanks for taking my question. Yvonne, you've been killing it over there. So keep on killing there, congrats. And John, you guys always have a special place in my heart and it's been great working with you and one of the first companies I ever covered. So all the best, man. So I guess I want to talk a little bit about like big picture, like you guys have a lot of things going on. I'm obviously now starting to branch down to many different indications. So when you look across like the next three to 5 years, I mean, some of these start to come potentially to fruition, are you looking to kind of build deeper commercial organizations that do more and diversify? Or are you kind of thinking about different other strategic ways and things to do things?\nJohn Maraganore: Well, it's a terrific question, Alethia. And you've always been such a great covering analyst, so it's wonderful to have been one of the first companies you've covered. But I think your questions are really terrific one for Yvonne. So I going to just pass it right over to her.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. No, that's great. I think we're in a really strong position where we put in place to continue to execute. If we look at the opportunities that are ahead of us, they're going to be focused around the cardiac market for the next few years. Obviously, hopefully, we get great data out of APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B. And then we look forward to zilebesiran for hypertension which we believe is going to completely reimagine the treatment of hypertension. I think we're going to be able to build on this footprint from a commercial perspective within the company. But clearly, as we go forward with all the opportunity we have, what that gives us is tremendous optionality but thinking about how we want to build the business. We're just incredibly fortunate to be standing on the foundation that John has built over the last 19 years and I couldn't be more excited about we have in front of us.\nJohn Maraganore: Does that answer your question, Alethia?\nAlethia Young: It does. And congrats, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Lebowitz with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Lebowitz: Yvonne, congratulations on the new role. And John, it's been great working with you over the years. A quick question on the data from the Vutrisiran trial. Would you be able to compare the safety profiles of ONPATTRO, Vutrisiran and revusiran the discontinued therapy and as far as similarities and differences across the platforms?\nJohn Maraganore: Well, let me give some context and then maybe, Akshay, you can comment on it. I mean revusiran, of course, is a completely different animal, early generation STC, GalNAc conjugate, poorly stable, not very stable, required extremely high doses and turned out to be not well-tolerated in the frail patient population. And obviously, that program was discontinued. I think the big difference between the subcu delivered Vutrisiran versus the IV-infused ONPATTRO really comes down to the type of administration that's involved. If you look at subcu injection, we see a low incidence of mild-to-moderate, generally always reversible type of injection site reactions with subcu delivered Vutrisiran. With intravenously administered ONPATTRO, we see a low incidence, roughly 50-or-so percent of infusion-related reactions which are not uncommon with IV infused drugs as well. And so I think that's really the biggest difference between them. Of course, Vutrisiran also does not require pre-medication which is a nice feature around Vutrisiran as well. And so in general, I think those are the main differences. Akshay, do you want to comment any further?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: No, I think you covered it well, John. I would just add that the safety profile of Vutrisiran looks extremely encouraging on its face and comparing to the placebo data from APOLLO. And just as one marker of that, I would say, in a 3-study discontinuations, in a study of this length with over 120, 130 patients on Vutrisiran is pretty remarkable. I mean these are very frail, sick patients. And with the encouraging efficacy data we've discussed today. I think that all adds to a very encouraging benefit/risk profile. Of course, we'll submit these data to regulators and they have the final judgment but we're certainly very encouraged by the overall profile of this drug.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. And I would just add to wrap it up, that that obviously both Vutrisiran and ONPATTRO, well, in the case of ONPATTRO, we also have post-marketing data and we are encouraged by the very consistent post-marketing data as it relates to the study results that we saw in APOLLO. But then in terms of ongoing clinical studies for both patisiran and Vutrisiran in the cardiomyopathy study, the APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B studies, we have data safety monitoring boards that review the unblinded safety data quarterly. And so far, so good in terms of any externally support for continuing to move forward. So that's the landscape, David. We've learned a lot over the years in terms of how to make these molecules better and better. And I think knock on wood, so far so good in terms of how that's played out.\nDavid Lebowitz: If we jump over to OXLUMO, I know that the -- you were talking about the bolus patients at the beginning, who had the loading dose led to the, I guess, the downtick from last quarter. How should we view that factor going forward from this point, as far as mapping out our run rates going forward for the drug?\nJohn Maraganore: Maybe, Tolga and Jeff can take that on. Tolga, do you want to start?\nTolga Tanguler: I mean, look, at the end of the day, we were able to grow our patient basis over 5% and added, now we're at 120 patients. Majority of the patients that we've been able to build over time has been coming from either naive patients where you do see this starting dose impact and as well as early access program patients that already were getting their starting those prior to the program that before they were commercial. The way I would really think about this is, as we are expanding geographically, we would still see some level of this impact to a degree based on the markets that we're expanding as well as our continuous performance in the U.S. where we didn't really have a lot of early access program patients. So this dynamic will continue but maybe not to the magnitude that we currently see at this stage. Jeff, do you have anything else to add?\nJeff Poulton: The one thing I'd add just on top of that is, I think it's the scale of the opportunity grows, some of the noise that you see from these dynamics will dissipate.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back to the company for closing comments.\nJohn Maraganore: All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining on this call. This is my last one at Alnylam. I want to thank all of you for the support over the last 19 years.

            "content": "Thank you, Yvonne and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our third quarter performance, particularly with ONPATTRO but also with our two ultrarare medicines, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, where we're still in launch phases and seeing some continued impact from the pandemic, particularly for GIVLAARI. For ONPATTRO, we achieved $120 million in global net product revenues, representing approximately 6% quarter-on-quarter growth compared with the second quarter. We ended the quarter with over 1,875 patients on commercial treatments. In the U.S., we continue to see strength on many fronts, including 12% growth in demand and notable growth in new prescribers. We have also continued to see encouraging signs of the health care system reopening. As an example, we've also seen an uptick in face-to-face interactions between our field team and HCPs in the third quarter, resulting in the second highest number of Start Forms for ONPATTRO in the U.S. in any quarter since launch. Further, patient diagnosis is evolving well, with continued growth in the use of PYP scans which is often the start of the patient journey towards hATTR polyneuropathy diagnosis. Treatment compliance has returned to pre-COVID levels and remained stable at over 90%, a remarkable result for an infused medicine. We also have confirmed access over 98% of covered U.S. lives with no payer headwinds. Now with regard to the rest of the world, market access has been achieved in over 30 countries worldwide and notable highlight in Q3 was achieving of pricing and reimbursement in Ireland which is a country with endemic disease due to the T60A mutation. We're also observing a good balance of first-line use and switches from other products, including stabilizers in rest of world markets. Moving to GIVLAARI. We continue to execute on this product's launch, having achieved $32 million in global net product revenues in the third quarter, representing approximately 4% quarter-on-quarter growth compared with Q2. As of September 30, we attained over 300 patients worldwide on commercial therapy. We observed a steady quarter-on-quarter patient growth rate of over 10%, driven primarily by geographic expansion and we're optimistic GIVLAARI will continue to perform well over time. In the U.S., we continue to make strong progress toward establishing Value-Based Agreements with over 10 finalized to date with commercial payers. We also have confirmed access for over 94% of covered U.S. lives with no pushback or headwinds. We continue to make great progress with market access efforts outside of the U.S. with recent launches in Japan and Spain and achievement of pricing and reimbursement in the U.K. and France. Moving now to OXLUMO which is also still in the launch phase. We achieved $15 million in global net product revenues in the third quarter which represented a decrease of approximately 9% from Q2 revenues. This decrease reflects the transition of the initial bolus of commercial patients from their monthly loading doses to their quarterly maintenance dosing. As we previously highlighted, is a dynamic expected to following launch. As of September 30, we attained over 120 patients on commercial OXLUMO treatment globally, representing over approximately 25 patient growth versus Q2. We believe this demonstrates that notwithstanding the decrease in revenues during the quarter, OXLUMO's fundamental growth remains strong. Our market access efforts are also progressing well. Now with over 10 VBAs finalized to date with commercial payers and confirmed access for over 85% of covered U.S. lives with no payer headwinds. Geographic expansion of OXLUMO is moving along steadily with two important launches underway, in Germany and France, supported by timely execution of the transitions to commercial drugs for patients previously treated through early access programs. In the CEMEA region, we continue to be pleased by the broad utilization of OXLUMO across age groups and eGFR categories at this early stage of the launch. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our third quarter commercial results with strong ONPATTRO performance and continued launch execution on GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. With that, I will now turn it over to Akshay to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Akshay? Sure. I mean, first of all, obviously, we are very pleased with the ONPATTRO performance and how we've been able to expand our prescriber base and increase our Start Forms. Now there will be patients and physicians who are an waiting and see category. And I believe with a combination of efficacy safety and once quarterly in the future and possibly semiannual subcutaneous treatment regimen, along with -- coupled with the strong commercial capabilities that we already built. I believe this product will enable us to further expand the franchise that we already established, especially in markets where increased convenience, for instance, in Japan, we have limited home infusion availability. The switch dynamic will certainly increase as well as in the EU, where increased convenience could accelerate to switch dynamic from a stabilizer to increase our category share of first line versus other treatment options No, John. I mean, essentially, what we shared earlier as well based on some of the market research studies we've done, we've certainly seen the early indicators of cardiomyopathy or cardiac data, secondary endpoints tend to be seen very favorably by the cardiologist if the product is obviously approved. And obviously, given the profile of the product, they being a quarterly subcutaneous injection clearly addresses the adherence issue which, again, would be another important indicator. I mean, look, at the end of the day, we were able to grow our patient basis over 5% and added, now we're at 120 patients. Majority of the patients that we've been able to build over time has been coming from either naive patients where you do see this starting dose impact and as well as early access program patients that already were getting their starting those prior to the program that before they were commercial. The way I would really think about this is, as we are expanding geographically, we would still see some level of this impact to a degree based on the markets that we're expanding as well as our continuous performance in the U.S. where we didn't really have a lot of early access program patients. So this dynamic will continue but maybe not to the magnitude that we currently see at this stage. Jeff, do you have anything else to add?"

            "content": "Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. We've been so fortunate as Alnylam to have had your tremendous leadership, John, over these last 19 years. And I know I speak for the entire Alnylam team in thanking you for your commitment, passion and excellence. You have been the architect and the inspiration behind our success at this stage and I'm so grateful that you've given me the opportunity to advance Alnylam in its next exciting chapter. And I couldn't be more excited about Alnylam's prospects going forward with Alnylam P5x25. This is our clear road map for delivering RNAi therapeutics to help patients around the world and deliver value to our shareholders. And in the coming year, we expect to bring our fifth RNAi therapeutic to market and potentially expand our TTR franchise opportunity significantly. We expect steady and continued growth of our three directly marketed products with excellence in our commercial performance while also advancing sustainable innovation from our organic product engine, including our first extrahepatic program. These are very bright days for Alnylam. And I really encourage you to join us at our upcoming R&D Day on November 19 to hear some of exciting new progress. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga? I mean, John, if I could just add that I'm looking forward to actually what is going to be quite a sort of reasonable transition period here. I'm not actually taking on the role as CEO until January one next year and John will be staying on as an adviser for the 3-or-so months following that period. So we're going to be seeing quite often of each other, still I think take a period of time. Well, I just want to add that John and I created the P5x25 goals together. And as you all know, this lays out the very bold vision that we have at the company, delivering transformative medicines to patients around the world with both rare and more prevalent diseases from our amazing product engine as well as delivering excellent financial performance. And we put the strategy together. And going forward, I'm fully committed to progressing the strategy. I think it serves us well as a road map to guide us through the next chapter. And I kind of plan to execute fully against this plan without any loss of momentum. And I'd just like to add one point on that just to emphasize that our commercial organization has done a fantastic job but we have something like 1,875 patients that are currently on commercial treatment. We have an opportunity that's much, much larger than that. If you look at the patients that would be appropriate for ONPATTRO and hopefully, shortly Vutrisiran. You're looking at over 30,000 patients. So we really are at the beginning of this journey that I think, going to just continue to pick up steam as time goes on. Yes. No, that's great. I think we're in a really strong position where we put in place to continue to execute. If we look at the opportunities that are ahead of us, they're going to be focused around the cardiac market for the next few years. Obviously, hopefully, we get great data out of APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B. And then we look forward to zilebesiran for hypertension which we believe is going to completely reimagine the treatment of hypertension. I think we're going to be able to build on this footprint from a commercial perspective within the company. But clearly, as we go forward with all the opportunity we have, what that gives us is tremendous optionality but thinking about how we want to build the business. We're just incredibly fortunate to be standing on the foundation that John has built over the last 19 years and I couldn't be more excited about we have in front of us."

            "name": "John Maraganore",
            "content": "Thanks, Christine and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. In the third quarter and recent period, we made continued progress bringing our commercial RNAi therapeutics to patients around the world. We advanced our clinical pipeline of over a dozen potential transformative medicine programs and we delivered on the promise of sustainable innovation, with RNAi, with our industry-leading platform and our preclinical efforts. Of course, a highlight for the period was the positive top line 18-month results from the HELIOS-A Phase III study of Vutrisiran that we announced just yesterday. And Akshay will review those results very shortly. As we announced this morning, after much thoughtful consideration and planning, I've decided that this is the right time to begin a smooth transition of leadership at Alnylam. I've decided that this is the time for me to begin a new chapter in my career of yet again pushing the bounds of biomedical innovation by helping entrepreneurs and companies advance new modalities to improve the lives of patients. I couldn't be more pleased that Yvonne Greenstreet has agreed to help lead Alnylam in a planned transition that will occur at the end of this year. Of course, I am so honored to have the opportunity to build Alnylam over the last 19 years in RNAi therapeutics to patients around the world. I am so proud of what we've accomplished and I'm so thankful for the opportunity to have worked with our past and present Alnylam team to build this incredibly special company. I have no doubt that Alnylam will continue to soar in the years to come, helping patients with its transformative science and medicines. So with that, let me turn it over to Yvonne to make some remarks as well. Yvonne? So Maury, let me start by just thanking you and your congratulatory comments. But the question here really goes right to Akshay. Akshay, take it away. Does that answer your question, Maury? Yes. Just real quickly on that, obviously, the -- for the European filing, we will be including these 18-month data in the European filing that was agreed to by the  but with the FDA, there's no needed up in that filing. Yes. Thank you, Gena. Akshay, do you want to handle both questions? Yes. Thank you, Tazeen. Thanks for your very warm comments. And you're going to love working with Yvonne. She is nothing short of terrific. I wouldn't be staying on the Scientific Advisory Board because I cannot do anything other than love the science of Alnylam and can't wait to continue to be involved with the great science and progress that we're making here in the company. As you can imagine, being on boards for a former CEO is always a complicated thing. And I just think it's a lot better for Yvonne if I'm not on the board and I just focus on the science which I'll do and I'll torture Akshay instead, leave Yvonne in good place. But no, it's a decision that I made because I think it's very difficult for former CEOs to stay on boards. And obviously, I will participate in the company on the Scientific Advisory Board. But Akshay, do you want to comment on KARDIA? I think so. Thanks, Tazeen. Does that answer your question? Questions? So Ted, you were coming in and out which asset with Regeneron specifically? APP, fantastic. Okay. Yes. No, I mean, let me just start by saying one of the really exciting next frontiers for Alnylam is the broader extrahepatic delivery opportunities. And you'll hear a lot about that at our upcoming R&D Day and I think you're going to be really pleased with what you hear. And of course, the program that's pushing that frontier is ALN-APP which targets amyloid precursor protein. And we are really excited that the IND should be filed or CTA in this case will be filed by the end of the year and we do expect to have human data next year from that program which will be really important because if we can reproduce the 70%, 80% lowering of APP and Abeta fragments that we have observed so durably in the primate that would be a major milestone for the entire field and frankly, for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in the future. So we really look forward to that. Now specifically on the development plans, maybe I can point it over to Pushkal to maybe make some high-level comments. Pushkal? Does that answer your question, Ted? Yes. Well, let me have Pushkal answer the APOLLO-B question and then Akshay can answer the APP question. But let me just start, Salveen, first of all, by thanking you for your comments at the beginning, of course but also just reminding you that, obviously, in the design both the HELIOS-B and APOLLO-B study. We come at this with enormous experience in doing clinical studies in ATTR amyloidosis. And we come at this, of course, with a very solid track record, as you know, from our overall clinical development team and designing very robust, typically highly overpowered studies, I might say, as you can note from our traditional P values. So with that as background, Pushkal, do you want to answer Salveen's specific question? Great. Thank you, Pushkal. Akshay, the question on APP? Paul, thanks for the question and your kind words at the beginning. And let me try to be really clear. This was my decision. I want to begin a new chapter. I've been running this company for 19 years, came here when there were 6 employees as the founding CEO, $17.5 million post-money valuation and took it to $25 billion and obviously, 1,600 employees in 20 countries around the world. And four approved medicines. So after a 19-year tenure like that, it's not unreasonable to say, \"Okay, things are really good. Things are going great, might want to not be a running CEO for the next 19 years.\" And in terms of timing, yes, I could have waited until next year, I could have waited until two years. I could have waited until 30 years but I'd probably be dead. So at some point, you just got to make the call about when to make a transition. And I couldn't be more excited about where the company is right now. And I couldn't be more excited about the fact that Yvonne is here as my successor. I mean if I waited for a year and Yvonne got lured to go someplace else, I'd have no successor. So I have to keep kicking the can down the road. So the bottom line is this is the right time. There's never a great time, of course but I think this is the right time. And in terms of value creation, I'm still a major shareholder of the company. And I want to stay a major shareholder of the company. And I'm obviously going to benefit from the very, in my view, very likely outcome of APOLLO-B which I think will be a very defining event for the company. Does that answer your question? I don't know, Yvonne, if you want to say something? I mean, absolutely, Paul. I mean, we have a very committed team of leaders here in the company. And I have no reason to believe that any changes are going to happen. But we also have a really strong bench. We have a strong group of people that are right underneath these leaders that we have right now. And so we are in a very, very strong position as a result of all that. And I have every confidence that this company will continue to perform unbelievably well for the future. No doubt about it in my mind. All right. I'm in. I'm in. Okay. Great. So let me have Akshay answer. You asked the question about differentiation as well. So I'm going to have Tolga way out of that, part of it. Let me start though with Akshay commenting on the -- without getting into trouble with ACC if that's where we present it. So Akshay, go ahead. And Tolga, do you want to comment a little bit. Sorry, go ahead, Ritu. And Tolga, do you want to comment a little bit on Ritu's question around the potential differentiation of these data as it relates to the competitive landscape and so forth? Thanks, Anupam and I will miss you in January but I'll perhaps be the audience watching Yvonne. But getting back to your question on differentiation and specifically the question on how does it all play out, I'll let Tolga answer in just a minute. But let me just start by saying that obviously, if we generate positive results out of APOLLO-B and if the drug is approved for the wild-type and hereditary ATTR cardiomyopathy segment, those are, of course, important ifs. We think that the profile of a TTR silencer, the mechanism of action of a TTR silencer will be a valued part of the treatment options that are available for patients with this disease. And we certainly believe, based on market research we've done that Tolga can comment on, that, that type of availability certainly for patients that may be progressing in their ongoing treatment with a stabilizer drug if they're on a stabilizer drug. That type of treatment option may be important for the patients, again, assuming positive APOLLO-B data and positive approval. So that's at least the foundational aspect of it. Tolga, do you want to add anything more to that as well? Yes. Pushkal, do you want to comment? Does that answer your question, Anupam. Well, it's a terrific question, Alethia. And you've always been such a great covering analyst, so it's wonderful to have been one of the first companies you've covered. But I think your questions are really terrific one for Yvonne. So I going to just pass it right over to her. Does that answer your question, Alethia? Well, let me give some context and then maybe, Akshay, you can comment on it. I mean revusiran, of course, is a completely different animal, early generation STC, GalNAc conjugate, poorly stable, not very stable, required extremely high doses and turned out to be not well-tolerated in the frail patient population. And obviously, that program was discontinued. I think the big difference between the subcu delivered Vutrisiran versus the IV-infused ONPATTRO really comes down to the type of administration that's involved. If you look at subcu injection, we see a low incidence of mild-to-moderate, generally always reversible type of injection site reactions with subcu delivered Vutrisiran. With intravenously administered ONPATTRO, we see a low incidence, roughly 50-or-so percent of infusion-related reactions which are not uncommon with IV infused drugs as well. And so I think that's really the biggest difference between them. Of course, Vutrisiran also does not require pre-medication which is a nice feature around Vutrisiran as well. And so in general, I think those are the main differences. Akshay, do you want to comment any further? Yes. And I would just add to wrap it up, that that obviously both Vutrisiran and ONPATTRO, well, in the case of ONPATTRO, we also have post-marketing data and we are encouraged by the very consistent post-marketing data as it relates to the study results that we saw in APOLLO. But then in terms of ongoing clinical studies for both patisiran and Vutrisiran in the cardiomyopathy study, the APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B studies, we have data safety monitoring boards that review the unblinded safety data quarterly. And so far, so good in terms of any externally support for continuing to move forward. So that's the landscape, David. We've learned a lot over the years in terms of how to make these molecules better and better. And I think knock on wood, so far so good in terms of how that's played out. Maybe, Tolga and Jeff can take that on. Tolga, do you want to start? All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining on this call. This is my last one at Alnylam. I want to thank all of you for the support over the last 19 years. We've built a remarkable company that's absolutely here to last. And our next chapter has so much promise for patients and our broader stakeholders. Thank you. Have a great day."

            "content": "Thanks, Akshay and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting Alnylam's Q3 2021 financial results which reflect another quarter of progress on our journey towards building a self-sustainable financial profile aligned with our P5x25 goals. Turning to our results first for ONPATTRO. We generated $120.3 million in net revenue for the quarter representing 6% growth from the second quarter of 2021 and 46% growth compared with Q3 2020. U.S. ONPATTRO sales decreased 2% versus Q2 2021 and were impacted by the following: demand growth was 12%, consistent with Q2, primarily driven by an increase in patients on therapy and greater than 90% patient treatment compliance. Demand growth was offset by inventory destocking in Q3 compared with stocking in Q2, representing an approximate 10% headwind to reported Q3 growth and higher gross-to-net deductions which negatively impacted reported Q3 growth by approximately 3%. In our international markets, ONPATTRO performance remained strong with growth of 12% versus Q2 2021, primarily driven by increased patient demand broadly across markets in Europe, Canada and Japan. Turning to our results for GIVLAARI. We generated $31.8 million in net revenue in Q3 representing 4% growth compared to the second quarter of 2021 and 91% growth versus Q3 2020. U.S. GIVLAARI sales were flat versus Q2 2021 and were impacted by the following: demand growth was 9%, primarily due to an increased patients on therapy and greater than 90% patient treatment compliance. Demand growth was offset by inventory destocking in Q3 compared with stocking in Q2, negatively impacting Q3 reported growth by approximately 8%. With OXLUMO, we generated $14.9 million in net revenue in the quarter, representing a 9% decrease compared with Q2. As Tolga previously mentioned, despite patient growth of approximately 25% in the quarter, sales decreased due to the transition of the initial bolus of commercial patients from monthly loading dose to quarterly maintenance dose regimens. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter with the following highlights: total combined product sales in the second quarter were $167 million, representing 68% growth versus Q3 2020. Net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was $20.1 million, a decrease from Q3 last year, primarily due to less revenue recognized from our collaboration with Vir. Our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for the quarter increased 12% versus Q3 2020. Key drivers of the increase continued to be additional R&D investment in advancing our early, mid and late-stage pipeline programs and increased SG&A investment to support our three commercial brands, including the launch of OXLUMO. Non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter decreased by approximately $20 million versus the same period in 2020, driven by strong top line growth and more moderate growth in operating expenses, continuing our progress towards achieving profitability. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $2.3 billion as of September 30, 2021, compared to $1.9 billion as of December 30, 2020. Notably, the third quarter included the second $500 million payment from Blackstone for the monetization of 50% of inclisiran royalties. Lastly, turning to our full year 2021 financial guidance. We are reiterating our guidance for combined product sales, $640 million to $665 million; for net revenue from collaborations and royalties, $150 million to $200 million; and for non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses, $1.175 billion to $1.275 billion. Let me now turn to a review of upcoming milestones. We are very excited about the positive 18-month data from HELIOS-A for hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy and plan to present the full results at a medical conference in early 2022. With zilebesiran, as Akshay mentioned, we plan to present additional data from the Phase I study at the AHA meeting later this month and plan to initiate the KARDIA-2 Phase II combination study later this year as well. From lumasiran, we plan to initiate a Phase II study for renal stone events in late 2021. This Phase II study will be important for life cycle management of OXLUMO with the potential to enable a Phase III trial to significantly expand the overall opportunity. We also intend to submit supplemental regulatory filings with the FDA and the EMA in late 2021, based on the results from the ILLUMINATE-C study with the goal of strengthening the labeling supporting OXLUMO. Turning to cemdisiran for complement-mediated diseases. Our partner, Regeneron, plans to initiate a Phase III study of cemdisiran and pozelimab combination and myasthenia gravis. With ALN-HSD, as Akshay mentioned, we expect to report initial safety results in healthy volunteers from the Phase I study at our upcoming R&D Day. We're very excited to file our first CNS CTA for ALN-APP in late 2021 setting us up for potential initial clinical proof-of-concept data in late 2022. And as another step toward expanding our prevalent disease opportunities, we plan to advance ALN-XDH in development for the treatment of gout toward a CTA filing in late 2021. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? The one thing I'd add just on top of that is, I think it's the scale of the opportunity grows, some of the noise that you see from these dynamics will dissipate."

            "content": "Thanks, Tolga and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis where we're advancing two clinical stage product candidates, patisiran and Vutrisiran. Whilst ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat the  hATTR amyloidosis, we're committed to expanding the product's label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end, we're conducting the APOLLO-B Phase III study which is fully enrolled with over 300 patients and where we expect to report top line results in mid-2022. We're also advancing Vutrisiran which is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection and is also in development for ATTR amyloidosis. Here, we're conducting two Phase III studies. The first is HELIOS-A, evaluating Vutrisiran in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. Earlier this year, we presented positive 9-month results from the study which showed that the study met its primary and secondary end points at nine months. These data form the basis for our regulatory submissions to both the FDA and EMA. The FDA has accepted the submission and has signed a PDUFA date to Vutrisiran of April 14, 2022 and the EMA has validated our MAA submission. Patient dosing in HELIOS-A continued past the 9-month mark. And yesterday, we are happy to report positive top line results from the 18-month time point of the HELIOS-A study which I will now review. Please note that we plan to present the full 18-month results from the study at a medical congress in early 2022 and as such, we'll need to limit our discussion to the top line results only. These results mark an important step in bringing Vutrisiran a low dose once quarterly and potentially biannual subcutaneously administered therapy to patients living with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and as well as progressing our efforts to build an industry-leading franchise of medicines for the treatment of these patients. As a reminder, HELIOS-A is a randomized open-label study in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The study enrolled 164 patients who were randomized 3:1 to receive Vutrisiran at a dose of 25 milligrams administered subcutaneously once every three months or patisiran administered intravenously once every three weeks at a dose of 0.3 mg per kg. The primary endpoint was measured at nine months and was the change from baseline in the mNIS+7 neuropathy impairment score as compared to the external placebo group from the APOLLO Phase III study. We're delighted to report today that the HELIOS-A met all secondary endpoints measured at 18 months, including statistically significant improvements in progression of neuropathy as measured by the mNIS+7 score, quality of life, gate speed, nutritional status and overall disability relative to the placebo data from the APOLLO Phase III study of Vutrisiran. The final secondary endpoint, reduction in serum TTRF levels with Vutrisiran demonstrated non-inferiority relative to the within-study patisiran arm as expected. These results build on the positive 9-month Vutrisiran data we shared earlier this year and demonstrated that the reduction of neurological improvement and improvement in quality of life in patients with hATTR amyloidosis seen at nine months is maintained at 18 months. Furthermore, at 18 months, Vutrisiran treated patients showed quantitative improvement across a variety of exploratory endpoints evaluated in both the intent-to-treat population as well as a prespecified cardiac subpopulation. Improvements were seen in a number of exploratory endpoints, including the biomarker NT-proBNP, a measure of cardiac stress and certain echocardiographic parameters relative to the external placebo group. Other echocardiographic endpoints showed trends toward improvement but did not reach significance due to the small sample size. Finally, in a cohort of 48 patients, treatment with Vutrisiran was associated with an improvement in technetium uptake that is reduced tracer uptake in the heart relative to baseline in a majority of patients. This is the largest study conducted to date using imaging to characterize the impact of a TTR silencer on cardiac amyloid. Whilst it's important to recognize that these are exploratory data, that these patients have predominantly polyneuropathy, we believe these results are very encouraging with respect to providing potential evidence for reduced cardiac amyloid burden with Vutrisiran treatment. Vutrisiran's potential impact on cardiac manifestations of the disease is currently being studied in the HELIOS-B trial. Let's now review the safety results during the 18-month treatment period. Vutrisiran demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile. Study discontinuations occurred in three patients or 2.5% and were due to adverse events in the Vutrisiran arm by month 18. The single new discontinuation since month nine was in an event of cardiac failure considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator. By month 18, there were two deaths, neither of which were considered related to study drug. There were two serious adverse events deemed related to Vutrisiran by the study investigator consisting of dyslipidemia and a urinary tract infection. Deaths and related SAEs all occurred by month nine and have been previously reported. Treatment emergent adverse events occurring 10% or more of patients included 4, diarrhea, pain in extremity, peripheral edema, arthralgia, dizziness, urinary tract infections with the exception of pain in extremity and arthralgia, each of these events occurred at a similar or lower rate as compared with the external placebo. Injection site reactions were reported in 5 patients or 4.1% and were all mild and transient. There were no hepatic safety concerns. In summary, Vutrisiran has demonstrated an encouraging efficacy and safety profile in HELIOS-A through 18 months. Moreover, within the realm of reproducing clinical trial data, we're delighted to see the extent to which HELIOS-A results with Vutrisiran recapitulate the APOLLO data with patisiran. As previously noted, the other Phase III Vutrisiran study is HELIOS-B which is our ongoing Phase III cardiac outcome study with Vutrisiran in hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy. We were excited in the third quarter to complete enrollment in the study with over 600 patients, well ahead of schedule due to strong enrollment demand. Beyond patisiran and Vutrisiran, the newest addition to our ATTR amyloidosis franchise is the preclinical program, ALN-TTRsc04. Using our IKARIA platform, we've generated a new TTR targeting siRNA, ALN-TTRsc04 that we believe could support an annual dosing regimen with greater than 90% TTR knockdown. ALN-TTRsc04 is planned to enter clinical development with an IND filing at or around year-end 2022. Let's now move on to lumasiran. Our RNAi therapeutic approved late last year in the EU and U.S. as the first treatment for primary hyperoxaluria type one or PH1. In the third quarter, we were pleased to announce positive top line results from the ILLUMINATE-C Phase III study of lumasiran and we announced today that we plan to present full results from the study at the American Society of Nephrology meeting being held next week. We also now intend to submit supplemental regulatory filings with the FDA and EMA in late 2021, with the goal of further strengthening the labeling supporting OXLUMO. We're also excited about the potential of lumasiran for patients with recurrent renal stones and later this year, we plan to start a Phase II trial to evaluate that potential. Now in addition to our late-stage programs, we believe we're also making great progress with our early and mid-stage programs. Whilst I can't cover all these programs due to limited time today, one of the exciting parts of our story is the expansion of RNAi therapeutics beyond rare diseases into prevalent disease opportunities. Our program for high potential is a great example. Zilebesiran, formerly known as ALN-AGT is our investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the genetically validated target angiotensinogen in development for the treatment of hypertension. We look forward to presenting additional clinical results from the Phase I study at the American Heart Association meeting later this month, including in patients on a low-salt diet and in patients receiving co-administration with the conventional RAAS inhibitor, irbesartan. We also recently initiated our KARDIA Phase II program with zilebesiran. The first of the two studies, KARDIA-1 is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran as a monotherapy in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. This study is currently enrolling patients. In late 2021, we plan on initiating KARDIA-2 which is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran as add-on therapy in patients with hypertension despite treatment with standard of care. We also continue to harness our organic product engine with the goal of achieving sustainable innovation with two to four INDs per year. To this end, we're on track to file a CTA for ALN-XDH in development for the treatment of gout in late 2021. We're also on track to file a CTA for ALN-XDH in development for the treatment of gout in late 2021. We're also on track to file a CTA for ALN-APP in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy late 2021. We're very excited about our APP program as it's the first investigational RNAi therapeutic for our CNS platform which was also a feature at the OTS Meeting this past month. We believe that our initial human data for ALN-APP expected next year, if positive, could open the frontiers of RNAi therapeutics for many CNS diseases and also herald with potential growth of our broader extrahepatic efforts. Now in closing and on a personal note, John, thank you for your remarkable leadership over the last 19 years, as Alnylam built a whole new class of medicines, RNAi therapeutics. It has been my great privilege to work with you. You will leave us in a remarkably strong position as we build towards P5x25 and beyond, my friend. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff. Jeff? Yes. Maury, obviously, the current data now with Vutrisiran only further strengthen our belief in the drug, the data look outstanding in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. These new exploratory data with the cardiac endpoints are extremely encouraging. We're very excited about the technetium scan observations that show reduced uptake of the technetium. And in addition to the previously reported finding at nine months which we see again an 18 months improvement, in proBNP, improvement in aspects to the echocardiogram and these new -- the technetium data, I think this all bodes well for the performance of Vutrisiran in HELIOS-B and strengthens our hypothesis that TTR lowering is an important way to address TTR-related cardiac disorders. And so our confidence in APOLLO-B, of course, also goes up significantly because of these observations. So I'll stop there and happy to take any other questions. Yes. So with respect to HELIOS-A, we'll present the full data, Gena, at an upcoming medical meeting. But suffice it to say, the vast majority of patients would have New York Heart Association one or two level disease. With respect to APOLLO-B and tafamidis, Pushkal Garg is with us. Pushkal, do you want to comment on that? Yes, KARDIA-1 enrollment is going well. Generally speaking, Tazeen, we let the trial progress and we have clear line of sight on the last patient in before we give further guidance. But it's going very well. I mean this is hypertension as also there are 1.2 billion patients around the world. So it's an eminently enrollable study and it is going well. Yes. So we're very excited about CNS delivery approaches we have in hand, we shared at OTS that we've got a novel conjugate that's a lipid-based system, C16. And we've shown reproducibly, both in small animals, rodents and in nonhuman primates that we get widespread delivery in the central nervous system with potent knockdown, 80% or greater durable knockdown of up to a year and against multiple targets. And these targets we've looked at cell-specific markets, so we know we get knockdown in all the major cell types in the nervous system, the neuron, the ascites microglial cells. And anatomically, the  looks very encouraging indeed with knockdown in deep brain structures which I know has been a challenge for other modalities, cortical structures, cerebella structures in the spinal cord. So with that kind of preclinical pharmacology package, one has to be excited and therefore the ALN-APP program which we discussed just a few minutes ago, really is in the vanguard of what's to come and we look forward to exciting data from that program in 2022 with biomarker lockdown, hopefully. Yes, Ritu, we will have to wait for the full data to share in more detail. But at a high level, what I would say is, this is a -- there's the metric evaluation tool where you look at the extent of tracer uptake into the heart and what we've done in a significant number of -- actually, the largest number of patients in the study of this kind of ever looked at pre and post-treatment and we're very encouraged by the fact that the majority show reduction in tracer uptake with technetium. Now that's not a clinically approvable endpoint today. What we know scientifically is that we're encouraged by this because the data would suggest that this could be potential evidence for reduction in cardiac amyloid and that, of course, would be very exciting. So we'll share the full data set with you in due course. But the data can only be supportive and encouraging of what's to come in APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B and our overall belief that reduction of TTR levels with our drugs, patisiran and lumasiran hopefully, will convert significant clinical benefit for patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy. Yes. The technetium is an optional assessment in that. Not all patients will have it and of course, the availability will vary at sites around the world. But yes, there'll be some technetium data. More importantly, I think in those studies, Ritu will be the clinical endpoints, of course, right which 6-minute-walk distance for APOLLO-B and mortality and hospitalization for Helios-B. By the way, just to keep the record straight, I was referring to HELIOS-B, not APOLLO-B. So sorry about the subcutaneous one. No, I think you covered it well, John. I would just add that the safety profile of Vutrisiran looks extremely encouraging on its face and comparing to the placebo data from APOLLO. And just as one marker of that, I would say, in a 3-study discontinuations, in a study of this length with over 120, 130 patients on Vutrisiran is pretty remarkable. I mean these are very frail, sick patients. And with the encouraging efficacy data we've discussed today. I think that all adds to a very encouraging benefit/risk profile. Of course, we'll submit these data to regulators and they have the final judgment but we're certainly very encouraged by the overall profile of this drug."

John?\nJohn Maraganore: Thanks, Christine, and thank you everyone for joining the call today. In the second quarter and recent period, we made tremendous progress bringing RNAi therapeutics to patients around the world with our commercial, medical and R&D efforts while delivering solid financial performance. To start, our teams delivered steady ongoing commercial execution and continued revenue growth, including 12% quarterly growth for ONPATTRO strengthening of GIVLAARI performance and the continued impressive uptake for OXLUMO. On our pipeline efforts, highlights include excellent progress building our ATTR Amyloidosis franchise. We completed enrollment in the APOLLO -B Phase 3 study of Patisiran and expect to complete enrollment in the HELIOS-B, Phase study of Patisiran within the next two weeks, significantly ahead of schedule, and already with more than 600 patients enrolled.\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks John, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our second quarter performance. For, ONPATTRO, we achieve $114 million in global net product revenues, representing approximately 12% quarter-on-quarter growth compared with the first quarter. We ended the quarter with over 1,725 patients on commercial treatments. In the US, we continue to see strength on many fronts, including 12% growth in demand and notable growth in new prescribers. We have also seen encouraging signs of the healthcare system reopening. For example, in the second quarter, we received more stock forms for ONPATTRO in the US than we have since early 2019. We're also seeing an uptick in face-to-face interactions between our field team and healthcare professionals, which is an indicator that the healthcare system is continuing to open up. Further, speed to patient diagnosis is continuing to improve with ongoing growth in the use of QRT scans, which is often the start of the patient journey toward a polyneuropathy diagnosis. Patient compliance also remains high and stable at pre COVID levels. And we continue to observe a trend and concomitant use of ONPATTRO to treat the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis, along with the use of hATTR stabilizer to treat the cardiomyopathy of this disease in mixed genotype patients. With regard to the rest of the world, market access has now been achieved in over 30 countries worldwide. In Q2, we saw significant 17% quarter-on-quarter growth in our rest of world markets, with particular strength in Europe and Canada. We're also observing a good balance of first line use and switches from stabilizers in these markets.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Thanks Tolga, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we're advancing two clinical stage product candidates, Patisiran and Vutrisiran. Also, ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat the polyneuropathy associated with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. We're committed to expanding the products labeled for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end, we're conducting the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study. During the second quarter we completed enrollment in APOLLO-B and expect to report top line results in mid 2022. We are also advancing Vutrisiran and investigational therapy, which is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection and is also in development for ATTR amyloidosis. Here, we're conducting two Phase 3 studies. The first is HELIOS-A evaluating Vutrisiran and hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. At the AAN conference in April, we presented our positive nine months HELIOS-A results. Based on those results, we submitted our NDA to the FDA, which was accepted and signed the PDUFA date of April 14, 2022. Patient dosing continues in HELIOS-A and we look forward to reporting top line results from the 18 month endpoint in late 2021, which will also further characterize Vutrisiran impact on the exploratory cardiac endpoints. We plan to make additional regulatory submissions including in the EU in the late 2021 period based on the HELIOS-A results. The other Phase 3 Vutrisiran study is HELIOS-B, which is our ongoing Phase 3 cardiac outcomes study with Vutrisiran in hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. We're excited to have announced this morning but due to high interest amongst physicians and patients, we now expect to complete enrollment within the next two weeks well ahead of schedule. And with more than 600 patients randomized to date. HELIOS-BI has a 30 month endpoint of all cause mortality and CV events. And we can now expect the full results in early 2024. The study design includes the potential for an interim analysis and we'll consider these following results from APOLLO-B in alignment with regulatory authorities. Lastly, for Vutrisiran, we're very excited about the potential opportunity for biannual dosing regimen, which could further differentiate Vutrisiran from other products and provide yet another dosing regimen option for patients. \nJeff Poulton: Thanks Akshay, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting Alnylam's Q2 2021 financial results, which reflect another strong quarter of operational excellence across the business. Turning to our results first for ONPATTRO, we generated $113.8 million in net revenue for the quarter, representing 12% growth from the first quarter of 2021 and 71% growth compared with Q2 2020. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of double digit quarter-on-quarter growth following one quarter of flattened growth that we experienced during the onset of the pandemic in Q2 of last year. US ONPATTRO sales increased 6% versus Q1 2021. And we're primarily impacted by the following. An approximate 12% increase in demand, representing acceleration from the 4% demand growth delivered in Q1 with the increase driven by the addition of new patients on therapy and continuation of greater than 90% patient treatment compliance. Demand growth was offset by a higher level of gross to net deductions and less inventory stocking in the quarter compared with Q1, 2021. In our international markets, ONPATTRO performance remains very strong with growth of 17% versus Q1 2021 and 79% versus Q2 2020, primarily driven by increased patient demand broadly across our markets in Europe and Canada. Sales from our international markets comprise 54% of our global total in Q2, clearly reflecting the benefit of our global commercial footprint. Turning to our results for GIVLAARI; we generated $30.6 million in net revenue in Q2, representing 24% growth compared to the first quarter of 2021, driven by ongoing launches in the US and Europe. Reported results in the US in particular improve during the quarter with quarter-on-quarter growth of 26% compared to 6% quarter-on-quarter growth in Q1, as we benefited from improved patient flow through the US healthcare system. With OXLUMO, we had an excellent second full quarter of sales, generating $16.3 million in net revenue in a quarter up from $9.1 million in Q1 with growth contributions from both US and rest of world markets. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter. Total combined product sales in the second quarter were $160.8 million, representing 107% growth versus Q2 2020. Net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was $59.4 million, a significant increase from Q2 last year, primarily due to revenue recognized from our Regeneron collaboration. We recognize $0.3 million in royalty revenues during the quarter, representing our initial recognition of royalties earned on Novartis as sales of Leqvio. Gross margin on total revenues was 82.4% for the quarter, a slight improvement from prior year. Our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for the quarter increased 19% versus Q2 2020. Key drivers of the increased continue to be additional R&D investment in advancing our late stage pipeline programs and increased SG&A investment to support our free commercial brands, including the launch of OXLUMO. Also recall that last year in Q2 operating expenses were at the lowest quarterly level in 2020 and were impacted by the onset of the pandemic. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter decreased by approximately $51 million versus the same period in 2020, driven by strong top line growth and more moderate growth in operating expenses. Q2 also represents the sixth consecutive quarter that we've delivered an improvement in our non-GAAP operating loss. And we believe this clearly signals the path we are on towards profitability. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2021, compared to $1.87 billion as of December 30, 2020, with the increase primarily due to the second drawdown of our credit facility with Blackstone, which occurred during Q2, and cash received from the exercise and employee equity awards and purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan, offset by cash used in our operations to support overall growth. Lastly, turning to our financial guidance. We believe our results for the second quarter continue to demonstrate successful commercial execution. As a result of the strength of our first half 2021 results, we are increasing our full year 2021 combined net product revenue guidance from $610 million to $660 million to $640 million to $665 million, representing a 3% increase from the midpoint of the prior range to the midpoint of the new range. Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties, and for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses remain unchanged. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Yvonne to review our upcoming milestones, Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks Jeff, and hello, everyone. Let me start by reviewing an exciting partnership we announced with PeptiDream, PeptiDream is an industry leader in the discovery and optimization of peptide ligands against a wide variety of receptors. Through this collaboration, we and PeptiDream will discover and develop peptide-siRNA conjugates to create multiple opportunities to deliver RNAi therapeutics to tissues outside the liver. The collaboration has the potential to have multiple training opportunities by targeting disease causing mRNA strong scripts and a wide variety of tissue types. Let me now turn to a review of remaining goals to 2021. ONPATTRO within our TTR programs, we plan to present 18 month top line results from HELIOS-A Phase 3 study with Vutrisiran. We also plan additional regulatory submissions for Vutrisiran in the EU, Japan and Brazil in late 2021. Based on the excellent progress and enrollment, we also plan to complete enrollment in HELIOS-B in the coming weeks as we announced today. With Zilebesiran as Akshay mentioned, we plan to present additional data from the Phase 1 study later this year, hopefully at the American Heart meeting in November, pending abstract acceptance and plan to initiate the KARDIA-2 Phase 2 combination study later this year as well. For Lumasiran, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 study for renal stone events in late 2021. We believe this Phase 2 study represents meaningful Lifecycle Management of OXLUMO with a potential to significantly expand the overall opportunity. We also plan to submit supplemental regulatory applications in both the US and EU based on the ILLUMINATE-C results. With ALN-HSD, we expect to report initial Phase 2 results of healthy volunteers from the Phase 1 study. Turning to cemdisiran for complement mediated diseases, our partner Regeneron plans to initiate a Phase 3 study of cemdisiran and pozelimab combination in myasthenia gravis. In addition to multiple Phase 2 studies in PNH. We believe the combination of cemdisiran and pozelimab represents an attractive therapeutic strategy for complements mediated diseases. We're very excited to file our first CNS CTA for ALN-APP now expected in late 2021 in development for the treatment of autism or dominant Alzheimer disease, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. This sets us up for potential initial PSC data in 2022. And given the exciting preclinical progress, we plan to advance ALN-XDH in development for the treatment of gout toward a CTA filing in late 2021. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Yvonne. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. \nOperator:  Our first question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays.\nGenaWang: Thank you for taking my question and also congrats on the very strong quarter. So I have a one big picture question, Alnylam has been very successful as a standalone company with established platform, several approved drugs, and also numerous high quality pipeline assets. So just wondering going forward, are you willing to be under a bigger umbrella? Or do you want to continue being a standalone company and to grow into top five Biotech Company as your goal?\nJohnMaraganore: Hi, Gena. Thank you, first of all, for your comments on the quarter. And thank you for your comments on what we've been able to achieve as a company. And I think it's fair to say that we believe that we have a path forward as a company to build significant value. It's very evident in the P5x25, five year goals and plans that we outlined earlier this year, as to how we believe that we can build a top five biotech company in market cap over the next five year period, by execution with our organic product engine and our capabilities to achieve sustainable innovation. So it's certainly our plan to continue on that path. But of course, we have a fiduciary duty to shareholders. And obviously, we'll always consider that component of how we have an obligation to our shareholders. But our plans right now are very focused on our P5x25 goals and our abilities to execute continuously on that sustainable source of innovation. So that's how we're focused, Gena.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nAlethiaYoung: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. You guys crushed at this quarter. I guess I wanted -- it's another kind of big picture. But just wanting to talk a little bit about as you started to do bigger programs like in hypertension, even ones beyond as you build up your business? Like, how do you kind of think about the balancing act of making that investment and kind of the commitment to profitability? Because I mean, some of these programs are pretty big opportunities. So I know I just wanted to kind of flavor wouldn't you go out alone? Or do you think that these are opportunities for potential partnership thing?\nJohnMaraganore: Yes, well, first of all, thanks, Alethia for the comments on the quarter. We're really pleased with the results, obviously. And it's a real credit to our overall organization for delivering as they did. Look, we're very excited about the opportunities for RNAi therapeutics in more prevalent diseases. I think the data with cemdisiran really points to the ability to reimagine the treatment of hypertension, a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality around the world. So, I mean, how can you not get excited about transformational medicines that can make a fundamental impact on a major issue of public health, globally, with the potential obviously, over time to help many, many people. So we're very excited about that direction, there's really no reason why we aren't able to advance these assets on our own. We have a great team; we have a proven track record of execution on the R&D side. And there's simply no reason why we have any need for capabilities or even funding from third party partners. But obviously, we also want to make sure that we navigate our path toward a sustainable and ultimately profitable business in a responsible manner. So we are very thoughtful about how we balance our OpEx investments, along with the growth in our revenues toward a sustainable, financially sustainable, self sustainable profile. And so that is a core part of our strategy. Let me with those intros, let me first start with Jeff, and then transfer over to Yvonne, to comment a little bit more about our sort of going forward views. But Jeff, do you want to talk first on the financials, and then upon a little bit about our perspectives on growth in the prevalent disease markets?\nJeffPoulton: Yes, I think I agree with everything you said, John, and one of the metrics P5x25 goals is getting to profitability across the period and we're committed to doing that. I think the one other comments that I would make as it relates to cemdisiran is from a commercial standpoint, our hope is that we'll be able to leverage infrastructure that hopefully we will have built by then from a perspective of supporting an expansion of the TTR franchise for successful in the APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B studies to get into a larger sort of cardiomyopathy footprint. So that's one factor as well. \nJohnMaraganore: And Yvonne, do you want to comment a little bit more strategically going forward? How we think through this?\nYvonneGreenstreet: No, I think actually, both of you have covered this well. We believe we're a unique company. And we have every intention of building a top five bar tech. And we have every intention of progressing all of our opportunities, obviously, in a thoughtful fashion. \nJohnMaraganore: Is that answered your questions, Alethia? \nOperator: Our next question comes from Maury Raycroft with Jefferies.\nMauryRaycroft: Hi, good morning, everyone. Congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can talk about the parallels between zilebesiran and inclisiran. And then investors should be thinking about? And is there anything additional, you could say about the KARDIA-2 design including whether it's going to be dosing every three months or six months? And lastly, if you can provide any perspective into what timeline look like for both KARDIA-1 and 2?\nJohnMaraganore: Fantastic. Let me start my comments. And then maybe Akshay, you can chime in here on some more of the specifics on the KARDIA program, and the dosing regimen. For starters, I mean, look, we're very, again, very excited about zilebesiran and its potential to reimagine the treatment of hypertension. And you are very right, Maury, to point to the analogy with inclisiran, because both siRNA are designed to address very prevalent -- both very prevalent diseases, one is in hypercholesterolemia with inclisiran the other hypertension with zilebesiran. And both, of course, enable a very infrequent dose regimen to control these leading causes of CV morbidity, mortality in both cases, right with HDL and LDL, I'd say from a development program standpoint was attractive, strategically about both efforts is that the biomarker or the clinical marker that we're measuring in our Phase 2 studies and our Phase 2 studies, in the cases, zilebesiran blood pressure. And in the case of inclisiran LDL cholesterol, those are the exact same endpoints that will be used in our Phase 3 trials, in support of an approval. And so it is attractive that we have completely de-risked the primary endpoint of what will ultimately be a Phase 3 with zilebesiran. And that's a very analogous situation to what we have with inclisiran in the setting of hypercholesterolemia, so very attractive profile. And, of course we're very, very encouraged by the safety profile that we saw with inclisiran and 1000s of patients that we're studying. And we're obviously aiming to achieve similar results with zilebesiran, as we do further studies with that agent. So at a high strategic level, that is -- those are some of the reasons why there are a lot of analogies between inclisiran and zilebesiran.  So with that, Akshay, maybe you can talk a little bit about more of the KARDIA program, some of the timelines there, as well as some of the dosing approaches through three months or six months like. So Akshay, take it away.\nAkshayVaishnaw: Yes, thanks, John. So, Maury, zilebesiran we will execute two Phase 2 studies, KARDIA-1 is looking at zilebesiran as mono therapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. About just shy of 400 patients here in 75 or so in that study, orthodox randomized control study. And that'll be -- that study is up and running that we complemented by KARDIA-2 which will kick off in the months to come later this year. And then we'll evaluate in KARDIA-2, the combination of zilebesiran with other antihypertensive medications and of course, that will include Ras inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and more details to come. That study will be larger, about 650 patients also we're not guiding right now as to the exact completion date of both studies. They're just getting going. As I said, and more details to come later in the year, as recruitment ramps up, but this is hypertension. So we're anticipating enrollment will go relatively quickly. And so we're looking forward to an exciting outcome building on the very promising data from the Phase 1 that John has already commented on. With reference to dose and regimen there'll be a spectrum of doses evaluated, again, more details to follow. But I can reiterate that we'll be looking at both three and six monthly dosing regimens in these studies. And so we'll have a comprehensive look at the pharmacology of the drugs and put us in a good position to select the right dose and regimen for the development in Phase 3. So I hope that's helpful, Maury.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.\nSalveenRichter: Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Given your agreement with PeptiDream, could you just talk about extrahepatic targets that you're or tissues that you're looking to target beyond CNS?\nJohnMaraganore: Yes, thanks, Salveen. Let me start and then I'll hand it over to Akshay to talk a little bit further. We're obviously very excited about the agreement that we formed last week with PeptiDream, as Yvonne said in her remarks, PeptiDream is really a leading company in peptide design and synthesis. And obviously, working with them is part of our continued investment in extrahepatic delivery, where we've already been very successful in CNS and ocular. So we're very excited about that. So Akshay, do you want to talk a little bit about how we look at the future of extrahepatic delivery and tissues of interest?\nAkshayVaishnaw: Yes, so, Salveen, of course, we're interested in a range of organs with several reasons; one is that RNAi as a pharmacologic activity can be conducted in any tissue in any cell in the body. So we can take a siRNA to any cell type, and expect to see targets knocked down, and we can say that with confidence. And if you combine that with the possibility that they're genetically validated, and ontologically, validated targets in many, many different tissues, we've got broader ambitions with PeptiDream beyond the liver. So of course, we already in the CNS ANI that we have several options there in terms of the kinds of conjugates we've built. I'm sure we can add to those with PeptiDream and then there'll be new tissues you'll be hearing about from us. But you can remain confident that this collaboration is being conducted to really maintain and extend our leadership position RNAi. And we believe that by the end of the decade, we'll see RNAi in many, many different tissues beyond the liver, and approved programs associated with that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Matteis with Stifel.\nPaulMatteis: Great, thanks so much. I was wondering if you could give any comments on the expansion of the exec chair role and if there's any sort of back story to that or any relationship to the prior ONPATTRO investigation that was announced earlier this year in terms of marketing. And then just one question on APOLLO-B. What do you assume for the number of events in that study in terms of mortality and hospitalization? And do you think that there's a chance to show at least some sort of convincing numerical difference versus placebo? Thanks so much.\nJohnMaraganore: Well, I'll take the first part, Paul, and then Akshay; you should obviously address the APOLLO-B thing. So yes, we announced this morning, the appointment of Mike Bonny in an expanded role, he's obviously been our Chairman. But we've now expanded his role as the Executive Chair of the Company. And this is really to help us continue and further strengthen our overall ethics and compliance function within the company, an area that we're extremely committed to having a high quality best-in-class type of organization, and its integration within the business. So that's what we've done. Mike is an extremely experienced commercial leader. I have worked with Mike in for many, many years. I know him, obviously extremely well. And so we welcome him in this new governance role in a way that really is just aimed to help us continue to be the best company we could possibly be across every dimension of what we do. And Mike brings a lot of experience to that side of it. So, Akshay, do you want to handle the APOLLO-B question? \nAkshayVaishnaw: Yes, Paul. I think it's clear to everybody the primary endpoint six minute walk distance. And that's how we powered the study from the beginning; it's the most efficient way to show potentially the benefit of Patisiran in the ATTR  populations. So we're looking forward to that result in the middle of next year, the studies fully enrolled, of course. And that's exciting. Now vis-\u00e0-vis the specifics of mortality and hospitalization study wasn't powered around that. And we look forward to seeing those data. It's hard to tell right now of course, because the study is blinded, and so forth, to comment on the exact nature of those data and what we'll see, we hope to see a trend, but that's something we'll have to wait for next year.\nJohnMaraganore: Is that answered your questions?\nOperator: Next question comes from Ritu Baral with Cowen.\nRituBaral: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. Given the rapid timelines for HELIOS-B especially relative to APOLLO-B versus initial expectations, John, what are your, I guess, current thoughts on a potential interim, it's continued to be a point of client conversations and also obviously feeds into the whole breakeven question. And then a very quick follow up for Tolga and Jeff, Q2 was great. But apparently, since we can't have nice things, the Delta variant is going to be hitting Q3. What are you seeing so far? And what might be impact be there? Thanks.\nJohnMaraganore: Okay. That's great. Let me start with the IAA. Then will, Akshay you may want to comment on the IAA after that, and then we'll go to Tolga on your question for delta variant and perspectives on Q3, we obviously aren't going to foreshadow Q3, but we can give you some sense from our -- at least our view. So regarding the interim analysis, Ritu, what we designed HELIOS-B, we included the end -- and with alignment of both the FDA and the EMA, we included the ability to do an interim analysis that was not at that time specified. Because we wanted to have more time in the study to basically understand how and what type of interim analysis we might do, we continue to believe that an interim analysis could be useful in the study. But obviously, we have the beautiful benefit of the APOLLO-B readout that will occur sometime this time next year, that will give us line of sight on mortality and see the events that are happening in that study, and the wisdom and any trends that we might see and the wisdom of doing an earlier interim analysis with HELIOS-B as it relates to that study. Now, it's extremely good that we also have tilted it on the enrollment of HELIOS-B, as it relates to the study and the fact that the ultimate ending date of that study is now been accelerated significantly. So obviously, all these things will factor into our decision. But that decision, which includes regulatory alignment, of course, won't be really happening until next year, Akshay, anything to add to the IAA side of things?\nAkshayVaishnaw: No, I think you covered it, John.\nJohnMaraganore: Okay, terrific. And so let's now go to Tolga to comment a little bit on his perspectives on Q3 as it relates to the Delta variant. Tolga?\nTolgaTanguler: Yes, absolutely. Thank you for that question. Look, I mean, we obviously as an organization learned a lot and build a lot of capabilities that includes alternative sites of care, home care when it's possible, and how we have been able to continue to engage with physicians and other important customers, that will stay with us, regardless of where the Delta Varian is going. So we clearly were able to take advantage of healthcare systems opening up. And that has obviously been reflected on our ability to reform and communicate with our key stakeholders. In the near term, we don't anticipate a significant impact given the success of the vaccine. But obviously, like everyone else, we are observing and continue to build our capabilities and the learnings that we've had since 2020. John, I don't know if you have anything else to add to that.\nJohnMaraganore: No, I think you nailed it. I would just say obviously, we're to -- our confidence is partially driven -- as partially reflected in our new guidance range, which we - up to $640 million to $665 million this morning. So obviously, we wouldn't have done that if we felt -- if felt confident around our ability to continue to perform for the rest of the year. And I think that's speaks for itself.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tazeen Ahmad with Bank of America.\nTazeenAhmad: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, mine is going to also be on ATTR. Can you give us some color about why you think the enrollment rate of HELIOS-B is much faster than you might have been anticipated initially? And then can you give us any idea of the profile of the patients that are being enrolled in HELIOS-B? Are they -- in any way really different from the profile that's been enrolled in APOLLO-B? And I guess I'm trying to get a little bit of color on whether or not we can make any read through assessments based on what you show for APOLLO-B as read through to HELIOS-B? Thank you.\nJohnMaraganore: Yes, those are great questions, Tazeen. I am going to just pass them both over to Akshay. Akshay, why don't you handle them?\nAkshayVaishnaw: Yes, so the enrollment in HELIOS-B has gone extremely well. And I think a few of the major factors are, we obviously have a validated platform, we get excellent TTR knockdown, TTR knockdown is a proven approach in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and is of great interest in Cardiomyopathy space, as you know the data from the original APOLLO study would suggest that in Cardiomyopathy in hATTR patients, there are these important effects on biomarkers post hoc analysis showing mortality and hospitalization. So all of these bode well. And I think a very promising in terms of the hope for both Patisiran and vutrisiran in the various studies, including HELIOS-B Vutrisiran. So I think that's helped a lot. There's great interest. Of course, the Vutrisiran is once every three months subcutaneously. And we're also investigated once every six months. So that's a very exciting value proposition for patients. It's convenient, and an effective way we hope to treat the disease, I'm sure that's an attractive fact that we've heard that from folks. And that's especially important in these COVID times to see patients as much. And then finally, we have enormous experience in the TTR space in terms of working with investigators working with patients and working globally, at triple digit number of sites that we now know, through work. And so that's been very effectively leveraged by our clinical development team, and clinical operations team. So those are some of the factors. And we look forward to the results in due course. Now, your other question related to similarities with patient population, at a high level, I would say yes, indeed, they are largely similar. And they are basically patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy, which could be hereditary, or wild-type. I think we anticipate seeing more wild-type patients in both studies, and they'll have a substantial burden of disease in terms of  section one, two in some patients with class three diseases. So, I think the APOLLO readout and as John emphasized on earlier question for regarding the interim analysis for HELIOS-B is an important readout, will give us the great insight that will then leverage to make decisions around the IAA for HELIOS-B.\nTazeenAhmad: Okay, Akshay thanks for that. Maybe just the follow up, Akshay, sometimes when studies enrolled faster than expected and investors can get a little concerned about whether or not the quality of the patients being enrolled is ideal. Now, obviously, you can only give a limited amount of information on this question, but is that a concern at all for you? Thank you.\nAkshayVaishnaw: Yes, I mean, we monitor the quality of our studies, obviously very, very carefully just for the reasons that you say I think we've established a good track record. We have three approved drugs that we've executed numerous phases, one, two and three studies now. And so we're confident that the quality control systems we have in place when we do clinical trials are adequate and you can rest assured we've been paying a lot of attention to the studies of patients coming into APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B studies, inclusion and exclusion criteria that the patient management through the studies. And of course, we do a lot of work ourselves and in collaboration with our CROs. So there are numerous points of control. And so I think, really the rapid enrollment is more reflection of the tremendous work by my colleagues and the attractiveness of the hypothesis and Vutrisiran as a drug as opposed to something awry in the study. So we're feeling good.\nJohnMaraganore: Yes, I'm going to be less -- there's should be zero concern about that, Tazeen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mani Foroohar with SVB Leerink.\nManiForoohar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First, let's start with the PeptiDream collaboration. We've seen some early but interesting data with other autologous approaches, using an antibody targeting approach, specifically in skeletal muscle. Do you want to give us a little bit of sense of how you think about that data versus the unique advantages of PeptiDream approach, and sort of the scope of extrahepatic targets on a specific tissue types that you think the PeptiDream collaboration are especially well suited for. And then secondarily more sort of a more commercial question. Presuming that we continue to see reasonable vaccine protection against the Delta variant with booster doses received from Bayer from Pfizer, and J&J? Where are we in terms of how many innings in are we in terms of the recovery in clinical volumes? And is there additional tailwind to be had there commercially on growth acceleration across the existing pipeline? I'm sorry, cost of the existing commercial platform?\nJohnMaraganore: Could you, Mani, could you repeat the second part of your question again? COVID impact and yes --\nManiForoohar: Yes, how much, presuming that we don't have a return to lockdown sort of bear that dynamic. How much runway is there as the rebound in clinical volumes, and how much of a tailwind remains?\nJohnMaraganore: Good, okay, all right. So, Akshay, do you want to handle the PeptiDream question? And then Tolga, Maybe you can address Mani's question on tailwinds on that side. So go ahead, Akshay.\nAkshayVaishnaw: Yes, So, Mani, broadly speaking, we ourselves have invented a number of delivery systems for RNAi therapeutics to the liver to the nervous system in the eye. Of course, we've been very open with the lipid nanoparticles approach from -- and then the GalNAc conjugates for the liver. And then we have novel conjugates, which we hadn't shared as many details for the central nervous system in the eye. And so I'm confident that over the period of time that there'll be many, many approaches that we and others will come up with, as you said, published on antibody targeting via the transferrin receptor for muscle. Some of the advantages of peptide based approaches, of course, are screening, specificity, ease of manufacture cogs; there are many, many advantages. I think we'll probably have a much more diverse library that we can tap on. In fact, we know we have a much more diverse library we can tap with PeptiDream. And so we can, we'll be able to reach evolved array of receptors for internalization of our RNAi. And so it's really a very exciting collaboration. We ourselves have some pilot data, they have pilot data. And so more details become but I think this really opens up an enormous number of possibilities Alnylam. \nJohnMaraganore: Tolga, do you want to handle the second question?\nTolgaTanguler: Sure. Absolutely. I mean, look, obviously, having seen the healthcare systems opening up, we've been able to generate a pretty healthy growth of 12%, quarter-over- quarter. And due to that, we were able to increase our guidance for the full year. Now looking at the future, obviously we're very pleased with the capabilities that we've built, which helps us a lot tremendously. If you look at our adherence rates, if you look at how we've been able to engage with our customers, those numbers have been relatively steady. The big remaining question is going to be depending on our ability to find new patients is if the healthcare systems closed down significantly, which we don't anticipate, obviously, that impacts some category growth but what we've been able to achieve so far, in the first half of the year and through 2020, I think should demonstrate that we've been able to navigate an environment where rather limited with the healthcare systems, the more it opens up, it will certainly help us to be able to continue to grow at that standard rate that we've been able to demonstrate.\nJohnMaraganore: Yes, I would just add. Thanks, Tolga. And I would just add, Mani, to your question that we know that there are still -- there's still going to be more and more patients that come back into the healthcare system. I think we all know what that people have stayed off because of concerns. And as time goes on we're going to see more coming back. So I think this is an opportunity for more headwinds for the -- more tail winds rather for the future, because of just returning to the health care system and normal care cycles that are going to be important going forward.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Luca Issi with RBC.\nLucaIssi: Oh, fantastic. Thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on all the progress. Two quick one here. The first, can maybe talk a little bit more about the IKARIA Platform here. I find it interesting that in your press release, you mentioned that the platform is both long acting and reversible. So wondering if you can offer any color on how you're planning to do both. And then the second one of Patisiran, obviously data in early 2022 but wondering if you can comment on the ultimate commercial opportunity for this product given the evolving competitive landscape in both Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B. Thank you.\nJohnMaraganore: Great, thanks for the two great questions. Let me answer both. And then Akshay, you can jump in if you have additional views. Look, we're very excited about the IKARIA Platform. IKARIA, by the way is an island in Greece, that's one of these blue zone islands where people live for a long time. So we like Greek islands, and we'd like people living for a long time. But the foundation, the scientific foundation for this is going to be something that we present relatively soon, sometime in the fall at a scientific meeting. And I think what you're going to see is really continued evidence of Alnylam innovation and Alnylam ingenuity, as it relates to RNA interference. So the reason it's both long acting and reversible, is it's RNAi, we're targeting RNA, we're not targeting DNA, which has got a lot of uncertainties and risks associated with it. And so by targeting RNA with RNAi platform with some adjustments that we've made to it, we're able to achieve both long acting and reversible. And I think importantly, as well, Luca, a deeper level of knockdown. So it's really got many attributes that we think are exciting. And TTRsc04 will be the first program providing annual dosing, almost a vaccine for the treatment of hATTR and more broadly ATTR amyloidosis. So, very, very exciting. Now, on Patisiran, that's our program in hemophilia, what Sanofi has said is that they're planning to have a filing, regulatory filing in the second half of next year. They continue to be very excited about the program as are we. And while the landscape in hemophilia certainly is evolving and has evolved with the introduction of Hemlibra, it's fair to say that there are many aspects of the Patisiran profile including its effectiveness, potential effectiveness in Hemophilia B, where there is no subcutaneous treatment option today and that's a lot smaller than Hemophilia A, it's still a very sizable market opportunity and some of the longer acting factors that were being developed for Hemophilia B have not panned out as successfully namely Idelvion from CSL so there really is a very nice opportunity just in Hemophilia B alone, and then obviously the opportunity to compete in the Hemophilia A market against Hemlibra is something which Sanofi is quite keen on doing as well. Gene therapy is coming as well, but I think that's going to really be niche in the whole hemophilia segment at the end of the day. So Akshay, anything to add to those two comments I just made?\nAkshayVaishnaw: No, you covered it, John.\nJohn Maraganore: Excellent. Thank you. So I think that was the last question. So let me thank everybody for joining us on this call. We're obviously really happy with our second quarter results and overall results in 2021. And we're really looking forward to the next six months of the year, and what we can deliver from our science as well as our commercial execution. And we're very much on our way to our P5x25. So it's an exciting time for Alnylam by all accounts. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation.

            "content": "Thanks John, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our second quarter performance. For, ONPATTRO, we achieve $114 million in global net product revenues, representing approximately 12% quarter-on-quarter growth compared with the first quarter. We ended the quarter with over 1,725 patients on commercial treatments. In the US, we continue to see strength on many fronts, including 12% growth in demand and notable growth in new prescribers. We have also seen encouraging signs of the healthcare system reopening. For example, in the second quarter, we received more stock forms for ONPATTRO in the US than we have since early 2019. We're also seeing an uptick in face-to-face interactions between our field team and healthcare professionals, which is an indicator that the healthcare system is continuing to open up. Further, speed to patient diagnosis is continuing to improve with ongoing growth in the use of QRT scans, which is often the start of the patient journey toward a polyneuropathy diagnosis. Patient compliance also remains high and stable at pre COVID levels. And we continue to observe a trend and concomitant use of ONPATTRO to treat the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis, along with the use of hATTR stabilizer to treat the cardiomyopathy of this disease in mixed genotype patients. With regard to the rest of the world, market access has now been achieved in over 30 countries worldwide. In Q2, we saw significant 17% quarter-on-quarter growth in our rest of world markets, with particular strength in Europe and Canada. We're also observing a good balance of first line use and switches from stabilizers in these markets. Yes, absolutely. Thank you for that question. Look, I mean, we obviously as an organization learned a lot and build a lot of capabilities that includes alternative sites of care, home care when it's possible, and how we have been able to continue to engage with physicians and other important customers, that will stay with us, regardless of where the Delta Varian is going.

            "name": "Yvonne Greenstreet",
            "content": "Thanks Jeff, and hello, everyone. Let me start by reviewing an exciting partnership we announced with PeptiDream, PeptiDream is an industry leader in the discovery and optimization of peptide ligands against a wide variety of receptors. Through this collaboration, we and PeptiDream will discover and develop peptide-siRNA conjugates to create multiple opportunities to deliver RNAi therapeutics to tissues outside the liver. The collaboration has the potential to have multiple training opportunities by targeting disease causing mRNA strong scripts and a wide variety of tissue types. Let me now turn to a review of remaining goals to 2021. ONPATTRO within our TTR programs, we plan to present 18 month top line results from HELIOS-A Phase 3 study with Vutrisiran. We also plan additional regulatory submissions for Vutrisiran in the EU, Japan and Brazil in late 2021. Based on the excellent progress and enrollment, we also plan to complete enrollment in HELIOS-B in the coming weeks as we announced today. With Zilebesiran as Akshay mentioned, we plan to present additional data from the Phase 1 study later this year, hopefully at the American Heart meeting in November, pending abstract acceptance and plan to initiate the KARDIA-2 Phase 2 combination study later this year as well. For Lumasiran, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 study for renal stone events in late 2021. We believe this Phase 2 study represents meaningful Lifecycle Management of OXLUMO with a potential to significantly expand the overall opportunity. We also plan to submit supplemental regulatory applications in both the US and EU based on the ILLUMINATE-C results. With ALN-HSD, we expect to report initial Phase 2 results of healthy volunteers from the Phase 1 study. Turning to cemdisiran for complement mediated diseases, our partner Regeneron plans to initiate a Phase 3 study of cemdisiran and pozelimab combination in myasthenia gravis. In addition to multiple Phase 2 studies in PNH. We believe the combination of cemdisiran and pozelimab represents an attractive therapeutic strategy for complements mediated diseases. We're very excited to file our first CNS CTA for ALN-APP now expected in late 2021 in development for the treatment of autism or dominant Alzheimer disease, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. This sets us up for potential initial PSC data in 2022. And given the exciting preclinical progress, we plan to advance ALN-XDH in development for the treatment of gout toward a CTA filing in late 2021. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? No, I think actually, both of you have covered this well. We believe we're a unique company. And we have every intention of building a top five bar tech. And we have every intention of progressing all of our opportunities, obviously, in a thoughtful fashion."

            "name": "John Maraganore",
            "content": "Thanks, Christine, and thank you everyone for joining the call today. In the second quarter and recent period, we made tremendous progress bringing RNAi therapeutics to patients around the world with our commercial, medical and R&D efforts while delivering solid financial performance. To start, our teams delivered steady ongoing commercial execution and continued revenue growth, including 12% quarterly growth for ONPATTRO strengthening of GIVLAARI performance and the continued impressive uptake for OXLUMO. On our pipeline efforts, highlights include excellent progress building our ATTR Amyloidosis franchise. We completed enrollment in the APOLLO -B Phase 3 study of Patisiran and expect to complete enrollment in the HELIOS-B, Phase study of Patisiran within the next two weeks, significantly ahead of schedule, and already with more than 600 patients enrolled. Hi, Gena. Thank you, first of all, for your comments on the quarter. And thank you for your comments on what we've been able to achieve as a company. And I think it's fair to say that we believe that we have a path forward as a company to build significant value. It's very evident in the P5x25, five year goals and plans that we outlined earlier this year, as to how we believe that we can build a top five biotech company in market cap over the next five year period, by execution with our organic product engine and our capabilities to achieve sustainable innovation. So it's certainly our plan to continue on that path. But of course, we have a fiduciary duty to shareholders. And obviously, we'll always consider that component of how we have an obligation to our shareholders. But our plans right now are very focused on our P5x25 goals and our abilities to execute continuously on that sustainable source of innovation. So that's how we're focused, Gena. Yes, well, first of all, thanks, Alethia for the comments on the quarter. We're really pleased with the results, obviously. And it's a real credit to our overall organization for delivering as they did. Look, we're very excited about the opportunities for RNAi therapeutics in more prevalent diseases. I think the data with cemdisiran really points to the ability to reimagine the treatment of hypertension, a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality around the world. So, I mean, how can you not get excited about transformational medicines that can make a fundamental impact on a major issue of public health, globally, with the potential obviously, over time to help many, many people. So we're very excited about that direction, there's really no reason why we aren't able to advance these assets on our own. We have a great team; we have a proven track record of execution on the R&D side. And there's simply no reason why we have any need for capabilities or even funding from third party partners. But obviously, we also want to make sure that we navigate our path toward a sustainable and ultimately profitable business in a responsible manner. So we are very thoughtful about how we balance our OpEx investments, along with the growth in our revenues toward a sustainable, financially sustainable, self sustainable profile. And so that is a core part of our strategy. Let me with those intros, let me first start with Jeff, and then transfer over to Yvonne, to comment a little bit more about our sort of going forward views. But Jeff, do you want to talk first on the financials, and then upon a little bit about our perspectives on growth in the prevalent disease markets? And Yvonne, do you want to comment a little bit more strategically going forward? How we think through this? Is that answered your questions, Alethia? Fantastic. Let me start my comments. And then maybe Akshay, you can chime in here on some more of the specifics on the KARDIA program, and the dosing regimen. For starters, I mean, look, we're very, again, very excited about zilebesiran and its potential to reimagine the treatment of hypertension. And you are very right, Maury, to point to the analogy with inclisiran, because both siRNA are designed to address very prevalent -- both very prevalent diseases, one is in hypercholesterolemia with inclisiran the other hypertension with zilebesiran. And both, of course, enable a very infrequent dose regimen to control these leading causes of CV morbidity, mortality in both cases, right with HDL and LDL, I'd say from a development program standpoint was attractive, strategically about both efforts is that the biomarker or the clinical marker that we're measuring in our Phase 2 studies and our Phase 2 studies, in the cases, zilebesiran blood pressure. And in the case of inclisiran LDL cholesterol, those are the exact same endpoints that will be used in our Phase 3 trials, in support of an approval. And so it is attractive that we have completely de-risked the primary endpoint of what will ultimately be a Phase 3 with zilebesiran. And that's a very analogous situation to what we have with inclisiran in the setting of hypercholesterolemia, so very attractive profile. And, of course we're very, very encouraged by the safety profile that we saw with inclisiran and 1000s of patients that we're studying. And we're obviously aiming to achieve similar results with zilebesiran, as we do further studies with that agent. So at a high strategic level, that is -- those are some of the reasons why there are a lot of analogies between inclisiran and zilebesiran.  So with that, Akshay, maybe you can talk a little bit about more of the KARDIA program, some of the timelines there, as well as some of the dosing approaches through three months or six months like. So Akshay, take it away. Yes, thanks, Salveen. Let me start and then I'll hand it over to Akshay to talk a little bit further. We're obviously very excited about the agreement that we formed last week with PeptiDream, as Yvonne said in her remarks, PeptiDream is really a leading company in peptide design and synthesis. And obviously, working with them is part of our continued investment in extrahepatic delivery, where we've already been very successful in CNS and ocular. So we're very excited about that. So Akshay, do you want to talk a little bit about how we look at the future of extrahepatic delivery and tissues of interest? Well, I'll take the first part, Paul, and then Akshay; you should obviously address the APOLLO-B thing. So yes, we announced this morning, the appointment of Mike Bonny in an expanded role, he's obviously been our Chairman. But we've now expanded his role as the Executive Chair of the Company. And this is really to help us continue and further strengthen our overall ethics and compliance function within the company, an area that we're extremely committed to having a high quality best-in-class type of organization, and its integration within the business. So that's what we've done. Mike is an extremely experienced commercial leader. I have worked with Mike in for many, many years. I know him, obviously extremely well. And so we welcome him in this new governance role in a way that really is just aimed to help us continue to be the best company we could possibly be across every dimension of what we do. And Mike brings a lot of experience to that side of it. So, Akshay, do you want to handle the APOLLO-B question? Is that answered your questions? Okay. That's great. Let me start with the IAA. Then will, Akshay you may want to comment on the IAA after that, and then we'll go to Tolga on your question for delta variant and perspectives on Q3, we obviously aren't going to foreshadow Q3, but we can give you some sense from our -- at least our view. So regarding the interim analysis, Ritu, what we designed HELIOS-B, we included the end -- and with alignment of both the FDA and the EMA, we included the ability to do an interim analysis that was not at that time specified. Because we wanted to have more time in the study to basically understand how and what type of interim analysis we might do, we continue to believe that an interim analysis could be useful in the study. But obviously, we have the beautiful benefit of the APOLLO-B readout that will occur sometime this time next year, that will give us line of sight on mortality and see the events that are happening in that study, and the wisdom and any trends that we might see and the wisdom of doing an earlier interim analysis with HELIOS-B as it relates to that study. Now, it's extremely good that we also have tilted it on the enrollment of HELIOS-B, as it relates to the study and the fact that the ultimate ending date of that study is now been accelerated significantly. So obviously, all these things will factor into our decision. But that decision, which includes regulatory alignment, of course, won't be really happening until next year, Akshay, anything to add to the IAA side of things? Okay, terrific. And so let's now go to Tolga to comment a little bit on his perspectives on Q3 as it relates to the Delta variant. Tolga? No, I think you nailed it. I would just say obviously, we're to -- our confidence is partially driven -- as partially reflected in our new guidance range, which we - up to $640 million to $665 million this morning. So obviously, we wouldn't have done that if we felt -- if felt confident around our ability to continue to perform for the rest of the year. And I think that's speaks for itself. Yes, those are great questions, Tazeen. I am going to just pass them both over to Akshay. Akshay, why don't you handle them? Yes, I'm going to be less -- there's should be zero concern about that, Tazeen. Could you, Mani, could you repeat the second part of your question again? COVID impact and yes -- Good, okay, all right. So, Akshay, do you want to handle the PeptiDream question? And then Tolga, Maybe you can address Mani's question on tailwinds on that side. So go ahead, Akshay. Tolga, do you want to handle the second question? Yes, I would just add. Thanks, Tolga. And I would just add, Mani, to your question that we know that there are still -- there's still going to be more and more patients that come back into the healthcare system. I think we all know what that people have stayed off because of concerns. And as time goes on we're going to see more coming back. So I think this is an opportunity for more headwinds for the -- more tail winds rather for the future, because of just returning to the health care system and normal care cycles that are going to be important going forward. Great, thanks for the two great questions. Let me answer both. And then Akshay, you can jump in if you have additional views. Look, we're very excited about the IKARIA Platform. IKARIA, by the way is an island in Greece, that's one of these blue zone islands where people live for a long time. So we like Greek islands, and we'd like people living for a long time. But the foundation, the scientific foundation for this is going to be something that we present relatively soon, sometime in the fall at a scientific meeting. And I think what you're going to see is really continued evidence of Alnylam innovation and Alnylam ingenuity, as it relates to RNA interference. So the reason it's both long acting and reversible, is it's RNAi, we're targeting RNA, we're not targeting DNA, which has got a lot of uncertainties and risks associated with it. And so by targeting RNA with RNAi platform with some adjustments that we've made to it, we're able to achieve both long acting and reversible. And I think importantly, as well, Luca, a deeper level of knockdown. So it's really got many attributes that we think are exciting. And TTRsc04 will be the first program providing annual dosing, almost a vaccine for the treatment of hATTR and more broadly ATTR amyloidosis. So, very, very exciting. Now, on Patisiran, that's our program in hemophilia, what Sanofi has said is that they're planning to have a filing, regulatory filing in the second half of next year. They continue to be very excited about the program as are we. And while the landscape in hemophilia certainly is evolving and has evolved with the introduction of Hemlibra, it's fair to say that there are many aspects of the Patisiran profile including its effectiveness, potential effectiveness in Hemophilia B, where there is no subcutaneous treatment option today and that's a lot smaller than Hemophilia A, it's still a very sizable market opportunity and some of the longer acting factors that were being developed for Hemophilia B have not panned out as successfully namely Idelvion from CSL so there really is a very nice opportunity just in Hemophilia B alone, and then obviously the opportunity to compete in the Hemophilia A market against Hemlibra is something which Sanofi is quite keen on doing as well. Gene therapy is coming as well, but I think that's going to really be niche in the whole hemophilia segment at the end of the day. So Akshay, anything to add to those two comments I just made? Excellent. Thank you. So I think that was the last question. So let me thank everybody for joining us on this call. We're obviously really happy with our second quarter results and overall results in 2021. And we're really looking forward to the next six months of the year, and what we can deliver from our science as well as our commercial execution. And we're very much on our way to our P5x25. So it's an exciting time for Alnylam by all accounts. Thank you and have a great day."

            "content": "Thanks Akshay, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting Alnylam's Q2 2021 financial results, which reflect another strong quarter of operational excellence across the business. Turning to our results first for ONPATTRO, we generated $113.8 million in net revenue for the quarter, representing 12% growth from the first quarter of 2021 and 71% growth compared with Q2 2020. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of double digit quarter-on-quarter growth following one quarter of flattened growth that we experienced during the onset of the pandemic in Q2 of last year. US ONPATTRO sales increased 6% versus Q1 2021. And we're primarily impacted by the following. An approximate 12% increase in demand, representing acceleration from the 4% demand growth delivered in Q1 with the increase driven by the addition of new patients on therapy and continuation of greater than 90% patient treatment compliance. Demand growth was offset by a higher level of gross to net deductions and less inventory stocking in the quarter compared with Q1, 2021. In our international markets, ONPATTRO performance remains very strong with growth of 17% versus Q1 2021 and 79% versus Q2 2020, primarily driven by increased patient demand broadly across our markets in Europe and Canada. Sales from our international markets comprise 54% of our global total in Q2, clearly reflecting the benefit of our global commercial footprint. Turning to our results for GIVLAARI; we generated $30.6 million in net revenue in Q2, representing 24% growth compared to the first quarter of 2021, driven by ongoing launches in the US and Europe. Reported results in the US in particular improve during the quarter with quarter-on-quarter growth of 26% compared to 6% quarter-on-quarter growth in Q1, as we benefited from improved patient flow through the US healthcare system. With OXLUMO, we had an excellent second full quarter of sales, generating $16.3 million in net revenue in a quarter up from $9.1 million in Q1 with growth contributions from both US and rest of world markets. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter. Total combined product sales in the second quarter were $160.8 million, representing 107% growth versus Q2 2020. Net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was $59.4 million, a significant increase from Q2 last year, primarily due to revenue recognized from our Regeneron collaboration. We recognize $0.3 million in royalty revenues during the quarter, representing our initial recognition of royalties earned on Novartis as sales of Leqvio. Gross margin on total revenues was 82.4% for the quarter, a slight improvement from prior year. Our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses for the quarter increased 19% versus Q2 2020. Key drivers of the increased continue to be additional R&D investment in advancing our late stage pipeline programs and increased SG&A investment to support our free commercial brands, including the launch of OXLUMO. Also recall that last year in Q2 operating expenses were at the lowest quarterly level in 2020 and were impacted by the onset of the pandemic. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter decreased by approximately $51 million versus the same period in 2020, driven by strong top line growth and more moderate growth in operating expenses. Q2 also represents the sixth consecutive quarter that we've delivered an improvement in our non-GAAP operating loss. And we believe this clearly signals the path we are on towards profitability. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2021, compared to $1.87 billion as of December 30, 2020, with the increase primarily due to the second drawdown of our credit facility with Blackstone, which occurred during Q2, and cash received from the exercise and employee equity awards and purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan, offset by cash used in our operations to support overall growth. Lastly, turning to our financial guidance. We believe our results for the second quarter continue to demonstrate successful commercial execution. As a result of the strength of our first half 2021 results, we are increasing our full year 2021 combined net product revenue guidance from $610 million to $660 million to $640 million to $665 million, representing a 3% increase from the midpoint of the prior range to the midpoint of the new range. Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties, and for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses remain unchanged. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Yvonne to review our upcoming milestones, Yvonne? Yes, I think I agree with everything you said, John, and one of the metrics P5x25 goals is getting to profitability across the period and we're committed to doing that. I think the one other comments that I would make as it relates to cemdisiran is from a commercial standpoint, our hope is that we'll be able to leverage infrastructure that hopefully we will have built by then from a perspective of supporting an expansion of the TTR franchise for successful in the APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B studies to get into a larger sort of cardiomyopathy footprint. So that's one factor as well."

            "name": "Akshay Vaishnaw",
            "content": "Thanks Tolga, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we're advancing two clinical stage product candidates, Patisiran and Vutrisiran. Also, ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat the polyneuropathy associated with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. We're committed to expanding the products labeled for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end, we're conducting the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study. During the second quarter we completed enrollment in APOLLO-B and expect to report top line results in mid 2022. We are also advancing Vutrisiran and investigational therapy, which is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection and is also in development for ATTR amyloidosis. Here, we're conducting two Phase 3 studies. The first is HELIOS-A evaluating Vutrisiran and hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. At the AAN conference in April, we presented our positive nine months HELIOS-A results. Based on those results, we submitted our NDA to the FDA, which was accepted and signed the PDUFA date of April 14, 2022. Patient dosing continues in HELIOS-A and we look forward to reporting top line results from the 18 month endpoint in late 2021, which will also further characterize Vutrisiran impact on the exploratory cardiac endpoints. We plan to make additional regulatory submissions including in the EU in the late 2021 period based on the HELIOS-A results. The other Phase 3 Vutrisiran study is HELIOS-B, which is our ongoing Phase 3 cardiac outcomes study with Vutrisiran in hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. We're excited to have announced this morning but due to high interest amongst physicians and patients, we now expect to complete enrollment within the next two weeks well ahead of schedule. And with more than 600 patients randomized to date. HELIOS-BI has a 30 month endpoint of all cause mortality and CV events. And we can now expect the full results in early 2024. The study design includes the potential for an interim analysis and we'll consider these following results from APOLLO-B in alignment with regulatory authorities. Lastly, for Vutrisiran, we're very excited about the potential opportunity for biannual dosing regimen, which could further differentiate Vutrisiran from other products and provide yet another dosing regimen option for patients. Yes, thanks, John. So, Maury, zilebesiran we will execute two Phase 2 studies, KARDIA-1 is looking at zilebesiran as mono therapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. About just shy of 400 patients here in 75 or so in that study, orthodox randomized control study. And that'll be -- that study is up and running that we complemented by KARDIA-2 which will kick off in the months to come later this year. And then we'll evaluate in KARDIA-2, the combination of zilebesiran with other antihypertensive medications and of course, that will include Ras inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and more details to come. That study will be larger, about 650 patients also we're not guiding right now as to the exact completion date of both studies. They're just getting going. As I said, and more details to come later in the year, as recruitment ramps up, but this is hypertension. So we're anticipating enrollment will go relatively quickly. And so we're looking forward to an exciting outcome building on the very promising data from the Phase 1 that John has already commented on. With reference to dose and regimen there'll be a spectrum of doses evaluated, again, more details to follow. But I can reiterate that we'll be looking at both three and six monthly dosing regimens in these studies. And so we'll have a comprehensive look at the pharmacology of the drugs and put us in a good position to select the right dose and regimen for the development in Phase 3. So I hope that's helpful, Maury. Yes, so, Salveen, of course, we're interested in a range of organs with several reasons; one is that RNAi as a pharmacologic activity can be conducted in any tissue in any cell in the body. So we can take a siRNA to any cell type, and expect to see targets knocked down, and we can say that with confidence. And if you combine that with the possibility that they're genetically validated, and ontologically, validated targets in many, many different tissues, we've got broader ambitions with PeptiDream beyond the liver. So of course, we already in the CNS ANI that we have several options there in terms of the kinds of conjugates we've built. I'm sure we can add to those with PeptiDream and then there'll be new tissues you'll be hearing about from us. But you can remain confident that this collaboration is being conducted to really maintain and extend our leadership position RNAi. And we believe that by the end of the decade, we'll see RNAi in many, many different tissues beyond the liver, and approved programs associated with that. Yes, Paul. I think it's clear to everybody the primary endpoint six minute walk distance. And that's how we powered the study from the beginning; it's the most efficient way to show potentially the benefit of Patisiran in the ATTR  populations. So we're looking forward to that result in the middle of next year, the studies fully enrolled, of course. And that's exciting. Now vis-\u00e0-vis the specifics of mortality and hospitalization study wasn't powered around that. And we look forward to seeing those data. It's hard to tell right now of course, because the study is blinded, and so forth, to comment on the exact nature of those data and what we'll see, we hope to see a trend, but that's something we'll have to wait for next year. No, I think you covered it, John. Yes, so the enrollment in HELIOS-B has gone extremely well. And I think a few of the major factors are, we obviously have a validated platform, we get excellent TTR knockdown, TTR knockdown is a proven approach in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and is of great interest in Cardiomyopathy space, as you know the data from the original APOLLO study would suggest that in Cardiomyopathy in hATTR patients, there are these important effects on biomarkers post hoc analysis showing mortality and hospitalization. So all of these bode well. And I think a very promising in terms of the hope for both Patisiran and vutrisiran in the various studies, including HELIOS-B Vutrisiran. So I think that's helped a lot. There's great interest. Of course, the Vutrisiran is once every three months subcutaneously. And we're also investigated once every six months. So that's a very exciting value proposition for patients. It's convenient, and an effective way we hope to treat the disease, I'm sure that's an attractive fact that we've heard that from folks. And that's especially important in these COVID times to see patients as much. And then finally, we have enormous experience in the TTR space in terms of working with investigators working with patients and working globally, at triple digit number of sites that we now know, through work. And so that's been very effectively leveraged by our clinical development team, and clinical operations team. So those are some of the factors. And we look forward to the results in due course. Now, your other question related to similarities with patient population, at a high level, I would say yes, indeed, they are largely similar. And they are basically patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy, which could be hereditary, or wild-type. I think we anticipate seeing more wild-type patients in both studies, and they'll have a substantial burden of disease in terms of  section one, two in some patients with class three diseases. So, I think the APOLLO readout and as John emphasized on earlier question for regarding the interim analysis for HELIOS-B is an important readout, will give us the great insight that will then leverage to make decisions around the IAA for HELIOS-B. Yes, I mean, we monitor the quality of our studies, obviously very, very carefully just for the reasons that you say I think we've established a good track record. We have three approved drugs that we've executed numerous phases, one, two and three studies now. And so we're confident that the quality control systems we have in place when we do clinical trials are adequate and you can rest assured we've been paying a lot of attention to the studies of patients coming into APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B studies, inclusion and exclusion criteria that the patient management through the studies. And of course, we do a lot of work ourselves and in collaboration with our CROs. So there are numerous points of control. And so I think, really the rapid enrollment is more reflection of the tremendous work by my colleagues and the attractiveness of the hypothesis and Vutrisiran as a drug as opposed to something awry in the study. So we're feeling good. Yes, So, Mani, broadly speaking, we ourselves have invented a number of delivery systems for RNAi therapeutics to the liver to the nervous system in the eye. Of course, we've been very open with the lipid nanoparticles approach from -- and then the GalNAc conjugates for the liver. And then we have novel conjugates, which we hadn't shared as many details for the central nervous system in the eye. And so I'm confident that over the period of time that there'll be many, many approaches that we and others will come up with, as you said, published on antibody targeting via the transferrin receptor for muscle. Some of the advantages of peptide based approaches, of course, are screening, specificity, ease of manufacture cogs; there are many, many advantages. I think we'll probably have a much more diverse library that we can tap on. In fact, we know we have a much more diverse library we can tap with PeptiDream. And so we can, we'll be able to reach evolved array of receptors for internalization of our RNAi. And so it's really a very exciting collaboration. We ourselves have some pilot data, they have pilot data. And so more details become but I think this really opens up an enormous number of possibilities Alnylam. No, you covered it, John."

John?\nJohn Maraganore: Thanks Christine and thank you everyone for joining the call today. 2021 is off to a great start for Alnylam with four approved RNAi therapeutics now helping patients around the world and more in our pipeline poised to do the same in the coming years. To start, our teams delivered a steady ongoing commercial execution and continued revenue growth including 13% quarterly growth for ONPATTRO with our first triple-digit revenue quarter and an impressive initial uptake for OXLUMO in its first full quarter on the market. On the pipeline side, the full positive results from the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study of vutrisiran were presented last week and we announced that we have filed an NDA for vutrisiran with the FDA bringing us a step closer to the potential approval of this important asset in our TTR franchise.\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks John and good morning everyone. Let's get started with a review of our commercial performance from the first quarter. In Q1 despite COVID headwinds, particularly in the US, we were able to achieve strong results. For ONPATTRO, we achieved $102 million in global net product revenues in the first quarter and we ended the quarter with over 1,500 patients on commercial treatment. In the US, we continue to see progress on many fronts including steady and continuous growth in patients as well as notable growth in new prescribers across specialties seeing patients with hATTR polyneuropathy. Adherence to treatment remains stable at pre-COVID levels and we continue to observe a trend of HCP choice in concomitant use of ONPATTRO to treat polyneuropathy along with the use of a TTR stabilizer for cardiomyopathy in mixed phenotype hATTR amyloidosis patients. Much of our continuous growth in ONPATTRO revenue is driven by increased hATTR diagnosis rates, which, we believe, is due to wider availability of PYP scans. Access is another important highlight with confirmed access to ONPATTRO for over 98% of covered lives.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Thanks, Tolga, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we're advancing our two product candidates patisiran and vutrisiran. With patisiran, we're committed to expanding the products label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end we're conducting the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study. We continue to enroll patients in APOLLO-B and continue to expect completion of the enrollment in early 2021, which would put us on track for a top line readout in mid-2022. We're also advancing vutrisiran, which is delivered by quarterly subcutaneous injection. Here we're conducting two Phase 3 studies. The first is HELIOS-A evaluating vutrisiran in amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy -- in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. Just over a week ago, at the American Academy of Neurology Conference, we presented our positive full nine-month results, which I'll briefly recap here. On the primary endpoint of change in mNIS+7 from baseline at nine months, vutrisiran treatment resulted in a 17-point mean treatment benefit relative to the external placebo group from the APOLLO Phase 3 study of patisiran. The effect was highly significant, indicating robustness of the treatment effect. Also, the mean change in mNIS+7 relative to baseline was a negative value, indicating improvement, providing evidence that like patisiran, vutrisiran not only halts neuropathy progression, but also achieved reversal of neuropathy symptoms relative to baseline in the majority of patients in this pivotal trial. As to the key secondary end point change in Norfolk Quality of Life score at nine months relative to baseline, vutrisiran treated patients demonstrated to the mean improvement in quality of life, relative to the external placebo arm.\nJeff Poulton: Thanks Akshay, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting Alnylam's Q1 2021 financial results. As Tolga highlighted, it was another very strong quarter of commercial execution with excellent results. Turning to our results first for ONPATTRO. We generated $102 million in net revenue for the quarter, representing 13% growth from the fourth quarter of 2020 and 53% growth compared with Q1 2020. This marks the third consecutive quarter of double-digit quarter-on-quarter growth following one quarter of flattened growth we experienced during the onset of the pandemic in Q2 of last year. US ONPATTRO sales increased 15% versus Q4 2020 and were primarily impacted by the following: an approximate 4% increase in demand driven by the addition of new patients on therapy, an increase of inventory in the distribution channel with inventory increasing from approximately one week at the end of 2020 to approximately two weeks at the end of Q1. And a lower level of gross to net deductions in the third quarter compared with Q4 2020. Consistent with full year 2020, we expect gross to net deductions will remain in the mid-20s globally for ONPATTRO in 2021. In our international markets, ONPATTRO performance remained strong with growth of 11% versus Q4 2020, primarily driven by increased patient demand in our five major markets in Europe. Results in Japan were unfavorably impacted by a reduction of inventory at our distributor during Q1. Turning to our results for GIVLAARI. We generated $24.7 million in net revenue in Q1, representing 11% growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 driven by ongoing launches in the US and Europe. Reported results in the US were unfavorably impacted by an increase in gross to net sales deductions in Q1 compared with Q4. With OXLUMO we had a strong first full quarter of sales generating $9.1 million in net revenue in the quarter. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter. Total combined product sales in the first quarter were $135.8 million, representing 89% growth versus Q1 2020. Net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was $41.8 million, a significant increase from Q1 last year, primarily due to revenue recognized from our Regeneron collaboration. Gross margin on total revenues was 83% for the quarter, down from 87% in Q1 2020, primarily due to lower margins on collaboration revenues in the quarter. Our combined non-GAAP, R&D and SG&A expenses for the quarter increased modestly at 6% versus Q1 2020. Key drivers of the increase were additional R&D investment in advancing our late-stage pipeline programs and increased SG&A investment to support the launch of OXLUMO. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter decreased by approximately $45 million versus the same period in 2020, driven by strong top line growth and moderate growth in operating expenses. Q1 also represents the fifth consecutive quarter that we've delivered an improvement in our non-GAAP operating loss and clearly signals the path we're on towards profitability. Lastly, turning to our financial guidance. Following our strong Q1 results, we remain confident in our full year outlook and are reiterating the financial guidance we provided on our Q4 results call in February. Starting with net product revenues, we anticipate combined net product revenues for our three commercialized products will be between $610 million and $660 million. Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalty is a range between $150 million and $200 million. And our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses is a range between $1.175 billion and $1.275 billion. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Yvonne to review our upcoming milestones. Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks Jeff and hello everyone. We've already achieved important milestones in 2021. And as we look ahead, there are plenty of catalysts queued up for the next 12 to 24 months. Firstly, within our TTR franchise, we expect to complete enrollment in the Phase 3 APOLLO-B study of patisiran early this year setting up top line results in mid-2022. With Vutrisiran, we're on track to initiate data generation for a biannual dosing regimen in mid-2021 followed later in 2021 by presentation of 18-month top line results in HELIOS-A. And as we've announced today we can look forward to completion of enrollment in HELIOS-B later this year. For GIVLAARI, we look forward to an important regulatory milestone with its potential approval in Japan midyear. Turning to OXLUMO. We anticipate an approval in Brazil in mid-2021. Upcoming clinical milestones will also include top line results in the Phase 3 ILLUMINATE-C study in mid-2021 as well as initiation of a Phase 2 study for recurrent renal stones in late 2021. This Phase 2 study will be important for lifecycle management of OXLUMO with the potential to significantly expand the overall opportunity. Our early and mid-stage pipeline has locked in-store as well. For cemdisiran enrollment and dosing continues in the Phase II monotherapy study in IgA nephropathy. And dosing continues in the Phase I combo study with pozelimab in collaboration with Regeneron. Our partners at fair continue to enroll and dose ALN-HBV02 in the Phase II combo trial with pegylated interferon alpha. And at Dicerna, our partners continue to advance fitusiran for AAT deficiency liver disease. ALN-AGT is on track to enter Phase II midyear. With the start of the KARDIA program in hypertension and we're very excited about the planned filing in mid-2021 of our first CNS, CTA for ALN-APP. This sets us up a potential initial CNS proof-of-concept data in 2022. So needless to say, Alnylam has much to look forward to in the coming quarters as we execute on these key catalysts across our pipeline and platform and the first quarter marks a strong start with regard to our Alnylam P5x25 goals outlined in January. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Yvonne. Operator, we will now open the call for your questions. Those dialed-in, we would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each and then get back in the queue if you have additional questions.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from the line of Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America. Your question, please.\nTazeen Ahmad: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. Good news on the enrollment rate for HELIOS-B. I just wanted to get a little bit of color, if you could provide any on why you think it was able to \u2013 it is enrolling faster than you previously anticipated. And does that give you a better sense of when we could see the data at least at the top line level readout? Thank you.\nJohn Maraganore: That's \u2013 thank you, Tazeen and we're also very excited about the progress on HELIOS-B I think it really is supported by the enthusiasm in the community for Vutrisiran, as a once quarterly subcu medicine for ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, which is what we're evaluating in that Phase III study. So really, really good. And obviously there's an opportunity for biannual dosing as well pending those results. So let me turn it over to Akshay to comment really on his perspectives on that. Akshay?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Just building on what you said John, first and foremost, I'd say the outstanding work of our clinical operations team, particularly during this very stressful and remarkable COVID period. I think it's also a testament to our global reach in the TTR space through our work in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Many of the investigators, we know because they work in both diseases hATTR and ATTR cardiomyopathy. And I think they're very excited about the possibility of our drugs in wild-type TTR cardiomyopathy. And then of course with our global reach we've gone to many sites where there's no access to approved drugs like tafamidis for example for wild-type TTR cardiomyopathy. And so people are very motivated to help study both ONPATTRO and Vutrisiran in that setting. So delighted with our own in-house efforts and I think there's a tremendous therapeutic rationale for our agents in those diseases and wonderful collaboration with the investigators in sites.\nJohn Maraganore: And Tazeen to your question about timing for results, we're not giving any guidance at this point. It would be premature to do that. But we are planning an interim analysis and we are in planning and discussions with regulators to lockdown exactly what the design would be of that interim analysis. And when we have more clarity on that we can provide it to you at that time. Otherwise, you probably remember that the HELIOS-B study has a 30-month endpoint. So the \u2013 without the interim analysis, it would go 30 months past the point of enrollment being completed.\nTazeen Ahmad: Okay. Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Maury Raycroft from Jefferies. Your question, please.\nMaury Raycroft: Hi, good morning, everyone and congrats on the update today. Just wondering if you can provide a breakdown on how many ONPATTRO patients are on concurrent use with the stabilizers? And any specifics on switches as well?\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Let me hand it over to Tolga on that and he can give you some framing around what we see in the US and what we see in the rest of world, which is very important there. But just before I hand it over, obviously the \u2013 in all cases the use of ONPATTRO is for the treatment of the polyneuropathy in the hereditary ATTR disease. So that's an important reminder as well. Tolga, do you want to go ahead and comment on some of these market dynamics that we observed?\nTolga Tanguler: Sure, John. Thank you and hi, Maury. Yes, so as John indicated, we are obviously indicated for polyneuropathy, which actually makes the difference between different geographies. As you may know ONPATTRO is one of the only other stabilizers then there's no -- sorry silencers and there's no stabilizer indicated for polyneuropathy in the US. There we do see mix phenotype patients for hATTR. And those numbers remain about 20% right now with the concomitant use of another area -- of a stabilizer for the cardiomyopathy treatment which were not indicated. In Europe and Japan, we are indicated with another -- with a stabilizer. And as a silencer I must say we're very encouraged by the switches for those patients that are progressing potentially with the stabilizers. And there we do see the benefit of silencers and the contribution of switches in both in Japan and major European markets remain a very significant contributor of our growth. John?\nJohn Maraganore: Maury does that answer your question?\nMaury Raycroft: Yes. Yes very helpful. And maybe just as a follow-up. Based on the combo use trend that you're seeing just checking if you're thinking about or having conversations with Pfizer to potentially collaborate on scanning or diagnosing or maybe even leveraging the combo commercially as you think about reaching the broader cardiomyopathy opportunity?\nJohn Maraganore: Yes Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Yes, I mean look first of all having multiple players in this devastating condition is a very good thing for the patients. And even though we're not collaborating with Pfizer, I think if you look at the protocol development in major US centers with the advent of these treatments, it certainly is helping. We certainly believe those protocols should include genetic testing which then further establishes the condition for polyneuropathy and mix phenotype patients. So, while we're not in direct communication or collaboration I can tell you we're all aiming for those patients to get diagnosed as quickly as possible which we know it takes anywhere between five to 10 years and can cause mortality and morbidity. So, again, we're moving in the right direction in the same direction but there's no specific collaborative action between the two companies.\nMaury Raycroft: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nJohn Maraganore: Thanks Maury.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question please.\nAlethia Young: And congrats on -- I want to talk in particular about GIVLAARI and the trends that you're seeing it seems like if I'm reading this chart and I'm a little bit colorblind I think you saw like $7 million plus in sales ex-US and $1.4 million in the US. I just wanted to talk a little bit about how you're thinking about growth trends in the United States. And kind of the trends that you're seeing there are unique and distinct obviously relative to ex-US. I saw that you had the APU in France on the timing and what's that? Thanks.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Let me -- I'll hand it over to Tolga and maybe Jeff will want to say a few things, but let me just comment obviously with GIVLAARI. We are very excited about where this product is going. I mean the impact is having on patients with acute hepatic porphyria is really profound and very impressive. And so we are really pleased with the help that we're providing patients with this terrible disorder. A big part of the growth story for GIVLAARI this year is going to be geographic expansion with pricing and reimbursement achieved in many European countries because right now it's really largely been driven from Germany and our APU in France. So, we do expect growth coming from geographic expansion along with new patient finding growth as well. But Tolga do you want to comment more broadly and Jeff as well?\nTolga Tanguler: Absolutely--\nAlethia Young: I mean don't tell me -- but actually I was asking about OXLUMO. I actually misspoke sorry.\nJohn Maraganore: Okay. Sorry.,\nAlethia Young: Sorry, my bad.\nJohn Maraganore: Okay. All right. Well, thanks for the correction. Yes. No, look OXLUMO had a fantastic first quarter of launch. We're really, really pleased with that. And obviously it's approved in both Europe and the US and was first approved in Europe which is terrific. And it's off to a great start. Tolga do you want to comment a little bit on some of that dynamic?\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. I was all ready for -- geared up for GIVLAARI. I'm going to switch gears here. Absolutely. Listen OXLUMO, obviously, and is another very -- is treating another devastating conditions. We greatly benefited from early access patients in Europe. And majority of our early access program patients were in Europe. Therefore, these treating physicians electing to continue with the commercial therapy and frankly went rather smoothly is the reason why we see a good uptake in Europe. US had few patients and therefore less to convert. But given over 30 start forms in the US we're very confident that US will be a key driver of OXLUMO growth. I'm also really encouraged at the fact that we're attracting the patients that are being treated are both pediatric and adults and broad eGFR category with the broad eGFR category. So, that's also really encouraging. And last but not least, we've been able to already achieve two-third access of -- on the U.S. universe with payers and our value-based agreements driving clearly easy smooth access. So again, it's too soon for us to be concerned about U.S. and in fact, I'm really encouraged with what we're seeing with the patient start forms, which is over 30 right now already this last quarter.\nAlethia Young: Awesome. Thank you.\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks, Alethia.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs.\nSonya Bhatia: Hi. Thank you so much for taking our question. This is Sonya on for Salveen. Could you help frame expectations into the APOLLO-B trial, in particular we're wondering what would be considered clinically meaningful? And how we should think about potential read through to the HELIOS-B trial? Thank you.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. Thanks Sonya. Just as a reminder, I'll hand it over to Akshay. But just as a reminder APOLLO-B is our randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of patisiran in wild-type and hereditary ATTR patients with cardiomyopathy. So this is the opportunity to potentially expand our patisiran opportunity into that broader segment. And so Akshay, do you want to comment a little bit on how we view success in that study?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. The primary endpoint in APOLLO-B is six minute walk distance, which is a clinically validated measure in the disease and is intuitively clinically meaningful, patients with cardiomyopathies, any form of heart failure, struggle with exercise and exercise tolerance. So being able to walk significantly better relative to the control arm is going to be very important to demonstrate that. And so, the primary endpoint, in and of itself, will be very clinically meaningful. Beyond that, we will get a lot of additional data from that study. Of course, we'll be looking at hospitalization rates mortality. The study is not powered for that, but it will, of course, be important to see what trends we're seeing there. And in addition to that, a host of biomarkers and other endpoints such as BNP, such as echo cardiogram changes and technician and the like. Now, the reason why we feel excited about that whole package and the likelihood of success is that, if you go back to the original APOLLO study with patisiran in hATTR with polyneuropathy and the cardiac patients within that study or patients that had significant cardiac disease, I should say. We saw very encouraging findings. We saw the 10-meter walk test stabilized relative to placebo very deteriorated dramatically. We saw that BNP was favorable slightly down relative to placebo. In that study BNP is an important cardiac biomarker. Echocardiogram showed reduction in the left ventricular wall thickness. And then subsequent to that other groups have demonstrated academic groups such as the Gilmore Group in London and they published this. They see diminution on technician scan with evidence for regression of amyloid in the heart. They also saw that light cardiac MRI. They saw stabilization of six minute walk distance in their ONPATTRO treated hATTR cardiopathy patients. These are all very encouraging findings to us that support, the likelihood success with APOLLO-B. And then, finally, with mortality and hospitalization itself, post hoc analysis from the original APOLLO study did demonstrate a significant difference. Now post hoc and we should be very mindful of that. But, again, an encouraging finding. So in totality, I think, the therapeutic rationale is very strong, both for APOLLO-B and also for vutrisiran in HELIOS-B where, of course, the study is larger and it's powered to detect mortality and hospitalization changes and that's the primary readout. And so, I think if APOLLO-B is positive, which, I've given you the reasons why we're excited. We're then very encouraged by the implications for HELIOS-B as a result. And it should speed the interim analysis and so forth of HELIOS-B.\nJohn Maraganore: Yes. And I'll just add to that that, obviously, won\u2019t be -- we're expecting data from APOLLO-B middle 2022. We do -- we're on track to complete enrollment in early 2021, so just in the next period. And then we expect to have data from APOLLO-B in mid 2022. So that is going to be obviously an important data readout sometime mid next year.\nSonya Bhatia: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lebowitz from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nDavid Lebowitz: Thank you very much for taking my question. If there is -- I mean when there is an interim analysis for APOLLO-B, what type of analysis will actually be conducted? And is there a possibility that that interim analysis can produce a result that allows for an earlier, I guess, regulatory submission, or is it really -- we just should assume 30 months is the only route to a submission?\nJohn Maraganore: Yes, David, thanks for that question. I'll hand it over to Akshay and maybe Yvonne wants to comment as well. But I mean, the purpose for doing the interim analysis would be to potentially bring vutrisiran to the market ahead of the final result, which would read out at 30 months. And so, that certainly is the intent of the interim analysis to shorten that time. So that is why we're doing it. Akshay, Yvonne, any more to add to that?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: No, not really. I think you covered it, John. I think if APOLLO-B is positive then that would certainly be very exciting for anticipating the results from HELIOS-B that would accelerate the interim analysis gives us great insight into the relevant interim analysis to do. And the motivation would be to get Vutrisiran to patients faster with that IA.\nJohn Maraganore: Yeah. Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: No that's great. I think that's covered it.\nJohn Maraganore: I mean, the only thing I would say David, is just bear in mind that we have not yet resolved the design of the interim analysis with the regulatory authorities. We have in the original protocol specified that there would be an interim analysis or there could be an interim analysis. But the final design of that would need to be aligned on with regulators, which is an important step.\nDavid Lebowitz: Does that include the timing of the analysis?\nJohn Maraganore: Absolutely. The design and the timing and what the endpoint will exactly be all those elements would be obtained in alignment with regulators, absolutely.\nDavid Lebowitz: Helpful. Thank you for taking my question.\nJohn Maraganore: Thanks David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gena Wang from Barclays. Your question please.\nGena Wang: Thank you for taking my question. I have one regarding the value-based payment. Just wondering now you have three drugs or have a value based reimbursement. So just wondering, what is the real-world implementation? And based on current experience roughly what percentage of patients you need to actually adjust the payment or value due to lack of efficacy?\nJohn Maraganore: Yeah. Well, Gena, let me just start on that really important question and then maybe turn it over to Jeff to address how that's been handled in the real world. But let me start by saying that we're really proud of our proactive approach with value-based agreements with payers. Certainly in the U.S. commercial market, we've also done some element of that in Europe as well. And I think the results speak for themselves. I mean because the benefit of these shared arrangements with the payer community has been one, in which they view Alnylam as being proactive and open-minded about value. It has changed the dialogue away from price into discussion or recognition of value. We've been very innovative on that. And, of course, the result has been essentially no payer headwinds in the U.S. market and very broad access that we've been able to achieve for patients. So it is something, which we're especially proud of and we hopefully can demonstrate the innovation on this from a commercial perspective similar to the innovation we've always had as an R&D organization. So with that, Jeff, do you want to comment on some of the real-world color on those VBAs?\nJeff Poulton: Yeah happy to. Gena I'll speak to ONPATTRO. Obviously that's the product that's been on the market the longest that we have the most experience there. And I will say that the deductions that we're paying associated with the VBAs that have been signed with commercial payers are extremely modest at this point. And that's because the product is working well. So we're not having to make payments for patients that are discontinuing due to an unsatisfactory experience with the product. So extremely modest again I would say in terms of the impact on the deductions that we're paying.\nJohn Maraganore: And I think the one index of that that we report out from time-to-time Gena as you know is the adherence rate being so high with the product, which really speaks to the -- to how well the product is performing in the patient community. I think it's fair to say generally consistent with our clinical experience with patisiran in the APOLLO study.\nTolga Tanguler: And if I can add\u2026\nJohn Maraganore: Tolga anything to add?\nTolga Tanguler: Yeah, yeah. I mean, as you and Jeff mentioned the outcomes of our products and its efficacy is really a testament that these VBAs are working in favor of the patient and payers as well as us. So it's really a win-win-win situation. And one should also keep in mind that as we design these VBAs, ASP risk is really minimized. And we're certainly not seeing that at this moment. And if it were to occur, it certainly is minimized in the way we formulate our VBAs. So we certainly don't now anticipate any long-term negative impact on our revenues.\nGena Wang: Thank you very much.\nJohn Maraganore: Does that answer your question Gena?\nGena Wang: Yes. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Debjit Chattopadhyay from Guggenheim Securities. Your question please.\nJohn Maraganore: Are you on mute Debjit?\nUnidentified Analyst: Sorry, yes, I was on mute.\nJohn Maraganore: I thought so.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Aaron  on for Debjit. So congrats on the progress, the ONPATTRO launch looks like it's going very well. Can you tell us what proportion of patients being treated in the U.S. also have concomitant cardiomyopathy versus polyneuropathy alone? And maybe elaborate on the ramp in diagnosed patients in ATTR? Thanks.\nJohn Maraganore: Sure. I mean we answered the first question earlier, you may not have heard the answer, but we can do it again no problem. Tolga, do you want to handle both of those questions?\nTolga Tanguler: Yeah, absolutely. The first question, obviously, is first of all let's be clear. Our objective is to make sure that we get to treat as many patients with polyneuropathy condition as possible. In some cases physicians identify these patients with mix phenotype. And in those instances we obviously help support patients to make sure they get access to our medicine if they were on another treatment with a concomitant therapy. That's -- we're pleased with what we're seeing. And obviously in Europe and Japan we don't have this phenomena and we tend to build our business with the switches. And obviously naive patients which again we see a great progress. Can you repeat the second question?\nUnidentified Analyst: Just about the ramp in diagnosed patients in ATTR how that's increasing?\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. Again I think rising tide lifts all boats. So we do see a great expansion of protocol development in centers of excellence. We see a good referral network with community centers as you may know the PYP scintigraphy scans are really helping. And these scans are relatively cheap, inexpensive and very accessible. So we see more and more centers are diagnosing these patients. And then we do see a good uptake of our genetic testing program, Alnylam Act as well. And in fact the last two, three months of the first quarter we've seen our highest in the number of genetic testing. So right now up to now we've tested about 36000 patients that are suspected of hATTR and we received a relatively high-yield out of these we're about 6%. Over 2000 patients were diagnosed with the genetic mutation. So that's going really well and we're very encouraged by both the increase of PYP scans, as well as system taking advantage of genetic testing along with Alnylam Act. Did that answer your question?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Matteis from Stifel. Your question, please.\nPaul Matteis: Great. Thanks so much. I wanted to ask one more question about APOLLO-B. And that's really, how do you think we could end up comparing these data to the tafamidis data. If we go back to APOLLO-A, I remember John you're kind of talking about ahead of those data a goal that stabilized disease or even reversed it and that would be unequivocally better than tafamidis. Do you think the 6-minute walk test data from APOLLO-B are going to be directly comparable to what we have from tafamidis in this population 6-minute walk? And what would be the caveats any comparison? Thanks.\nJohn Maraganore: Well Paul, I'll just start and then I'm sure Akshay will want to chime in. But in general of course comparisons between studies is something that you have to always take with the grain of salt. There are formal ways of doing it which may be done by people. But ultimately it is fraught with caveats to say the least. Akshay do you want to comment a little bit on that further?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. I mean let me just reiterate because I think it's so important what you just said that Pfizer colleagues with their investigators did wonderful work and they should speak to the value of their results and the implication direct comparisons are not valid greatly. Now having said all of that, at a very high level I think what all of us would like to see in this space, patients investigators and all of this investigating drugs is we'd like to halt the course of this terrible disease cardiomyopathy in these patients. And looking at the published Pfizer data with tafamidis, I think it's fair to say that that drug obviously has a significant impact on mortality and hospitalization 6-minute walk distance. But the overall feeling is that it's just slowing down the rate of deterioration. And what if we could just sort of hop the disease and extract stabilize these parameters like 6-minute walk distance which is what we very much look forward to doing and showing with a policy the work of Gilmore and tau which I cited earlier study of 20 companies hATTR amyloidosis patients where they looked at the cut in myopathy aspect showed stabilization compared to historic control. Now that's a single-arm study compared to historic control but that's encouraging. And everything keeps pointing to the idea that we could stabilize recently with Vutrisiran in HELIOS-A, we showed stabilization of BNP versus deterioration in the placebo. We've seen that previously with patisiran in the original APOLLO study. So I think direct comparisons are very fraud for all sorts of reasons. I think we'll have a similar population in APOLLO-B. So it will be a valid population to think about the value of the drug. And our goal is to show stabilization of the primary endpoint 6-minute walk distance.\nJohn Maraganore: Does that answer your question Paul?\nPaul Matteis: Totally. Thank you.\nJohn Maraganore: Thanks Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ritu Baral from Cowen. Your question please.\nRitu Baral: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. A quick one on the timing of the potential HELIOS-B interim, am I sort of reading between the lines right guys you have to meet with FDA before you decide on the interim to get their buy-in and that you want the top line APOLLO-B data ahead of that discussion? Would that necessarily put that FDA discussion in the second half of 2022?\nJohn Maraganore: Well, okay. So first of all, it's the FDA and also other regulators that have an important input here on a matter like this like the EMA. So it's not just the FDA, but we \u2013 certainly the timing of it will probably naturally occur the timing of that interim analysis will probably naturally occur after we have visibility on APOLLO-B results, right? But the design of the interim our plan would be to try to focus on what that is sooner than we have the readout from APOLLO-B. Akshay, anything \u2013 anything to add Akshay from your perspective on that?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: No. I just want to \u2013 with our announcement today of HELIOS-B enrollment completion by the end of the year looking very likely now. We didn't have that line of sight. We have that now. So the timing looks very conducive that will have the APOLLO-B data middle of May next year. And of course, by that time, the HELIOS-B study is fully enrolled, the patients have been on drug or placebo for a sufficient length of time, so it naturally leads to a very well-structured and planned IA after that fall for HELIOS-B.\nRitu Baral: Okay. And that would \u2013 if HELIOS-B enrolls on completion around end of 2022 most of those patients will have been on for 12 months or more do you think that that's adequate powering for an event-based trial based on your internal modeling of what TTR knockdown might result in?\nJohn Maraganore: Well, I think \u2013 go ahead, Akshay.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yeah. No, I think Ritu said HELIOS-B enrollment of completion end of 2022. We're just saying today that, it should be by the end of 2021 based on our line of sight now. So yeah, end of 2022 would be about 12 months yes you're right. As for the exact details of that I think we're going to work through that and we'll share in due course, Ritu.\nRitu Baral: Okay. Fair enough. I'll keep bugging you about that. But last very quick question. Just as far as we think about ONPATTRO to the end of the year. What is your line of sight on potential roll-off of home administration allowances during the COVID pandemic that may be ending over the course of this year? And what impact could that have on ONPATTRO do you think?\nJohn Maraganore: Yeah. Tolga, do you want to answer that?\nTolga Tanguler: Yeah. Look at the end of the day a lot of payers and specialty pharmacies are offering home infusion services. Our payer \u2013 our patient services program, also does a phenomenal job with site of care and accommodating different routes of the way those patients will be administered. We've seen a good steady uptake even prior to the pandemic as well as during the pandemic. So those allowances, while they're good, weren't the main driver, I believe for our ability to be able to accommodate those patients that are in need. In Europe, we've seen an uptick from 9%, 10% all the way up to 30% home care. As well as in the US, we doubled the amount of patients, but it still represents about one-fifth of our patients that are getting home care. So we're not broadly exposed. The type of services we provide will continue. So we really don't see that as a detractor of the performance that we have in this business.\nRitu Baral: Got it. And as far as you know, there's no particular time that Medicaid home infusion is ending sometime in 2021 those temporary allowances?\nTolga Tanguler: That, I'm not aware, I wouldn't be able to speak to that.\nJohn Maraganore: We've not heard anything. We've not heard anything on that, Ritu.\nRitu Baral: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Maraganore: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Navin Jacob from UBS. Your question please.\nJon Lim: Hi, everyone. This is Jon on for Navin. We wanted to go back to HELIOS-A and we \u2013 that the severe AE rates were a lot lower for Vutri versus ONPATTRO and we were just curious, if there was any color you could provide on that?\nJohn Maraganore: Yeah. Akshay, do you want to answer that question? This is looking at the \u2013 and the comparison was to the small ONPATTRO arm in the study I believe is what you're referring to. Akshay, do you want to comment on that?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yeah. I mean, I think we're very happy about the encouraging safety data with Vutrisiran in HELIOS-A, as we are with GalNAc subcu conjugates overall. As to direct comparison there, I think that the patisiran arm is very small. And really, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, when the data is so skewed that way in terms of sample size. So I don't think I'd overly conclude anything as we were discussing earlier. ONPATTRO, the overall safety profile relative to placebo, where the most robust test for that of course was the original APOLLO study. The data look very encouraging and favorable ONPATTRO in terms of safety. And in the real world, as evidenced by the retention on drug and the comfort investigators feel with it patients feel with it. We're very encouraged that the real-world safety and experience is as good as it was in the original APOLLO study. So that's real testament to how it's serving patients.\nJohn Maraganore: And Jon, the lower SAE rate in the Vutrisiran arm relative to external placebo, we believe is related to the fact that that patients on placebo are probably experiencing disease progression AEs that underscores that. So that's certainly, our belief based on those data.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yeah. The \u2013 I mean, just from a mechanical viewpoint, if you see a patient every three weeks for an intravenous infusion you're more likely to hear about a headache or whatever other intercurrent events going on in their lives as it does for all of us and it may or may not be an adverse event it may or may not be of relevance. So with the Vutrisiran being once quarterly, you're just not going to be asking the patient the same questions with the same frequency. But in either case, if something was of significance, it would emerge. And as you said, the overall safety profile for Vutrisiran does look very encouraging.\nJon Lim: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nJohn Maraganore: Thank you, Jon. Well listen thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. Obviously, we're really pleased with our first quarter results in 2021. It was a strong quarter for commercial execution. And we also had excellent progress across our pipeline programs and we're really pleased this quarter to have announced our P5x25 strategy, which we're obviously very, very excited about. So we look forward to talking to you in subsequent calls and wish everyone a wonderful rest of day and hope everybody stays safe as well. Bye-bye now.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tolga Tanguler",
            "content": "Thanks John and good morning everyone. Let's get started with a review of our commercial performance from the first quarter. In Q1 despite COVID headwinds, particularly in the US, we were able to achieve strong results. For ONPATTRO, we achieved $102 million in global net product revenues in the first quarter and we ended the quarter with over 1,500 patients on commercial treatment. In the US, we continue to see progress on many fronts including steady and continuous growth in patients as well as notable growth in new prescribers across specialties seeing patients with hATTR polyneuropathy. Adherence to treatment remains stable at pre-COVID levels and we continue to observe a trend of HCP choice in concomitant use of ONPATTRO to treat polyneuropathy along with the use of a TTR stabilizer for cardiomyopathy in mixed phenotype hATTR amyloidosis patients. Much of our continuous growth in ONPATTRO revenue is driven by increased hATTR diagnosis rates, which, we believe, is due to wider availability of PYP scans. Access is another important highlight with confirmed access to ONPATTRO for over 98% of covered lives. Sure, John. Thank you and hi, Maury. Yes, so as John indicated, we are obviously indicated for polyneuropathy, which actually makes the difference between different geographies. As you may know ONPATTRO is one of the only other stabilizers then there's no -- sorry silencers and there's no stabilizer indicated for polyneuropathy in the US. There we do see mix phenotype patients for hATTR. And those numbers remain about 20% right now with the concomitant use of another area -- of a stabilizer for the cardiomyopathy treatment which were not indicated. In Europe and Japan, we are indicated with another -- with a stabilizer. And as a silencer I must say we're very encouraged by the switches for those patients that are progressing potentially with the stabilizers. And there we do see the benefit of silencers and the contribution of switches in both in Japan and major European markets remain a very significant contributor of our growth. John? Yes, I mean look first of all having multiple players in this devastating condition is a very good thing for the patients. And even though we're not collaborating with Pfizer, I think if you look at the protocol development in major US centers with the advent of these treatments, it certainly is helping. We certainly believe those protocols should include genetic testing which then further establishes the condition for polyneuropathy and mix phenotype patients. So, while we're not in direct communication or collaboration I can tell you we're all aiming for those patients to get diagnosed as quickly as possible which we know it takes anywhere between five to 10 years and can cause mortality and morbidity. So, again, we're moving in the right direction in the same direction but there's no specific collaborative action between the two companies. Absolutely-- Yes. I was all ready for -- geared up for GIVLAARI. I'm going to switch gears here. Absolutely. Listen OXLUMO, obviously, and is another very -- is treating another devastating conditions. We greatly benefited from early access patients in Europe. And majority of our early access program patients were in Europe. Therefore, these treating physicians electing to continue with the commercial therapy and frankly went rather smoothly is the reason why we see a good uptake in Europe. US had few patients and therefore less to convert. But given over 30 start forms in the US we're very confident that US will be a key driver of OXLUMO growth. I'm also really encouraged at the fact that we're attracting the patients that are being treated are both pediatric and adults and broad eGFR category with the broad eGFR category. So, that's also really encouraging. And last but not least, we've been able to already achieve two-third access of -- on the U.S. universe with payers and our value-based agreements driving clearly easy smooth access. So again, it's too soon for us to be concerned about U.S. and in fact, I'm really encouraged with what we're seeing with the patient start forms, which is over 30 right now already this last quarter. Thanks, Alethia. And if I can add\u2026 Yeah, yeah. I mean, as you and Jeff mentioned the outcomes of our products and its efficacy is really a testament that these VBAs are working in favor of the patient and payers as well as us. So it's really a win-win-win situation. And one should also keep in mind that as we design these VBAs, ASP risk is really minimized. And we're certainly not seeing that at this moment. And if it were to occur, it certainly is minimized in the way we formulate our VBAs. So we certainly don't now anticipate any long-term negative impact on our revenues. Yeah, absolutely. The first question, obviously, is first of all let's be clear. Our objective is to make sure that we get to treat as many patients with polyneuropathy condition as possible. In some cases physicians identify these patients with mix phenotype. And in those instances we obviously help support patients to make sure they get access to our medicine if they were on another treatment with a concomitant therapy. That's -- we're pleased with what we're seeing. And obviously in Europe and Japan we don't have this phenomena and we tend to build our business with the switches. And obviously naive patients which again we see a great progress. Can you repeat the second question? Yes. Again I think rising tide lifts all boats. So we do see a great expansion of protocol development in centers of excellence. We see a good referral network with community centers as you may know the PYP scintigraphy scans are really helping. And these scans are relatively cheap, inexpensive and very accessible. So we see more and more centers are diagnosing these patients. And then we do see a good uptake of our genetic testing program, Alnylam Act as well. And in fact the last two, three months of the first quarter we've seen our highest in the number of genetic testing. So right now up to now we've tested about 36000 patients that are suspected of hATTR and we received a relatively high-yield out of these we're about 6%. Over 2000 patients were diagnosed with the genetic mutation. So that's going really well and we're very encouraged by both the increase of PYP scans, as well as system taking advantage of genetic testing along with Alnylam Act. Did that answer your question? Yeah. Look at the end of the day a lot of payers and specialty pharmacies are offering home infusion services. Our payer \u2013 our patient services program, also does a phenomenal job with site of care and accommodating different routes of the way those patients will be administered. We've seen a good steady uptake even prior to the pandemic as well as during the pandemic. So those allowances, while they're good, weren't the main driver, I believe for our ability to be able to accommodate those patients that are in need. In Europe, we've seen an uptick from 9%, 10% all the way up to 30% home care. As well as in the US, we doubled the amount of patients, but it still represents about one-fifth of our patients that are getting home care. So we're not broadly exposed. The type of services we provide will continue. So we really don't see that as a detractor of the performance that we have in this business. That, I'm not aware, I wouldn't be able to speak to that."

            "content": "Thanks Jeff and hello everyone. We've already achieved important milestones in 2021. And as we look ahead, there are plenty of catalysts queued up for the next 12 to 24 months. Firstly, within our TTR franchise, we expect to complete enrollment in the Phase 3 APOLLO-B study of patisiran early this year setting up top line results in mid-2022. With Vutrisiran, we're on track to initiate data generation for a biannual dosing regimen in mid-2021 followed later in 2021 by presentation of 18-month top line results in HELIOS-A. And as we've announced today we can look forward to completion of enrollment in HELIOS-B later this year. For GIVLAARI, we look forward to an important regulatory milestone with its potential approval in Japan midyear. Turning to OXLUMO. We anticipate an approval in Brazil in mid-2021. Upcoming clinical milestones will also include top line results in the Phase 3 ILLUMINATE-C study in mid-2021 as well as initiation of a Phase 2 study for recurrent renal stones in late 2021. This Phase 2 study will be important for lifecycle management of OXLUMO with the potential to significantly expand the overall opportunity. Our early and mid-stage pipeline has locked in-store as well. For cemdisiran enrollment and dosing continues in the Phase II monotherapy study in IgA nephropathy. And dosing continues in the Phase I combo study with pozelimab in collaboration with Regeneron. Our partners at fair continue to enroll and dose ALN-HBV02 in the Phase II combo trial with pegylated interferon alpha. And at Dicerna, our partners continue to advance fitusiran for AAT deficiency liver disease. ALN-AGT is on track to enter Phase II midyear. With the start of the KARDIA program in hypertension and we're very excited about the planned filing in mid-2021 of our first CNS, CTA for ALN-APP. This sets us up a potential initial CNS proof-of-concept data in 2022. So needless to say, Alnylam has much to look forward to in the coming quarters as we execute on these key catalysts across our pipeline and platform and the first quarter marks a strong start with regard to our Alnylam P5x25 goals outlined in January. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? No that's great. I think that's covered it."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "John Maraganore",
            "content": "Thanks Christine and thank you everyone for joining the call today. 2021 is off to a great start for Alnylam with four approved RNAi therapeutics now helping patients around the world and more in our pipeline poised to do the same in the coming years. To start, our teams delivered a steady ongoing commercial execution and continued revenue growth including 13% quarterly growth for ONPATTRO with our first triple-digit revenue quarter and an impressive initial uptake for OXLUMO in its first full quarter on the market. On the pipeline side, the full positive results from the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study of vutrisiran were presented last week and we announced that we have filed an NDA for vutrisiran with the FDA bringing us a step closer to the potential approval of this important asset in our TTR franchise. That's \u2013 thank you, Tazeen and we're also very excited about the progress on HELIOS-B I think it really is supported by the enthusiasm in the community for Vutrisiran, as a once quarterly subcu medicine for ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, which is what we're evaluating in that Phase III study. So really, really good. And obviously there's an opportunity for biannual dosing as well pending those results. So let me turn it over to Akshay to comment really on his perspectives on that. Akshay? And Tazeen to your question about timing for results, we're not giving any guidance at this point. It would be premature to do that. But we are planning an interim analysis and we are in planning and discussions with regulators to lockdown exactly what the design would be of that interim analysis. And when we have more clarity on that we can provide it to you at that time. Otherwise, you probably remember that the HELIOS-B study has a 30-month endpoint. So the \u2013 without the interim analysis, it would go 30 months past the point of enrollment being completed. Yes. Let me hand it over to Tolga on that and he can give you some framing around what we see in the US and what we see in the rest of world, which is very important there. But just before I hand it over, obviously the \u2013 in all cases the use of ONPATTRO is for the treatment of the polyneuropathy in the hereditary ATTR disease. So that's an important reminder as well. Tolga, do you want to go ahead and comment on some of these market dynamics that we observed? Maury does that answer your question? Yes Tolga? Thanks Maury. Yes. Let me -- I'll hand it over to Tolga and maybe Jeff will want to say a few things, but let me just comment obviously with GIVLAARI. We are very excited about where this product is going. I mean the impact is having on patients with acute hepatic porphyria is really profound and very impressive. And so we are really pleased with the help that we're providing patients with this terrible disorder. A big part of the growth story for GIVLAARI this year is going to be geographic expansion with pricing and reimbursement achieved in many European countries because right now it's really largely been driven from Germany and our APU in France. So, we do expect growth coming from geographic expansion along with new patient finding growth as well. But Tolga do you want to comment more broadly and Jeff as well? Okay. Sorry., Okay. All right. Well, thanks for the correction. Yes. No, look OXLUMO had a fantastic first quarter of launch. We're really, really pleased with that. And obviously it's approved in both Europe and the US and was first approved in Europe which is terrific. And it's off to a great start. Tolga do you want to comment a little bit on some of that dynamic? Yes. Thanks Sonya. Just as a reminder, I'll hand it over to Akshay. But just as a reminder APOLLO-B is our randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study of patisiran in wild-type and hereditary ATTR patients with cardiomyopathy. So this is the opportunity to potentially expand our patisiran opportunity into that broader segment. And so Akshay, do you want to comment a little bit on how we view success in that study? Yes. And I'll just add to that that, obviously, won\u2019t be -- we're expecting data from APOLLO-B middle 2022. We do -- we're on track to complete enrollment in early 2021, so just in the next period. And then we expect to have data from APOLLO-B in mid 2022. So that is going to be obviously an important data readout sometime mid next year. Yes, David, thanks for that question. I'll hand it over to Akshay and maybe Yvonne wants to comment as well. But I mean, the purpose for doing the interim analysis would be to potentially bring vutrisiran to the market ahead of the final result, which would read out at 30 months. And so, that certainly is the intent of the interim analysis to shorten that time. So that is why we're doing it. Akshay, Yvonne, any more to add to that? Yeah. Yvonne? I mean, the only thing I would say David, is just bear in mind that we have not yet resolved the design of the interim analysis with the regulatory authorities. We have in the original protocol specified that there would be an interim analysis or there could be an interim analysis. But the final design of that would need to be aligned on with regulators, which is an important step. Absolutely. The design and the timing and what the endpoint will exactly be all those elements would be obtained in alignment with regulators, absolutely. Thanks David. Yeah. Well, Gena, let me just start on that really important question and then maybe turn it over to Jeff to address how that's been handled in the real world. But let me start by saying that we're really proud of our proactive approach with value-based agreements with payers. Certainly in the U.S. commercial market, we've also done some element of that in Europe as well. And I think the results speak for themselves. I mean because the benefit of these shared arrangements with the payer community has been one, in which they view Alnylam as being proactive and open-minded about value. It has changed the dialogue away from price into discussion or recognition of value. We've been very innovative on that. And, of course, the result has been essentially no payer headwinds in the U.S. market and very broad access that we've been able to achieve for patients. So it is something, which we're especially proud of and we hopefully can demonstrate the innovation on this from a commercial perspective similar to the innovation we've always had as an R&D organization. So with that, Jeff, do you want to comment on some of the real-world color on those VBAs? And I think the one index of that that we report out from time-to-time Gena as you know is the adherence rate being so high with the product, which really speaks to the -- to how well the product is performing in the patient community. I think it's fair to say generally consistent with our clinical experience with patisiran in the APOLLO study. Tolga anything to add? Does that answer your question Gena? Are you on mute Debjit? I thought so. Sure. I mean we answered the first question earlier, you may not have heard the answer, but we can do it again no problem. Tolga, do you want to handle both of those questions? Well Paul, I'll just start and then I'm sure Akshay will want to chime in. But in general of course comparisons between studies is something that you have to always take with the grain of salt. There are formal ways of doing it which may be done by people. But ultimately it is fraught with caveats to say the least. Akshay do you want to comment a little bit on that further? Does that answer your question Paul? Thanks Paul. Well, okay. So first of all, it's the FDA and also other regulators that have an important input here on a matter like this like the EMA. So it's not just the FDA, but we \u2013 certainly the timing of it will probably naturally occur the timing of that interim analysis will probably naturally occur after we have visibility on APOLLO-B results, right? But the design of the interim our plan would be to try to focus on what that is sooner than we have the readout from APOLLO-B. Akshay, anything \u2013 anything to add Akshay from your perspective on that? Well, I think \u2013 go ahead, Akshay. Yeah. Tolga, do you want to answer that? We've not heard anything. We've not heard anything on that, Ritu. Thank you. Yeah. Akshay, do you want to answer that question? This is looking at the \u2013 and the comparison was to the small ONPATTRO arm in the study I believe is what you're referring to. Akshay, do you want to comment on that? And Jon, the lower SAE rate in the Vutrisiran arm relative to external placebo, we believe is related to the fact that that patients on placebo are probably experiencing disease progression AEs that underscores that. So that's certainly, our belief based on those data. Thank you, Jon. Well listen thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. Obviously, we're really pleased with our first quarter results in 2021. It was a strong quarter for commercial execution. And we also had excellent progress across our pipeline programs and we're really pleased this quarter to have announced our P5x25 strategy, which we're obviously very, very excited about. So we look forward to talking to you in subsequent calls and wish everyone a wonderful rest of day and hope everybody stays safe as well. Bye-bye now."

            "content": "Thanks Akshay, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting Alnylam's Q1 2021 financial results. As Tolga highlighted, it was another very strong quarter of commercial execution with excellent results. Turning to our results first for ONPATTRO. We generated $102 million in net revenue for the quarter, representing 13% growth from the fourth quarter of 2020 and 53% growth compared with Q1 2020. This marks the third consecutive quarter of double-digit quarter-on-quarter growth following one quarter of flattened growth we experienced during the onset of the pandemic in Q2 of last year. US ONPATTRO sales increased 15% versus Q4 2020 and were primarily impacted by the following: an approximate 4% increase in demand driven by the addition of new patients on therapy, an increase of inventory in the distribution channel with inventory increasing from approximately one week at the end of 2020 to approximately two weeks at the end of Q1. And a lower level of gross to net deductions in the third quarter compared with Q4 2020. Consistent with full year 2020, we expect gross to net deductions will remain in the mid-20s globally for ONPATTRO in 2021. In our international markets, ONPATTRO performance remained strong with growth of 11% versus Q4 2020, primarily driven by increased patient demand in our five major markets in Europe. Results in Japan were unfavorably impacted by a reduction of inventory at our distributor during Q1. Turning to our results for GIVLAARI. We generated $24.7 million in net revenue in Q1, representing 11% growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 driven by ongoing launches in the US and Europe. Reported results in the US were unfavorably impacted by an increase in gross to net sales deductions in Q1 compared with Q4. With OXLUMO we had a strong first full quarter of sales generating $9.1 million in net revenue in the quarter. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the quarter. Total combined product sales in the first quarter were $135.8 million, representing 89% growth versus Q1 2020. Net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was $41.8 million, a significant increase from Q1 last year, primarily due to revenue recognized from our Regeneron collaboration. Gross margin on total revenues was 83% for the quarter, down from 87% in Q1 2020, primarily due to lower margins on collaboration revenues in the quarter. Our combined non-GAAP, R&D and SG&A expenses for the quarter increased modestly at 6% versus Q1 2020. Key drivers of the increase were additional R&D investment in advancing our late-stage pipeline programs and increased SG&A investment to support the launch of OXLUMO. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter decreased by approximately $45 million versus the same period in 2020, driven by strong top line growth and moderate growth in operating expenses. Q1 also represents the fifth consecutive quarter that we've delivered an improvement in our non-GAAP operating loss and clearly signals the path we're on towards profitability. Lastly, turning to our financial guidance. Following our strong Q1 results, we remain confident in our full year outlook and are reiterating the financial guidance we provided on our Q4 results call in February. Starting with net product revenues, we anticipate combined net product revenues for our three commercialized products will be between $610 million and $660 million. Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalty is a range between $150 million and $200 million. And our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses is a range between $1.175 billion and $1.275 billion. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Yvonne to review our upcoming milestones. Yvonne? Yeah happy to. Gena I'll speak to ONPATTRO. Obviously that's the product that's been on the market the longest that we have the most experience there. And I will say that the deductions that we're paying associated with the VBAs that have been signed with commercial payers are extremely modest at this point. And that's because the product is working well. So we're not having to make payments for patients that are discontinuing due to an unsatisfactory experience with the product. So extremely modest again I would say in terms of the impact on the deductions that we're paying."

            "name": "Akshay Vaishnaw",
            "content": "Thanks, Tolga, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we're advancing our two product candidates patisiran and vutrisiran. With patisiran, we're committed to expanding the products label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end we're conducting the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study. We continue to enroll patients in APOLLO-B and continue to expect completion of the enrollment in early 2021, which would put us on track for a top line readout in mid-2022. We're also advancing vutrisiran, which is delivered by quarterly subcutaneous injection. Here we're conducting two Phase 3 studies. The first is HELIOS-A evaluating vutrisiran in amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy -- in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. Just over a week ago, at the American Academy of Neurology Conference, we presented our positive full nine-month results, which I'll briefly recap here. On the primary endpoint of change in mNIS+7 from baseline at nine months, vutrisiran treatment resulted in a 17-point mean treatment benefit relative to the external placebo group from the APOLLO Phase 3 study of patisiran. The effect was highly significant, indicating robustness of the treatment effect. Also, the mean change in mNIS+7 relative to baseline was a negative value, indicating improvement, providing evidence that like patisiran, vutrisiran not only halts neuropathy progression, but also achieved reversal of neuropathy symptoms relative to baseline in the majority of patients in this pivotal trial. As to the key secondary end point change in Norfolk Quality of Life score at nine months relative to baseline, vutrisiran treated patients demonstrated to the mean improvement in quality of life, relative to the external placebo arm. Yes. Just building on what you said John, first and foremost, I'd say the outstanding work of our clinical operations team, particularly during this very stressful and remarkable COVID period. I think it's also a testament to our global reach in the TTR space through our work in hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Many of the investigators, we know because they work in both diseases hATTR and ATTR cardiomyopathy. And I think they're very excited about the possibility of our drugs in wild-type TTR cardiomyopathy. And then of course with our global reach we've gone to many sites where there's no access to approved drugs like tafamidis for example for wild-type TTR cardiomyopathy. And so people are very motivated to help study both ONPATTRO and Vutrisiran in that setting. So delighted with our own in-house efforts and I think there's a tremendous therapeutic rationale for our agents in those diseases and wonderful collaboration with the investigators in sites. Yes. The primary endpoint in APOLLO-B is six minute walk distance, which is a clinically validated measure in the disease and is intuitively clinically meaningful, patients with cardiomyopathies, any form of heart failure, struggle with exercise and exercise tolerance. So being able to walk significantly better relative to the control arm is going to be very important to demonstrate that. And so, the primary endpoint, in and of itself, will be very clinically meaningful. Beyond that, we will get a lot of additional data from that study. Of course, we'll be looking at hospitalization rates mortality. The study is not powered for that, but it will, of course, be important to see what trends we're seeing there. And in addition to that, a host of biomarkers and other endpoints such as BNP, such as echo cardiogram changes and technician and the like. Now, the reason why we feel excited about that whole package and the likelihood of success is that, if you go back to the original APOLLO study with patisiran in hATTR with polyneuropathy and the cardiac patients within that study or patients that had significant cardiac disease, I should say. We saw very encouraging findings. We saw the 10-meter walk test stabilized relative to placebo very deteriorated dramatically. We saw that BNP was favorable slightly down relative to placebo. In that study BNP is an important cardiac biomarker. Echocardiogram showed reduction in the left ventricular wall thickness. And then subsequent to that other groups have demonstrated academic groups such as the Gilmore Group in London and they published this. They see diminution on technician scan with evidence for regression of amyloid in the heart. They also saw that light cardiac MRI. They saw stabilization of six minute walk distance in their ONPATTRO treated hATTR cardiopathy patients. These are all very encouraging findings to us that support, the likelihood success with APOLLO-B. And then, finally, with mortality and hospitalization itself, post hoc analysis from the original APOLLO study did demonstrate a significant difference. Now post hoc and we should be very mindful of that. But, again, an encouraging finding. So in totality, I think, the therapeutic rationale is very strong, both for APOLLO-B and also for vutrisiran in HELIOS-B where, of course, the study is larger and it's powered to detect mortality and hospitalization changes and that's the primary readout. And so, I think if APOLLO-B is positive, which, I've given you the reasons why we're excited. We're then very encouraged by the implications for HELIOS-B as a result. And it should speed the interim analysis and so forth of HELIOS-B. No, not really. I think you covered it, John. I think if APOLLO-B is positive then that would certainly be very exciting for anticipating the results from HELIOS-B that would accelerate the interim analysis gives us great insight into the relevant interim analysis to do. And the motivation would be to get Vutrisiran to patients faster with that IA. Yes. I mean let me just reiterate because I think it's so important what you just said that Pfizer colleagues with their investigators did wonderful work and they should speak to the value of their results and the implication direct comparisons are not valid greatly. Now having said all of that, at a very high level I think what all of us would like to see in this space, patients investigators and all of this investigating drugs is we'd like to halt the course of this terrible disease cardiomyopathy in these patients. And looking at the published Pfizer data with tafamidis, I think it's fair to say that that drug obviously has a significant impact on mortality and hospitalization 6-minute walk distance. But the overall feeling is that it's just slowing down the rate of deterioration. And what if we could just sort of hop the disease and extract stabilize these parameters like 6-minute walk distance which is what we very much look forward to doing and showing with a policy the work of Gilmore and tau which I cited earlier study of 20 companies hATTR amyloidosis patients where they looked at the cut in myopathy aspect showed stabilization compared to historic control. Now that's a single-arm study compared to historic control but that's encouraging. And everything keeps pointing to the idea that we could stabilize recently with Vutrisiran in HELIOS-A, we showed stabilization of BNP versus deterioration in the placebo. We've seen that previously with patisiran in the original APOLLO study. So I think direct comparisons are very fraud for all sorts of reasons. I think we'll have a similar population in APOLLO-B. So it will be a valid population to think about the value of the drug. And our goal is to show stabilization of the primary endpoint 6-minute walk distance. No. I just want to \u2013 with our announcement today of HELIOS-B enrollment completion by the end of the year looking very likely now. We didn't have that line of sight. We have that now. So the timing looks very conducive that will have the APOLLO-B data middle of May next year. And of course, by that time, the HELIOS-B study is fully enrolled, the patients have been on drug or placebo for a sufficient length of time, so it naturally leads to a very well-structured and planned IA after that fall for HELIOS-B. Yeah. No, I think Ritu said HELIOS-B enrollment of completion end of 2022. We're just saying today that, it should be by the end of 2021 based on our line of sight now. So yeah, end of 2022 would be about 12 months yes you're right. As for the exact details of that I think we're going to work through that and we'll share in due course, Ritu. Yeah. I mean, I think we're very happy about the encouraging safety data with Vutrisiran in HELIOS-A, as we are with GalNAc subcu conjugates overall. As to direct comparison there, I think that the patisiran arm is very small. And really, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, when the data is so skewed that way in terms of sample size. So I don't think I'd overly conclude anything as we were discussing earlier. ONPATTRO, the overall safety profile relative to placebo, where the most robust test for that of course was the original APOLLO study. The data look very encouraging and favorable ONPATTRO in terms of safety. And in the real world, as evidenced by the retention on drug and the comfort investigators feel with it patients feel with it. We're very encouraged that the real-world safety and experience is as good as it was in the original APOLLO study. So that's real testament to how it's serving patients. Yeah. The \u2013 I mean, just from a mechanical viewpoint, if you see a patient every three weeks for an intravenous infusion you're more likely to hear about a headache or whatever other intercurrent events going on in their lives as it does for all of us and it may or may not be an adverse event it may or may not be of relevance. So with the Vutrisiran being once quarterly, you're just not going to be asking the patient the same questions with the same frequency. But in either case, if something was of significance, it would emerge. And as you said, the overall safety profile for Vutrisiran does look very encouraging."

Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Christine, and thank you everyone for joining the call today. 2022 was an excellent year at Alnylam where we delivered impressive commercial performance and made significant advancements across our broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutics. Commercially, as preannounced in January, we achieved full year 2022 net product revenues of $894 million which represents year-over-year growth of 35% or 43% with constant exchange rates and 13% growth between the third and fourth quarters. A tailwind to the success was the approval and launch of AMVUTTRA in the U.S., Germany, and Japan for hereditary hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy where rapid uptake among physicians and patient reflects an attractive product profile. With our pipeline, notable progress during the year included the exciting results for APOLLO-B, our Phase 3 study of patisiran ATTR amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy. The sNDA based on these results has been accepted with a PDUFA date of October the 8th. And we look forward to the FDA's review and potential approval later this year. Pushkal will provide more color on this later in the call. Among our earlier programs, a highlight for the year was the initiation of the first-in-human study of RNAi therapeutic in the CNS with ALN-APP for Alzheimer's disease. We also completed three CTA filings advancing to the clinic promising programs such as ALN-KHK for type 2 diabetes, ALN-PNP for NASH and ALN-TTRsc04 for ATTR amyloidosis and we are announcing today the dosing has started in a Phase 1 study with this program. Looking forward to the rest of 2023, we are excited for seven important pipeline milestones, including 10 clinical readouts from Alnylam and partner led programs, such as Phase 1 results from the aforementioned ALN-APP study and Phase 2 results from the KARDIA hypertension studies of zilebesiran. This execution is in line with our focus on the following key drivers for Alnylam's group over the next several years.\nxtrahepatic:\nx25: With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks Yvonne and good morning everyone. Our commercial operations had a strong close to 2022 delivering $262 million in combined net product sales in Q4, which represented 13% growth compared with Q3 2022. The strong growth was driven by an increase in patients on commercial therapy across both our TTR and also rare franchises. We remain particularly encouraged by several signs indicating that the ongoing launch of AMVUTTRA for ATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy both in the U.S. and now also in Germany and Japan, is expanding the size of the opportunity for our TTR franchise. Now I will turn to our specific results starting with our TTR franchise. We saw robust growth in our TTR franchise in Q4 achieving $191 million in global net product revenues for ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA representing a 12% increase compared with the first quarter and a solid 38% growth compared with Q4 2021. The year-over-year growth in Q4 was driven by the strength of the AMVUTTRA launch in the U.S. with the U.S. market delivering an impressive 72% growth compared with Q4 2021. At the end of 2022, over 2,975 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA treatment worldwide, an increase of nearly 400 patients from the end of Q3, which represents a doubling of the quarterly trend that existed prior to the launch of AMVUTTRA, a clear signal of accelerating TTR franchise growth. In the U.S. combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased 12% versus the third quarter and were primarily impacted by the following. A robust 19% increase in demand growth, which was driven by the strength of the AMVUTTRA patient uptake, which is being driven both by switches from ONPATTRO and more importantly from increases in patients new to therapy. ONPATTRO inventory destocking in the channel during the fourth quarter reduced reported TTR growth by approximately 5%. This was anticipated as demand for ONPATTRO in the U.S. continues to decrease as more patients switched to AMVUTTRA. In our international markets, combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA also increased 12% versus Q3 2022, primarily driven by the success of initial international AMVUTTRA launches in Germany and Japan with growth favorably impacted both by increased patient demand and initial launch stocking. Finally, our global results continued to be challenged by foreign exchange headwinds with total TTR year-over-year reported growth of 38% deflected the foreign exchange impact of 10 percentage points due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. Now I would like to provide you with some additional color on our ongoing AMVUTTRA U.S. launch progress as well as an update on initial international launches in Germany and Japan. In the U.S., we've received more than 750 AMVUTTRA start forms in the six plus months since launch with more than 50% of the start forms representing new patients and the balance representing switches from ONPATTRO. Consistent with what we shared at Q3, the monthly average of new therapy AMVUTTRA start forms remains at 60 per month, which is double the rate of ONPATTRO new to therapy start forms that we were receiving prior to the launch of AMVUTTRA. Furthermore in the U.S. our demand generation has been healthy and balanced between community accounts and centers of excellence and we have and we have seen an approximately 30% increase in our prescriber base since launch, a clear signal that AMVUTTRA is expanding the opportunity for our TTR franchise. Additionally, our patient base has broadened to include a variety of newly and previously diagnosed patients starting on AMVUTTRA with significant enthusiasm being expressed for AMVUTTRA's product profile including quarterly subcutaneous dozing. Meanwhile, on the access front, given our parity launch pricing, we have not faced any significant access headwinds. We've also made significant progress with formulary approvals supporting smooth access to patients that are prescribed AMVUTTRA. In our international markets the initial launches of AMVUTTRA in Germany and Japan in Q4 experienced robust demands with new patient starts coming from both switches from ONPATTRO as well as new to therapy patients that were consistent with what we experienced in the U.S. in our initial launch quarters. The new to therapy patients included a healthy mix of naive to therapy and switches from the competition and ONPATTRO. Our next anticipated international launch is expected in the UK in late Q1 2023. To wrap up with AMVUTTRA, we are pleased with our initial launch progress and are encouraged by the early signs that were expanding the market opportunity for our TTR franchise. Moving to our ultra-rare disease franchise, first GIVLAARI, we achieved $47 million in global net product revenues in fourth quarter representing a 3% increase compared with Q3 2022 and 16% growth versus Q4 2021. At the end of 2022, over 520 patients were on commercial GIVLAARI treatments worldwide, up from over 460 at the end of the third quarter representing 13% quarterly patient growth. The reported 16% increase in year-over-year global net product revenue growth of GIVLAARI reflected a foreign exchange impact of 6 percentage points due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. In the U.S. sales of GIVLAARI were flat versus the third quarter, primarily due to the demand growth of 3% driven by an increase in patients on therapy, which was offset by changes in inventory stocking during the quarter. In our international markets, GIVLAARI sales increased 10% compared with the third quarter, primarily due to the growth in patients on therapy and the timing of orders in partner markets. Moving now to our second ultra-rare disease product OXLUMO. We achieved $24 million in global net product revenues in the fourth quarter representing a 45% increase compared with the third quarter. At the end of 2022 over 280 patients were on commercial OXLUMO treatment worldwide, up from over 230 at the end of the third quarter, representing 22% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S. sales of OXLUMO increased 38% versus the third quarter due to a growth in patients on therapy and an increase in average patient utilization during the quarter driven by more patients on the monthly loading dose portion of their initial treatments. In our international business sales of OXLUMO increased 50% compared with the third quarter due to an increase in patients on therapy and due to the timing of orders in partner markets. Additionally, as with ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI, changes in foreign exchange rates also negatively impacted OXLUMO Q4 2022 results with reported year-over-year growth of 24% reflected a foreign exchange impact of 9 percentage points due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. In conclusion, we are pleased with the growth in revenues and patient demand achieved in Q4 and particularly with our early signs of strong performance associated with the AMVUTTRA launch, which we believe represents an important therapy option for hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy and an accelerated growth opportunity for our TTR franchise. With that, I will now turn it over to Pushkal to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal?\nPushkal Garg: Thanks Tolga, and good morning everyone. Let me begin by updating you on our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we are advancing three clinical stage product candidates, patisiran, vutrisiran, and as I'll update in a moment, TTRsc04. First, as you've heard from Yvonne, we are delighted that our supplemental new drug application for patisiran for the cardiomyopathy of ATTR amyloidosis has been accepted by the FDA with a standard review and a PDUFA date of October 8th. In their file acceptance letter, the FDA stated that they have not identified any review issues. The agency also noted that they are planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. If approved, this will allow us to extend the potential benefits of an RNAi therapeutic to the many patients with wild type and hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. This filing is based on the pivotal APOLLO-B study, which demonstrated improved functional status and quality of life in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy given patisiran for 12 months relative to placebo. The efficacy is also supported by an encouraging safety profile and exploratory data indicating that patisiran treatment can favorably impact disease progression. With the sNDA now accepted, I'd also like to share some details on our global filing plans for patisiran in ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. We are planning to submit an sNDA in Brazil in early 2023. However, we do not plan to pursue label expansion in other regions. This is a result of the earlier than anticipated enrollment completion of the vutrisiran and HELIOS-B study combined with the timelines for regulatory approval and obtaining market access in these countries. As a result, we will focus our efforts in other regions to submitting an sNDA for vutrisiran assuming positive results from the ongoing HELIOS-B study. As a reminder, HELIOS-B is studying a similar population as APOLLO-B, but is designed for a primary outcomes endpoint of all-cause mortality and recurrent CV events. We remain on track to share top line results in early 2024. As you know, we have been evaluating a biannual dosing regimen of vutrisiran as part of the HELIOS-A randomized treatment extension or RTE, which was performed after the main portion of the study had completed. Our objective has been to see if we can provide a more convenient dosing regimen versus the already excellent profile of the 25 mg every three months regimen with maintained efficacy. The primary endpoint of the RTE was non-inferiority of TTR lowering with the 50 mg biannual regimen versus the 25 mg quarterly regimen as well as an acceptable safety profile. Today we are reporting top line results of the randomized treatment extension through month nine. As expected non-inferiority of the 50 mg biannual dosing regimen was indeed established as demonstrated by mean serum TTR reduction over nine months. However, we did note some recovery of serum TTR reduction in the 50 mg arm towards the very end of the dosing interval at six months. To illustrate this, at month six, 80% of patients on the 25 mg quarterly regimen achieved 80% knockdown or greater, whereas on the 50 mg biannual regimen, 63% of patients achieved that same degree of knockdown. In other words, 37% of patients did not get to 80% TTR knockdown with the biannual regimen. Vutrisiran also continued to demonstrate an acceptable safety profile. No safety signals regarding cardiac, hepatic or renal events were observed. In the RTE study there were six deaths of which five occurred on the 50 mg biennial arm and one occurred on the 25 mg quarterly arm, after the patient dropped out of the study. None was considered related to the study drug and the majority occurred in patients with notable preexisting cardiomyopathy at baseline in the context of known aggressive mutations. We're planning to present more details on these results in a scientific congress in early 2023. Despite the supportive efficacy data and safety data from the RTE, we've made the strategic decision not to move forward with regulatory submissions for the 50 mg biannual dosing regimen of vutrisiran as previously planned. Several factors played into that decision. First, the dynamics of serum TTR recovery observed towards the very end of the biannual dosing interval, which we believe is suboptimal in terms of a product profile where we see clamped pharmacology in order to achieve maximal efficacy for patients. Second, as you heard from Tolga, the very strong initial commercial performance of AMVUTTRA in its first two quarters on the market, given its compelling therapeutic profile with quarterly subcutaneous dosing, along with the extremely positive feedback it has received from patients and physicians, allows us to exercise greater selectivity in advancing an innovative offering.\nIKARIA Platform and: In addition to our late stage clinical programs, we believe we have also been making great progress with our early and mid-stage programs. A notable highlight includes zilebesiran, our investigational RNAi therapeutic for hypertension which we believe could transform the treatment of this disease and offer a highly differentiated profile from all existing antihypertensives including RAS inhibitors. We're thrilled to have announced that our KARDIA-1 Phase 2 study was fully enrolled as of December and on track to deliver top line results in mid-2023. We also look forward to KARDIA-2 top line results at or around year end 2023. We're also working to expand delivery of RNAi therapeutics to tissues beyond the liver. To that end, we are on the cusp of seeing important data from ALN-APP, which is our first investigational RNAi therapeutic directed to the CNS, and in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. ALN-APP has the potential to offer a highly differentiated approach in Alzheimer's disease by targeting APP upstream of where antibodies currently target and has the potential to act both intracellularly and extracellularly to reduce disease-causing peptides. We believe these initial clinical data with ALN-APP if positive will be an important milestone, not just for this particular program, but for our overall CNS platform to show that RNAi can achieve clinically relevant degrees of target knockdown in the CNS with a safety and dosing profile that supports further development. We remain on track to report top line results from the Phase 1 study in early 2023. These are just a few highlights from our broad and innovative pipeline, driven by our underlying organic product engine that we expect will deliver sustainable innovation and represents a key growth driver for Alnylam in the years to come. To wrap up these highlights, we're excited to have submitted a CTA filing for ALN-KHK in type 2 diabetes with a Phase 1 start expected imminently. In addition, our partners at Regeneron have begun dosing in a Phase 1 trial of ALN-PNP in NASH. With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff?\nJeff Poulton: Thanks Pushkal, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting Alnylam's Q4 in full year 2022 financial results, which underscore Alnylam's strong commercial capabilities and operational excellence. After commenting on our fourth quarter and full year results, I will also provide our financial guidance for 2023. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the fourth quarter and full year, total product revenues for 2022 were $894 million or 35% growth versus 2021 or 43% on a constant exchange rate basis with growth contributions from all four commercial products. Net revenue from collaborations for the fourth quarter was approximately $71 million, representing an 18% increase compared with Q4 2021, primarily due to increased revenue from our collaboration with Regeneron from increased manufacturing activities in the quarter. For the full year, net revenue from collaborations was $135 million, representing a 25% decrease compared with 2021 primarily due to a decrease in revenue recognized in connection with our collaboration agreements with Regeneron and Vir, attributed to reduced research and manufacturing activities and timing of reimbursable activities. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 16% in the fourth quarter 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in headcount to support our R&D pipeline and development expenses associated with the KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2 zilebesiran Phase 2 studies. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount and other investments in support of the global launch of AMVUTTRA and other corporate expenses to support the scaling of our business. Our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were approximately $1.4 billion for the full year 2022, representing 14% growth versus 2021 as we continue to advance our pipeline and deliver strong top line growth while maintaining discipline and how we invest in our operations.\nx25: Finally, we ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.2 billion compared to $2.4 billion at the end of 2021 with the decrease primarily due to our operating loss in 2022, which was partially offset by approximately $265 million received from employee option award exercises and approximately $135 million from our convertible debt financing. We continue to believe that our current cash balance will bridge us to financial self-sustainability, an enviable position in today's market environment. Now turning to our financial guidance for 2023, starting with net product revenues, we are providing combined net product revenue guidance from ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI, OXLUMO, and AMVUTTRA. Our guidance assumes the sNDA for patisiran for ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy in the U.S. will be approved by the PDUFA date on October 8th, 2023, and also assumes foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2022. We anticipate combined net product revenues for these four products will be between $1.2 billion and $1.285 billion with the projected report growth range versus 2022 of 34% to 44%. As you can see, we are also providing constant exchange rate growth guidance for our net product revenues this year with a projected range of 34% to 44%, highlighting no current difference between our reported and constant exchange rate growth guidance. Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties is a range between $100 million and $175 million with the midpoint of the range of approximately flat versus 2022. We anticipate the collaboration revenue associated with our partnership with Regeneron and Leqvio royalties from Novartis will drive the majority of our collaboration and royalty revenue in 2023. Our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses is a range between $1.575 billion and $1.65 billion. The midpoint of the guidance range represents a projected 13% increase compared with 2022. Growth highlights for R&D expense in 2023 include increased investment in zilebesiran as we progress the KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2 Phase 2 studies, initial investment in TTRsc04, as well as growth in pre-DC and IND enabling efforts across our preclinical portfolio as we continue to invest in creating new organic growth opportunities for the future. Growth Highlights for SG&A expense in 2023 include increased medical and commercial investment as we prepare for the potential launch of patisiran in the U.S. for ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones slated for early 2023. We will, of course, be executing on the global commercialization of our products on ONPATTRO, AMVUTTRA, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. We expect to complete enrollment in the KARDIA-2 Phase 2 studies of zilebesiran, topline results from our Phase 1 study of ALN-APP in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease is on track for early 2023 with our partner program Vir expects additional results from Phase 2 combination trials of ALN-HBV02, and Regeneron plans to initiate a Phase 2 study of ALN-HSD in patients with NASH. Let me now turn it back to Christine and coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, we will now open the call for your questions. To those dialed in, we would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each and then get back in the queue if you have additional questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ritu Baral from Cowen. Your line is now open.\nRitu Baral: Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Yvonne, I wanted to ask about just the potential topics of the advisory committee meeting. What do you think at this point, what is Alnylam planning on addressing during the Advisory Committee meeting? If no review, I'm sorry, no review issues have yet been identified in the communication are there points during the sNDA review that by law interaction is required between the sponsor and the regulator to help you suss that out? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Ritu, thank you very much for that question. I mean, as you know, we were very pleased with the results from the APOLLO-B study and please that the FDA accepted our application. And as you point out, did not identify any review issues to date. You know, whether you have an ADCOM [ph] or not is entirely up to the FDA. We have no indication at this point in time with respect to any specific areas to address as any potential advisory committee. But we look forward to engaging with the FDA through this process and sharing our data. Beyond that there's not a lot else we can say at this point in time.\nRitu Baral: So no legal interactions required for the sNDA process in the near future with you guys?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Well, we will get information as to more details around the advisory committee actual points in time, but at this stage we have no further information that we can provide. I mean, the only update that we are required to provide the FDA is the 120-day safety update.\nRitu Baral: Got it. Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Next question?\nOperator: One moment for the next question. And your next question comes from the line of David Lebowitz from Citi. Your line is now open.\nDavid Lebowitz:\nIKARIA:\nYvonne Greenstreet: Right, so I'll start off and then invite Pushkal to contribute. I think really the first thing to say is that the quarterly regimen of AMVUTTRA has really been a game changer for patients with TTR Polyneuropathy, and we are really pleased with the profile. You've heard from Tolga earlier, you know how well the launch is going. So really the decision to not move forward with a six monthly regimen was a strategic one. We want to be able to focus on the quarterly AMVUTTRA regimen in the near-term.\nIKARIA:\nPushkal Garg:\nIKARIA:\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks. Thanks Pushkal. May I have the next question?\nOperator: One moment for the next question. Your next question comes from the line of Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nTazeen Ahmad: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mine is on APP for the expected top line that's due in the beginning of this year, can you just give us some color on what data exactly you're planning on presenting and how we should interpret that data? What would be clinically meaningful? And do you also plan on presenting any plaque [ph] clearance data with that top line? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: We didn\u2019t actually kind of hear all of the questions. Do you mind perhaps repeating it and maybe focusing on just one question?\nTazeen Ahmad: Yes. The question is on what you're going to present at the top line? What should we include in that assumption of what you're going to be presenting? So would you be [indiscernible]\nYvonne Greenstreet: Fine, that's really clear, so top line\u2026\nTazeen Ahmad: Yeah.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Topline data from the ALN-APP study. Pushkal?\nPushkal Garg: Yeah. Thanks, Tazeen. So, yes, we're really excited about the ALN-APP program. It's our first foray into the CNS. We're still on track to have top line data in the first half of this year. As a reminder, this is a study in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease. We're in the single ascending dose phase of that study. And what we are hoping to report out on will be safety and tolerability, which is the primary endpoint. This is the first time we're giving intrathecal injection with the C16 conjugate, and then looking for target engagement, a knockdown of soluble APP alpha and beta. So we have very good pharmacodynamic markers that can point to target engagement. And we will want to see evidence of target engagement there that we're seeing good pharmacology in the brain. So those are really the key things that we'll be reporting on later in the first half of the year.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks Pushkal. Next question?\nOperator: One moment for the next question. And your next question comes through the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Tommy on for Salveen. Thanks so much for taking our questions. For HELIOS-B can you remind us of the rationale behind using all-cause mortality instead of cardiovascular mortality in the composite primary endpoint? And is there one that's preferred by physicians and regulators? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks. And I guess that's a question straight for you, Pushkal.\nPushkal Garg: Yeah. So Salveen I think when we, you know, when we look at, when we designed the HELIOS-B study, we really want to ultimately show the benefit of the drug on the totality of the experience of patients with this disease. And an all-cause mortality and recurrent CV event endpoint really captures, maximizes the number of events that we can capture in the course of the study which aids in the powering of the study and also becomes a very clinically meaningful effect. Certainly there can be analyses that are looked at under that as secondaries or post hocs that look at the various types of mortality events. But that's the basic explanation.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Next question?\nOperator: One moment for the next question. The next question comes from the line of Maury Raycroft from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nMaury Raycroft: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you have a tentative date scheduled for the adcom and you've mentioned adding the 120-day safety data from APOLLO-B open label extension, but I'm wondering if you can discuss possible scenarios where you may be able to supplement the sNDA with additional efficacy or safety data from APOLLO-B, open label extension and or the HELIOS-B study.\nPushkal Garg: Yes, so Maury, maybe a couple questions in there. You know, we don't have a formal date yet. That's something again, we've released what we understand at the moment from the agency's correspondence with us. So we'll look forward to getting additional information on that. And in terms of the 18-month data, look we're in the process of getting and reviewing the APOLLO-B open label extension data. As a reminder, everybody crosses over to active drug at month-12. And we'll certainly share those data at an appropriate scientific meeting. And with regard to the agency, we'll be supplying whatever they need to facilitate their review. And so, we're looking forward to sharing things, the data with them, both from the main study and as they need from the open label extension. The day 120 safety update is primarily focused on safety update data, so that will also be a parallel process.\nMaury Raycroft: Understood. Okay, thanks for taking my question.\nPushkal Garg: Sure.\nOperator: And one moment for the next question. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Matteis with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nPaul Matteis: Hey, thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on the progress. I was, I thought it was really interesting that you included potential sales from ONPATTRO in TTR cardiomyopathy in guidance, given that it's under review, given that there is an adcom, and I guess is it the right interpretation of that decision, that the company continues to have very high conviction that the APOLLO-B data should lead to an approval, and that was enough for you to plan financially and guide around that? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, well, I mean, I'll start and then hand it over to Jeff in terms of how we thought about planning. I mean, clearly, we do believe that the APOLLO-B study has delivered actually very impactful results, both in terms of health status and disease progress. We've talked about the efficacy endpoints in some detail. And clearly we are planning for the advisory committee as notified by the FDA. And obviously you know, we will have to await the FDA's determination on our submission. But you know, we believe that we have an efficacy and safety package here that is pretty compelling. Jeff, do you want to speak a little bit to how we thought about ONPATTRO CM revenues?\nJeff Poulton: Yes, I mean, Paul, you're right. I mean, we flagged that in the guidance on the slide that we assumed that. Again, given the timing of that, given that it's in the fourth quarter, the impact of that from a revenue perspective, that this year is going to be relatively modest. And so, not, that doesn't really have a significant impact on the financial guidance we've given for the year as a result, if approved, we would expect more significant impact next year.\nPaul Matteis: Thanks so much.\nOperator: And one moment for your next question. The next question comes from the line of Gena Wang with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nGena Wang: Thank you. I have one question regarding the APP program. What will be the ideal clinical profile regarding percentage of knockdown and the frequency of dosing? Any negative review from vutrisiran by any dosing data regarding frequency of dosing for the APP program?\nPushkal Garg: Yes, Gina, thanks for your question. So I guess a couple things in there. You know, what's the ideal profile? So look, I think this is the, you know, we've said before that we don't have the, from genetic data, we would imagine that we would want get to close to about 50% knockdown of ALN-APP of amyloid precursor protein. We think that's probably around the target range to get to a therapeutic effect, but at the end of the day, no one really knows. And so that's kind of where we're shooting for. But this is again an initial single ascending dose study. We'll be providing some interim data and so we'll be working our way up to get to higher levels of knockdown as the data allow and so that's point one. In terms of the frequency of dosing, look, the preclinical data that we have suggests that this may be a relatively infrequently dosed molecule. We've seen knockdown lasting over six months in the non-human primate studies that we've done with ALN-APP. So we're very encouraged with the potential that this could be a quarterly or potentially biannually dosed drug in the CNS. But again, the data will inform that. I don't think there's any particular read-through from the increased randomized treatment extension that's a different molecule given to a different space. It's a different conjugate. And as you know, we continue to -- our scientists continue to hone our chemistry all the time, but a lot of that is also molecule and target dependent. So we're very encouraged by the data we have so far non-clinically and really looking forward to the clinical data emerging shortly.\nGena Wang: Thank you very much.\nPushkal Garg: Thanks, Gena.\nOperator: For your next question. Your next question comes from the line of Luca Issi with RBC Capital. Your line is open.\nLuca Issi: Oh, great. Thanks so much for taking my question, and congrats on the progress. I have a quick one on HELIOS-B. I think there's a few docs out there that are convinced that actually the drug is making an impact for their patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy, but they are just worried that this trial is not long enough to actually show a convincing separation of the curves. Is there a scenario where you can amend the protocol so you don't read out the primary endpoint when the last patients reach the 30-month mark, but rather after a pre-specified number of events? Any thoughts there? I much appreciate it.\nPushkal Garg: Yes, Luca, I think, you know, there's, and first of all, it's great that you're getting that sort of feedback. We're obviously encouraged overall by the profile of vutrisiran and that we're seeing from patients out there. In terms of the study design, I think we've a, I'll just remind you, we have a track record of working in this space for quite a while and executing successful studies. Our teams have gone through and we feel very good about the design of the study and the execution of this study. As a reminder, we've got variable follow up for 30 to 36 months. And this study builds upon the success and what we've seen in terms of encouraging data coming out of APOLLO-B where we saw positive impacts on functional endpoints, quality of life, evidence of potential delays in disease progression and favorable impacts on echocardiographic parameters, technicians, and there's a lot of positive data there. And HELIOS-B is twice as large and about three times as long. So we feel good about the design and execution of that study, and we're not planning at this point to make any changes.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, spot on Pushkal. I mean, right now we're focused on robust execution and bringing this home and sharing results with you in early 2024.\nLuca Issi: Got it. Super helpful. Thank you, guys.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Next question,\nOperator: One moment for your next question. And your next question comes from the line of Jessica Fye with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. This is Jail for Jess. So two questions from us on the sNDA of ONPATTRO, in the case that the FDA will request any new data, or in the case that you might want to send more data to the FDA, do you expect any type of PDUFA extension because of the new data submission? And then secondly, we know that the cardiovascular outcome data from [indiscernible] trial will be available in July. So just curious, would you be watching for the data from the [indiscernible] CM and if any thought you can share with us regarding the kind of potential impact on the tribute data on your thinking of the change in patient population and anything along those lines? Thank you very much.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Two questions for you really here, Pushkal. One on the sNDA was on ONPATTRO and requirement for new data and potential extensions, the data and then I think some questions around our perspectives on [indiscernible] cardiomyopathy outcome study.\nPushkal Garg: Yes, thank you. Look, in terms of the impact if we're asked to supply additional data, I really can't speculate. Certainly we will provide whatever data the agency requires to facilitate their review. And we look forward to sharing that data in the course of questions that come from the agency and at the advisory committee. The FDA has declared a PDUFA date of October 8, and I know they'll be striving to achieve that, and we'll update if there's any changes to that based on their requests. In terms of the [indiscernible] data, look, we look forward to seeing the results. I think it's scheduled for the middle of the year, but I don't think that really changes anything for us in the context of the APOLLO-B sNDA. That study is completed and under review and so we'll certainly be looking for those results, but -- and watching them, but there's, I don't see any really particular impact on the APOLLO-B sNDA.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, so informative for the field, yes. But of no real kind of consequence to our specific programs, correct, yes. Next question?\nOperator: One moment for the next question and your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. May be just a quick one on AMVUTTRA in polyneuropathy. I noticed you got a J-Code in early January. Just curious what impact you think that could have on the trajectory of the launch and is it potential we could see an inflection there? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, that's a nice short question for Tolga, implications of the, our receipts of the J-Code.\nTolga Tanguler: Right. Hi Mike. Thanks for the question. We're very pleased with the fact that the J-Code we received the J-Code as a, on the due date. Prior to the J-Code we already had a generic J-Code that allowed us to be able to have access to provide the right access to our patients in the U.S. Therefore, we wouldn't necessarily be expecting any significant change. Now in terms of the outtake is already itself has been, as Yvonne put it, has been a game changer. We have doubled the number of start forms that we would normally receive in a steady state of ONPATTRO. Therefore, we're very pleased with the accelerated growth that our parity pricing at launch, as well as our good value based access strategies that we were able to establish prior to the launch, that's really allowing us to have a smooth sailing in terms of the access front, and the growth is really coming from thanks to the profile of the product as well as our efforts in expanding the prescriber base for the polyneuropathy across the U.S. as well as now in Japan and Germany.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Tolga. Next question, please?\nOperator: One moment for the next question and your next question comes from the line of Myles Minter with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nMyles Minter: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just on the HELIOS extension and the 50 mg biannual dosing, did the five patients that passed away in that arm all achieve the 80% TTR knockdown, or did they not? And did they all die from cardiomyopathy? There just again seems to be an imbalance between mortality on the 25 mg every quarter and the 50 mg biannual. And we know that the 25 mg quarterly is efficacious. So just clarifying that would be helpful.\nTolga Tanguler:\nBNP: As an example, three out of the five patients in the 50 mg biannual regimen who passed away had glue 89 glen [ph] and Serine 77 [indiscernible] mutations, which are particularly aggressive, so make the causes too, some CB, but some were non-CB. As an example, one of the patients who passed away in the biannual regimen was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and died after chemotherapy. And then we looked you know, there was no relationship to pharmacokinetics or as you were asking pharmacodynamics a knocked down that we observed. So we'll provide more details in upcoming scientific meetings. But we're very reassured from the detailed safety analysis, which did not, did not to our minds seem to be any relationship to the drug.\nMyles Minter: Right. Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for the next question, and your next question comes from the line of Joseph Stringer from Needham and Co. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Barbara on for Joey, and our question is about the big picture. Can you give us a sense of what you think ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA's combined market penetration of the TTR polyneuropathy and mixed phenotypes is at this time?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, I think, I think just kind of taking a step back and thinking about the TTR market as a whole, I mean, there's no doubt that it's a rapidly growing market with increased physician awareness, increased diagnosis of patients, and obviously that's translating into increased treatment of patients. So we are very excited that we have two RNAi therapeutics participating and helping patients who have ATTR Amyloidosis at the moment with polyneuropathy, and then of course, hoping to extend the label to patients who also have cardiomyopathy. We think it's a market that also has room for multiple players. It really is all about kind of market growth rather than market share. And I think what's particularly pertinent with respect to our portfolio is, we really see our portfolio driving growth overall going forward for Alnylam. So, you know, we're very pleased with our progress thus far. And you know, we look to continue helping physicians, treat patients as appropriate with both ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA. I mean, Tolga is there anything you want to add in terms of just stepping back and thinking about the TTR market?\nTolga Tanguler: Yes, I mean, along the same lines we're very pleased to be able to provide now we do have a franchise. We have two products that are available in the US? and soon for the rest of the world in polyneuropathy. And what we know is despite the fact that it's a rare disease, there is still significant unmet need, it's a devastating disease. If the patients are not treated, they do end up with mortality care mobility in a timeframe of five to seven years. And despite that, diagnosis and treatment is still relatively low numbers. And what AMVUTTRA launch has demonstrated to us is the fact that having a very compelling product profile and with the convenience of subcutaneous injectable every quarter really does change the game in terms of how it allows us to be able to reach more patients through by actually finding more, more physicians. So we do have this prevalence number that's anywhere between 40,000 to 50,000 across the world, including the mixed genocide patients. We're still scratching the surface and as Yvonne indicated with these products coming into the market will allow us to actually increase the awareness, both on the physician side as well as on the patient's side. And the most recent launch of AMVUTTRA clearly demonstrates that.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Tolga. So we've got time for one last question.\nOperator: One moment for the last question, and your last question comes from the line of Eliana Merle with UBS. Your line is now open.\nEliana Merle: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Just on the ONPATTRO ADCOM, I guess just from the interactions and feedback from the FDA so far, do you get the sense that this ADCOM is more specific to the APOLLO-B data, such as being at 12 months, or do you think it sort of is more broadly about the ATTR landscape in cardiomyopathy and the clinical significance in different subgroups? I mean, I guess like in other words, how much do you think the ADCOM would impact AMVUTTRA potential labeling discussion versus this being more of an APOLLO-B specific related discussion at the ADCOM? Thanks.\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks Ellie for your question. Again, as we've said at the beginning, we don't have any particular feedback from the agency on the specifics of what the ADCOM will be or the questions there. And we'll certainly look forward to hearing more from the agency. We're committed to supporting their review in any way we can. I do expect that the ADCOM is going to be focused on the APOLLO-B data however. That's the sNDA that we filed and that would be the subject of the review. Those would be the data that we'd be sharing and talking about in the context of that -- the review and the advisory committee as well. But again, we'll look forward to seeing more from the agency when they get back to us with details.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, and again, I think just to underscore that we believe the APOLLO-B data actually, you know has demonstrated the hypothesis that RNAi therapeutics can have a meaningful impact on patients with TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. So we shall stop there. Thank you everybody for joining the call. We're really happy with the progress that we've made in the fourth quarter and the full year 2022. We've had strong commercial results. We've continued to advance our diverse pipeline of programs and developments, and we've also got a number of exciting catalysts on deck in 2023. So we look forward to updating you along the way as we continue to deliver on these goals. So thank you everybody, and have a great day.\nOperator: Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tolga Tanguler",
            "content": "Thanks Yvonne and good morning everyone. Our commercial operations had a strong close to 2022 delivering $262 million in combined net product sales in Q4, which represented 13% growth compared with Q3 2022. The strong growth was driven by an increase in patients on commercial therapy across both our TTR and also rare franchises. We remain particularly encouraged by several signs indicating that the ongoing launch of AMVUTTRA for ATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy both in the U.S. and now also in Germany and Japan, is expanding the size of the opportunity for our TTR franchise. Now I will turn to our specific results starting with our TTR franchise. We saw robust growth in our TTR franchise in Q4 achieving $191 million in global net product revenues for ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA representing a 12% increase compared with the first quarter and a solid 38% growth compared with Q4 2021. The year-over-year growth in Q4 was driven by the strength of the AMVUTTRA launch in the U.S. with the U.S. market delivering an impressive 72% growth compared with Q4 2021. At the end of 2022, over 2,975 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA treatment worldwide, an increase of nearly 400 patients from the end of Q3, which represents a doubling of the quarterly trend that existed prior to the launch of AMVUTTRA, a clear signal of accelerating TTR franchise growth. In the U.S. combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased 12% versus the third quarter and were primarily impacted by the following. A robust 19% increase in demand growth, which was driven by the strength of the AMVUTTRA patient uptake, which is being driven both by switches from ONPATTRO and more importantly from increases in patients new to therapy. ONPATTRO inventory destocking in the channel during the fourth quarter reduced reported TTR growth by approximately 5%. This was anticipated as demand for ONPATTRO in the U.S. continues to decrease as more patients switched to AMVUTTRA. In our international markets, combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA also increased 12% versus Q3 2022, primarily driven by the success of initial international AMVUTTRA launches in Germany and Japan with growth favorably impacted both by increased patient demand and initial launch stocking. Finally, our global results continued to be challenged by foreign exchange headwinds with total TTR year-over-year reported growth of 38% deflected the foreign exchange impact of 10 percentage points due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. Now I would like to provide you with some additional color on our ongoing AMVUTTRA U.S. launch progress as well as an update on initial international launches in Germany and Japan. In the U.S., we've received more than 750 AMVUTTRA start forms in the six plus months since launch with more than 50% of the start forms representing new patients and the balance representing switches from ONPATTRO. Consistent with what we shared at Q3, the monthly average of new therapy AMVUTTRA start forms remains at 60 per month, which is double the rate of ONPATTRO new to therapy start forms that we were receiving prior to the launch of AMVUTTRA. Furthermore in the U.S. our demand generation has been healthy and balanced between community accounts and centers of excellence and we have and we have seen an approximately 30% increase in our prescriber base since launch, a clear signal that AMVUTTRA is expanding the opportunity for our TTR franchise. Additionally, our patient base has broadened to include a variety of newly and previously diagnosed patients starting on AMVUTTRA with significant enthusiasm being expressed for AMVUTTRA's product profile including quarterly subcutaneous dozing. Meanwhile, on the access front, given our parity launch pricing, we have not faced any significant access headwinds. We've also made significant progress with formulary approvals supporting smooth access to patients that are prescribed AMVUTTRA. In our international markets the initial launches of AMVUTTRA in Germany and Japan in Q4 experienced robust demands with new patient starts coming from both switches from ONPATTRO as well as new to therapy patients that were consistent with what we experienced in the U.S. in our initial launch quarters. The new to therapy patients included a healthy mix of naive to therapy and switches from the competition and ONPATTRO. Our next anticipated international launch is expected in the UK in late Q1 2023. To wrap up with AMVUTTRA, we are pleased with our initial launch progress and are encouraged by the early signs that were expanding the market opportunity for our TTR franchise. Moving to our ultra-rare disease franchise, first GIVLAARI, we achieved $47 million in global net product revenues in fourth quarter representing a 3% increase compared with Q3 2022 and 16% growth versus Q4 2021. At the end of 2022, over 520 patients were on commercial GIVLAARI treatments worldwide, up from over 460 at the end of the third quarter representing 13% quarterly patient growth. The reported 16% increase in year-over-year global net product revenue growth of GIVLAARI reflected a foreign exchange impact of 6 percentage points due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. In the U.S. sales of GIVLAARI were flat versus the third quarter, primarily due to the demand growth of 3% driven by an increase in patients on therapy, which was offset by changes in inventory stocking during the quarter. In our international markets, GIVLAARI sales increased 10% compared with the third quarter, primarily due to the growth in patients on therapy and the timing of orders in partner markets. Moving now to our second ultra-rare disease product OXLUMO. We achieved $24 million in global net product revenues in the fourth quarter representing a 45% increase compared with the third quarter. At the end of 2022 over 280 patients were on commercial OXLUMO treatment worldwide, up from over 230 at the end of the third quarter, representing 22% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S. sales of OXLUMO increased 38% versus the third quarter due to a growth in patients on therapy and an increase in average patient utilization during the quarter driven by more patients on the monthly loading dose portion of their initial treatments. In our international business sales of OXLUMO increased 50% compared with the third quarter due to an increase in patients on therapy and due to the timing of orders in partner markets. Additionally, as with ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI, changes in foreign exchange rates also negatively impacted OXLUMO Q4 2022 results with reported year-over-year growth of 24% reflected a foreign exchange impact of 9 percentage points due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. In conclusion, we are pleased with the growth in revenues and patient demand achieved in Q4 and particularly with our early signs of strong performance associated with the AMVUTTRA launch, which we believe represents an important therapy option for hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy and an accelerated growth opportunity for our TTR franchise. With that, I will now turn it over to Pushkal to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal? Right. Hi Mike. Thanks for the question. We're very pleased with the fact that the J-Code we received the J-Code as a, on the due date. Prior to the J-Code we already had a generic J-Code that allowed us to be able to have access to provide the right access to our patients in the U.S. Therefore, we wouldn't necessarily be expecting any significant change. Now in terms of the outtake is already itself has been, as Yvonne put it, has been a game changer. We have doubled the number of start forms that we would normally receive in a steady state of ONPATTRO. Therefore, we're very pleased with the accelerated growth that our parity pricing at launch, as well as our good value based access strategies that we were able to establish prior to the launch, that's really allowing us to have a smooth sailing in terms of the access front, and the growth is really coming from thanks to the profile of the product as well as our efforts in expanding the prescriber base for the polyneuropathy across the U.S. as well as now in Japan and Germany. BNP: As an example, three out of the five patients in the 50 mg biannual regimen who passed away had glue 89 glen [ph] and Serine 77 [indiscernible] mutations, which are particularly aggressive, so make the causes too, some CB, but some were non-CB. As an example, one of the patients who passed away in the biannual regimen was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and died after chemotherapy. And then we looked you know, there was no relationship to pharmacokinetics or as you were asking pharmacodynamics a knocked down that we observed. So we'll provide more details in upcoming scientific meetings. But we're very reassured from the detailed safety analysis, which did not, did not to our minds seem to be any relationship to the drug.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Pushkal Garg",
            "content": "Thanks Tolga, and good morning everyone. Let me begin by updating you on our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we are advancing three clinical stage product candidates, patisiran, vutrisiran, and as I'll update in a moment, TTRsc04. First, as you've heard from Yvonne, we are delighted that our supplemental new drug application for patisiran for the cardiomyopathy of ATTR amyloidosis has been accepted by the FDA with a standard review and a PDUFA date of October 8th. In their file acceptance letter, the FDA stated that they have not identified any review issues. The agency also noted that they are planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. If approved, this will allow us to extend the potential benefits of an RNAi therapeutic to the many patients with wild type and hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. This filing is based on the pivotal APOLLO-B study, which demonstrated improved functional status and quality of life in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy given patisiran for 12 months relative to placebo. The efficacy is also supported by an encouraging safety profile and exploratory data indicating that patisiran treatment can favorably impact disease progression. With the sNDA now accepted, I'd also like to share some details on our global filing plans for patisiran in ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. We are planning to submit an sNDA in Brazil in early 2023. However, we do not plan to pursue label expansion in other regions. This is a result of the earlier than anticipated enrollment completion of the vutrisiran and HELIOS-B study combined with the timelines for regulatory approval and obtaining market access in these countries. As a result, we will focus our efforts in other regions to submitting an sNDA for vutrisiran assuming positive results from the ongoing HELIOS-B study. As a reminder, HELIOS-B is studying a similar population as APOLLO-B, but is designed for a primary outcomes endpoint of all-cause mortality and recurrent CV events. We remain on track to share top line results in early 2024. As you know, we have been evaluating a biannual dosing regimen of vutrisiran as part of the HELIOS-A randomized treatment extension or RTE, which was performed after the main portion of the study had completed. Our objective has been to see if we can provide a more convenient dosing regimen versus the already excellent profile of the 25 mg every three months regimen with maintained efficacy. The primary endpoint of the RTE was non-inferiority of TTR lowering with the 50 mg biannual regimen versus the 25 mg quarterly regimen as well as an acceptable safety profile. Today we are reporting top line results of the randomized treatment extension through month nine. As expected non-inferiority of the 50 mg biannual dosing regimen was indeed established as demonstrated by mean serum TTR reduction over nine months. However, we did note some recovery of serum TTR reduction in the 50 mg arm towards the very end of the dosing interval at six months. To illustrate this, at month six, 80% of patients on the 25 mg quarterly regimen achieved 80% knockdown or greater, whereas on the 50 mg biannual regimen, 63% of patients achieved that same degree of knockdown. In other words, 37% of patients did not get to 80% TTR knockdown with the biannual regimen. Vutrisiran also continued to demonstrate an acceptable safety profile. No safety signals regarding cardiac, hepatic or renal events were observed. In the RTE study there were six deaths of which five occurred on the 50 mg biennial arm and one occurred on the 25 mg quarterly arm, after the patient dropped out of the study. None was considered related to the study drug and the majority occurred in patients with notable preexisting cardiomyopathy at baseline in the context of known aggressive mutations. We're planning to present more details on these results in a scientific congress in early 2023. Despite the supportive efficacy data and safety data from the RTE, we've made the strategic decision not to move forward with regulatory submissions for the 50 mg biannual dosing regimen of vutrisiran as previously planned. Several factors played into that decision. First, the dynamics of serum TTR recovery observed towards the very end of the biannual dosing interval, which we believe is suboptimal in terms of a product profile where we see clamped pharmacology in order to achieve maximal efficacy for patients. Second, as you heard from Tolga, the very strong initial commercial performance of AMVUTTRA in its first two quarters on the market, given its compelling therapeutic profile with quarterly subcutaneous dosing, along with the extremely positive feedback it has received from patients and physicians, allows us to exercise greater selectivity in advancing an innovative offering. Yeah. Thanks, Tazeen. So, yes, we're really excited about the ALN-APP program. It's our first foray into the CNS. We're still on track to have top line data in the first half of this year. As a reminder, this is a study in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease. We're in the single ascending dose phase of that study. And what we are hoping to report out on will be safety and tolerability, which is the primary endpoint. This is the first time we're giving intrathecal injection with the C16 conjugate, and then looking for target engagement, a knockdown of soluble APP alpha and beta. So we have very good pharmacodynamic markers that can point to target engagement. And we will want to see evidence of target engagement there that we're seeing good pharmacology in the brain. So those are really the key things that we'll be reporting on later in the first half of the year. Yeah. So Salveen I think when we, you know, when we look at, when we designed the HELIOS-B study, we really want to ultimately show the benefit of the drug on the totality of the experience of patients with this disease. And an all-cause mortality and recurrent CV event endpoint really captures, maximizes the number of events that we can capture in the course of the study which aids in the powering of the study and also becomes a very clinically meaningful effect. Certainly there can be analyses that are looked at under that as secondaries or post hocs that look at the various types of mortality events. But that's the basic explanation. Yes, so Maury, maybe a couple questions in there. You know, we don't have a formal date yet. That's something again, we've released what we understand at the moment from the agency's correspondence with us. So we'll look forward to getting additional information on that. And in terms of the 18-month data, look we're in the process of getting and reviewing the APOLLO-B open label extension data. As a reminder, everybody crosses over to active drug at month-12. And we'll certainly share those data at an appropriate scientific meeting. And with regard to the agency, we'll be supplying whatever they need to facilitate their review. And so, we're looking forward to sharing things, the data with them, both from the main study and as they need from the open label extension. The day 120 safety update is primarily focused on safety update data, so that will also be a parallel process. Sure. Yes, Gina, thanks for your question. So I guess a couple things in there. You know, what's the ideal profile? So look, I think this is the, you know, we've said before that we don't have the, from genetic data, we would imagine that we would want get to close to about 50% knockdown of ALN-APP of amyloid precursor protein. We think that's probably around the target range to get to a therapeutic effect, but at the end of the day, no one really knows. And so that's kind of where we're shooting for. But this is again an initial single ascending dose study. We'll be providing some interim data and so we'll be working our way up to get to higher levels of knockdown as the data allow and so that's point one. In terms of the frequency of dosing, look, the preclinical data that we have suggests that this may be a relatively infrequently dosed molecule. We've seen knockdown lasting over six months in the non-human primate studies that we've done with ALN-APP. So we're very encouraged with the potential that this could be a quarterly or potentially biannually dosed drug in the CNS. But again, the data will inform that. I don't think there's any particular read-through from the increased randomized treatment extension that's a different molecule given to a different space. It's a different conjugate. And as you know, we continue to -- our scientists continue to hone our chemistry all the time, but a lot of that is also molecule and target dependent. So we're very encouraged by the data we have so far non-clinically and really looking forward to the clinical data emerging shortly. Thanks, Gena. Yes, Luca, I think, you know, there's, and first of all, it's great that you're getting that sort of feedback. We're obviously encouraged overall by the profile of vutrisiran and that we're seeing from patients out there. In terms of the study design, I think we've a, I'll just remind you, we have a track record of working in this space for quite a while and executing successful studies. Our teams have gone through and we feel very good about the design of the study and the execution of this study. As a reminder, we've got variable follow up for 30 to 36 months. And this study builds upon the success and what we've seen in terms of encouraging data coming out of APOLLO-B where we saw positive impacts on functional endpoints, quality of life, evidence of potential delays in disease progression and favorable impacts on echocardiographic parameters, technicians, and there's a lot of positive data there. And HELIOS-B is twice as large and about three times as long. So we feel good about the design and execution of that study, and we're not planning at this point to make any changes. Yes, thank you. Look, in terms of the impact if we're asked to supply additional data, I really can't speculate. Certainly we will provide whatever data the agency requires to facilitate their review. And we look forward to sharing that data in the course of questions that come from the agency and at the advisory committee. The FDA has declared a PDUFA date of October 8, and I know they'll be striving to achieve that, and we'll update if there's any changes to that based on their requests. In terms of the [indiscernible] data, look, we look forward to seeing the results. I think it's scheduled for the middle of the year, but I don't think that really changes anything for us in the context of the APOLLO-B sNDA. That study is completed and under review and so we'll certainly be looking for those results, but -- and watching them, but there's, I don't see any really particular impact on the APOLLO-B sNDA."

            "content": "Thanks Pushkal, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting Alnylam's Q4 in full year 2022 financial results, which underscore Alnylam's strong commercial capabilities and operational excellence. After commenting on our fourth quarter and full year results, I will also provide our financial guidance for 2023. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for the fourth quarter and full year, total product revenues for 2022 were $894 million or 35% growth versus 2021 or 43% on a constant exchange rate basis with growth contributions from all four commercial products. Net revenue from collaborations for the fourth quarter was approximately $71 million, representing an 18% increase compared with Q4 2021, primarily due to increased revenue from our collaboration with Regeneron from increased manufacturing activities in the quarter. For the full year, net revenue from collaborations was $135 million, representing a 25% decrease compared with 2021 primarily due to a decrease in revenue recognized in connection with our collaboration agreements with Regeneron and Vir, attributed to reduced research and manufacturing activities and timing of reimbursable activities. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 16% in the fourth quarter 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in headcount to support our R&D pipeline and development expenses associated with the KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2 zilebesiran Phase 2 studies. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount and other investments in support of the global launch of AMVUTTRA and other corporate expenses to support the scaling of our business. Our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were approximately $1.4 billion for the full year 2022, representing 14% growth versus 2021 as we continue to advance our pipeline and deliver strong top line growth while maintaining discipline and how we invest in our operations. Yes, I mean, Paul, you're right. I mean, we flagged that in the guidance on the slide that we assumed that. Again, given the timing of that, given that it's in the fourth quarter, the impact of that from a revenue perspective, that this year is going to be relatively modest. And so, not, that doesn't really have a significant impact on the financial guidance we've given for the year as a result, if approved, we would expect more significant impact next year."

            "content": "Thanks, Christine, and thank you everyone for joining the call today. 2022 was an excellent year at Alnylam where we delivered impressive commercial performance and made significant advancements across our broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutics. Commercially, as preannounced in January, we achieved full year 2022 net product revenues of $894 million which represents year-over-year growth of 35% or 43% with constant exchange rates and 13% growth between the third and fourth quarters. A tailwind to the success was the approval and launch of AMVUTTRA in the U.S., Germany, and Japan for hereditary hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy where rapid uptake among physicians and patient reflects an attractive product profile. With our pipeline, notable progress during the year included the exciting results for APOLLO-B, our Phase 3 study of patisiran ATTR amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy. The sNDA based on these results has been accepted with a PDUFA date of October the 8th. And we look forward to the FDA's review and potential approval later this year. Pushkal will provide more color on this later in the call. Among our earlier programs, a highlight for the year was the initiation of the first-in-human study of RNAi therapeutic in the CNS with ALN-APP for Alzheimer's disease. We also completed three CTA filings advancing to the clinic promising programs such as ALN-KHK for type 2 diabetes, ALN-PNP for NASH and ALN-TTRsc04 for ATTR amyloidosis and we are announcing today the dosing has started in a Phase 1 study with this program. Looking forward to the rest of 2023, we are excited for seven important pipeline milestones, including 10 clinical readouts from Alnylam and partner led programs, such as Phase 1 results from the aforementioned ALN-APP study and Phase 2 results from the KARDIA hypertension studies of zilebesiran. This execution is in line with our focus on the following key drivers for Alnylam's group over the next several years. Ritu, thank you very much for that question. I mean, as you know, we were very pleased with the results from the APOLLO-B study and please that the FDA accepted our application. And as you point out, did not identify any review issues to date. You know, whether you have an ADCOM [ph] or not is entirely up to the FDA. We have no indication at this point in time with respect to any specific areas to address as any potential advisory committee. But we look forward to engaging with the FDA through this process and sharing our data. Beyond that there's not a lot else we can say at this point in time. Well, we will get information as to more details around the advisory committee actual points in time, but at this stage we have no further information that we can provide. I mean, the only update that we are required to provide the FDA is the 120-day safety update. Next question? Right, so I'll start off and then invite Pushkal to contribute. I think really the first thing to say is that the quarterly regimen of AMVUTTRA has really been a game changer for patients with TTR Polyneuropathy, and we are really pleased with the profile. You've heard from Tolga earlier, you know how well the launch is going. So really the decision to not move forward with a six monthly regimen was a strategic one. We want to be able to focus on the quarterly AMVUTTRA regimen in the near-term. We didn\u2019t actually kind of hear all of the questions. Do you mind perhaps repeating it and maybe focusing on just one question? Fine, that's really clear, so top line\u2026 Topline data from the ALN-APP study. Pushkal? Thanks Pushkal. Next question? Thanks. And I guess that's a question straight for you, Pushkal. Next question? Yes, well, I mean, I'll start and then hand it over to Jeff in terms of how we thought about planning. I mean, clearly, we do believe that the APOLLO-B study has delivered actually very impactful results, both in terms of health status and disease progress. We've talked about the efficacy endpoints in some detail. And clearly we are planning for the advisory committee as notified by the FDA. And obviously you know, we will have to await the FDA's determination on our submission. But you know, we believe that we have an efficacy and safety package here that is pretty compelling. Jeff, do you want to speak a little bit to how we thought about ONPATTRO CM revenues? Yes, spot on Pushkal. I mean, right now we're focused on robust execution and bringing this home and sharing results with you in early 2024. Next question, Two questions for you really here, Pushkal. One on the sNDA was on ONPATTRO and requirement for new data and potential extensions, the data and then I think some questions around our perspectives on [indiscernible] cardiomyopathy outcome study. Yes, so informative for the field, yes. But of no real kind of consequence to our specific programs, correct, yes. Next question? Yes, that's a nice short question for Tolga, implications of the, our receipts of the J-Code. Thanks, Tolga. Next question, please? Yes, I think, I think just kind of taking a step back and thinking about the TTR market as a whole, I mean, there's no doubt that it's a rapidly growing market with increased physician awareness, increased diagnosis of patients, and obviously that's translating into increased treatment of patients. So we are very excited that we have two RNAi therapeutics participating and helping patients who have ATTR Amyloidosis at the moment with polyneuropathy, and then of course, hoping to extend the label to patients who also have cardiomyopathy. We think it's a market that also has room for multiple players. It really is all about kind of market growth rather than market share. And I think what's particularly pertinent with respect to our portfolio is, we really see our portfolio driving growth overall going forward for Alnylam. So, you know, we're very pleased with our progress thus far. And you know, we look to continue helping physicians, treat patients as appropriate with both ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA. I mean, Tolga is there anything you want to add in terms of just stepping back and thinking about the TTR market? Thanks, Tolga. So we've got time for one last question. Yes, and again, I think just to underscore that we believe the APOLLO-B data actually, you know has demonstrated the hypothesis that RNAi therapeutics can have a meaningful impact on patients with TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. So we shall stop there. Thank you everybody for joining the call. We're really happy with the progress that we've made in the fourth quarter and the full year 2022. We've had strong commercial results. We've continued to advance our diverse pipeline of programs and developments, and we've also got a number of exciting catalysts on deck in 2023. So we look forward to updating you along the way as we continue to deliver on these goals. So thank you everybody, and have a great day."

Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Christine, and thank you everyone for joining the call today. We are very pleased with the results delivered in the third quarter, both commercially and with our pipeline. Commercially, this is the first full quarter of our AMVUTTRA launch since the U.S. approval back in June, which drove 30% growth in the U.S. for the TTR franchise compared to quarter two. Clinically, the TTR franchise is a high life as well. We presented positive results for the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study of vutrisiran in patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, validating the therapeutic hypothesis that RNAi-mediated silencing of TTR has the potential to result in a disease-modifying impact on the cardiac manifestations of ATTR amyloidosis. We are delighted with the totality of these results and we look forward to submitting a supplemental NDA for ONPATTRO by year end. This also gives us increased confidence in the HELIOS-B Phase 3 outcome study of vutrisiran in ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, which is on track for top line results in early 2024. Our earlier stage programs advance as well with positive results presented from the Phase 2 study of cemdisiran in patients with IgA nephropathy as well as preliminary data in patients from the ongoing Phase 1 study of ALN-HSD in development for the treatment of NASH. In the coming quarters, we expect to have more exciting updates from our pipeline, including results for potential biannual dose regimen for vutrisiran preliminary Phase 1 results and healthy volunteers for ARN XDH, an investigational RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of gout. Completion of enrollment in the KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study of zilebesiran and initiation of a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study of ALN-TTRscO4, for which we filed a CTA earlier this month. This execution is in line with our focus on these key drivers for Alnylam\u2019s growth over the next several years. Firstly, the potential near-term expansion of our TTR franchise opportunity, where we aim to become a global leader in delivering impactful and highly differentiated medicines for patients. Second our expansion beyond rare diseases and to prevalent diseases. And the third growth driver for the company comes from our sustainable innovation engine comprised of new platform enhancements, opportunities with extrahepatic delivery and our ability to find new genetically validated targets, which can drive further pipeline expansion to 2025 and beyond. We believe all of this positions us well to deliver on our Alnylam piece of it by \u201825 goal, making Alnylam a top biotech company, developing and commercializing transformative medicines for rare and prevalent diseases for patients around the world driven by a high-yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering exceptional financial results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks, Yvonne and good morning everyone. Q3 was a strong quarter for our commercial portfolio, with 9% quarter-over-quarter growth driven by a strong launch of AMVUTTRA in the U.S., as Yvonne highlighted. While still early, we are encouraged by several signs indicating that AMVUTTRA is expanding the size of the opportunity for our hATTR-PN franchise. I will have more details to share on this shortly. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to impact product revenues from our international operations as ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI, and OXLUMO Q3 product sales each experienced FX headwinds compared with the prior quarter and prior year periods. With initial sales of AMVUTTRA which are now reflected in our quarterly financial results, moving forward, we will highlight our results for ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA on a combined franchise basis. We saw robust growth in our TTR franchise in Q3, achieving $170 million in global net product revenues for ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA, representing an 11% increase compared with the second quarter and a solid 41% growth compared with Q3 2021. At the end of Q3 over 2,580 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA treatment worldwide, up from over 2,400 patients at the end of the second quarter, representing a steady 8% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S., combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased a robust 30% versus the second quarter and were primarily impacted by the following and 19% increase in demand growth, which was driven by the strength of the initial AMVUTTRA patient uptake, more than offsetting the decrease in patients on ONPATTRO that switched AMVUTTRA. In total for the quarter, 180 patients initiated AMVUTTRA treatment with over 40% representing new patients for Alnylam and the balance representing patients switching from ONPATTRO. Initial AMVUTTRA launch inventory stocking in the distribution channel increased growth an additional 11% in the quarter. In our international markets, ONPATTRO Q3 product sales decreased 5% versus Q2 \u201822 despite an increase in patients on therapy as the timing of orders in partner markets and FX headwinds offset the increase. Our global results continue to be challenged by foreign exchange headwinds, with ONPATTRO year-over-year reported growth of 41%, held back 11 percentage points due to the foreign exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Now, I\u2019d like to provide you with some additional color on our AMVUTTRA U.S. launch. In the first 4 months of launch, new patient start forms have doubled to an average of 60 start forms per month, excluding switches in comparison to 30 start forms per month for ONPATTRO in the first half of this year, which we believe highlights the strength of the AMVUTTRA launch to-date. Our demand generation has been healthy and balanced between community accounts and centers of excellence, while about 17% of start forms have been generated from new prescribers. We are seeing our patient base broaden to include a variety of newly and previously diagnosed patients starting on AMVUTTRA with significant enthusiasm being expressed for AMVUTTRA\u2019s product profile, including quarterly subcutaneous dosing. Meanwhile, on the access front, given our parity pricing to-date, we have not faced with any significant access headwinds and have made significant progress with formulary approvals, providing smooth access to patients that are put on AMVUTTRA therapy. Additionally, we are pleased with the average time from receipt of start forms to initiation of therapy for AMVUTTRA patients, which is already in line with our ONPATTRO benchmark. To wrap up with AMVUTTRA, we are also excited about the recent regulatory approvals in the EU and Japan for hATTR amylidiosis patients with polyneuropathy and are looking forward to launches in Germany and Japan in the fourth quarter. Moving to AMVUTTRA rare disease franchise, first GIVLAARI, we achieved $46 million in global net product revenues in the second quarter, representing a 1% increase compared with Q2 \u201822 and 43% growth versus Q3 \u201821. At the end of Q3, over 460 patients were on commercial GIVLAARI treatment worldwide, up from over 420 at the end of second quarter, representing 10% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S., sales of GIVLAARI increased 5% versus the second quarter primarily due to demand growth of 7% by an increase in patients on therapy, which was modestly offset by changes in inventory, stocking and gross to net sales deductions. In our international markets, GIVLAARI sales decreased 6% compared with the second quarter, with growth in patients on therapy more than offset by lower net pricing and FX headwinds. Finally, the reported 43% increase in year-over-year global net product revenue growth of GIVLAARI was held back 7 percentage points due to unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. Moving now to our second ultra-rare disease product, OXLUMO, we achieved $16 million in global net product revenues in the third quarter, representing a 10% increase compared with the second quarter. At the end of Q3, over 230 patients were on commercial OXLUMO treatment worldwide, up from over 200 at the end of the second quarter, representing 15% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S., sales of OXLUMO decreased 10% versus the second quarter as growth in patients on therapy was more than offset by decreased average patient utilization during the quarter, driven by fewer patients on the monthly loading dose portion of their initial treatment. In our international business, sales of OXLUMO increased 29% compared with the second quarter due to an increase in patients on therapy and higher net realized price during the quarter partially offset by FX headwinds. Additionally, as with ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI, changes in foreign exchange rates also negatively impacted OXLUMO Q3 \u201822 results, with reported year-over-year growth of 10% held back by 10 percentage points due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. In conclusion, we are pleased with the growth in revenues and patient demand achieved in Q3 and particularly with early signs of strong performance associated with AMVUTTRA launch, which we believe represents an important therapy option for hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy and an accelerated growth opportunity for our TTR franchise. With that, I will now turn it over to Akshay to review our recent R&D pipeline progress. Akshay?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Thanks, Tolga and good morning everyone. I will start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we are advancing two clinical stage product candidates Patisiran and Vutrisiran. Whilst ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat the polyneuropathy associated with hereditary AT amyloidosis, we are committed to expanding the product\u2019s label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end, we are excited to have recently presented positive results from the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study, where Patisiran achieved a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement relative to placebo in the 6-minute walk test at 12 months, the primary endpoint of the study. It also achieved a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement relative to placebo at 12 months on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionaire, the study\u2019s first secondary endpoint and a key measure of patient self-reported health status and quality of life. Furthermore, Patisiran demonstrated an acceptable tolerability profile and we are very encouraged by the overall safety profile of Patisiran. Collectively, we believe these efficacy results validate the therapeutic hypothesis that RNAi-mediated silencing of TTR has the potential to result in a disease-modifying impact on cardiac manifestations of ATTR amyloidosis. With these results in hand, we remain on track to submit a supplemental NDA filing for review by the FDA by the end of this year with the goal of obtaining regulatory approval in the U.S. making this medicine available to patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy as rapidly as possible. Also advancing Vutrisiran which is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection and amongst is AMVUTTRA to treat the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis. AMVUTTRA was approved based on results from the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study. That study includes an ongoing randomized treatment expansion where we are evaluating a biannual dose regimen and we are on track to share results in late 2022. As with ONPATTRO, year 2, we are committed to expanding the label to include the treatment of cardiomyopathy in hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. This is being accomplished by the HELIOS-B Phase 3 study of investigational vutrisiran. HELIOS-B, which is fully enrolled, has an endpoint of all-cause mortality and CV events assessed after at least 30 and up to 36 months and we are on track to share top line results in early 2024. As was announced this morning, after clinical consideration, we have made the decision not to conduct the optional interim analysis for HELIOS-B. Several factors drove us to this decision, including one, the early completion of enrollment of HELIOS-B, which meant that any potential acceleration in the approval based on an interim analysis was minimal relative to waiting until the readout from the fully completed study in early 2024. Two, our desire to conclude HELIOS-B with the strongest possible dataset, including outcomes data; and three, further enhancement in confidence in HELIOS-B with the recently positive APOLLO-B readout. As such, we look forward to the HELIOS-B readout as scheduled early in 2024. We have also announced this morning that while we remain very excited about the opportunity for TTR lowering to address Stargardt disease, we do not plan to initiate a Phase 3 study of vutrisiran this year as previously planned as we evaluate the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on therapies being developed from orphan disease. We are continuing to consider options for the best path forward in Stargardt disease as we recognize the significant unmet medical need in this patient population. Lastly, with regard to our TTR franchise, we are excited to announce that a clinical trial application has been filed for ALN-TTRsc04, the first clinical program from our IKARIA platform, which aims to achieve an annual dosing regimen with highly potent and reversible effects. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers by year end. In addition to our late-stage clinical programs, we believe we have also been making great progress with our early and mid-stage programs. Notable highlight this quarter was our announcement of positive results from our Phase 2 study of zilebesiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting C5 competitive complement pathway, which is in development in collaboration with Regeneron for the treatment of IgA nephropathy or IgAN. In the study, at week 32, treatment of cemdisiran results in the 37% mean reduction in baseline in the 24-hour urinary protein to creatinine ratio relative to placebo, the primary readout of the study and an important prognostic marker of disease progression. The results of secondary endpoints were also consistent with the therapeutic benefit of cemdisiran in IgAN. There were no significant drug-related safety signals and we believe these collective efficacy and safety data support continued clinical development of cemdisiran monotherapy in patients with IgAN. We look forward to gaining alignment with Regeneron to finalize plans for Phase 3 and sharing those updates with you in due course. Another exciting highlight recently was the announcement of the preliminary Phase 1 data supporting the clinical advancement of ALN-HSD, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting HSD17B13 in development for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH. After single-dose valuation in healthy adult volunteers on a) multiple doses of ALN-HSD are being studied in adult patients with NASH or b) patients in the first two Part B cohorts namely 200 and 400 milligrams quarterly, have completed at least 6 months on the study. The remaining cohorts are exploring a lower dose or a later biopsy time point. In the first two Part B cohorts, ALN-HSD was associated with robust target knockdown and numerically lower liver enzymes and biopsy-derived non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score over 6 months in patients receiving ALN-HSD relative to placebo. The study was not powered to achieve statistical significance on these endpoints and the primary outcome measure is frequency of adverse events. ALN-HSD has exhibited an encouraging pace and tolerability profile to date. Based on these results, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in adult patients with NASH in late 2022 in collaboration with Regeneron. Now turning to our ALN-APP program which is in the development for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. ALN-APP is our first investigational conjugate RNA therapeutic tying a gene expression in the central nervous system. We continue to make progress enrolling patients with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease and are progressing through the single ascending dose portion of the Phase 1 study. As we announced in our press release this morning, we now expect initial clinical data from this study in early 2023, a slight change from our previous guidance of late \u201822. This change reflects the continued progression through dose escalation cohorts at a measured pace and the rigor with which we are screening for appropriate patients for this study that meet all necessary inclusion/exclusion criteria. We believe this initial clinical data with ALN-APP is positive, will be an important milestone for our CNS platform to show that RNAi can achieve clinically relevant degrees of target outbound in the CNS with the safety and dosing profile that supports further development. And we look forward to reporting top line results from the study in early 2023. These are just a few highlights from our broad and innovative pipeline driven by our underlying organic product engine that will drive sustainable innovation and represents a key growth driver for Alnylam in the years to come. Representative of the productivity of our engine, we look forward to two further CTR-IND filings for the first in human studies before year-end, namely ALN-KHK for the treatment of metabolic liver disease, including diabetes, which is an Alnylam wholly owned program and ALN-APP for NASH in collaboration with Regeneron. We will be discussing all this in greater detail at our upcoming R&D Day being held virtually on December 15, and I encourage you to tune it. With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff?\nJeff Poulton: Thanks, Akshay, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam\u2019s Q3 2022 financial results and an update on our full year guidance. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for Q3 2022. A Total product revenues for the quarter were $232 million or 39% growth versus Q3 2021. It is also worth noting that year-over-year growth in combined product revenues was held back by approximately 10% due to the foreign exchange impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar and given that approximately 45% of our product revenues are generated via sales in international markets. Net revenue from collaborations for the third quarter was approximately $29 million, representing a 45% increase compared with Q3 2021, primarily due to an increase in revenue recognized in connection with our collaboration agreement with Regeneron and contributed to an increase in reimbursable activities under our Research Services arrangement in addition to an increase in revenue recognized associated with partnership clinical trial activities. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 6% in the third quarter 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to increased compensation-related expenses as a result of increased employee headcount and an increase in development expenses, primarily associated with the ramp-up in enrollment in the KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2 zilebesiran Phase 2 studies offset by decreased clinical batches manufactured during the quarter. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 33% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to increased headcount and other strategic investments in support of our AMVUTTRA launch and other corporate purposes. Our non-GAAP operating loss for Q2 2022 was $130 million representing an $18 million improvement compared with Q2 2021, driven by strong top line growth, offset by more moderate growth in operating expenses. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion at the end of 2021 with the decrease primarily due to our year-to-date operating loss in 2022. This decrease was largely offset by approximately $200 million received from employee option award exercises and approximately $135 million received from the issuance of convertible debt net of repayment of our Blackstone credit facility inclusive of prepayment premiums, purchase of cap call transactions and offering expenses. We continue to believe our current cash balance is sufficient to bridge us to a self-sustainable financial profile. Now I\u2019d like to turn to our full year 2022 financial guidance. Starting with net product revenues, we continue to anticipate combined net product revenues for our four commercialized products will be between $870 million and $930 million. Additionally, given the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar since we issued our current guidance in April, we are currently trending towards the lower half of our $870 million to $930 million guidance range. We are reducing our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties from a range of between $175 million and $225 million to a range between $100 million and $150 million primarily due to the timing of reimbursable activities in our collaboration with Regeneron and lower-than-anticipated Leqvio royalties and sales milestones. And our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG& A expenses remain unchanged and is a range between $1.390 billion and $1.450 billion. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones on deck through the end of 2022. We will continue executing on our global commercialization of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. Next, our TTR franchise will have important updates. With Patisiran, we plan to submit an sNDA for review by the FDA for the treatment of patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. With vutrisiran, we plan to report results on a biannual dose regimen from HELIOS-A in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. Lastly, for ALN-TTRsc04, we are on track to initiate a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers. In our mid- and early-stage portfolio, we are looking forward to milestones that include completion of enrollment in the KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study of zilebesiran at or around year-end, preliminary results expected from healthy volunteers in the Phase 1 study of ALN-XDH in development for patients with gout and submission of CTA filings for ALN-KHK for the treatment of metabolic liver disease, including diabetes, and ALN-APP for NASH. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, we will now open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Maury Raycroft Jefferies. Your line is open.\nMaury Raycroft: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can talk about whether you\u2019ve gotten any feedback from FDA on APOLLO-B data and what the NDA package would contain? And also, if you can talk about confidence around your primary endpoint P value and whether FDA has provided any specific comments on this?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Thanks for that question. Maury. I mean, clearly, we were delighted with the results from our APOLLO-B study where we deliver clinically meaningful and significant benefits across the 6-minute walk test and KCCQ, which are important measures actually for patients in terms of how they function and feel and we\u2019ve got good safety and numerical reduction test. So we are very confidence with the package of data that we have supporting this indication holistically, particularly given the small size and short duration of the study, actually, perhaps you can follow-up on our regulatory progress.\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. So thanks, Maury, and thanks, Yvonne. I mean, I think you addressed at the high level, the key positives that came out of the study that reinforces that therapeutics can have a significant impact, we believe, in ATT amyloidosis, including in the cardiomyopathy. We\u2019re proceeding to file the supplemental NDA by the end of the year, as we\u2019ve said. We\u2019re confident in this package the points that Yvonne outlined as the file goes under review, the FDA was get a safety update, 180-day safety update during review, so we will be providing that, of course. And we will be very responsive to any questions they have. And so that\u2019s as much as I can say. At this point in time. But we\u2019ve shared the data across two meetings at ISA and HFSA had extremely strong and positive responses from investigates KOLs and others. And so we are excited for that.\nYvonne Greenstreet: That\u2019s great. So moving forward expeditiously. Thank you, Maury. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter. Your line is open.\nSalveen Richter: Is interim. Did the outcomes analysis of APOLLO-B impact your thinking on treated or placebo separation here? And how much time do you save? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Actually, I think that\u2019s one for you.\nChristine Lindenboom: So actually repeat the full question. I think talking about the outcomes analysis, but the line is not brilliant. So we didn\u2019t quite catch the second half of your question. Could you repeat it for us?\nSalveen Richter: Sure. Could you explain the factors you considered when deciding not to conduct the HELIOS-B interim? I\u2019m just wondering whether the outcomes analysis of APOLLO-B impact your thinking on treated placebo separation and how much time you save here?\nYvonne Greenstreet: The question is around thinking behind not progressing the interim analysis.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes, I mean, Salveen, as you intimate, the positive data out of pole significantly increase our confidence and belief that the design and conduct of HELIOS-B is the right test of the hypothesis that vutrisiran can help patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy. So we feel quite involved of looking at all the detailed data, most of which we\u2019ve shared already at these international meetings, but there are others. And so that was one major factor. The second was we obviously want to have the best data associated with vutrisiran to make it a best-in-class product, hopefully, for patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy. The best way to do that is to preserve alpha and not mess around with the statistics, which obviously, if you do an interim, then that has a significant downstream conference on how on both the statistics for the final readout in early \u201824. And thirdly is just the speed at which everything is moved which we\u2019re delighted by. So the fact that HELIOS-B actually overenrolled that it did, means it\u2019s such a narrow time frame between any putative interim and any potential approval thereof versus the full readout in early \u201824 and hopefully getting a great label in serving patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy.\nChristine Lindenboom: That\u2019s great actually. Thank you very much. Next question. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tazeen Ahmad of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTazeen Ahmad: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe, Yvonne can you just clarify whether your team has already met with FDA for your pre-sNDA meeting regarding the APOLLO-B results yet? Or is that still to come? And then secondly, do you have any expectations about whether or not an AdCom would be needed to review this filing. It is the second indication proposed for an already approved drug, but I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on that? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. Thanks, Tazeen. I mean, as you know, we don\u2019t comment on regulatory interactions. I think I actually covered this in an earlier question, we\u2019re very confident with the package that we have supporting this indication, and we\u2019re moving forward as planned with a submission later this year. That\u2019s about all I can say on the topic. But thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eliana Merle of UBS. Your line is open.\nEliana Merle: Hey, thanks so much for taking the question. Just another one in terms of thinking about HELIOS-B as well as the potential uptake in cardiomyopathy, could you help us understand how you interpret the data in tafamidis combination? And what this could potentially mean in terms of uptake in, say, tafamidis progressors or combination use in the real world commercially. And any initial feedback say you are hearing initially? I know it\u2019s early, but just curious your thoughts.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Right. So I think there may be kind of two parts of the question. I think one actually may be starting off with new perspectives around data and combination with [indiscernible], maybe talk to give some perspectives on how you see things in the commercial?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Thank you, Yvonne. Vis-a-vis your, question Eliana on the family subgroup concomitant with Patisiran. Just to step back, this was a, I think, a large robust study that considered the real-world population out there. The majority of whom don\u2019t have any drug right now, about 75% of the study was on placebo and no background therapy at about 25% of patients had background to [indiscernible]. I refer you to our HFS a output and Dr. Mara\u2019s very eloquent discussion of why it\u2019s a little bit of a full there and just to use a phrase to cut into small subgroup analysis that really are not powered and the study was not designed to tell we fool ourselves. And again, Dr. Maria explained and discussed all this very well. I thought it HFSA. So the overall readout of the study, I think, was robust and excellent impacting patients functionality via the fixed in walk distance and the quality of life, lots of internal consistency in the data. So this is a strong package and we\u2019re delighted with it. I appreciate the interest of subgroups, so that\u2019s really know what the study was poured to read out.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, I thought that just generally or factors around how the commercial.\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. Just to build on Akshay\u2019s point, it would be premature for us to comment anything specific on without the label. But what we can tell you is if you just look at the numbers since the launch of tafamidis, the diagnosis rate went up by 10x and we certainly anticipate that to continue. This is a highly devastating disease. Across the U. S. and ex-U.S., there is about 250,000 to 300,000 patients suffer from this devastating disease. And what we know is those patients that are a lot of untreated patients and those patients who continue to progress on TAF. So we believe our upcoming therapies if they are approved, will be a very attractive option, both for physicians and obviously for patients.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thank you. So absolutely lots of medical needs still the \u2013 these patients unfortunately. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ritu Baral of Cowen. Your line is open.\nRitu Baral: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Yvonne or Akshay, should we be expecting priority review on the sNDA just given what you and your regulatory consultancy as the unmet need in TTR cardiomyopathy. And can you just also remind us when the last interaction you had with FDA was in the past, obviously, not forward-looking. And if there is been any significant turnover in the review team or senior members in the review division since then.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Ritu. So another question about the regulatory outlook here actually in terms of expectations with respect to priority of and another question really just asking us to comment on our progress with regulatory interactions. So I think you\u2019ve sort of answered the question, but maybe you can reiterate the point.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. I mean, I think it, thanks for the question. As you know, we don\u2019t discuss the back and forth the regulators. I will reiterate what I said earlier, that we\u2019re confident in this data package, we\u2019re on track to file the supplemental NDA by the end of the year and the priority review, well, that\u2019s the FDA\u2019s decision, and they have to evaluate the pros and cons of this therapy and the data package we\u2019ve submitted. And we will eagerly await their decision, but there is not much more I can put.\nYvonne Greenstreet: And Ritu can we comment on review team turnover. I think that\u2019s what the FDA has managed and we\u2019re not really in a position to speak to that. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jessica Fye of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJessica Fye: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Did you have a pre-NDA meeting yet for the ONPATTRO cardiomyopathy filing or if not, do you expect to?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Thanks for the question. I mean again, I think there is lots of interest around this. The most important thing is that we obviously have lots of back and forth regulators across all our programs. And let me just reiterate that we will file the supplemental NDA by the end of the year for this program based on everything we have discussed so far on this call and in many other settings. So, thanks for the question.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thanks Akshay. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lebowitz of Citi. Your line is open.\nDavid Lebowitz: Thank you very much for taking my question. When you look at the ONPATTRO, the AMVUTTRA new patient start forms, I noticed that the number of new patients percentage uptick from what was announced in the first quarter of launch, I think we from about a third to nearly 50%. Could you comment on what the expectations for new patients to be coming to market is and what that might \u2013 how that might impact growth of the overall franchise relative to what ONPATTRO would have done without the presence of AMVUTTRA?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. No, that\u2019s a great question. I mean we are particularly pleased with the performance of our TTR franchise, especially the progress of the AMVUTTRA launch in the U.S., and we are seeing a kind of great dynamic, with approximately half of new patients and switches. And I think you made the point about a TTR franchise, which I would like to underscore. I think we now really have a TTR franchise and we expect to be able to grow the PN market, encourage earlier treatment given the very effective regimen of AMVUTTRA. But Tolga, do you want to add some more color maybe to how you are seeing the outlook for the TTR franchise?\nTolga Tanguler: No, absolutely, Yvonne. Look, early signs of U.S. AMVUTTRA launch is a good testament to the overall TTR franchise future. Our TTR franchise grew by 30% versus last quarter, driven mainly by AMVUTTRA. Two-thirds of this growth was really demand. In our view, early signs of performance really confirm three key beliefs. One is the fine available treatments, there is a significant unmet need and the role of AMVUTTRA and its attractive product profile will continue to increase growth. That\u2019s going to be important. And also, we do have the strong foundational capabilities that we build over time across customer-facing capabilities that will allow us to continue expand this growth. So, we are really excited about this. We are still scratching the surface in terms of diagnosis and treatment. There are 10,000 to 15,000 patients in the U.S. that suffer from this condition. We believe AMVUTTRA\u2019s product profile will be a very nice fit to that treatment regimen.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thanks Tolga. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gena Wang of Barclays. Your line is open.\nGena Wang: Thank you for taking my questions. Sorry, I will ask APOLLO-B question again. I think because there are quite some questions were raised on its approvability since it\u2019s only one study and then there is no outcome data. So, maybe if you could refresh our memory, the history of APOLLO-B study. So, basically, how study was designed and was it aligned with the FDA?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. Akshay, that\u2019s clearly for you.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Thanks Gena. I think we have discussed much of this on other calls, but let me just reiterate, Gena, that I think this is \u2013 I am losing track a little bit say for seven Phase 3 study or seven Phase 3 studies we have negotiated with the FDA and other regulators around the world. All our work is in collaboration with guidance from regulators. We have four Alnylam products approved based on that excellent set of dialogues and the relationships we have and understanding how regulators are trying to guide us. This product and this trial was no different from that. And so if any credibility or confidence is derived from our prior performance I would like you to apply it here. Now, in the specifics here, when APOLLO was done, and we all remember the conversations, those of you that were involved then, the cardiac data we got a subgroup data from APOLLO were very promising. And the FDA said, yes, that is the case, and we have discussed that before. And based on that, they guided us that we should do a separate study in a cardiomyopathy population. And with that conversation and collaboration, the design that you see in APOLLO-B resulted. And so this study was done in close collaboration with regulators, and we are grateful for the guidance, and we are very happy with the outcome where clearly, we have shown the impact on patient functionality and quality of life, which are two cornerstones of FDA base of approval of drugs. Safety looks very encouraging to us, too. And then finally, on the monetary front, you will recall that four patients on placebo rather on patisiran and 10 on placebo. So, that\u2019s encouraging, although it\u2019s a small number. So, this package, we believe, is rather strong for a trial that was designed in collaboration with regulators. And so we are looking forward to filing the NDA.\nGena Wang: Thank you.\nChristine Lindenboom: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Matteis of Stifel. Your line is open.\nPaul Matteis: Hey. Thanks so much. I was really interested in your comments in the press release and in the prepared remarks on drug positioning related to the Inflation Reduction Act and kind of broader drug pricing risk. And to that point, you just filed a CTA for a once annual TTR knockdown drug. How do you think about positioning that and kind of balancing Stargardt versus this potentially just being a next-gen and TTR cardiomyopathy and also enabling you to maintain premium pricing beyond a decade in that space? Thanks so much.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thank you for the question here. I think look, the inflation reduction is a significant shift in Medicare and how the Federal Government regulates our industry. We are supportive of the new Part D patient out-of-pocket caps, but we have considerable concerns about a couple of other aspects of the legislation. Clearly, the first is around concerns a small molecule medicines, face negotiated Medicare reimbursement rates only 9 years after approval compared to 13 years for monoclonal antibodies. I think very pertinent to us in the near-term is that while the exemptions in the Inflation Reduction Act from Medicare price negotiation for a drug that has a single orphan drug indication, they are now this incentive to pursuing the approval of drugs that in additional indications. Look, we are still digesting the legislation. But as you pointed out, in the meantime, besides the patisiran Phase 3 study in Stargardt disease, as we consider options for the best path forward. I would like to just kind of note three points really. One is that we remain excited actually by the opportunity for an RNAi-mediated TTR lowering method as a potential therapy in patients with Stargardt disease. We think it\u2019s an important unmet medical need. And the second, I think you touched on it when you talked about TTRsc04. As a platform company, we really have the opportunity to continuously innovate and bring optionality to how we think about developing our medicines. And I think TTRsc04 is another TTR lowering program that we are moving forward, which we are very excited about. I think the other point that I would like to make, which I think is quite important is just to remind everybody that Vutrisiran actually has orphan disease that we mentioned for TTR amyloidosis, be it polyneuropathy or cardiomyopathy. So, as with many other companies, we are reflecting on the implications that that\u2019s relatively new legislation on how we think about our portfolio. But as a company, we actually think we are very well positioned given our platform and our ability to continue to innovate around our medicines.\nChristine Lindenboom: Okay. The next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Nachman of BMO. Your line is open.\nGary Nachman: Hi. Good morning. If you end up getting the ONPATTRO of APOLLO-B approval, let\u2019s say, end of next year, but then you will be bumping up against the Vutrisiran HELIOS-B data in early \u201824. How much of an impact do you think that might have on your launch of ONPATTRO in CM when physicians will be anticipating this other important data set. I know it\u2019s a bit early thinking about the launches, but given the timing of these, I was curious to get some of your early thoughts on that. Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Well, so I will just start off by saying that the reason why we progress ONPATTRO in the cardiomyopathy indication just a level of unmet medical need, that\u2019s the patients who continue to progress despite various therapies. And really, we took the opportunity with ONPATTRO to try to bring a near-term solution for these patients, whilst we continue to develop Vutrisiran in our HELIOS-B study. And as you pointed out, we will have those results shortly at the beginning of 2024. So, we think that we are able to meet the needs of patients in the near-term hopefully with the approval of ONPATTRO and CM. And then as we progress HELIOS-B going forward and even more attractive regimen for these patients shortly afterwards. But maybe Tolga, you can comment on how we are thinking about the launch of ONPATTRO with the opportunity hopefully of bringing Vutrisiran to these patients in the medium-term.\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. No, I think you summarized perfectly, Yvonne. All I would add is there is a big unmet need. There are patients who are currently on available treatments that are continuing to progress. And to your point, we want to make an alternative treatment available as quickly as possible so we can actually meet those needs and also continue to build our capabilities for the larger indication. We are obviously very pleased with the capabilities that we have built based on what we are actually able to demonstrate with AMVUTTRA CM [ph] launch. And as we continue to expand the indication, we believe our experience with the CM is going to help us to have even a stronger launch with AMVUTTRA CM, if it\u2019s approved.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks Tolga, that\u2019s great. So again, the sort of TTR franchise approach, which we think will be important for patients and our commercial performance going forward.\nChristine Lindenboom: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Luca Issi of RBC Capital.\nLuca Issi: Hey. Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe one on the pipeline, if I may. So, maybe on APP, kind of any additional color on why the readout has been pushed out? And maybe bigger picture, can you level set expectations to-date the next year? Wht reduction in CSF APP alpha and beta would you consider it meaningful? And maybe what\u2019s the earliest we could possibly see functional data for that data set? Thanks so much.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Great. Thank you, Luca, for a question on APP. Look, we are clearly excited about the potential for RNAi therapeutics and addressing CNS diseases. This is the first one out of the gate and we are progressing kind of very well, but thoughtfully as Akshay described in his introductory remarks. But actually, maybe you can speak to the data that we are expecting after the ongoing study.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. The crucial data, I think first and foremost is safety. This is our first candidate in central nervous system. So, that\u2019s a keen interest. The study is progressing well. So, we are very comfortable so far. Beyond that, obviously, there is lots of interest in the biomarker outlook. And so we will be looking for APP knockdown and the fragments therapeutic trail from APP changes in those of the CNS APP. And in addition to that, there is going to be important PK because, again, it\u2019s the first time we have injected that have to [indiscernible]. So, those are the key data points in the short-term that we will be looking at and looking forward to reporting in early \u201823.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Absolutely. And as we move forward in APP, we are able to demonstrate the impact on patients with \u2013 anyone with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The quarter opens up the opportunity for a whole host of other devastating CNS supporters. So, a very important program for us, we are progressing well. Thank you for the question.\nChristine Lindenboom: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Stringer of Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nJoseph Stringer: Hi. Good morning. Thanks taking our question. A question on AMVUTTRA start forms in the percentage sourced from new prescribers. I think this quarter you have around 17%, that was similar to 20% from your last update. Do you sort of see this continuing and fairly stable in that 15% to 20% range going forward, or how do you see that going forward? Thank you.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Tolga, that\u2019s clearly a question for you. How do you see the percentage of new prescribers going forward?\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. Look, I mean I am glad you have highlighted that. We are really excited about sort of how we are displaying those strong foundational capabilities that we have been able to build from diagnosis all the way to access support. One of those excitements is we see a healthy balance of physicians, both from academic centers and community specialists, start prescribing this medication. And as you pointed out, another important metric is the new prescribers. We see a steady increase of this new specialist around 20% month-after-month being added to the prescriber base. And as a result of that, we also see patients are treated a bit younger, a sign that patients are getting diagnosed and obviously, they are getting the AMVUTTRA treatment. Another important metric that we also see and where we are obviously going to pay a lot of attention to this is our start forms to treatment rates, despite having a temporary J-code, it\u2019s been similar to ONPATTRO. And again, thanks to our good access support, VBAs and our price parity strategy. So, because of those elements, we believe we are going to continue to see a good expansion of new prescribers and net new patients for AMVUTTRA that\u2019s going to drive the TTR franchise to the next level.\nJoseph Stringer: Super. Thank you very much.\nYvonne Greenstreet: And I think we have got time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Minter of William Blair. Your line is open.\nMyles Minter: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just on OXLUMO actually, just with the recent FDA label expansion. Are you expecting like a significant amount of warehouse advanced PH1 patients. And I guess, how are you thinking about growing that franchise moving forward, considering it looks somewhat flat over the past quarters? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Tolga, do you want\u2026?\nTolga Tanguler: Look, GIVLAARI [ph] is a devastating disease and we are very pleased to be able to actually provide important treatment for these ultra-rare disease patients. LMHC has been a great addition \u2013 we do see a good addition to our data suite of data that we have. We see a good group of patients, both from pediatric and as adults level as well as various progressive stage of their diseases. It eliminates is simply another important element that will allow the prescribers to be able to prescribe this medicine to a broad range of patients that suffer from this ultra-rare disease.\nEnd of Q&A:\nYvonne Greenstreet: Look, we have had a great quarter. We really are based in our commercial performance and we are seeing strong growth in patients on therapy across all of our commercial portfolio. So, I am certainly very pleased with our performance. So, thank you everyone for joining us on this call. Great progress in the third quarter of 2022, we talked about our strong commercial results, but also we are pleased with how we are advancing our diverse pipeline programs that are in development. A lot of excitement ahead, cashless on deck in the coming months and we of course, look forward to updating you along the way as we continue to deliver on our near and long-term goals. So, thank you everybody and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tolga Tanguler",
            "content": "Thanks, Yvonne and good morning everyone. Q3 was a strong quarter for our commercial portfolio, with 9% quarter-over-quarter growth driven by a strong launch of AMVUTTRA in the U.S., as Yvonne highlighted. While still early, we are encouraged by several signs indicating that AMVUTTRA is expanding the size of the opportunity for our hATTR-PN franchise. I will have more details to share on this shortly. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to impact product revenues from our international operations as ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI, and OXLUMO Q3 product sales each experienced FX headwinds compared with the prior quarter and prior year periods. With initial sales of AMVUTTRA which are now reflected in our quarterly financial results, moving forward, we will highlight our results for ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA on a combined franchise basis. We saw robust growth in our TTR franchise in Q3, achieving $170 million in global net product revenues for ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA, representing an 11% increase compared with the second quarter and a solid 41% growth compared with Q3 2021. At the end of Q3 over 2,580 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA treatment worldwide, up from over 2,400 patients at the end of the second quarter, representing a steady 8% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S., combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased a robust 30% versus the second quarter and were primarily impacted by the following and 19% increase in demand growth, which was driven by the strength of the initial AMVUTTRA patient uptake, more than offsetting the decrease in patients on ONPATTRO that switched AMVUTTRA. In total for the quarter, 180 patients initiated AMVUTTRA treatment with over 40% representing new patients for Alnylam and the balance representing patients switching from ONPATTRO. Initial AMVUTTRA launch inventory stocking in the distribution channel increased growth an additional 11% in the quarter. In our international markets, ONPATTRO Q3 product sales decreased 5% versus Q2 \u201822 despite an increase in patients on therapy as the timing of orders in partner markets and FX headwinds offset the increase. Our global results continue to be challenged by foreign exchange headwinds, with ONPATTRO year-over-year reported growth of 41%, held back 11 percentage points due to the foreign exchange impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar. Now, I\u2019d like to provide you with some additional color on our AMVUTTRA U.S. launch. In the first 4 months of launch, new patient start forms have doubled to an average of 60 start forms per month, excluding switches in comparison to 30 start forms per month for ONPATTRO in the first half of this year, which we believe highlights the strength of the AMVUTTRA launch to-date. Our demand generation has been healthy and balanced between community accounts and centers of excellence, while about 17% of start forms have been generated from new prescribers. We are seeing our patient base broaden to include a variety of newly and previously diagnosed patients starting on AMVUTTRA with significant enthusiasm being expressed for AMVUTTRA\u2019s product profile, including quarterly subcutaneous dosing. Meanwhile, on the access front, given our parity pricing to-date, we have not faced with any significant access headwinds and have made significant progress with formulary approvals, providing smooth access to patients that are put on AMVUTTRA therapy. Additionally, we are pleased with the average time from receipt of start forms to initiation of therapy for AMVUTTRA patients, which is already in line with our ONPATTRO benchmark. To wrap up with AMVUTTRA, we are also excited about the recent regulatory approvals in the EU and Japan for hATTR amylidiosis patients with polyneuropathy and are looking forward to launches in Germany and Japan in the fourth quarter. Moving to AMVUTTRA rare disease franchise, first GIVLAARI, we achieved $46 million in global net product revenues in the second quarter, representing a 1% increase compared with Q2 \u201822 and 43% growth versus Q3 \u201821. At the end of Q3, over 460 patients were on commercial GIVLAARI treatment worldwide, up from over 420 at the end of second quarter, representing 10% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S., sales of GIVLAARI increased 5% versus the second quarter primarily due to demand growth of 7% by an increase in patients on therapy, which was modestly offset by changes in inventory, stocking and gross to net sales deductions. In our international markets, GIVLAARI sales decreased 6% compared with the second quarter, with growth in patients on therapy more than offset by lower net pricing and FX headwinds. Finally, the reported 43% increase in year-over-year global net product revenue growth of GIVLAARI was held back 7 percentage points due to unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. Moving now to our second ultra-rare disease product, OXLUMO, we achieved $16 million in global net product revenues in the third quarter, representing a 10% increase compared with the second quarter. At the end of Q3, over 230 patients were on commercial OXLUMO treatment worldwide, up from over 200 at the end of the second quarter, representing 15% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S., sales of OXLUMO decreased 10% versus the second quarter as growth in patients on therapy was more than offset by decreased average patient utilization during the quarter, driven by fewer patients on the monthly loading dose portion of their initial treatment. In our international business, sales of OXLUMO increased 29% compared with the second quarter due to an increase in patients on therapy and higher net realized price during the quarter partially offset by FX headwinds. Additionally, as with ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI, changes in foreign exchange rates also negatively impacted OXLUMO Q3 \u201822 results, with reported year-over-year growth of 10% held back by 10 percentage points due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. In conclusion, we are pleased with the growth in revenues and patient demand achieved in Q3 and particularly with early signs of strong performance associated with AMVUTTRA launch, which we believe represents an important therapy option for hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy and an accelerated growth opportunity for our TTR franchise. With that, I will now turn it over to Akshay to review our recent R&D pipeline progress. Akshay? Yes. So thanks, Maury, and thanks, Yvonne. I mean, I think you addressed at the high level, the key positives that came out of the study that reinforces that therapeutics can have a significant impact, we believe, in ATT amyloidosis, including in the cardiomyopathy. We\u2019re proceeding to file the supplemental NDA by the end of the year, as we\u2019ve said. We\u2019re confident in this package the points that Yvonne outlined as the file goes under review, the FDA was get a safety update, 180-day safety update during review, so we will be providing that, of course. And we will be very responsive to any questions they have. And so that\u2019s as much as I can say. At this point in time. But we\u2019ve shared the data across two meetings at ISA and HFSA had extremely strong and positive responses from investigates KOLs and others. And so we are excited for that. Yes. Just to build on Akshay\u2019s point, it would be premature for us to comment anything specific on without the label. But what we can tell you is if you just look at the numbers since the launch of tafamidis, the diagnosis rate went up by 10x and we certainly anticipate that to continue. This is a highly devastating disease. Across the U. S. and ex-U.S., there is about 250,000 to 300,000 patients suffer from this devastating disease. And what we know is those patients that are a lot of untreated patients and those patients who continue to progress on TAF. So we believe our upcoming therapies if they are approved, will be a very attractive option, both for physicians and obviously for patients. No, absolutely, Yvonne. Look, early signs of U.S. AMVUTTRA launch is a good testament to the overall TTR franchise future. Our TTR franchise grew by 30% versus last quarter, driven mainly by AMVUTTRA. Two-thirds of this growth was really demand. In our view, early signs of performance really confirm three key beliefs. One is the fine available treatments, there is a significant unmet need and the role of AMVUTTRA and its attractive product profile will continue to increase growth. That\u2019s going to be important. And also, we do have the strong foundational capabilities that we build over time across customer-facing capabilities that will allow us to continue expand this growth. So, we are really excited about this. We are still scratching the surface in terms of diagnosis and treatment. There are 10,000 to 15,000 patients in the U.S. that suffer from this condition. We believe AMVUTTRA\u2019s product profile will be a very nice fit to that treatment regimen. Yes. No, I think you summarized perfectly, Yvonne. All I would add is there is a big unmet need. There are patients who are currently on available treatments that are continuing to progress. And to your point, we want to make an alternative treatment available as quickly as possible so we can actually meet those needs and also continue to build our capabilities for the larger indication. We are obviously very pleased with the capabilities that we have built based on what we are actually able to demonstrate with AMVUTTRA CM [ph] launch. And as we continue to expand the indication, we believe our experience with the CM is going to help us to have even a stronger launch with AMVUTTRA CM, if it\u2019s approved. Yes. Look, I mean I am glad you have highlighted that. We are really excited about sort of how we are displaying those strong foundational capabilities that we have been able to build from diagnosis all the way to access support. One of those excitements is we see a healthy balance of physicians, both from academic centers and community specialists, start prescribing this medication. And as you pointed out, another important metric is the new prescribers. We see a steady increase of this new specialist around 20% month-after-month being added to the prescriber base. And as a result of that, we also see patients are treated a bit younger, a sign that patients are getting diagnosed and obviously, they are getting the AMVUTTRA treatment. Another important metric that we also see and where we are obviously going to pay a lot of attention to this is our start forms to treatment rates, despite having a temporary J-code, it\u2019s been similar to ONPATTRO. And again, thanks to our good access support, VBAs and our price parity strategy. So, because of those elements, we believe we are going to continue to see a good expansion of new prescribers and net new patients for AMVUTTRA that\u2019s going to drive the TTR franchise to the next level. Look, GIVLAARI [ph] is a devastating disease and we are very pleased to be able to actually provide important treatment for these ultra-rare disease patients. LMHC has been a great addition \u2013 we do see a good addition to our data suite of data that we have. We see a good group of patients, both from pediatric and as adults level as well as various progressive stage of their diseases. It eliminates is simply another important element that will allow the prescribers to be able to prescribe this medicine to a broad range of patients that suffer from this ultra-rare disease."

            "name": "Jeff Poulton",
            "content": "Thanks, Akshay, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam\u2019s Q3 2022 financial results and an update on our full year guidance. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for Q3 2022. A Total product revenues for the quarter were $232 million or 39% growth versus Q3 2021. It is also worth noting that year-over-year growth in combined product revenues was held back by approximately 10% due to the foreign exchange impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar and given that approximately 45% of our product revenues are generated via sales in international markets. Net revenue from collaborations for the third quarter was approximately $29 million, representing a 45% increase compared with Q3 2021, primarily due to an increase in revenue recognized in connection with our collaboration agreement with Regeneron and contributed to an increase in reimbursable activities under our Research Services arrangement in addition to an increase in revenue recognized associated with partnership clinical trial activities. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 6% in the third quarter 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to increased compensation-related expenses as a result of increased employee headcount and an increase in development expenses, primarily associated with the ramp-up in enrollment in the KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2 zilebesiran Phase 2 studies offset by decreased clinical batches manufactured during the quarter. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 33% in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to increased headcount and other strategic investments in support of our AMVUTTRA launch and other corporate purposes. Our non-GAAP operating loss for Q2 2022 was $130 million representing an $18 million improvement compared with Q2 2021, driven by strong top line growth, offset by more moderate growth in operating expenses. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.3 billion compared to $2.4 billion at the end of 2021 with the decrease primarily due to our year-to-date operating loss in 2022. This decrease was largely offset by approximately $200 million received from employee option award exercises and approximately $135 million received from the issuance of convertible debt net of repayment of our Blackstone credit facility inclusive of prepayment premiums, purchase of cap call transactions and offering expenses. We continue to believe our current cash balance is sufficient to bridge us to a self-sustainable financial profile. Now I\u2019d like to turn to our full year 2022 financial guidance. Starting with net product revenues, we continue to anticipate combined net product revenues for our four commercialized products will be between $870 million and $930 million. Additionally, given the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar since we issued our current guidance in April, we are currently trending towards the lower half of our $870 million to $930 million guidance range. We are reducing our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties from a range of between $175 million and $225 million to a range between $100 million and $150 million primarily due to the timing of reimbursable activities in our collaboration with Regeneron and lower-than-anticipated Leqvio royalties and sales milestones. And our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG& A expenses remain unchanged and is a range between $1.390 billion and $1.450 billion. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones on deck through the end of 2022. We will continue executing on our global commercialization of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. Next, our TTR franchise will have important updates. With Patisiran, we plan to submit an sNDA for review by the FDA for the treatment of patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. With vutrisiran, we plan to report results on a biannual dose regimen from HELIOS-A in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. Lastly, for ALN-TTRsc04, we are on track to initiate a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers. In our mid- and early-stage portfolio, we are looking forward to milestones that include completion of enrollment in the KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study of zilebesiran at or around year-end, preliminary results expected from healthy volunteers in the Phase 1 study of ALN-XDH in development for patients with gout and submission of CTA filings for ALN-KHK for the treatment of metabolic liver disease, including diabetes, and ALN-APP for NASH. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?"

            "name": "Akshay Vaishnaw",
            "content": "Thanks, Tolga and good morning everyone. I will start with our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we are advancing two clinical stage product candidates Patisiran and Vutrisiran. Whilst ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat the polyneuropathy associated with hereditary AT amyloidosis, we are committed to expanding the product\u2019s label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end, we are excited to have recently presented positive results from the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study, where Patisiran achieved a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement relative to placebo in the 6-minute walk test at 12 months, the primary endpoint of the study. It also achieved a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement relative to placebo at 12 months on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionaire, the study\u2019s first secondary endpoint and a key measure of patient self-reported health status and quality of life. Furthermore, Patisiran demonstrated an acceptable tolerability profile and we are very encouraged by the overall safety profile of Patisiran. Collectively, we believe these efficacy results validate the therapeutic hypothesis that RNAi-mediated silencing of TTR has the potential to result in a disease-modifying impact on cardiac manifestations of ATTR amyloidosis. With these results in hand, we remain on track to submit a supplemental NDA filing for review by the FDA by the end of this year with the goal of obtaining regulatory approval in the U.S. making this medicine available to patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy as rapidly as possible. Also advancing Vutrisiran which is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection and amongst is AMVUTTRA to treat the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis. AMVUTTRA was approved based on results from the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study. That study includes an ongoing randomized treatment expansion where we are evaluating a biannual dose regimen and we are on track to share results in late 2022. As with ONPATTRO, year 2, we are committed to expanding the label to include the treatment of cardiomyopathy in hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. This is being accomplished by the HELIOS-B Phase 3 study of investigational vutrisiran. HELIOS-B, which is fully enrolled, has an endpoint of all-cause mortality and CV events assessed after at least 30 and up to 36 months and we are on track to share top line results in early 2024. As was announced this morning, after clinical consideration, we have made the decision not to conduct the optional interim analysis for HELIOS-B. Several factors drove us to this decision, including one, the early completion of enrollment of HELIOS-B, which meant that any potential acceleration in the approval based on an interim analysis was minimal relative to waiting until the readout from the fully completed study in early 2024. Two, our desire to conclude HELIOS-B with the strongest possible dataset, including outcomes data; and three, further enhancement in confidence in HELIOS-B with the recently positive APOLLO-B readout. As such, we look forward to the HELIOS-B readout as scheduled early in 2024. We have also announced this morning that while we remain very excited about the opportunity for TTR lowering to address Stargardt disease, we do not plan to initiate a Phase 3 study of vutrisiran this year as previously planned as we evaluate the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on therapies being developed from orphan disease. We are continuing to consider options for the best path forward in Stargardt disease as we recognize the significant unmet medical need in this patient population. Lastly, with regard to our TTR franchise, we are excited to announce that a clinical trial application has been filed for ALN-TTRsc04, the first clinical program from our IKARIA platform, which aims to achieve an annual dosing regimen with highly potent and reversible effects. We expect to initiate a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers by year end. In addition to our late-stage clinical programs, we believe we have also been making great progress with our early and mid-stage programs. Notable highlight this quarter was our announcement of positive results from our Phase 2 study of zilebesiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting C5 competitive complement pathway, which is in development in collaboration with Regeneron for the treatment of IgA nephropathy or IgAN. In the study, at week 32, treatment of cemdisiran results in the 37% mean reduction in baseline in the 24-hour urinary protein to creatinine ratio relative to placebo, the primary readout of the study and an important prognostic marker of disease progression. The results of secondary endpoints were also consistent with the therapeutic benefit of cemdisiran in IgAN. There were no significant drug-related safety signals and we believe these collective efficacy and safety data support continued clinical development of cemdisiran monotherapy in patients with IgAN. We look forward to gaining alignment with Regeneron to finalize plans for Phase 3 and sharing those updates with you in due course. Another exciting highlight recently was the announcement of the preliminary Phase 1 data supporting the clinical advancement of ALN-HSD, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting HSD17B13 in development for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH. After single-dose valuation in healthy adult volunteers on a) multiple doses of ALN-HSD are being studied in adult patients with NASH or b) patients in the first two Part B cohorts namely 200 and 400 milligrams quarterly, have completed at least 6 months on the study. The remaining cohorts are exploring a lower dose or a later biopsy time point. In the first two Part B cohorts, ALN-HSD was associated with robust target knockdown and numerically lower liver enzymes and biopsy-derived non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score over 6 months in patients receiving ALN-HSD relative to placebo. The study was not powered to achieve statistical significance on these endpoints and the primary outcome measure is frequency of adverse events. ALN-HSD has exhibited an encouraging pace and tolerability profile to date. Based on these results, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in adult patients with NASH in late 2022 in collaboration with Regeneron. Now turning to our ALN-APP program which is in the development for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. ALN-APP is our first investigational conjugate RNA therapeutic tying a gene expression in the central nervous system. We continue to make progress enrolling patients with early onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease and are progressing through the single ascending dose portion of the Phase 1 study. As we announced in our press release this morning, we now expect initial clinical data from this study in early 2023, a slight change from our previous guidance of late \u201822. This change reflects the continued progression through dose escalation cohorts at a measured pace and the rigor with which we are screening for appropriate patients for this study that meet all necessary inclusion/exclusion criteria. We believe this initial clinical data with ALN-APP is positive, will be an important milestone for our CNS platform to show that RNAi can achieve clinically relevant degrees of target outbound in the CNS with the safety and dosing profile that supports further development. And we look forward to reporting top line results from the study in early 2023. These are just a few highlights from our broad and innovative pipeline driven by our underlying organic product engine that will drive sustainable innovation and represents a key growth driver for Alnylam in the years to come. Representative of the productivity of our engine, we look forward to two further CTR-IND filings for the first in human studies before year-end, namely ALN-KHK for the treatment of metabolic liver disease, including diabetes, which is an Alnylam wholly owned program and ALN-APP for NASH in collaboration with Regeneron. We will be discussing all this in greater detail at our upcoming R&D Day being held virtually on December 15, and I encourage you to tune it. With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff? Thanks for that question. Maury. I mean, clearly, we were delighted with the results from our APOLLO-B study where we deliver clinically meaningful and significant benefits across the 6-minute walk test and KCCQ, which are important measures actually for patients in terms of how they function and feel and we\u2019ve got good safety and numerical reduction test. So we are very confidence with the package of data that we have supporting this indication holistically, particularly given the small size and short duration of the study, actually, perhaps you can follow-up on our regulatory progress. Yes, I mean, Salveen, as you intimate, the positive data out of pole significantly increase our confidence and belief that the design and conduct of HELIOS-B is the right test of the hypothesis that vutrisiran can help patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy. So we feel quite involved of looking at all the detailed data, most of which we\u2019ve shared already at these international meetings, but there are others. And so that was one major factor. The second was we obviously want to have the best data associated with vutrisiran to make it a best-in-class product, hopefully, for patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy. The best way to do that is to preserve alpha and not mess around with the statistics, which obviously, if you do an interim, then that has a significant downstream conference on how on both the statistics for the final readout in early \u201824. And thirdly is just the speed at which everything is moved which we\u2019re delighted by. So the fact that HELIOS-B actually overenrolled that it did, means it\u2019s such a narrow time frame between any putative interim and any potential approval thereof versus the full readout in early \u201824 and hopefully getting a great label in serving patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy. Thank you, Yvonne. Vis-a-vis your, question Eliana on the family subgroup concomitant with Patisiran. Just to step back, this was a, I think, a large robust study that considered the real-world population out there. The majority of whom don\u2019t have any drug right now, about 75% of the study was on placebo and no background therapy at about 25% of patients had background to [indiscernible]. I refer you to our HFS a output and Dr. Mara\u2019s very eloquent discussion of why it\u2019s a little bit of a full there and just to use a phrase to cut into small subgroup analysis that really are not powered and the study was not designed to tell we fool ourselves. And again, Dr. Maria explained and discussed all this very well. I thought it HFSA. So the overall readout of the study, I think, was robust and excellent impacting patients functionality via the fixed in walk distance and the quality of life, lots of internal consistency in the data. So this is a strong package and we\u2019re delighted with it. I appreciate the interest of subgroups, so that\u2019s really know what the study was poured to read out. Yes. I mean, I think it, thanks for the question. As you know, we don\u2019t discuss the back and forth the regulators. I will reiterate what I said earlier, that we\u2019re confident in this data package, we\u2019re on track to file the supplemental NDA by the end of the year and the priority review, well, that\u2019s the FDA\u2019s decision, and they have to evaluate the pros and cons of this therapy and the data package we\u2019ve submitted. And we will eagerly await their decision, but there is not much more I can put. Yes. Thanks for the question. I mean again, I think there is lots of interest around this. The most important thing is that we obviously have lots of back and forth regulators across all our programs. And let me just reiterate that we will file the supplemental NDA by the end of the year for this program based on everything we have discussed so far on this call and in many other settings. So, thanks for the question. Yes. Thanks Gena. I think we have discussed much of this on other calls, but let me just reiterate, Gena, that I think this is \u2013 I am losing track a little bit say for seven Phase 3 study or seven Phase 3 studies we have negotiated with the FDA and other regulators around the world. All our work is in collaboration with guidance from regulators. We have four Alnylam products approved based on that excellent set of dialogues and the relationships we have and understanding how regulators are trying to guide us. This product and this trial was no different from that. And so if any credibility or confidence is derived from our prior performance I would like you to apply it here. Now, in the specifics here, when APOLLO was done, and we all remember the conversations, those of you that were involved then, the cardiac data we got a subgroup data from APOLLO were very promising. And the FDA said, yes, that is the case, and we have discussed that before. And based on that, they guided us that we should do a separate study in a cardiomyopathy population. And with that conversation and collaboration, the design that you see in APOLLO-B resulted. And so this study was done in close collaboration with regulators, and we are grateful for the guidance, and we are very happy with the outcome where clearly, we have shown the impact on patient functionality and quality of life, which are two cornerstones of FDA base of approval of drugs. Safety looks very encouraging to us, too. And then finally, on the monetary front, you will recall that four patients on placebo rather on patisiran and 10 on placebo. So, that\u2019s encouraging, although it\u2019s a small number. So, this package, we believe, is rather strong for a trial that was designed in collaboration with regulators. And so we are looking forward to filing the NDA. Yes. The crucial data, I think first and foremost is safety. This is our first candidate in central nervous system. So, that\u2019s a keen interest. The study is progressing well. So, we are very comfortable so far. Beyond that, obviously, there is lots of interest in the biomarker outlook. And so we will be looking for APP knockdown and the fragments therapeutic trail from APP changes in those of the CNS APP. And in addition to that, there is going to be important PK because, again, it\u2019s the first time we have injected that have to [indiscernible]. So, those are the key data points in the short-term that we will be looking at and looking forward to reporting in early \u201823. Tolga, that\u2019s clearly a question for you. How do you see the percentage of new prescribers going forward?"

            "name": "Yvonne Greenstreet",
            "content": "Thanks, Christine, and thank you everyone for joining the call today. We are very pleased with the results delivered in the third quarter, both commercially and with our pipeline. Commercially, this is the first full quarter of our AMVUTTRA launch since the U.S. approval back in June, which drove 30% growth in the U.S. for the TTR franchise compared to quarter two. Clinically, the TTR franchise is a high life as well. We presented positive results for the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study of vutrisiran in patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, validating the therapeutic hypothesis that RNAi-mediated silencing of TTR has the potential to result in a disease-modifying impact on the cardiac manifestations of ATTR amyloidosis. We are delighted with the totality of these results and we look forward to submitting a supplemental NDA for ONPATTRO by year end. This also gives us increased confidence in the HELIOS-B Phase 3 outcome study of vutrisiran in ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, which is on track for top line results in early 2024. Our earlier stage programs advance as well with positive results presented from the Phase 2 study of cemdisiran in patients with IgA nephropathy as well as preliminary data in patients from the ongoing Phase 1 study of ALN-HSD in development for the treatment of NASH. In the coming quarters, we expect to have more exciting updates from our pipeline, including results for potential biannual dose regimen for vutrisiran preliminary Phase 1 results and healthy volunteers for ARN XDH, an investigational RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of gout. Completion of enrollment in the KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study of zilebesiran and initiation of a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study of ALN-TTRscO4, for which we filed a CTA earlier this month. This execution is in line with our focus on these key drivers for Alnylam\u2019s growth over the next several years. Firstly, the potential near-term expansion of our TTR franchise opportunity, where we aim to become a global leader in delivering impactful and highly differentiated medicines for patients. Second our expansion beyond rare diseases and to prevalent diseases. And the third growth driver for the company comes from our sustainable innovation engine comprised of new platform enhancements, opportunities with extrahepatic delivery and our ability to find new genetically validated targets, which can drive further pipeline expansion to 2025 and beyond. We believe all of this positions us well to deliver on our Alnylam piece of it by \u201825 goal, making Alnylam a top biotech company, developing and commercializing transformative medicines for rare and prevalent diseases for patients around the world driven by a high-yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering exceptional financial results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga? That\u2019s great. So moving forward expeditiously. Thank you, Maury. Next question. Actually, I think that\u2019s one for you. The question is around thinking behind not progressing the interim analysis. Yes. Thanks, Tazeen. I mean, as you know, we don\u2019t comment on regulatory interactions. I think I actually covered this in an earlier question, we\u2019re very confident with the package that we have supporting this indication, and we\u2019re moving forward as planned with a submission later this year. That\u2019s about all I can say on the topic. But thanks for the question. Right. So I think there may be kind of two parts of the question. I think one actually may be starting off with new perspectives around data and combination with [indiscernible], maybe talk to give some perspectives on how you see things in the commercial? Yes, I thought that just generally or factors around how the commercial. Thank you. So absolutely lots of medical needs still the \u2013 these patients unfortunately. Next question please. Thanks, Ritu. So another question about the regulatory outlook here actually in terms of expectations with respect to priority of and another question really just asking us to comment on our progress with regulatory interactions. So I think you\u2019ve sort of answered the question, but maybe you can reiterate the point. And Ritu can we comment on review team turnover. I think that\u2019s what the FDA has managed and we\u2019re not really in a position to speak to that. Thank you. Next question. Yes. No, that\u2019s a great question. I mean we are particularly pleased with the performance of our TTR franchise, especially the progress of the AMVUTTRA launch in the U.S., and we are seeing a kind of great dynamic, with approximately half of new patients and switches. And I think you made the point about a TTR franchise, which I would like to underscore. I think we now really have a TTR franchise and we expect to be able to grow the PN market, encourage earlier treatment given the very effective regimen of AMVUTTRA. But Tolga, do you want to add some more color maybe to how you are seeing the outlook for the TTR franchise? Yes. Akshay, that\u2019s clearly for you. Thank you for the question here. I think look, the inflation reduction is a significant shift in Medicare and how the Federal Government regulates our industry. We are supportive of the new Part D patient out-of-pocket caps, but we have considerable concerns about a couple of other aspects of the legislation. Clearly, the first is around concerns a small molecule medicines, face negotiated Medicare reimbursement rates only 9 years after approval compared to 13 years for monoclonal antibodies. I think very pertinent to us in the near-term is that while the exemptions in the Inflation Reduction Act from Medicare price negotiation for a drug that has a single orphan drug indication, they are now this incentive to pursuing the approval of drugs that in additional indications. Look, we are still digesting the legislation. But as you pointed out, in the meantime, besides the patisiran Phase 3 study in Stargardt disease, as we consider options for the best path forward. I would like to just kind of note three points really. One is that we remain excited actually by the opportunity for an RNAi-mediated TTR lowering method as a potential therapy in patients with Stargardt disease. We think it\u2019s an important unmet medical need. And the second, I think you touched on it when you talked about TTRsc04. As a platform company, we really have the opportunity to continuously innovate and bring optionality to how we think about developing our medicines. And I think TTRsc04 is another TTR lowering program that we are moving forward, which we are very excited about. I think the other point that I would like to make, which I think is quite important is just to remind everybody that Vutrisiran actually has orphan disease that we mentioned for TTR amyloidosis, be it polyneuropathy or cardiomyopathy. So, as with many other companies, we are reflecting on the implications that that\u2019s relatively new legislation on how we think about our portfolio. But as a company, we actually think we are very well positioned given our platform and our ability to continue to innovate around our medicines. Well, so I will just start off by saying that the reason why we progress ONPATTRO in the cardiomyopathy indication just a level of unmet medical need, that\u2019s the patients who continue to progress despite various therapies. And really, we took the opportunity with ONPATTRO to try to bring a near-term solution for these patients, whilst we continue to develop Vutrisiran in our HELIOS-B study. And as you pointed out, we will have those results shortly at the beginning of 2024. So, we think that we are able to meet the needs of patients in the near-term hopefully with the approval of ONPATTRO and CM. And then as we progress HELIOS-B going forward and even more attractive regimen for these patients shortly afterwards. But maybe Tolga, you can comment on how we are thinking about the launch of ONPATTRO with the opportunity hopefully of bringing Vutrisiran to these patients in the medium-term. Thanks Tolga, that\u2019s great. So again, the sort of TTR franchise approach, which we think will be important for patients and our commercial performance going forward. Great. Thank you, Luca, for a question on APP. Look, we are clearly excited about the potential for RNAi therapeutics and addressing CNS diseases. This is the first one out of the gate and we are progressing kind of very well, but thoughtfully as Akshay described in his introductory remarks. But actually, maybe you can speak to the data that we are expecting after the ongoing study. Absolutely. And as we move forward in APP, we are able to demonstrate the impact on patients with \u2013 anyone with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The quarter opens up the opportunity for a whole host of other devastating CNS supporters. So, a very important program for us, we are progressing well. Thank you for the question. And I think we have got time for one more question. Tolga, do you want\u2026?"

And thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. We are very pleased with our second quarter results and the progress we've made towards our near- and long-term goals. Commercially, we achieved 14% product sales growth compared with the first quarter as we continue to drive a steady increase in patients on therapy across our portfolio of marketed products, including ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. And we're excited to have expanded that portfolio with a recent U.S. approval and positive CHMP opinion for ONPATTRO for hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. And we are looking forward to executing on ONPATTRO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s launch and the potential for further global expansion. Five RNAi therapeutics from our organic platform approved in under four years is truly remarkable. In addition to our growing commercial portfolio, we continue to make great strides with our RNAi therapeutic pipeline programs. This includes our progress in establishing our TTR franchise, where we are tracking towards plan and are on the cusp of seeing results from the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study of patisiran in patients with ATTR amyloidosis, with cardiomyopathy. We've announced the day that we expect to share top line data within the next three weeks with full data to be released thereafter at the medical congress. In addition to these highly anticipated results, we also continue to make exciting progress across numerous other progress within our pipeline. We have and continue to innovate a part of what we believe to be one of the most productive, organic and self-sustainable platforms in biotech, which has the potential to deliver meaningful value creating therapies for rare and prevalent diseases in the years to come. To that end, there are many recent and upcoming milestones that underscore the breadth and scope of our pipeline. The cemdisiran we reported positive top line Phase 2 results in patients with IgA nephropathy, a kidney disease with significant unmet medical need. We're now working with Regeneron, to finalize Phase 3 plans, and potentially initiate the program by the end of this year. We were also excited to see positive data presented by Sanofi from the Phase 3 ATLAS-PPX study of fitusiran in patients with hemophilia, which met its primary endpoint and demonstrated that fitusiran prophylaxis, significantly reduce breathing episodes compared to prior factor bypassing agent prophylaxis. Looking through to the end of this year, we expect to have updates across our pipeline, including the potential for top line results from early studies, of AI and HSV in NASH, AI and XVH in Gouache, and AI and ATP in early onset Alzheimer's disease. Our first CNS endeavor. Sticking together, this all highlights our focus on these three key drivers for Alnylam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth of the next several years. First, is the potential near term expansion of our TCR franchise opportunity, where we aim to become a global leader in delivering impactful and highly differentiated medicine to patients. The second key growth driver is our expansion beyond rare diseases into prevalent diseases. And the third growth driver for the company comes from our sustainable innovation engine, comprised of new platform, enhancements opportunities to extrahepatic delivery, and our ability to find new genetically validated targets, which can drive further pipeline expansion to 2025 and beyond. We believe all of this positions as well to deliver on our Alnylam P fifth by 25 goals, making Alnylam a top biotech company, developing and commercializing transformative medicines for rare and common diseases for patients around the world, driven by high yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while deliver exceptional financial results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga, to review our commercial performance. Toga?\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks Yvonne. And good morning, everyone. Q2 was a strong quarter for our commercial portfolio with 14% quarter-over-quarter growth as Yvonne highlighted. We're also excited about the FDA approval and launch of AMVUTTRA in June. And we are encouraged by early promising size of . I have more detail to share on that shortly.  As anticipated, we are also experiencing improved market conditions following COVID impacting Q1, as we saw increased promotional activities, improve the patient flows, healthy demand, and improved patient compliance across our portfolio. I'll now provide details on the performance of each of our products. We continue to see growth for ONPATTRO achieving $153 million in global net product revenues in the second quarter, representing a 12% increase compared with the first quarter and 35% growth compared with Q2 2021. At the end of Q2, over 2,400 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO treatment worldwide, up from over 2200 patients at the end of the first quarter, representing steady 9% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S. sales of ONPATTRO increased 14% versus the first quarter, and were primarily impacted by an increase in patients on therapy and improved patient compliance following Q1, which was negatively impacted by COVID. In our international markets ONPATTRO Q2 product sales increased 10% versus Q1 2022, primarily due to an increase in patients on therapy and the timely orders in distributor and partner markets. Important to note our global results continue to be challenged by foreign exchange headwinds with ONPATTRO year-over-year reported growth of 35% being held back seven percentage points by the strengthening U.S. dollar. As you are aware, we received U.S. approval for AMVUTTRA at the end of the second quarter. And we're very pleased with the initial launch so far as our teams continue to execute in line with our clients. We received 133 start forms from launch through July 22 keeping demand generation on track with approximately one third of start forms generated from patients new to Alnylam, and two thirds from switches from ONPATTRO. Over 20% of those start forms came from new prescribers, which we believe is an encouraging early sign of potential market growth. We hit the ground running, reaching over 61,000 key stakeholders within 48 hours of launch serving as a catalyst for field engagement. We have also been engaging with health systems and the formulary processes has been started in over 60% of the priority deliver networks.  Further from an access standpoint, our teams have been engaged and feedback has been posted to date. In fact, there is one national policy published with a large national payer covering 24 million lives. The first AMVUTTRA patient has also been treated and we're looking for continuing this rollout and updating you further on our Q3 call. Moving to our ultra-rare disease franchise, first with GIVLAARI, we achieve $45 million in global net product revenues in the second quarter, representing a 28% increase compared with Q1 2022 and 47% growth versus Q2 2021. At the end of Q2, over 420 patients were on commercial GIVLAARI treatment worldwide, up from over 400 at the end of the first quarter, representing a 5% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S. sales of GIVLAARI increased 25% versus the first quarter. And we're primarily a result of the following: a healthy demand growth of 12% driven by an increase in patients on therapy and improved patient compliance following a soft Q1, primarily impacted by COVID. Inventory stocking dynamics, which favorably impacted reported growth by 8%, and a degrees in gross net deductions in the quarter, which favorably impacted reported growth by approximately 5%. In our international markets, GIVLAARI delivered 34% growth compared with the first quarter with the growth primarily driven by new patient adds, including a strong launch in the UK and favorability in growth net deductions. Finally, global GIVLAARI year-over-year reported growth of 47% was also held back by six percentage points due to our favorable foreign exchange rates. Moving now to our second ultra-rare disease product OXLUMO. We achieved $15 million in global net product revenues in the second quarter, representing a 2% increase compared with the first quarter. At the end of Q2, over 200 patients were on commercial OXLUMO treatment worldwide, up from over 160 at the end of the first quarter, representing 25% quarterly patient growth. In the us sales of OXLUMO increased 32% versus the first quarter and were primarily impacted by an increase in patient demand as well as inventory stock dynamics and a decrease in growth to net deductions during the quarter. In our international business, despite an increase in patients on therapy during the quarter, Q2 OXLUMO sales decreased by 15% compared with Q1, primarily due to an increase in gross to net deductions during the quarter and the timing of orders in our distributor and partner markets. On a year-over-year basis, global OXLUMO sales decrease 9% despite an approximately doubling of patients on therapy. The decrease was primarily due to a higher proportion of patients on the monthly loading dose portion of their treatments as well as lower net pricing in our international markets in Q2 2022. Additionally, as with ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI changes in foreign exchange rates also negatively impacted OXLUMO Q2 2022 results with reported year-over-year growth of minus 9% held back by 5 percentage points due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. In conclusion, we are pleased with the growth in revenues and patient demand, achieving Q2 and look forward to our Q3 results, which will include the first full quarter of AMVUTTRA's launch. With that I will now turn it over to Akshay to review our recent IND and pipeline progress. Akshay?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Thanks Tolga and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our efforts in AT amyloidosis doses where we are advancing two clinical stage product candidates: Patisiran and Vutrisiran. While Patisiran are on ONPATTRO currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat polyneuropathy associated with hereditary AT amyloidosis doses. We are committed to expanding the product's label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type AT amyloidosis patients. Excuse me, to this end we're conducting the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study and as announced this morning, we expect to report top line results within the next three weeks. We're also advancing Vutrisiran, which is delivered by quarterly subcutaneous injection and was recently approved in the U.S. under the brand name AMVUTTRA to treat the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in addition to receiving the positive CHMP opinion in the EU. Here to we are committed to expanding the label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in hereditary and wild\u00e2\u0080\u0091type patients. Vutrisiran is also in development for Stargardt Disease. HELIOS-A evaluating Vutrisiran in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy formed the basis by regulatory submissions and recent U.S. approved AMVUTTRA. In April 2021 we presented positive results from the study at the AAN meeting, which shows the study met its primary and secondary endpoints at nine months. We continued to report results from the study and recently presented new 18-month results from exploratory cardiac endpoints at the ESC HF meeting. These findings show that in a variety of pre-defined \u00e2\u0080\u0093 show that in a pre-defined cardiac sub-population of hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy, treatment with Vutrisiran was associated with improvements in exploratory cardiac endpoints relative to external placebo, including levels of NT-proBNP and a trend towards improvement in echocardiographic parameters. These findings in the cardiac subpopulation were consistent with the previously reported results in the mITT population. Additionally, in a planned cohort of patients from the mITT population, Vutrisiran treatment reduced cardiac uptake of technetium on scintigraphy imaging relative to baseline in the majority of accessible patients, including those with paradigm equal to two at baseline, suggesting that patients with the highest degrees of cardiac amyloid burden may recognize benefit from RNAi therapeutics. Vutrisiran also continue to demonstrate an encouraging safety and tolerability profile. As mentioned this is just the start for Vutrisiran as is also being evaluated in the HELIOS-B Phase 3 study for the treatment of patients with AT amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy including both hereditary and wild-type AT amyloidosis. HELIOS-B which is fully enrolled has a 30-month endpoint of all-cause mortality in CV events with many patients followed up to 36 months and we expect the full results in early 2024. The study design includes the potential for an interim analysis, and we will consider this following results from APOLLO-B and engagement with regulatory authorities. In addition to our late stage clinical programs, we believe we've also been making great progress without early and mid-stage programs. Notable highlight in the second quarter was our announcement of positive top line results from our Phase 2 study of Cemdisiran an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the C5 component of the complement pathway and is in development in collaboration with Regeneron for the treatment of IgA nephropathy or IgAN. In this study at week-32 treatment with Cemdisiran resulted in a 37% mean reduction from baseline in the 24-hour urine protein-to-creatinine ratio relative to placebo. This was the primary endpoint of the study and an important prognostic marker of disease progression. The results of secondary endpoints were also consistent with the therapeutic benefit of Cemdisiran in IgAN. There were no significant drug related safety signals, and we believe these collective efficacy and safety data support continued clinical development of Cemdisiran monotherapy in patients with IgAN. We now look forward to gaining a line with Regeneron to finalize plans for Phase 3 and hope to initiate a program by the end of this year, pending regulatory agency feedback. Moving on a key growth driver for Alnylam in the years come will be our organic product engine driving sustainable innovation. The second quarter features a new highlight in this regard. In Nature Biotechnology we published data from preclinical research on the delivery of lipophilic siRNA conjugates extrahepatic tissues including the CNS. These data provides early evidence of a potential role for 2'-O-hexadecy C16 conjugate siRNA in treating diseases of the CNS eye and lung with further exploring the potential for lipid conjugates to help achieve delivery to other organs. In another publication in Nature Communications this time we published research findings identifying mutations in the INHBE gene associated with protection against abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome, a condition impacting more than 20% of adults to avoid. Finding support the potential of INHBE which was previously referred to as Gen X to be evaluated as a novel therapeutic treatment of the treatment of Cardio-Metabolic Diseases, since INHBE loss of function improves waist-to-hip ratio and is associated with an improved lipid profile. With plan to pursue a development candidate for INHBE and its gene product actively leveraging out IKARIA platform. As you can appreciate, we have an incredibly broad and innovative platform that continues to advance and these are just a few recent highlights. We look forward to updating you on a number of these programs in the coming months. With that let me now turn the call over to Jeff to review our financials and upcoming milestones. Jeff?\nJeff Poulton: Thanks Akshay, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam's Q2 2022 financial results and an update to our full year guidance. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for Q2 2022. Total product revenues for the quarter were $214 million or 33% growth versus Q2 2021. It's also worth noting that year-over-year growth in combined product revenues was held back by approximately 7% due to the foreign exchange impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, which reached a 20-year high recently. And given that approximately 50% of our product revenues are generated via sales of international markets. Net revenue from collaborations for the second quarter was approximately $9 million representing an 85% decrease compared with Q2 2021, primarily due to a reduction in revenue from our Regeneron collaboration, which is subject to quarter-to-quarter variability dependent on a variety of factors including the level of work completed during the quarter, which is reimbursed by Regeneron. We do expect an increase in collaboration revenue and royalties in the second half of the year, primarily driven by increased activity across our Regeneron programs, as well as from an increased associated with Leqvio royalties and sales milestones as Novartis's U.S. launch progresses. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 15% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to increased spend on early development activities and increased headcount to support the growth of our pipeline. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 19% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to increased headcount and other expenses to support the growth of our commercial portfolio. Our non-GAAP operating loss for Q2 2022 was $161 million representing a $47 million higher loss compared with Q2 2021, which was primarily impacted by the reduction in collaboration revenue during the quarter. Finally, at the end of the quarter with cash, cash equivalence and marketable securities of $2.1 billion compared to $2.4 billion at the end of 2021. We continue to believe our current cash balance is sufficient bridges to a self-sustainable financial profile. Now I'd like to turn to our full year 2022 financial guidance. Following the strength of our operating results in Q2, we are reiterating the financial guidance we provided on our Q1 results call in April. Starting with net product revenues we anticipate combined net product revenues for our four commercialized products will be between $870 million and $930 million. However, given the continued strengthen of the U.S. dollar since we issued our guidance in April, and the fact that approximately 50% of our global product sales are generated in the international markets, we are currently trending towards the lower half of our $870 million to $930 million guidance range. Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties is a ranged between $175 million and $225 million, and our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses is a ranged between $1,390 million and $1,450 million. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones on deck through the end of 2022. We'll continue executing on our global commercialization of ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO as well as the launch of AMVUTTRA. Next our TTR franchise will have important updates with Patisiran's top line results from the APOLLO Phase 3 study are expected in the next three weeks. With Vutrisiran we plan to report results on a biannual dose regimen and initiate a Phase 3 study in Stargardt Disease both in late 2022. Lastly, we plan to file an IND and initiate a Phase 1 study for ALN-TTRsc04 in healthy volunteers by the end of the year. In our mid-stage portfolio we are looking forward to milestones that include completion of enrollment in the Phase 2 study of Lumasiran in patients with recurrent renal stones by year-end. Completion of enrollment in our Phase 2 KARDIA-2 study of Zilebesiran at or around year-end, and results from the Phase 2 study of ALN-HBV02 in combination with monoclonal antibody VIR-3434, which are partners that we expect to report later this year. Wrapping up, we have a few early stage readouts coming as well. These include top line results from Part B of the Phase 1 study of ALN-HSD in patients with NASH expected in mid-2022. Preliminary top line results from the Phase 1 study of ALN-APP in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease expected in late 2022 and preliminary top line results from the Phase 1 study of ALN-XDH in patients with gout also expected for late 2022. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. To those dialed in we'd like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each and then get back in the queue if you have any additional questions. Also, as a reminder we are in a quiet period with regard to our APOLLO-B study and will not be responding to questions on that topic.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from Paul Matteis with Stifel. You may proceed.\nPaul Matteis: Hey good morning. Thanks much for taking my question. Just on Vutrisiran, just a two-part question the commercial dynamics, I guess one, can you talk about the initial prescribing for patients new to  and how much of that is coming from cardiologists? And then just curious on the economics of in-office dosing for Patisiran and how does that compare for a physician versus ONPATTRO as an infusion? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks Paul for that question. I just like to start off by saying that we really are delighted to have  with AMVUTTRA and it's great to have additional ONPATTRO for patients here and its target that on the call, the initial sign but also very, very encouraging. Tolga, I'd like to hand over this question to you. So it's around the commercial dynamics with respect to the initial launch, how much in cardiology and then any commentary on the economics with respect to ONPATTRO compared to fitusiran from a physician perspective? Thanks Tolga.\nTolga Tanguler: Absolutely. Hi Paul. This is really exciting time. We launched the product and reporting the information that's available to us within the five weeks. In that five weeks we were able to receive over 130 start forms and of those one-third of those were actually naive patients. They are new to Alnylam and that's actually a very good robust number, it's early for us and these are only start forms. Patients need to go through the system and make sure that they actually get the product in, but as an early sign one-third as new naive patient dynamic is very encouraging. In terms of the economics, essentially the product is Part B therefore it is still a buy-and-bill and those patients that are going to be looking at a very similar dynamics as we see in ONPATTRO. What we're also excited about is frankly 20% of our prescribers in this very short period are new prescribers of TTR, new prescribers of ONPATTRO. So that's also very exciting dynamic that I'd like to underline.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thanks, Tolga. And thanks Paul. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from David Lebowitz with Citi. You may proceed.\nDavid Lebowitz: Thank you very much for taking my question. First on Vutrisiran, this is not with respect to any details on the data. I just want to, as far as presentation, I know historically in the past for top line releases, you've put out key values. I just want to confirm that we would likely see P-values certainly on the primary endpoint, but also the secondary end points as well. And one little add-on here as far as pricing goes, can you at least give us perspective on what type of shift we might see once cardiomyopathy gets added to the label?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Great. David thanks for that question. I think the first one Akshay is for you.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Just clarifying Dave that you said Vutrisiran, but I suspect you met the Patisiran with respect to the APOLLO-B results, am I correct?\nDavid Lebowitz: Indeed, of course.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. And you are right we'll present top line results in the form of the PR with P-values as we test the primary and secondaries in a hierarchical order. So that's as much  present time.\nDavid Lebowitz: Thanks Akshay. And maybe Tolga, you could take the second question, respect to pricing and any shift as we hopefully enter the Cardiomyopathy?\nTolga Tanguler: Look we're excited about the possibility of serving Cardiomyopathy patents, but as you could appreciate it's a little too soon for us to share any information because it's a little too soon, but we'll obviously update appropriately when we make those decisions.\nChristine Lindenboom: Alright. Thanks David. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nSalveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you just speak to the dynamics with regard to switching and combination that's playing out between your TTR franchise and Pfizer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tafamidis? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: I think Tolga that that question is straight over to you.\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. I mean, switching wise obviously in the U.S. we're indicated for polyneuropathy and the tafamidis indicated for cardiomyopathy, therefore we don't \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we do not see any switching dynamics. In terms of common use we see similar rates that we've seen in the past. It's about anywhere between 15% to 20%. What we see, what we're excited about switching dynamics is in ex-U.S. particularly in Europe and Japan where both of those products are available in polyneuropathy we've seen a significant source of our business is really built by the switches. Obviously we continue to add new naive patients both in Europe and Japan, but early on we've seen a good, strong dynamic which alludes to us that the physicians believe that there is actually \u00e2\u0080\u0093 probably more opportunity to use ONPATTRO as a silencer in the earlier part of the disease to get adequate treatment.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thanks Tolga. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ritu Baral with Cowen. You may proceed.\nRitu Baral: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping for just to follow up to Paul and Salveen's just a little more detail on the new patients. Tolga, you mentioned the prescribers, but are you seeing less severe patients? Is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are you seeing more mixed phenotype patients? And does this sort of bolus imply that there's some there's sort of warehoused patients to work through as we look at the new patient question for AMVUTTRA?\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. It's a great question. Thank you. If I indicated before, it's little too soon for us to really give a lot of specific dynamics. It's an area where we're obviously closely monitoring. What we're encouraged about is the early side indicate that we do see some \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a little younger patients, but again it's difficult to generalize at this point. We're only five weeks into the launch. What we're again excited about is the fact that we are seeing a broad range of patients quickly getting either switched or not even being treated. Part of it, I'm sure is going to be a little bit of the warehousing, but it's important to highlight that in Q1 we had a great strong robust ONPATTRO growth. With what we originally thought was probably the patients, the physicians will be waiting and warehousing some of those patients for AMVUTTRA that didn't exactly happen. But I'm certain that part of the uptake that we see in the first five weeks might be contributed to that warehousing dynamic.\nChristine Lindenboom: Yes. Thanks Tolga. It really does look at the introduction of AMVUTTRA is helping us, will help us grow the overall TCR franchise going forward which I think is very encouraging. Thanks, Ritu. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tazeen Ahmad with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nTazeen Ahmad: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Mine's on HELIOS-B, so you've reiterated your confidence that the early 2024 target for data readout is something that you feel confident about. I'm just wondering is there at all a scenario in which you would opt to extend the observation period though to allow for a higher chance of seeing a significant improvement in mortality benefit.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Maybe I'll stop by retracing our confidence in an early 2024 data readout from HELIOS-B and Akshay any perspective on how we might think about that study going forward.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. We've revisited the study designs and thoroughly assessed how robust is the study? Is it structured and powered in a way to help us meet the primary endpoint of the factory endpoint and we are comfortable with the study design. And so the study designs unaltered the only thing we'll consider is the interim analysis, of course in due course. And the other thing I would say by the way is that, as you, patients come in over a long period in the study in a large study like that, so many of them will have gone to 36 months and that provides additional coverage in terms of the robustness of the study. So we're comfortable and we'd reiterate later early 2024 and looking forward to positive results.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thanks, Akshay. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Stringer with Needham. You may proceed.\nJoseph Stringer: Hi, thank you for taking our question. Our question was for AMVUTTRA. I know its early days but how do you anticipate the time from start form to getting patient on drug? How do you think this compares relative to your experience with ONPATTRO? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. That's a great question and clearly with AMVUTTRA being our second product in the TTR franchise, we're really building on what's a very robust commercial operation that we have under Tolga's leadership. Tolga perhaps you could talk a little bit about that  speaking?\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks Yvonne. Obviously we're very well positioned to be able to maximize the opportunity for AMVUTTRA given our experiences with ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA's really attractive profiles being subcutaneous injectable every months. In regards to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in regards to the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 how the timing is going to work is look, I mean, at the end of the day we do have the right capabilities, right patient services, benefit verification, and so forth already in place within this category. And what we've so far done is working very closely with not only with major national and regional payers, but also with integrated delivery networks and other health providers to make sure that formularies are in place. Given the fact that we actually also set the price despite its very attractive profile its parity with ONPATTRO, we have not so far seen any significant headwind. Nevertheless like any new product it does take time for the healthcare system to absorb and make sure the PNT committees and so forth are in place to get the product approved. We're very pleased with the early signs of what we've so far done and how the healthcare systems are reacting, but I'm sure we're going to see some delays early on and eventually get to a place where I think it's going to be at parity with ONPATTRO or even maybe a little faster approval dynamic, but it's a little too soon for us to share where we are right now with that.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thanks, Tolga. I think good progress thus far and we're very pleased. So next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Maury Raycroft with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nMaury Raycroft: Hi good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I was going to ask a question on Givosiran for hypertension. Just wondering if you can elaborate on steps you've taken to streamline the protocol to speed up enrollment and what the status is on that?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. Just to everybody it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reminder, we unfortunately experienced and delays with our KARDIA-1 study with zilebesiran primarily due to the fact that we selected sites in the Ukraine and obviously with the ongoing war those sites were unable to move forward. We've expanded our site footprint in a very fee progress upfront. We also took the opportunity to just refine the protocol to make it an easier study to execute the . I don't know, Akshay, do you want to add any?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: No, I think you covered it Yvonne. The only other thing more specifically on the streamlining is we may inevitably more in these protocols, one tries to capture as much scientific information as one can. But given the needs of the program we're able to remove some of the assessments, don't take anything away from the core issue downtown hypertensive effects and safety, and so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and yet maintain two large robust protocols, which will be easier to approve one in monotherapy and one in combination therapy. So between the site expansion and these things, the profiles we are optimistic about readouts next year.\nChristine Lindenboom: Great. And just to add that we're expecting to complete enrollment in KARDIA-2 at the end of this year.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: That's right.\nChristine Lindenboom: So we're looking forward to that. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Luca Issi with RBC Capital. You may proceed.\nLuca Issi: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe one on TTR polyneuropathy, how are you thinking about a competitive landscape here? Obviously Ionis have reported successful Phase 3 and it seem very confident they can compete commercially given the AstraZeneca global footprint. I know we don't have the full data at this point, but how are you thinking about implications of that launch for your franchise? Thanks so much.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks. Yes, look I think that was primary question about, how we believe that we're going to compete in the TTR PN space, particularly with potential new competitors coming on stream with AstraZeneca.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Thank you, Yvonne. Look, first of all we are always excited to bring new mode of medication, different alternative treatments to patients because there's a lot of wood to chop when it comes to TTR PN prevalence and what the patients that are currently being treated. We anticipate the prevalence numbers around 25,000 to 30,000 patients worldwide and we are a very small fraction of that that we've been able to deliver. So what we've seen in similar categories, a good expansion of diagnosis and treatment rates going on. In regards to where we are, look at the end of the day we have been able to actually establish ourselves in the last four years as the major driver including in Europe and Japan against tafamidis that's also been promoted by an important company. One of the important, I think, drivers of our growth is going be obviously the making AMVUTTRA available worldwide. And we are well positioned to do that. We have Europe and Japan and geographic footprint and available in over 50 markets through other partners and distributors. Given the fact that we're going to be a year ahead already off set competition and plus again a very attractive profile that AMVUTTRA offers for the patients with the subcutaneous injectable over three months, and soon with six months if those trials work. We really like our chats in terms of how we're well positioned to be able to make this product available and continue to be a leader \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as a portfolio leader. But again, I just want to reiterate, having said that there are going to be products available and that's good for patients, and we're excited about that.\nLuca Issi: Thanks. So Akshay, do you want to say anything about  effective profile?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes, no, I'll just add to what Tolga said which was makes a lot of sense, but in terms of the data themselves, I think, we've got a very comprehensive data associated with vutrisiran around AMVUTTRA in hATTR and of course the primary showing improvement in neuropathy which is exciting. And in terms of the other end points for the secondary, but not just those exploratory cardiac endpoint, the impact on the heart and  the respiratory endpoints, but still notable, particularly with the new observation of the reducing technician scan uptake. And that that's very exciting for patients and physicians. And so, along with the convenience Q3, and then hopefully soon Q6 monthly dosing, this is a very differentiated product in the market that Tolga explained. We've been leaders in and ultimately I will add that love patients need good options in this space will want to see the full data package associated with frontiersin  recalling that the first time round with inotersen and there were some safety issues of note including renal effects, injection site reactions, platelet effects. And I'm sure they, and everybody is keen to know that the safety is good. So let's see, but I think we're off to a great start with AMVUTTRA.\nLuca Issi: Thanks for the opportunity.\nChristine Lindenboom: Sure, very helpful. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question goes from Gary Nachman with BMO. You may proceed.\nGary Nachman: Okay, great. So back to AMVUTTRA and the start forums and the two third switches from ONPATTRO, what's the profile of initial patients that are switching from ONPATTRO? Are you getting a sense if it's more patient or physician driven? Do they stay on ONPATTRO up until they get AMVUTTRA if that takes some time? And how do you expect that split between new and switches to shift over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.\nChristine Lindenboom: Tolga I think that we have lots of interest than the AMVUTTRA early demand.\nTolga Tanguler: Hi, Gary. I mean, look at the end of the day, what we're really excited about is AMVUTTRA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profile is giving us the ability and physicians the ability to be able to actually diagnosis and treat more patients. And what we've so far seen early signs is in terms of initiations it's both when it comes to switches, as well as naive patients. We have a good, robust patient services and our patients have been informed about the availability and some of those patients proactively reached out to their physicians.  What we've also seen is, as I indicated earlier, a good new, prescribers coming into the treatment of this condition and excited to be actually providing this medicine to those patients that probably were on the fence given that was an infusion with ONPATTRO earlier profile and AMVUTTRA tends to offer a very convenient option with great safety and efficacy data. Therefore we do what we so far seen in 133 start forms is a good, broad range of both patient prescriber base, as well as patient demographics that ranges across younger as well as more traditional demographics.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thanks. So, let's take the next question.\nGary Nachman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question line of Anupam Rama with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed.\nAnupam Rama: Hey guys, thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe following on the last question on AMVUTTRA on switching dynamics, what does your market research suggest on the timeframe in which you would expect switching to kind of peak or where most patients that are going to switch have made the switch? I think that's what we're trying to understand, many of us. Thanks so much.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Hi, Anupam. That's a great question. And thank you for putting it forward very precisely. So I think Tolga, there is a specific question here around what our market research is setting up right about the time for sort of peak switching.\nTolga Tanguler: What we are really interested at this point is really to make sure that the overall category is growing. So our focus is actually right now is really to make sure that we are bringing as many as new patients as possible given this new option. The switch is what we believe is going to play out a little more organically and will obviously update the Street for about a year about the switch and net naive patients. What we expect that to organically happen is most patients will end up with AMVUTTRA given its profile. However, we also know that in rare diseases, there are patients who are pleased with their existing treatment. Some of these patients never had any new treatment before AMVUTTRA sorry ONPATTRO was available. So we do expect some patients to remain on therapy. But in similar dynamics that we've seen is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 similar dynamics that we've seen in other categories patients tend to gravitate towards a more better option, which we believe AMVUTTRA is. But I also wanted to take the opportunity to remind everyone that we are going to be updating on the start form dynamics for two to three quarters.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Just one other comment. From a modeling perspective. It doesn't matter for ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA the same price, same value per patient per year. So just a reminder on that point.\nTolga Tanguler: Great point.\nChristine Lindenboom: Good. Okay. Let's take the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 hit the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tong Wu with Barclays. You may proceed.\nGena Wang: Hello, actually, can you hear me? \nChristine Lindenboom: Yes, we can hear you.\nGena Wang: Okay, good. This is Gena Wang from Barclays. Yes, so I have a question maybe follow-up the start form one to thirty-three start form. You said thirty four new to Alnylam just if you can give a little bit more clarity, what percentage of these are the switcher from tech savvy and versus truly naive patients? And then quickly on HELIOS-B I just wanted to do some maintenance check, last time we discussed  dropping rate maintained at the low single digit, any change in the dropping rate?\nChristine Lindenboom: Okay. Let's start with Tolga the AMVUTTRA question, and then back shape of the HELIOS-B question.\nTolga Tanguler: We really appreciate the excitement around the strong launch of AMVUTTRA, yet it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only five week of data. So we wanted to make sure that we all recognize that the  data we're providing is as good as we possibly can at this point. Those 34 new patients are na\u00c3\u00afve to us. And in terms of your own modeling one should also remember that the TEGSEDI remains a very small portion of the overall category. So we wouldn't necessarily index our na\u00c3\u00afve patients just only on switches from an alternative treatment.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. Good opportunity to grow.\nTolga Tanguler: Exactly.\nGena Wang: New patients coming into AMVUTTRA. So actually HELIOS-B has drop in rates.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, thanks, Gena. I can reiterate the drop in rates remain well within expectations. And I think I've discussed before we obviously had put in a buffer in the sample size to account for tap drops. We are well within those estimates. So we're comfortable with the design Gena. Thank you.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thanks, actually. That's great. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eliana Merle with UBS, you may proceed.\nEliana Merle: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess not an ATTR question, but on the pipeline for Lumasiran in recurrent renal stems, I guess maybe just with the Phase 2 finishing enrolling later this year and thinking about Phase 2 data next year. I mean, how should we think about what you are looking to see here it's obviously a much broader population. I guess what could we learn in terms of the relationship between oxalate reduction and reduction in stone formation and this broader population and your confidence in the biology there? And then I guess thinking about sort of the regulatory pathway from there, like what a potential Phase 3 could look like? And any types of like patient segmentation in terms of accessing this much larger population?\nYvonne Greenstreet : Actually, I'm not sure if you called all of that. \nTolga Tanguler : Yes.\nYvonne Greenstreet: I think it's around the  study, what we're looking to see from Phase 2 data, how we're thinking about oxalate reduction and then I think plans for moving forward that study.\nTolga Tanguler : Yes. So thanks for the question. So the lumar recurrence stone formation study is ongoing is obviously a very large population globally numbering in the millions probably. And what we want to see is a reduction in urinary oxalate. Now in the pH1 population, of course, we saw very such reductions urinary oxalate, they have an enzymatic defect in the liver. And the targeting of GO1 leads to 70 plus percent reduction in urinary oxylate. This is a hypothesis we're testing. One of the interesting things is we may not need to achieve levels like that to see a reduction in stone events. And so let's look at the data as it comes out next year and see. And I say that because the important thing is once oxalate becomes saturating levels in the urine that's when stone formation occurs. So you may not need to take it all the way back down to normal, you might just need to get it out of that super saturation range by some relatively modest margin to prevent stone formation. And so lots more work to do here, and we'll update you as we get data, but this is a very exciting opportunity with an approved drug that looks very safe to find the PH1 population. And that just reminds me of several safety will also be important seeing the RF population, but we're optimistic with what we've seen so far with Luma in PH1.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thanks. Actually another program in our pipeline, which is orientates around patients with much more common seizure, I think, an exciting potential development for our Alnylam. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Minter with William Blair. You may proceed.\nMyles Minter: Thanks for taking the question. Just on some around fitusiran and the  property data, can you just sort of discuss where you see like the complement inhibitor methodology sitting in the lines of therapy and I guess how it relates to the data that we've seen from the endothelin-1 receptor antagonist? And I guess is that a key consideration for Regeneron? And how they would potentially design a pivotal study and the types of patients that you would enroll in that pivotal study? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: So quite a few questions there. I mean really just yes, I think start off by reiterating that we were really pleased with the Phase 2 results of fitusiran patient with  property, very common condition, 37% reduction in , I think this is great. And I think kind of it's another potential Phase 3 program for Alnylam. So we're very pleased to be working with our partners Regeneron moving forward the next steps. Actually, I think there were enough questions in there, but I think much more specific around how we're thinking about that program.\nTolga Tanguler: Yes, we're very excited about the Phase 2 result with a 37% reduction in urinary proteinuria. Busy working with Regeneron right now, we take the lead in this program in the ICAN study design and we are sort of very busily looking forward to engaging regulatory authorities and hopefully kicking off the study by the year end. The specifics of where compliment or anti complement approaches sit, the interesting thing is the fundamental underlying pathology here are IGA immune complex is that  activate compliment that activated compliment then damages the glomerular basement membrane and proteinuria results. An additional aspect of the disease, I don't think anyone really understands how this occur is hyperfiltration in the kidney and says blood flow dynamics change through glomerulus. So we have the opportunity here orthogonally to impact two key pathogenic factors. With anti-compliment approaches we can get at the fundamental underlying immunopathology and we've seen the preliminary results we've shared. So this will have a foundational role, I believe, in the future in what will end up being a polypharmacy situation where there will be anti-inflammatory approaches like anti-compliment cemdisiran would be a great fit for that. It could be a once a month, once every three months type injection. And then in addition to that things that alter blood flow, so endothelin antagonist, ACE inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, et cetera. And so you will see drugs from both classes, the antihypertensive type drugs and anti-complement drugs being combined. And we'll see if steroids will also become part of the picture, but there is more work to do there, although they are rather general nonspecific agents and have  side effects. And just to add up what these favorable results open up the potential for cemdisiran, if the needs of patients with other  seizures, so we're enthusiastically moving forward here. Thank you for the question. One more question. I think we have one more question before we close. Last question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Olivia Brayer with Cantor. You may proceed.\nOlivia Brayer: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for the question. I know you are in a quiet period with respect to APOLLO-B, but I wanted to ask if there are any monitoring requirements after patients reach that 12-month mark that are built in this study? And then I've got a follow-up on sequencing from mixed phenotype patients. Is there anything you can do to improve access for patients that could move on ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA after ? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: So I just want to say, you pointed out we are in a quiet period, so we're not going to be taking any questions on APOLLO-B, but I didn't actually quite catch your second question. I think it was something to do with AMVUTTRA, but I didn't hear it properly. Could you repeat the question, the second part of the question?\nOlivia Brayer: Yes, sure. It's just about mixed phenotype patients, right. And whether there is anything you guys can do to improve payer access there for patients that could sequence onto ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA after ?\nYvonne Greenstreet: You mean plug neuropathy and mixed phenotype patients?\nOlivia Brayer: Yes.\nTolga Tanguler: Yes, I mean, look, we certainly have the right capabilities to support those patients. The fact that we've been able to position this at parity pricing, so certainly we believe will help increase access. So far we haven't really had heard any headwinds around the access piece. But we are indicated for polyneuropathy and in the U.S. tafamidis is indicated for cardiomyopathy. So in terms of providing any brief strategy for access would not be something we would consider. Like any of our new patients, we have great support of benefit verification and patient access support, which those patients would certainly be eligible if they go through our patient service program.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thanks, Tolga.\nYvonne Greenstreet : Okay. So thank you everyone for joining us on this call. We're very happy with the progress that we've made in the second quarter and first half of 2022. We've delivered strong commercial results. We've advanced our diversified pipeline programs and development, and we've got a number of exciting catalysts on deck in the coming months. So we look forward to updating you along the way while we continue to deliver on our near and long goals. Thanks everyone. And have a great day. \nChristine Lindenboom: Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tolga Tanguler",
            "content": "Thanks Yvonne. And good morning, everyone. Q2 was a strong quarter for our commercial portfolio with 14% quarter-over-quarter growth as Yvonne highlighted. We're also excited about the FDA approval and launch of AMVUTTRA in June. And we are encouraged by early promising size of . I have more detail to share on that shortly.  As anticipated, we are also experiencing improved market conditions following COVID impacting Q1, as we saw increased promotional activities, improve the patient flows, healthy demand, and improved patient compliance across our portfolio. I'll now provide details on the performance of each of our products. We continue to see growth for ONPATTRO achieving $153 million in global net product revenues in the second quarter, representing a 12% increase compared with the first quarter and 35% growth compared with Q2 2021. At the end of Q2, over 2,400 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO treatment worldwide, up from over 2200 patients at the end of the first quarter, representing steady 9% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S. sales of ONPATTRO increased 14% versus the first quarter, and were primarily impacted by an increase in patients on therapy and improved patient compliance following Q1, which was negatively impacted by COVID. In our international markets ONPATTRO Q2 product sales increased 10% versus Q1 2022, primarily due to an increase in patients on therapy and the timely orders in distributor and partner markets. Important to note our global results continue to be challenged by foreign exchange headwinds with ONPATTRO year-over-year reported growth of 35% being held back seven percentage points by the strengthening U.S. dollar. As you are aware, we received U.S. approval for AMVUTTRA at the end of the second quarter. And we're very pleased with the initial launch so far as our teams continue to execute in line with our clients. We received 133 start forms from launch through July 22 keeping demand generation on track with approximately one third of start forms generated from patients new to Alnylam, and two thirds from switches from ONPATTRO. Over 20% of those start forms came from new prescribers, which we believe is an encouraging early sign of potential market growth. We hit the ground running, reaching over 61,000 key stakeholders within 48 hours of launch serving as a catalyst for field engagement. We have also been engaging with health systems and the formulary processes has been started in over 60% of the priority deliver networks.  Further from an access standpoint, our teams have been engaged and feedback has been posted to date. In fact, there is one national policy published with a large national payer covering 24 million lives. The first AMVUTTRA patient has also been treated and we're looking for continuing this rollout and updating you further on our Q3 call. Moving to our ultra-rare disease franchise, first with GIVLAARI, we achieve $45 million in global net product revenues in the second quarter, representing a 28% increase compared with Q1 2022 and 47% growth versus Q2 2021. At the end of Q2, over 420 patients were on commercial GIVLAARI treatment worldwide, up from over 400 at the end of the first quarter, representing a 5% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S. sales of GIVLAARI increased 25% versus the first quarter. And we're primarily a result of the following: a healthy demand growth of 12% driven by an increase in patients on therapy and improved patient compliance following a soft Q1, primarily impacted by COVID. Inventory stocking dynamics, which favorably impacted reported growth by 8%, and a degrees in gross net deductions in the quarter, which favorably impacted reported growth by approximately 5%. In our international markets, GIVLAARI delivered 34% growth compared with the first quarter with the growth primarily driven by new patient adds, including a strong launch in the UK and favorability in growth net deductions. Finally, global GIVLAARI year-over-year reported growth of 47% was also held back by six percentage points due to our favorable foreign exchange rates. Moving now to our second ultra-rare disease product OXLUMO. We achieved $15 million in global net product revenues in the second quarter, representing a 2% increase compared with the first quarter. At the end of Q2, over 200 patients were on commercial OXLUMO treatment worldwide, up from over 160 at the end of the first quarter, representing 25% quarterly patient growth. In the us sales of OXLUMO increased 32% versus the first quarter and were primarily impacted by an increase in patient demand as well as inventory stock dynamics and a decrease in growth to net deductions during the quarter. In our international business, despite an increase in patients on therapy during the quarter, Q2 OXLUMO sales decreased by 15% compared with Q1, primarily due to an increase in gross to net deductions during the quarter and the timing of orders in our distributor and partner markets. On a year-over-year basis, global OXLUMO sales decrease 9% despite an approximately doubling of patients on therapy. The decrease was primarily due to a higher proportion of patients on the monthly loading dose portion of their treatments as well as lower net pricing in our international markets in Q2 2022. Additionally, as with ONPATTRO and GIVLAARI changes in foreign exchange rates also negatively impacted OXLUMO Q2 2022 results with reported year-over-year growth of minus 9% held back by 5 percentage points due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. In conclusion, we are pleased with the growth in revenues and patient demand, achieving Q2 and look forward to our Q3 results, which will include the first full quarter of AMVUTTRA's launch. With that I will now turn it over to Akshay to review our recent IND and pipeline progress. Akshay? Absolutely. Hi Paul. This is really exciting time. We launched the product and reporting the information that's available to us within the five weeks. In that five weeks we were able to receive over 130 start forms and of those one-third of those were actually naive patients. They are new to Alnylam and that's actually a very good robust number, it's early for us and these are only start forms. Patients need to go through the system and make sure that they actually get the product in, but as an early sign one-third as new naive patient dynamic is very encouraging. In terms of the economics, essentially the product is Part B therefore it is still a buy-and-bill and those patients that are going to be looking at a very similar dynamics as we see in ONPATTRO. What we're also excited about is frankly 20% of our prescribers in this very short period are new prescribers of TTR, new prescribers of ONPATTRO. So that's also very exciting dynamic that I'd like to underline. Look we're excited about the possibility of serving Cardiomyopathy patents, but as you could appreciate it's a little too soon for us to share any information because it's a little too soon, but we'll obviously update appropriately when we make those decisions. Yes. I mean, switching wise obviously in the U.S. we're indicated for polyneuropathy and the tafamidis indicated for cardiomyopathy, therefore we don't \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we do not see any switching dynamics. In terms of common use we see similar rates that we've seen in the past. It's about anywhere between 15% to 20%. What we see, what we're excited about switching dynamics is in ex-U.S. particularly in Europe and Japan where both of those products are available in polyneuropathy we've seen a significant source of our business is really built by the switches. Obviously we continue to add new naive patients both in Europe and Japan, but early on we've seen a good, strong dynamic which alludes to us that the physicians believe that there is actually \u00e2\u0080\u0093 probably more opportunity to use ONPATTRO as a silencer in the earlier part of the disease to get adequate treatment. Yes. It's a great question. Thank you. If I indicated before, it's little too soon for us to really give a lot of specific dynamics. It's an area where we're obviously closely monitoring. What we're encouraged about is the early side indicate that we do see some \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a little younger patients, but again it's difficult to generalize at this point. We're only five weeks into the launch. What we're again excited about is the fact that we are seeing a broad range of patients quickly getting either switched or not even being treated. Part of it, I'm sure is going to be a little bit of the warehousing, but it's important to highlight that in Q1 we had a great strong robust ONPATTRO growth. With what we originally thought was probably the patients, the physicians will be waiting and warehousing some of those patients for AMVUTTRA that didn't exactly happen. But I'm certain that part of the uptake that we see in the first five weeks might be contributed to that warehousing dynamic. Thanks Yvonne. Obviously we're very well positioned to be able to maximize the opportunity for AMVUTTRA given our experiences with ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA's really attractive profiles being subcutaneous injectable every months. In regards to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in regards to the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 how the timing is going to work is look, I mean, at the end of the day we do have the right capabilities, right patient services, benefit verification, and so forth already in place within this category. And what we've so far done is working very closely with not only with major national and regional payers, but also with integrated delivery networks and other health providers to make sure that formularies are in place. Given the fact that we actually also set the price despite its very attractive profile its parity with ONPATTRO, we have not so far seen any significant headwind. Nevertheless like any new product it does take time for the healthcare system to absorb and make sure the PNT committees and so forth are in place to get the product approved. We're very pleased with the early signs of what we've so far done and how the healthcare systems are reacting, but I'm sure we're going to see some delays early on and eventually get to a place where I think it's going to be at parity with ONPATTRO or even maybe a little faster approval dynamic, but it's a little too soon for us to share where we are right now with that. Hi, Gary. I mean, look at the end of the day, what we're really excited about is AMVUTTRA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profile is giving us the ability and physicians the ability to be able to actually diagnosis and treat more patients. And what we've so far seen early signs is in terms of initiations it's both when it comes to switches, as well as naive patients. We have a good, robust patient services and our patients have been informed about the availability and some of those patients proactively reached out to their physicians.  What we've also seen is, as I indicated earlier, a good new, prescribers coming into the treatment of this condition and excited to be actually providing this medicine to those patients that probably were on the fence given that was an infusion with ONPATTRO earlier profile and AMVUTTRA tends to offer a very convenient option with great safety and efficacy data. Therefore we do what we so far seen in 133 start forms is a good, broad range of both patient prescriber base, as well as patient demographics that ranges across younger as well as more traditional demographics. What we are really interested at this point is really to make sure that the overall category is growing. So our focus is actually right now is really to make sure that we are bringing as many as new patients as possible given this new option. The switch is what we believe is going to play out a little more organically and will obviously update the Street for about a year about the switch and net naive patients. What we expect that to organically happen is most patients will end up with AMVUTTRA given its profile. However, we also know that in rare diseases, there are patients who are pleased with their existing treatment. Some of these patients never had any new treatment before AMVUTTRA sorry ONPATTRO was available. So we do expect some patients to remain on therapy. But in similar dynamics that we've seen is \u00e2\u0080\u0093 similar dynamics that we've seen in other categories patients tend to gravitate towards a more better option, which we believe AMVUTTRA is. But I also wanted to take the opportunity to remind everyone that we are going to be updating on the start form dynamics for two to three quarters. Great point. We really appreciate the excitement around the strong launch of AMVUTTRA, yet it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only five week of data. So we wanted to make sure that we all recognize that the  data we're providing is as good as we possibly can at this point. Those 34 new patients are na\u00c3\u00afve to us. And in terms of your own modeling one should also remember that the TEGSEDI remains a very small portion of the overall category. So we wouldn't necessarily index our na\u00c3\u00afve patients just only on switches from an alternative treatment. Exactly. Yes. Yes. So thanks for the question. So the lumar recurrence stone formation study is ongoing is obviously a very large population globally numbering in the millions probably. And what we want to see is a reduction in urinary oxalate. Now in the pH1 population, of course, we saw very such reductions urinary oxalate, they have an enzymatic defect in the liver. And the targeting of GO1 leads to 70 plus percent reduction in urinary oxylate. This is a hypothesis we're testing. One of the interesting things is we may not need to achieve levels like that to see a reduction in stone events. And so let's look at the data as it comes out next year and see. And I say that because the important thing is once oxalate becomes saturating levels in the urine that's when stone formation occurs. So you may not need to take it all the way back down to normal, you might just need to get it out of that super saturation range by some relatively modest margin to prevent stone formation. And so lots more work to do here, and we'll update you as we get data, but this is a very exciting opportunity with an approved drug that looks very safe to find the PH1 population. And that just reminds me of several safety will also be important seeing the RF population, but we're optimistic with what we've seen so far with Luma in PH1. Yes, we're very excited about the Phase 2 result with a 37% reduction in urinary proteinuria. Busy working with Regeneron right now, we take the lead in this program in the ICAN study design and we are sort of very busily looking forward to engaging regulatory authorities and hopefully kicking off the study by the year end. The specifics of where compliment or anti complement approaches sit, the interesting thing is the fundamental underlying pathology here are IGA immune complex is that  activate compliment that activated compliment then damages the glomerular basement membrane and proteinuria results. An additional aspect of the disease, I don't think anyone really understands how this occur is hyperfiltration in the kidney and says blood flow dynamics change through glomerulus. So we have the opportunity here orthogonally to impact two key pathogenic factors. With anti-compliment approaches we can get at the fundamental underlying immunopathology and we've seen the preliminary results we've shared. So this will have a foundational role, I believe, in the future in what will end up being a polypharmacy situation where there will be anti-inflammatory approaches like anti-compliment cemdisiran would be a great fit for that. It could be a once a month, once every three months type injection. And then in addition to that things that alter blood flow, so endothelin antagonist, ACE inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, et cetera. And so you will see drugs from both classes, the antihypertensive type drugs and anti-complement drugs being combined. And we'll see if steroids will also become part of the picture, but there is more work to do there, although they are rather general nonspecific agents and have  side effects. And just to add up what these favorable results open up the potential for cemdisiran, if the needs of patients with other  seizures, so we're enthusiastically moving forward here. Thank you for the question. One more question. I think we have one more question before we close. Last question, please. Yes, I mean, look, we certainly have the right capabilities to support those patients. The fact that we've been able to position this at parity pricing, so certainly we believe will help increase access. So far we haven't really had heard any headwinds around the access piece. But we are indicated for polyneuropathy and in the U.S. tafamidis is indicated for cardiomyopathy. So in terms of providing any brief strategy for access would not be something we would consider. Like any of our new patients, we have great support of benefit verification and patient access support, which those patients would certainly be eligible if they go through our patient service program."

            "content": "Thanks Akshay, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam's Q2 2022 financial results and an update to our full year guidance. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for Q2 2022. Total product revenues for the quarter were $214 million or 33% growth versus Q2 2021. It's also worth noting that year-over-year growth in combined product revenues was held back by approximately 7% due to the foreign exchange impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar, which reached a 20-year high recently. And given that approximately 50% of our product revenues are generated via sales of international markets. Net revenue from collaborations for the second quarter was approximately $9 million representing an 85% decrease compared with Q2 2021, primarily due to a reduction in revenue from our Regeneron collaboration, which is subject to quarter-to-quarter variability dependent on a variety of factors including the level of work completed during the quarter, which is reimbursed by Regeneron. We do expect an increase in collaboration revenue and royalties in the second half of the year, primarily driven by increased activity across our Regeneron programs, as well as from an increased associated with Leqvio royalties and sales milestones as Novartis's U.S. launch progresses. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 15% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2021 primarily due to increased spend on early development activities and increased headcount to support the growth of our pipeline. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 19% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to increased headcount and other expenses to support the growth of our commercial portfolio. Our non-GAAP operating loss for Q2 2022 was $161 million representing a $47 million higher loss compared with Q2 2021, which was primarily impacted by the reduction in collaboration revenue during the quarter. Finally, at the end of the quarter with cash, cash equivalence and marketable securities of $2.1 billion compared to $2.4 billion at the end of 2021. We continue to believe our current cash balance is sufficient bridges to a self-sustainable financial profile. Now I'd like to turn to our full year 2022 financial guidance. Following the strength of our operating results in Q2, we are reiterating the financial guidance we provided on our Q1 results call in April. Starting with net product revenues we anticipate combined net product revenues for our four commercialized products will be between $870 million and $930 million. However, given the continued strengthen of the U.S. dollar since we issued our guidance in April, and the fact that approximately 50% of our global product sales are generated in the international markets, we are currently trending towards the lower half of our $870 million to $930 million guidance range. Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties is a ranged between $175 million and $225 million, and our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses is a ranged between $1,390 million and $1,450 million. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones on deck through the end of 2022. We'll continue executing on our global commercialization of ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO as well as the launch of AMVUTTRA. Next our TTR franchise will have important updates with Patisiran's top line results from the APOLLO Phase 3 study are expected in the next three weeks. With Vutrisiran we plan to report results on a biannual dose regimen and initiate a Phase 3 study in Stargardt Disease both in late 2022. Lastly, we plan to file an IND and initiate a Phase 1 study for ALN-TTRsc04 in healthy volunteers by the end of the year. In our mid-stage portfolio we are looking forward to milestones that include completion of enrollment in the Phase 2 study of Lumasiran in patients with recurrent renal stones by year-end. Completion of enrollment in our Phase 2 KARDIA-2 study of Zilebesiran at or around year-end, and results from the Phase 2 study of ALN-HBV02 in combination with monoclonal antibody VIR-3434, which are partners that we expect to report later this year. Wrapping up, we have a few early stage readouts coming as well. These include top line results from Part B of the Phase 1 study of ALN-HSD in patients with NASH expected in mid-2022. Preliminary top line results from the Phase 1 study of ALN-APP in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease expected in late 2022 and preliminary top line results from the Phase 1 study of ALN-XDH in patients with gout also expected for late 2022. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?"

            "name": "Akshay Vaishnaw",
            "content": "Thanks Tolga and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our efforts in AT amyloidosis doses where we are advancing two clinical stage product candidates: Patisiran and Vutrisiran. While Patisiran are on ONPATTRO currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat polyneuropathy associated with hereditary AT amyloidosis doses. We are committed to expanding the product's label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type AT amyloidosis patients. Excuse me, to this end we're conducting the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study and as announced this morning, we expect to report top line results within the next three weeks. We're also advancing Vutrisiran, which is delivered by quarterly subcutaneous injection and was recently approved in the U.S. under the brand name AMVUTTRA to treat the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in addition to receiving the positive CHMP opinion in the EU. Here to we are committed to expanding the label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in hereditary and wild\u00e2\u0080\u0091type patients. Vutrisiran is also in development for Stargardt Disease. HELIOS-A evaluating Vutrisiran in hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy formed the basis by regulatory submissions and recent U.S. approved AMVUTTRA. In April 2021 we presented positive results from the study at the AAN meeting, which shows the study met its primary and secondary endpoints at nine months. We continued to report results from the study and recently presented new 18-month results from exploratory cardiac endpoints at the ESC HF meeting. These findings show that in a variety of pre-defined \u00e2\u0080\u0093 show that in a pre-defined cardiac sub-population of hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy, treatment with Vutrisiran was associated with improvements in exploratory cardiac endpoints relative to external placebo, including levels of NT-proBNP and a trend towards improvement in echocardiographic parameters. These findings in the cardiac subpopulation were consistent with the previously reported results in the mITT population. Additionally, in a planned cohort of patients from the mITT population, Vutrisiran treatment reduced cardiac uptake of technetium on scintigraphy imaging relative to baseline in the majority of accessible patients, including those with paradigm equal to two at baseline, suggesting that patients with the highest degrees of cardiac amyloid burden may recognize benefit from RNAi therapeutics. Vutrisiran also continue to demonstrate an encouraging safety and tolerability profile. As mentioned this is just the start for Vutrisiran as is also being evaluated in the HELIOS-B Phase 3 study for the treatment of patients with AT amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy including both hereditary and wild-type AT amyloidosis. HELIOS-B which is fully enrolled has a 30-month endpoint of all-cause mortality in CV events with many patients followed up to 36 months and we expect the full results in early 2024. The study design includes the potential for an interim analysis, and we will consider this following results from APOLLO-B and engagement with regulatory authorities. In addition to our late stage clinical programs, we believe we've also been making great progress without early and mid-stage programs. Notable highlight in the second quarter was our announcement of positive top line results from our Phase 2 study of Cemdisiran an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting the C5 component of the complement pathway and is in development in collaboration with Regeneron for the treatment of IgA nephropathy or IgAN. In this study at week-32 treatment with Cemdisiran resulted in a 37% mean reduction from baseline in the 24-hour urine protein-to-creatinine ratio relative to placebo. This was the primary endpoint of the study and an important prognostic marker of disease progression. The results of secondary endpoints were also consistent with the therapeutic benefit of Cemdisiran in IgAN. There were no significant drug related safety signals, and we believe these collective efficacy and safety data support continued clinical development of Cemdisiran monotherapy in patients with IgAN. We now look forward to gaining a line with Regeneron to finalize plans for Phase 3 and hope to initiate a program by the end of this year, pending regulatory agency feedback. Moving on a key growth driver for Alnylam in the years come will be our organic product engine driving sustainable innovation. The second quarter features a new highlight in this regard. In Nature Biotechnology we published data from preclinical research on the delivery of lipophilic siRNA conjugates extrahepatic tissues including the CNS. These data provides early evidence of a potential role for 2'-O-hexadecy C16 conjugate siRNA in treating diseases of the CNS eye and lung with further exploring the potential for lipid conjugates to help achieve delivery to other organs. In another publication in Nature Communications this time we published research findings identifying mutations in the INHBE gene associated with protection against abdominal obesity and metabolic syndrome, a condition impacting more than 20% of adults to avoid. Finding support the potential of INHBE which was previously referred to as Gen X to be evaluated as a novel therapeutic treatment of the treatment of Cardio-Metabolic Diseases, since INHBE loss of function improves waist-to-hip ratio and is associated with an improved lipid profile. With plan to pursue a development candidate for INHBE and its gene product actively leveraging out IKARIA platform. As you can appreciate, we have an incredibly broad and innovative platform that continues to advance and these are just a few recent highlights. We look forward to updating you on a number of these programs in the coming months. With that let me now turn the call over to Jeff to review our financials and upcoming milestones. Jeff? Yes. Just clarifying Dave that you said Vutrisiran, but I suspect you met the Patisiran with respect to the APOLLO-B results, am I correct? Yes. And you are right we'll present top line results in the form of the PR with P-values as we test the primary and secondaries in a hierarchical order. So that's as much  present time. Yes. We've revisited the study designs and thoroughly assessed how robust is the study? Is it structured and powered in a way to help us meet the primary endpoint of the factory endpoint and we are comfortable with the study design. And so the study designs unaltered the only thing we'll consider is the interim analysis, of course in due course. And the other thing I would say by the way is that, as you, patients come in over a long period in the study in a large study like that, so many of them will have gone to 36 months and that provides additional coverage in terms of the robustness of the study. So we're comfortable and we'd reiterate later early 2024 and looking forward to positive results. No, I think you covered it Yvonne. The only other thing more specifically on the streamlining is we may inevitably more in these protocols, one tries to capture as much scientific information as one can. But given the needs of the program we're able to remove some of the assessments, don't take anything away from the core issue downtown hypertensive effects and safety, and so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and yet maintain two large robust protocols, which will be easier to approve one in monotherapy and one in combination therapy. So between the site expansion and these things, the profiles we are optimistic about readouts next year. That's right. Yes. Thank you, Yvonne. Look, first of all we are always excited to bring new mode of medication, different alternative treatments to patients because there's a lot of wood to chop when it comes to TTR PN prevalence and what the patients that are currently being treated. We anticipate the prevalence numbers around 25,000 to 30,000 patients worldwide and we are a very small fraction of that that we've been able to deliver. So what we've seen in similar categories, a good expansion of diagnosis and treatment rates going on. In regards to where we are, look at the end of the day we have been able to actually establish ourselves in the last four years as the major driver including in Europe and Japan against tafamidis that's also been promoted by an important company. One of the important, I think, drivers of our growth is going be obviously the making AMVUTTRA available worldwide. And we are well positioned to do that. We have Europe and Japan and geographic footprint and available in over 50 markets through other partners and distributors. Given the fact that we're going to be a year ahead already off set competition and plus again a very attractive profile that AMVUTTRA offers for the patients with the subcutaneous injectable over three months, and soon with six months if those trials work. We really like our chats in terms of how we're well positioned to be able to make this product available and continue to be a leader \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as a portfolio leader. But again, I just want to reiterate, having said that there are going to be products available and that's good for patients, and we're excited about that. Yes, no, I'll just add to what Tolga said which was makes a lot of sense, but in terms of the data themselves, I think, we've got a very comprehensive data associated with vutrisiran around AMVUTTRA in hATTR and of course the primary showing improvement in neuropathy which is exciting. And in terms of the other end points for the secondary, but not just those exploratory cardiac endpoint, the impact on the heart and  the respiratory endpoints, but still notable, particularly with the new observation of the reducing technician scan uptake. And that that's very exciting for patients and physicians. And so, along with the convenience Q3, and then hopefully soon Q6 monthly dosing, this is a very differentiated product in the market that Tolga explained. We've been leaders in and ultimately I will add that love patients need good options in this space will want to see the full data package associated with frontiersin  recalling that the first time round with inotersen and there were some safety issues of note including renal effects, injection site reactions, platelet effects. And I'm sure they, and everybody is keen to know that the safety is good. So let's see, but I think we're off to a great start with AMVUTTRA."

            "name": "Yvonne Greenstreet",
            "content": "Thanks, Christine. And thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. We are very pleased with our second quarter results and the progress we've made towards our near- and long-term goals. Commercially, we achieved 14% product sales growth compared with the first quarter as we continue to drive a steady increase in patients on therapy across our portfolio of marketed products, including ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. And we're excited to have expanded that portfolio with a recent U.S. approval and positive CHMP opinion for ONPATTRO for hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. And we are looking forward to executing on ONPATTRO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s launch and the potential for further global expansion. Five RNAi therapeutics from our organic platform approved in under four years is truly remarkable. In addition to our growing commercial portfolio, we continue to make great strides with our RNAi therapeutic pipeline programs. This includes our progress in establishing our TTR franchise, where we are tracking towards plan and are on the cusp of seeing results from the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study of patisiran in patients with ATTR amyloidosis, with cardiomyopathy. We've announced the day that we expect to share top line data within the next three weeks with full data to be released thereafter at the medical congress. In addition to these highly anticipated results, we also continue to make exciting progress across numerous other progress within our pipeline. We have and continue to innovate a part of what we believe to be one of the most productive, organic and self-sustainable platforms in biotech, which has the potential to deliver meaningful value creating therapies for rare and prevalent diseases in the years to come. To that end, there are many recent and upcoming milestones that underscore the breadth and scope of our pipeline. The cemdisiran we reported positive top line Phase 2 results in patients with IgA nephropathy, a kidney disease with significant unmet medical need. We're now working with Regeneron, to finalize Phase 3 plans, and potentially initiate the program by the end of this year. We were also excited to see positive data presented by Sanofi from the Phase 3 ATLAS-PPX study of fitusiran in patients with hemophilia, which met its primary endpoint and demonstrated that fitusiran prophylaxis, significantly reduce breathing episodes compared to prior factor bypassing agent prophylaxis. Looking through to the end of this year, we expect to have updates across our pipeline, including the potential for top line results from early studies, of AI and HSV in NASH, AI and XVH in Gouache, and AI and ATP in early onset Alzheimer's disease. Our first CNS endeavor. Sticking together, this all highlights our focus on these three key drivers for Alnylam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth of the next several years. First, is the potential near term expansion of our TCR franchise opportunity, where we aim to become a global leader in delivering impactful and highly differentiated medicine to patients. The second key growth driver is our expansion beyond rare diseases into prevalent diseases. And the third growth driver for the company comes from our sustainable innovation engine, comprised of new platform, enhancements opportunities to extrahepatic delivery, and our ability to find new genetically validated targets, which can drive further pipeline expansion to 2025 and beyond. We believe all of this positions as well to deliver on our Alnylam P fifth by 25 goals, making Alnylam a top biotech company, developing and commercializing transformative medicines for rare and common diseases for patients around the world, driven by high yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while deliver exceptional financial results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga, to review our commercial performance. Toga? Thanks Paul for that question. I just like to start off by saying that we really are delighted to have  with AMVUTTRA and it's great to have additional ONPATTRO for patients here and its target that on the call, the initial sign but also very, very encouraging. Tolga, I'd like to hand over this question to you. So it's around the commercial dynamics with respect to the initial launch, how much in cardiology and then any commentary on the economics with respect to ONPATTRO compared to fitusiran from a physician perspective? Thanks Tolga. Great. David thanks for that question. I think the first one Akshay is for you. I think Tolga that that question is straight over to you. Maybe I'll stop by retracing our confidence in an early 2024 data readout from HELIOS-B and Akshay any perspective on how we might think about that study going forward. Yes. That's a great question and clearly with AMVUTTRA being our second product in the TTR franchise, we're really building on what's a very robust commercial operation that we have under Tolga's leadership. Tolga perhaps you could talk a little bit about that  speaking? Yes. Just to everybody it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reminder, we unfortunately experienced and delays with our KARDIA-1 study with zilebesiran primarily due to the fact that we selected sites in the Ukraine and obviously with the ongoing war those sites were unable to move forward. We've expanded our site footprint in a very fee progress upfront. We also took the opportunity to just refine the protocol to make it an easier study to execute the . I don't know, Akshay, do you want to add any? Thanks. Yes, look I think that was primary question about, how we believe that we're going to compete in the TTR PN space, particularly with potential new competitors coming on stream with AstraZeneca. Hi, Anupam. That's a great question. And thank you for putting it forward very precisely. So I think Tolga, there is a specific question here around what our market research is setting up right about the time for sort of peak switching. Just one other comment. From a modeling perspective. It doesn't matter for ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA the same price, same value per patient per year. So just a reminder on that point. Yes. Good opportunity to grow. Yes, thanks, Gena. I can reiterate the drop in rates remain well within expectations. And I think I've discussed before we obviously had put in a buffer in the sample size to account for tap drops. We are well within those estimates. So we're comfortable with the design Gena. Thank you. Actually, I'm not sure if you called all of that. I think it's around the  study, what we're looking to see from Phase 2 data, how we're thinking about oxalate reduction and then I think plans for moving forward that study. So quite a few questions there. I mean really just yes, I think start off by reiterating that we were really pleased with the Phase 2 results of fitusiran patient with  property, very common condition, 37% reduction in , I think this is great. And I think kind of it's another potential Phase 3 program for Alnylam. So we're very pleased to be working with our partners Regeneron moving forward the next steps. Actually, I think there were enough questions in there, but I think much more specific around how we're thinking about that program. So I just want to say, you pointed out we are in a quiet period, so we're not going to be taking any questions on APOLLO-B, but I didn't actually quite catch your second question. I think it was something to do with AMVUTTRA, but I didn't hear it properly. Could you repeat the question, the second part of the question? You mean plug neuropathy and mixed phenotype patients? Okay. So thank you everyone for joining us on this call. We're very happy with the progress that we've made in the second quarter and first half of 2022. We've delivered strong commercial results. We've advanced our diversified pipeline programs and development, and we've got a number of exciting catalysts on deck in the coming months. So we look forward to updating you along the way while we continue to deliver on our near and long goals. Thanks everyone. And have a great day."

Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Christine, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. The first quarter of 2022 was another quarter of continued progress at Alnylam across our commercial and pipeline portfolios. First, despite an expected quarter-on-quarter decrease in combined product revenues from our commercial portfolio of ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, we observed a steady increase in patients on therapy. Alongside that commercial progress, our RNAi therapeutic pipeline programs continued to advance. With the TTR franchise, we present a positive 18-month results from the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study of vutrisiran. The NDA for vutrisiran is under review, with a new PDUFA date of July the 14, 2022, following the 3 months delay, we announced earlier in April to allow for the review of newly added information related to a new secondary packaging and labeling facility. We also brought new programs into the clinic with the initiation of two Phase 1 studies. And today, we announced that the Phase 1 study as ALN-XDH, patients with gout has been initiated. Additionally, the first on Alnylam, RNAi therapeutic, targeting a CNS disorder, ALN-APP has entered Phase 1, a very exciting milestone for our platform. And initial top line results from both of these programs are expected in late 2022. Looking further out, we believe Alnylam is poised for significant growth based on three key drivers. First is the potential near-term expansion of our TTR franchise, where we aim to become the global leader in delivering impactful and highly differentiated medicines to patients. Second, is our expansion beyond rare diseases into prevalent diseases. And a third key growth driver for the company comes from our sustainable innovation engine comprised of new platform enhancements, opportunities with extrahepatic delivery, and our ability to find new genetically validated targets, which can drive further pipeline expansion to 2025 and beyond. We believe all of this positions us well to deliver on our Alnylam P5x25 goals, making Alnylam a top biotech company developing and commercializing transformative medicines for rare and common diseases for patients around the world, driven by a high-yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering exceptional financial results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga, for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks, Yvonne, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter reflected steady progress, as we increase the number of commercial patients on therapy across our three products by 9%. In spite of this increase, Q1 reported revenues decreased by 6%, compared with Q4 2021, as Q4 benefited from a variety of non-recurring stocking and gross net benefits. Additionally, we did experience some headwinds from COVID in the early part of Q1, particularly in the U.S., where we saw a decrease in patient compliance across our portfolio in January and February, when Omicron cases were at their peak. We are encouraged by improved market conditions that developed in March that have extended further into April. And we're cautiously optimistic that COVID will have minimal impact on our commercial operations for the balance of the year, recognizing that the course of the pandemic remains uncertain. I will now provide details on the performance of each of our products. For ONPATTRO, we achieved $137 million in global net product revenues in the first quarter, representing a 1% decrease compared with the fourth quarter and 34% growth compared with Q1 2021. At the end of Q1, over 2,200 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO treatment worldwide, up from over 2,050 patients at year-end 2021, representing steady 7% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S., sales of ONPATTRO increased 4% versus Q4 2021 and were primarily impacted by the following. A 7% increase in demand driven by an increase in patients on therapy, which was negatively impacted by a decrease in patient compliance, primarily in January and February when Omicron cases were at their peak. Inventory stocking dynamics, which contributed to a 6% decrease in reported growth and a modest decrease in gross to net deductions in the quarter, contributing to a 3% increase in reported growth. In our international markets, ONPATTRO Q1 product sales declined 5% versus Q4, despite an increase in patients on therapy due to an increase in gross net deductions following Q4, which included several non-recurring benefits, along with an unfavorable foreign exchange impact due to strengthening U.S dollar in Q1, which impacted results across all three commercial products. Moving to GIVLAARI, we achieved $35 million in global net product revenues in the first quarter, representing a 13% decrease compared with Q4 2021 and 43% growth versus Q1 2021. At the end of Q1, over 400 patients were on commercial GIVLAARI treatment worldwide, up from over 250 at year-end '21 representing robust 14% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S., sales of GIVLAARI decreased 22% versus Q4 '21, and were primarily impacted by the following. Flat patient demand, despite a 5% increase in patients on therapy due to reduced patient compliance, which was negatively impacted by COVID in January and February; inventory stocking dynamics, which negatively impacted reported growth by 15%; and an increase in gross to net deductions in the quarter, which negatively impacted reported growth by 7% following the fourth quarter, which included several non-recurring gross to net benefits. In our international markets, GIVLAARI delivered 11% growth in Q1 compared with Q4 '21, with the growth primarily driven by new patient adds across key markets and geographic expansion, including an initial contribution from the U.K., following Q1 commercial launch. Moving now to OXLUMO, we achieved $50 million in global net product revenues in the first quarter, representing a 24% decrease compared with Q4 '21and 59% growth versus Q1 2021. At the end of Q1, over 160 patients were on commercial OXLUMO treatment worldwide, up from over 140 at year-end '21, representing 14% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S., sales of OXLUMO decreased by 5% versus Q4 2021 and were primarily impacted by the following. A 6% increase in patient demand, driven by an increase in patients on therapy, and an increase in gross to net deductions in the quarter, which more than offset the demand growth and negatively impacted reported growth by 11%. OXLUMO sales decreased in our international markets by 32% during the first quarter compared with Q4, despite an increase in patients on therapy during the quarter, primarily due to an increase in gross to net deductions following Q4, which included several non-recurring benefits, as well as the timing of order in partner in emerging markets. In conclusion, as expected, despite the reduction in reported revenue growth during the quarter, and challenges from COVID in the early part of the quarter, we remain encouraged by the steady growth in patients, we achieved across three products, particularly our performance with ONPATTRO during the quarter. Additionally, even though we were disappointed by the 3-month PDUFA delay for vutrisiran in the U.S., we are poised to launch the product upon potential FDA approval by the new July 14 PDUFA date, and we remain confident that this will continue to represent an attractive option for TTR polyneuropathy patients and an incremental growth opportunity for our TTR franchise. With that, I will now turn it over to Pushkal, to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal?\nPushkal Garg: Thanks, Tolga, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by updating you on our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we are advancing two product candidates, patisiran and vutrisiran across a number of clinical indications. While patisiran or ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to the polyneuropathy associated with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. We are committed to expanding the products labeled to the treatment of cardiomyopathy, in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end, we're conducting the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study, and we remain on track to report top line results in the middle of this year. We're also advancing vutrisiran, which is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection, and it's also in development for ATTR amyloidosis, as well as Stargardt disease. In ATTR amyloidosis, we're conducting two Phase 3 studies. The first is HELIOS-A, which is evaluating vutrisiran and hereditary ATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. In April 2021, we presented positive results from the study at the AAN meeting, which shows the study met its primary and secondary endpoints at 9 months. Those data form the basis for our regulatory submissions to both the FDA and EMA, which are currently under review. As we announced a few weeks ago, the FDA has extended the review timeline of the NDA to allow for the review of newly added information related to a new secondary packaging and labeling facility. Specifically, we submitted an amendment to our NDA, upon learning that the original third-party secondary packaging and labeling facility we plan to use for the vutrisiran launch was recently inspected as part of a routine cGMP inspection. This inspection was unrelated to the vutrisiran application, but as its outcome was unknown, it nevertheless could have resulted in vutrisiran receiving a complete response letter with uncertainty regarding the timeframe for resolution. While our amendment resulted in a 3-month extension, we believe that this approach offers the fastest path to a potential approval. The updated PDUFA goal date to allow for this review is July 14, 2022. I'd like to reiterate that the inspection issues raised at the original facility were not specifically related to vutrisiran, there have been no questions with regard to the safety or efficacy of the product, and there have been no additional clinical data or trials requested. In addition to these 9-month results, we all presented positive data from the 18-month analysis of the study in January of this year at the SFNP meeting in France. We're delighted that HELIOS-A met all secondary endpoints measured at 18 months including statistically significant improvements in neuropathy, as measured by the modified neuropathy impairment score or mNIS+7, quality of life, gait speed, nutritional status, and overall disability relative to external placebo data from the APOLLO Phase 3 study. Furthermore, at 18 months, vutrisiran also demonstrated improvement compared to external placebo, and the exploratory cardiac endpoint NT-proBNP and trend towards improvement in echocardiographic parameters as well as improvement compared to baseline in cardiac uptake of technetium on scintigraphy imaging. We believe that taken together these data, along with the exploratory cardiac data from the original APOLLO study, provide evidence to suggest that TTR silencing by patisiran and vutrisiran treatment may potentially improve the cardiac manifestations of this disease. Patisiran also demonstrate encouraging safety and tolerability profile, as shown by the data on this slide.  We're very pleased with the totality of these results and the profile of vutrisiran that continues to evolve. We believe that based on these data, vutrisiran, if approved, will present an exciting commercial opportunity, providing an attractive treatment option for patients with ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. In addition, I'll also remind you that we are seeking to further reduce the burden of treatment for patients by evaluating in every 6-month regimen of vutrisiran and the extension period of HELIOS-A, with data expected later this year. Of course, this is just the start for vutrisiran, as we're also conducting another Phase 3 study, HELIOS-B, which is our ongoing Phase 3 cardiac outcome study with vutrisiran in hereditary and wild-type amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy. HELIOS-B, which is fully enrolled as a 30-month endpoint of all-cause mortality and CV events, and we expect the full results in early 2024. The study design includes the potential for an interim analysis, and we will consider this after reviewing the results from the APOLLO-B and engaging with regulatory authorities. In addition to our late-stage clinical programs, we believe we've also been making great progress with our early and mid-stage programs. As we've highlighted for some time, a key growth driver from Alnylam is our expansion beyond rare diseases into prevalent conditions. A great example is our program in hypertension. Zilebesiran is our investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting angiotensinogen or AGT, which is in development for the treatment of hypertension. Zilebesiran is being evaluated in the Phase 2 KARDIA program. The first of these two studies KARDIA-1 is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran as a monotherapy in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. The second of these studies KARDIA-2 was initiated late last year and is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran as an add on therapy in patients with hypertension despite treatment with standard of care agents. We've announced this morning that we are experiencing enrollment delays in KARDIA-1 in part due to impacts of the situation in Ukraine, as well as the ongoing pandemic. We're expanding the geographic footprint of the study, and are also streamlining certain aspects of the protocol to facilitate enrollment. As a result, we now expect to complete enrollment in KARDIA-1 in early 2023 with top line results expected in mid-2023. We are implementing similar measures in KARDIA-2 as well, so as to complete enrollment at/or around year-end. Another key growth driver for Alnylam in the years to come will be our organic product engine driving sustainable innovation, with the goal of bringing two to four new molecules into the clinic each year. Here we achieved some notable progress in the first quarter. We announced this morning that the Phase 1 study of ALN-XDH in patients with gout has been initiated. This is an exciting program based on our work with the U.K Biobank, where we found that heterozygous loss of function of XDH was associated with significantly reduced serum urate and a lower risk of gout. We expect top line results in late 2022. We also achieved a major milestone with the initiation of our Phase 1 study of ALN-APP, our first RNAi therapeutic targeting a CNS disorder. ALN-APP is an innovative program with the potential to address both Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Initiating this program is a key step towards expanding our pipeline into extrahepatic tissues and we look forward to top line results in late 2022 here as well. These are just a few highlights among the many exciting programs we're advancing to address important unmet needs for patients. And we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff?\nJeff Poulton: Thanks, Pushkal, good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting on Alnylam's Q1 2022 financial results, and I will also provide an update on our 2022 financial guidance. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for Q1 2022. Total product revenues for the quarter were $187 million or 38% growth versus Q1 2021 with all three marketed products contributing more than 30% year-over-year growth. It is also worth highlighting that year-over-year growth in combined product revenue was held back by approximately 5% due to the foreign exchange impact of a strengthening U.S dollar and given that approximately 50% of our product revenues are generated via sales in international markets. Net revenue from collaborations for the first quarter was approximately $26 million, representing a 38% decrease compared with Q1 2021, primarily due to reduction in revenue from our Regeneron collaboration, which is subject to quarter-to-quarter variability dependent on a variety of factors including the level of work completed during the quarter, which is reimbursed by Regeneron. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses decreased 2% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to modestly reduced clinical trial expenses across the portfolio. However, we do expect an increase in year-over-year R&D expenses for the balance of the year, primarily driven by an increase in spend associated with our plans to increase enrollment and our zilebesiran KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2 Phase 2 studies. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 18% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to increased legal expenses, charitable contributions, and other expenses to support our strategic growth. Our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were approximately $295 million in Q1 2022, representing 6% growth versus Q1 2021 as we continue to advance our pipeline and deliver strong top line growth, while maintaining discipline in how we invest in our operations. Our non-GAAP operating loss for Q1 2022 was $117 million representing a $13 million improvement compared with Q1 2021 as we continue to progress on our journey towards building a self-sustainable financial profile, aligned with our P5x25 goals. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.2 billion, compared to $2.4 billion at the end of 2021. Now turning to our financial guidance. Despite steady progress and adding patients across our three commercial brands in Q1, we have decided to reduce our combined product revenue guidance for two primary reasons. First, as we announced earlier this month, our FDA PDUFA date for vutrisiran has been delayed by 3 months. And secondly, a strengthening U.S dollar has created a foreign exchange headwind for our international operations, which today comprise approximately 50% of our global sales. As a result, we have reduced our full year combined product revenue guidance from an original range of $900 million to $1 billion to a revised range of $870 million to $930 million, representing a 5% reduction at the midpoint of the ranges. This updated guidance assumes approval of vutrisiran in the U.S by the revised PDUFA date of July 14, as well as foreign exchange rates as of April 18, that are footnoted at the bottom of our guidance slide. Additionally, we've also reduced or non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expense guidance from an original range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion to a revised range of $1,390 million to $1,450 million as we seek partially offset the reduction in our top line guidance. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones on deck through mid-2022. To start, we will continue executing on our global commercialization of ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. On the R&D side, we have an exciting clinical readout coming up with cemdisiran where we plan to report Phase 2 monotherapy results in IgA nephropathy in early 2022. We plan to continue advancing our TTR franchise with patisiran. We look forward to top line results from the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study in mid-2022. With patisiran, we look forward to the potential approval and U.S launch of our fifth RNAi therapeutic with a new PDUFA date of July 14. Approval in the EU is anticipated mid-year with subsequent launches in key markets to follow, pending finalization of pricing and reimbursement. With ALN-HSD, we expect to report top line results from Part B of the Phase 1 study in patients with NASH in mid-2022. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, we will now open the call for your questions. To those dialed in, we would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each and then get back in the queue if you have additional questions.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from David Lebowitz with Citi.\nDavidLebowitz: Thank you very much for taking my question. When you look at the ONPATTRO performance in the quarter, did you happen to notice any different dynamics in the prescriber, a cardiologist versus neurologist at the start?\nYvonne Greenstreet: So, thanks for that question, David. Real quick, we're pleased with the growth that we're seeing with respect to patient demand with ONPATTRO. But I'll turn it over to Tolga to answer your specific question.\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. Hi, good morning. Look, at the end of the day, this is a multisystem disease and we do know that both neurologists and cardiologists play a very important role in the treatment. We have not really seen any change in the way the product is prescribed across the globe. We certainly had seen some, as we indicated on the call, some softness in January and February, particularly in the adherence compliance rate. But we are very encouraged by what we've seen in March. And the Omicron impact obviously is dissipating as we also seen in April.\nDavidLebowitz: Got it. And when looking at the shift in guidance as you've cited, reduction relative to the vutrisiran PDUFA date being put or delayed. How are we supposed to look at it as a component of that change that vutrisiran delay for the overall guidance change? And I guess I'm trying to level in on how should we view expectations for the drug for this year?\nJeff Poulton: Yes, hi. This is Jeff. We updated our guidance, as I said on the call for two primary reasons. One is the FX strengthening U.S dollar, given the percentage of revenue that we generate from ex U.S markets. And secondly, because of the delay in the PDUFA date for vutrisiran. And the thinking there is that, we've talked about vutrisiran being a growth driver overall for the TTR franchise for, I would say, for three primary reasons. One is that we think it'll be very attractive, attractively positioned for those mixed phenotype patients. We think for potential switches from competitive products. And then lastly, for patients that have been diagnosed, but not yet on treatment, we think vutrisiran will grow our overall franchise as a result of its profile. So, the guidance just reflects the fact that we'll have -- assuming approval by July 14, that we'll have the product on the market for one less quarter than we originally anticipated when we got it in February.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Tolga, any anything you'd like to add?\nTolga Tanguler: Yes, I mean, look, we're really excited about vutri. It clearly provides another growth opportunity for the TTR franchise. We built what we'd like to think a good strong growth engine within the TTR franchise across our key markets. And vutrisiran will be a great addition to that. What we've also seen is, although anecdotally, patients are excited about this, there is a group of patients that actually are going to be making an important decision. They're early in their disease progression. So, they're not -- they may not be willing to get and start with the infusion, and it's going to be a really great treatment option for those patients who would then be able to take advantage of our subcutaneous quarterly injection.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Tolga. Does that answer your question?\nDavidLebowitz: Thank you very much. And I guess just one more question. On the delay in the PDUFA date itself, can you just reiterate what information the FDA has asked for and versus what information you have elected to send them thus far. And you also spoke that there was no other areas of discussion, I expected that Type 1 change going forward?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Pushkal?\nPushkal Garg: Yes. So, I think -- look, in terms of -- I probably have to reiterate a little bit of what I said on the call already. This is really all a result of a third-party secondary packaging and labeling facility that had a routine CGMP or Current Good Manufacturing Practice inspection, just a routine inspection. It was not really vutrisiran. But this is a facility that we were going to -- we had proposed for to help with the launch of vutrisiran. But as a result of that, there was some inspection findings and the FDA has a timeline by which they have to reclassify that determine what action is necessary. That timeline was beyond the PDUFA date, the April 14 PDUFA date for vutrisiran. And so as a result, if it wasn't classified, we ran a risk of getting a complete response letter. And the timeline for resolution of that, as you know, can be somewhat uncertain. So based on that, we had discussions with the FDA and we elected to file an amendment to bring on board a secondary, a different facility. And we were able to do that quickly and file an amendment to the existing NDA. That resulted in this 3-month clock extension and the PDUFA date. But just to reiterate, there was no request for additional clinical data of any sort. There's no more safety or efficacy data that we're asked for. There's no new clinical trials, et cetera. This really just came about because of this inspection finding at this facility unrelated to vutrisiran and our decision to really find the most expedited path to get vutrisiran approved into patients. And we think this was the best path to do that. So that's what this is all about.\nYvonne Greenstreet: That was going to be absolutely ready to launch, assuming FDA approval by the July PDUFA date. Thank you, David. Next question.\nDavidLebowitz: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Maury Raycroft with Jefferies.\nMaury Raycroft: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question about APOLLO-B. So one difference between APOLLO-B versus BridgeBio's ATTRibute Phase 3 is inclusion of up to 30% stabilizer progressors. Can you elaborate on the criteria to classify patients as stabilizer progressors for the trial? Maybe talk about what gives you confidence the RNAi mechanism is going to work in these patients?\nPushkal Garg: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Maury for your question. Look, I think we've talked about this at some length over the last several months since the BridgeBio results. We remain quite confident about the design and the execution of the APOLLO-B study. For a variety of reasons, both the criteria we're using to include patients with the disease, the clinical criteria that were required to show that they have disease that's likely to progress during the course of the study and likely to benefit from therapy, the sizing and powering of the study, the methods that we put in place in terms of the oversight and execution of 6-minute walk test. To your specific question, Maury, about we do allow in APOLLO-B up to 30% of patients to have been previously on tafamidis. They -- assuming that they have been determined to progress based on the investigator's assessment. There's no formal criteria for that. That's really based on the investigator's assessment of the patient. And, I think, we powered very conservatively our study to allow for that. It's a global study. And so, there was -- we knew there was going to be some background to tafamidis use in the population. We certainly want to establish what the effect size of the drug is, both as a monotherapy and in combination, because we know that some of the reality of what's going to be happening in the marketplace. We took very conservative powering assumptions. And I'll remind you, we actually over enrolled by 20% in the study as well. So, I think we're very well-positioned for that. With regard to what gives us confidence, I think ultimately, what gives us confidence is really the fact that we're targeting an upstream mechanism. And in every data set that we've generated both APOLLO as well as with HELIOS-A as well as external datasets that have been generated to investigators studies, there's an accumulating amount of data that suggests that silencing may have an important effect on the cardiac aspects of this disease, whether it's measured by biomarkers, whether it's measured by echocardiographic parameters, or even outcomes. So, we look forward to the results in the middle of this year.\nMaury Raycroft: Great.\nYvonne Greenstreet: That's  summary.\nMaury Raycroft: Yes, thanks for taking my question.\nPushkal Garg: Does that help, Maury?\nMaury Raycroft: Yes. Yes, very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.\nSalveen Richter: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you help us understand what the impact of COVID in the Ukraine are on the KARDIA-1 study on the ladder? What proportion of the study is based in the Ukraine? And then just curious also on the lowered revenue guidance. Are you comfortable with the FX assumptions for the  here?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Great questions. Clearly the KARDIA studies are incredibly important to us. And we're focused on enrolling these as expeditiously as we can. Obviously, the Ukraine situation is devastating from a geopolitical and human perspective, but has had an impact on enrollment in KARDIA-1. But perhaps, Pushkal, you can address that, and also some of the approaches that we're taking to try and assure enrollment into the study.\nPushkal Garg: Sure. Thanks, Yvonne.\nYvonne Greenstreet: And we will go to Jeff for the revenue guidance question.\nPushkal Garg: Yes. And thanks, Salveen, for your question. So, look, we've got these two studies that we've kicked off, as we said, for zilebesiran, which is a very exciting program for us, that we think can actually transform the landscape for hypertension. KARDIA-1 is a monotherapy study started in the middle of last year. And then KARDIA-2 is a study looking at combination therapy that started towards the end of last year. As is pretty common in diseases like hypertension, other common diseases, we do have -- we did envision a geographic footprint for this study that was heavily reliant on Eastern European countries and for KARDIA-1, specifically Ukraine. That was the first study -- the first country that was up and running. And we were expecting -- there was a lot of investigator interest in this study in the Ukraine unfortunately, because of global events that's been severely impacted, so we -- while we were enrolling, we've actually had to stop -- curtail all our activities in the Ukraine, including interacting with investigators being able to  patients, et cetera, and have had to put those activities on hold. There was also a headwind with COVID with regard to the sort of a prevalent condition that we were also facing. So, what we've done is we've actually expanded the geographic footprint to this study, we're bringing additional countries online, additional sites online, as an important mitigation measure. And then the second thing is that we've had the opportunity to go back and look at our protocol, and look for areas where we can actually just facilitate enrollment by streamlining certain activities, reducing any burdens that may have been included in the protocol, as originally conceived and streamline that. And we think that's going to help as well. So that's what's led to that change. KARDIA-2 was not formally in the Ukraine, but it wasn't some -- it has been -- there are sites in Eastern European countries that may have some effect impact as well or feel some impact. And so, we're also really employing similar measures there broadening the footprint, and to have amended the protocol to sort of streamline some of the procedures in the study as well. So that's the story there.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, and just to remind everybody that we expect to complete enrollment of KARDIA-1 in early 2023 with the top line data expected mid-2023. And for KARDIA-2 complete enrollment at around year-end 2022. So, the data will be forthcoming. In due course, which will be looking forward to. So, Jeff, I think, a question for you in terms of how we thought about FX.\nJeff Poulton: Yes, let me give you a little bit -- little more detail, Salveen. So, we -- in our guidance slide, updated guidance slide, we did footnote at the bottom what the FX rates are that we've included in the updated guidance, which were as of April 18. And we also provided what we included in our original guidance on January 31. So, you can see the strengthening of the dollar there. Just to make sure it's clear, the exposure that we've got to ex U.S revenue. Based on our Q1 revenues, 49% of our revenues were in the U.S dollar in Q1, 38% were in Europe, so primarily in the Euro; and 13% were in ROW markets, primarily Japan. So those are -- the yen and the euro are our two biggest exposures. If you use the revised rates that we have compared to what we used in the original guidance, that's about a $20 million headwind relative to the original guidance that we gave. And the dollar is actually further strengthened since April 18. Now in terms of the sensitivity to that, just as a rough estimate, sort of from this point going forward each, 1% strengthening of the dollar against ex U.S currencies is about a $3 million headwind for us. So, the guidance range that we gave, hopefully would accommodate additional movements in FX, but we're not -- obviously we're not in the business of predicting which way the FX rates are going to move.\nSalveen Richter: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Matteis with Stifel.\nPaul Matteis: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. On vutrisiran, I just wanted to clarify two things. One, I don't know how much detail you go into. But given the proximity of this, this amendment to the PDUFA, how deep were you in labeling discussions? And I guess, how confident are you that all other aspects of the review were kind of largely resolved and more in the check-the-box phase? And then just second on vutrisiran, can you just clarify, is this going to be in 100% in office dose product? And are you comfortable that from a market opportunity perspective, there isn't some meaningful subpopulation of patients that really might prefer the independence of home dosing? Thanks so much.\nYvonne Greenstreet: So, I think first question, Pushkal, I think is for you. How confident are we in achieving approval by the new PDUFA date, given the proximity to putting in the amendment?\nPushkal Garg: Yes. Thanks for your question, Paul. I think -- look, I think what I will say is, again, this amendment was solely prompted by this inspection issue at the secondary packaging and labeling facility. We feel all other activities with regard to the review that the agency was conducting, we're on track and we felt good about it. I can't comment specifically about the label. But I think we feel everything else was really going well and on track. And this is really solely about this one issue that needed to be as I've discussed.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Pushkal. And Tolga, actually you could take the second question with respect to whether there's a market opportunity or subpopulation with respect to home dosing for people?\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. Yes. Hi, Paul. So, this study was obviously designed with physician administered routing. Therefore, we are eligible for Part B in the U.S. Through the Omicron and COVID, we actually were able to build a pretty substantial site of care and home injection capabilities. Therefore, we believe these capabilities will be nicely applied to a quarterly dosing and subsequently 6 monthly dosing. And given the severity of these patients, we still believe these patients are being monitored by the physician and quarterly or biannual checkups of these patients are actually very much parallel to the regimen that the doctors would like to see. So, in either way, we have the right capabilities that we'll be able to accommodate what the patient needs are.\nPaul Matteis: Okay. So, the whole dosing, just to clarify would be via a health care provider visiting the patient. Is that right?\nTolga Tanguler: That's exactly right. And right now, at the moment, we actually serve about 20% of our patients through home infusion.\nPaul Matteis: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. Good morning. Thanks very much. I guess just one quick follow-up. Can you -- there seems to be or I've gotten a lot of questions on the filing. Just to make sure, was this a voluntary action by you? Or was it suggested by the FDA? If you could just clarify that, I think that would help a lot of people. And then my sort of key question is just, can you talk a little bit about what you're doing in CNS more in depth? And in particular, sort of where you're starting in terms of dosing? How long you think it might take for before we see some clear knockdown and what you see are some maybe the key safety risks to watch out for? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, so maybe with the first question with respect to the filing. Yes, it was a voluntary action that we decided in close consultation with the FDA. So, I think that's another factor that gives us confidence in actually achieving an approval by the PDUFA date. Maybe Pushkal, you could take the question on the CNS opportunity where we are with ALN-APP.\nPushkal Garg: Absolutely. So, as we announced today, we're very excited that we kicked off this program, we found the CTA at the end of last year with ALN-APP, which is our first CNS directed RNAi therapeutics. And we kicked off the initial study in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease, we're going directly into patients with this therapeutic, first with some single doses and ultimately with some multiple doses in the context of the study. And it is a very interesting upstream target that we think has applications for broadly Alzheimer's disease as well as for other indications, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which is a devastating disease that results in cerebral hemorrhage. So, both of those are part of the development plan. The initial study, as I said goes into EOAD patients as a population that we think has a tremendous unmet need, lacks a lot of other confounding comorbidities that centers should allow for a clean background for us to assess the safety and tolerability and knockdown of this of CNS therapeutics. So we'll be looking closely in the single ascending dose cohorts for safety and tolerability. And then important biomarkers that we'll be looking at particularly soluble APP alpha and beta in the CSF, that's going to help us understand knockdown. There are also imaging modalities that are incorporated into study other biomarkers that we'll be looking at in the context of study to follow patients and look at clinical pharmacologic activity. But the main thing we'll be looking at will be soluble APP alpha and beta in the CSF. In terms of the exact timeframe that we're actively conducting the study at multiple sites. And as we've said, assuming enrollment goes as predicted, we expect to be able to report out some proof-of-concept data at the end of the year.\nYvonne Greenstreet: And just to add, one of the reasons why we're so excited about this program is obviously there's huge unmet medical needs in patients with Alzheimer's as well as cerebral amyloid angiopathy. But if we're successful with these indications that  are not the opportunity to be able to bring the power of RNAi platform to many, many other CNS diseases where it's the huge medical needs. So, we're very focused on ensuring progress with this program and hope to delivering data .\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ritu Baral with Cowen.\nRitu Baral: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up to Paul's question. Can you comment on whether you guys have started labeling discussions before the vutrisiran PDUFA delay? And also, has there been any indication that the new Fill & Finish plant requires an inspection at this point after I guess, the FDA has had a chance to review the additional CMC package submitted?\nYvonne Greenstreet: So, I think there's a few questions for you, Pushkal,  discussions and indications around the potential for an inspection.\nPushkal Garg: Yes. So, Ritu, it\u2019s Pushkal. I think -- yes, I mean, what I can say is that we've had a late cycle meeting. We -- labeled discussions, et cetera, is an ongoing process. And that happens in parallel with the regulatory review of the application. So all those activities were underway. And as I said, this was really all about this unrelated inspection that happened at this packaging and labeling facility. And I actually -- I think we -- what I would say is that it's a complement to our teams in the discussions that we were actually able to -- with agility put in an amendment quickly for the second facility, and actually mitigate this risk quite substantially. So, I think that's a testament. To your second question, which is somewhat related to that. The facility that we've amended to is one that we actually have experience with. It's a facility that we already use for ONPATTRO. We use it for GIVLAARI, we were actually planning to be using it for OXLUMO. And it's been in fact inspected by FDA and EMA in 2020 and 2021. So, we have a lot of reasons to have confidence in sort of regulatory standing of that particular facility. It's always up to the FDA with an amendment to make their own determination as to whether inspection is necessary and obviously, we defer to their judgment. But what we do feel is quite confident in the facility that we\u2019ve supplemented or amended to in our application, and the quality of what's done in that facility. So hopefully that answers your question.\nRitu Baral: Got it. And if I can squeak in one very quick follow-up. Jeff and Tolga, you mentioned January, February compliance had headwind -- COVID headwinds. It's not something that you guys have previously talked about, despite sort of definitely worse points in the pandemic? Was there something unique to the January, February Omicron wave that hit ONPATTRO versus the prior years?\nYvonne Greenstreet: I think, Tolga, that's a question for you. I mean, some more color because it impacts specifically with  ONPATTRO.\nPushkal Garg: Absolutely. I mean, look, each variant humbles us. We always learn new things about how the health system impacts. We have actually anticipated and I think shared some of our insights early on, particularly with the AHP patient when it comes to GIVLAARI. With ONPATTRO, given the elderly patient population and given the health care system, the health care system reacted across the world. We certainly had seen that. Some skip dosing, but it has nicely recovered in March. So, we're rather comfortable where the direction is going.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, that's great, Tolga. So, I mean, we're optimistic with you going forward. But as Tolga said, I think this virus has shown the potential for surprises on multiple occasions .\nRitu Baral: Understood, Yvonne.\nYvonne Greenstreet: .\nRitu Baral: Thank you.\nChristine Lindenboom.: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tazeen Ahmad with Bank of America.\nTazeen Ahmad: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just another point of clarification on your revised guidance. So, it does include vutri as it gets approved. But how are you thinking about the early days of the launch for vutri and PN? And specifically, its interaction with ONPATTRO, do you expect cannibalization to be part of the early launch metrics there? Or are you assuming a different patient population will start on vutri versus  on ONPATTRO? I think if you could give some color on that, that's great. And then secondly,  have some data too soon as well for ACTR. And just wondering how you think that could potentially change the competitive dynamic in the marketplace with another entrant? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Tolga, I think you can answer the first question around the interplay with respect to vutri and ONPATTRO, how are we thinking about the early days of the launch?\nTolga Tanguler: Right. So, Tazeen, I think, if you -- we should kind of maybe take a quick step back and look at the numbers that we're discussing here. I think, from -- both from vutri opportunity as well as any new competitive entrant dynamic, we're still looking at 20,000 to 30,000 patients PN and mix identified patients. And being the market leader, we're now -- as we announced this quarter, we moved from 1,525, in Q1 '21 to 2,200 patients in this past quarter. So we're adding a steady increase of patients for the treatment of this devastating condition. And vutri will certainly help us, I believe, to bring in some net naive patients, especially those patients that are diagnosed early in their treatment. We start seeing that dynamic already with ONPATTRO. We also certainly anticipate an acceleration of switches from the existing therapies that they may have been progressing or may not have found the best treatment regimen, which will certainly provide that opportunity. And we do anticipate number of ONPATTRO patients that might be interested in this new treatment regimen they may prefer it. We're not guiding right now about the net and switch numbers, but we do overall anticipate growth to accelerate.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, that's a great answer, Tolga. And maybe just to add that we really are still in the early stages of building the TTR franchise. We're currently addressing the needs of 2,200 patients with ONPATTRO. But there are another 30,000 or 40,000 patients there who are addressable by ONPATTRO. So, there's still lots of growth to come here. The second question, Tolga, I think is also for you. How are you thinking about new entrants into the market, particularly for ?\nTolga Tanguler: Yes, I mean, specifically with the PN category, we see an accelerated growth also in diagnosis. And I think, more share of voice, increased share of voice, I think, is going to certainly help that pattern. If you think of vutri profile of subcutaneous injection every quarter is certainly we believe is it will remain an attractive and will continue to help us be the market leader. But I think again, we shouldn't think of this category as a zero-sum game. Believe more entrants like in the MS category will probably help further the expansion of the category and given what Yvonne indicated that there are still a lot of undiagnosed or untreated patients.\nTazeen Ahmad: Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays.\nGena Wang: Thank you for taking my questions. I have two clarification questions. And one hypothetical question. So, for APOLLO-B, do you see data on the blinded base? And then for overlapping sites, do you use the same CRO versus BridgeBio's ATTRibute study? And for hypothetic questions, just say in the unfortunate event, APOLLO-B missed 6-minute walk test endpoint, what kind of a secondary endpoint data that will convince you HELIOS-B outcome data will be positive?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Pushkal, I think, three questions for you there.\nPushkal Garg: Yes, absolutely. Hi, Gena. So, look on a couple of these blinded data, so as every sponsor does running a blinded clinical trial, we have folks in our clinical team, data management, et cetera, who are responsible for looking at blinded data over the course of study. That's really to ensure that the study is being conducted properly to make sure the proper patients are being enrolled and they meet enrollment criteria to look at outlying data points. Someone has a 2-meter walk at six -- in 6-minutes or 2,000 meters to query the site and see if there was a data entry error, for instance, to see if there's patterns where sites are not conducting following procedures properly. So that's all part of what's happening. So, there are people who are looking at wanting to data over the course of study. It is all blinded. And so that's just part of the norms of the how a study is done and conducted to ensure that when we finally lock the database, that we have a clean data set that allows for interpretable data. And so those activities are underway, as it's done in every clinical trial that's done by every sponsor. In terms of overlapping sites, we don't actually have the exact count, but we probably estimate the 20% to 25% of sites may be overlapping. I'd remind you that doesn't: a, reflect necessarily the number of patients that are overlapping between the two different studies. And three, where we do our study, it's all under the context of our protocol with the CROs that we work with. And our protocol has clear trial procedures, training procedures, oversight, et cetera, that is all specific to APOLLO-B. I can't comment on the CROs that BridgeBio used. I actually don't know. And then I think your third question was, what you called hypothetical, what I will say is, we'll be looking at the totality of data coming out of this study. As you know, the primary endpoint is around a 6-minute walk test. But we'll be looking at KCCQ, which is an important secondary endpoint, we'll be looking at BNP, we'll be looking at echocardiographic parameters. And importantly, we'll be looking, although it's a short study of 12 months, we will be looking at event rates with regard to mortality, and importantly, hospitalization and be looking at the totality of those data to understand what we're seeing in terms of the impact of silencing in this patient population. And that will help us: a, interpret the data within APOLLO-B, but also help us think about the impact in this disease overall, as it relates to HELIOS-B. So hopefully, that answers your questions.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Pushkal. Gena, does that answer your question?\nGena Wang: Yes. Like -- regarding the secondary endpoint, TCCQBnT event rates, any particular separation you will be looking for that you think you'll be confident that HELIOS-B will be positive?\nPushkal Garg: Gena, it's really -- it's impossible to answer that question. I think we'll be looking at the totality of the data to really make that assessment. So, there's no single data point that we're looking at. There's no single number that we'll be looking at.\nGena Wang: Okay. I think we've got time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Anupam Rama with JPMorgan.\nAnupam Rama: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe I had a follow-up on Gena's question. But I just wanted to confirm that you'll have some of that mortality, CV hospitalizations in the top line results versus waiting for a full presentation at a medical conference or something like that. And specifically, what your expectations on those two metrics would be at a 12-month look? Thanks so much.\nPushkal Garg: Yes. So, Anupam, we -- those are pre-specified secondary endpoints. It's been our practice to when we report top line results to speak to P values with regard to primary and secondary endpoints. You can expect that we provided in the top line, but additional color and detail, of course, will come at a medical conference subsequently. And I'm sorry, I think I missed the second part of your question.\nAnupam Rama: Like, what would be your expectations at a 12-month look on CV hospitalizations and mortality?\nPushkal Garg: Oh, yes. So, what I would say is, the study was not powered for those endpoints at all. So, they are being captured, but they're not powered endpoints and that we -- as you can imagine, 12 months is a relatively short time to necessarily see effects on those. I will remind you that to tafamidis, it took 9 months to start to see a hospitalization separation and roughly 12 to 18 months to see a mortality separation. That said, our post-hoc data from APOLLO showed potentially ha much earlier separation on those events, some of the data that have been published in circulation a few years ago. So, there's some potential and we've seen on other parameters, effects of silencing potentially on echocardiographic parameters, technetium at  earlier time point. So, I think you're looking forward to seeing the results and seeing what that looks like. So, there's -- and that's why we've captured these as important secondary endpoints to look at.\nYvonne Greenstreet: We are indeed. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on this call. 2022 is off to a steady start as we continue to advance our  system. We did with all the exciting pipeline programs that we have in development. There are lot of exciting and important upcoming milestones over the course of the year and we look forward to updating you on these. So, thank you to everybody for joining our call today and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Yvonne, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter reflected steady progress, as we increase the number of commercial patients on therapy across our three products by 9%. In spite of this increase, Q1 reported revenues decreased by 6%, compared with Q4 2021, as Q4 benefited from a variety of non-recurring stocking and gross net benefits. Additionally, we did experience some headwinds from COVID in the early part of Q1, particularly in the U.S., where we saw a decrease in patient compliance across our portfolio in January and February, when Omicron cases were at their peak. We are encouraged by improved market conditions that developed in March that have extended further into April. And we're cautiously optimistic that COVID will have minimal impact on our commercial operations for the balance of the year, recognizing that the course of the pandemic remains uncertain. I will now provide details on the performance of each of our products. For ONPATTRO, we achieved $137 million in global net product revenues in the first quarter, representing a 1% decrease compared with the fourth quarter and 34% growth compared with Q1 2021. At the end of Q1, over 2,200 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO treatment worldwide, up from over 2,050 patients at year-end 2021, representing steady 7% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S., sales of ONPATTRO increased 4% versus Q4 2021 and were primarily impacted by the following. A 7% increase in demand driven by an increase in patients on therapy, which was negatively impacted by a decrease in patient compliance, primarily in January and February when Omicron cases were at their peak. Inventory stocking dynamics, which contributed to a 6% decrease in reported growth and a modest decrease in gross to net deductions in the quarter, contributing to a 3% increase in reported growth. In our international markets, ONPATTRO Q1 product sales declined 5% versus Q4, despite an increase in patients on therapy due to an increase in gross net deductions following Q4, which included several non-recurring benefits, along with an unfavorable foreign exchange impact due to strengthening U.S dollar in Q1, which impacted results across all three commercial products. Moving to GIVLAARI, we achieved $35 million in global net product revenues in the first quarter, representing a 13% decrease compared with Q4 2021 and 43% growth versus Q1 2021. At the end of Q1, over 400 patients were on commercial GIVLAARI treatment worldwide, up from over 250 at year-end '21 representing robust 14% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S., sales of GIVLAARI decreased 22% versus Q4 '21, and were primarily impacted by the following. Flat patient demand, despite a 5% increase in patients on therapy due to reduced patient compliance, which was negatively impacted by COVID in January and February; inventory stocking dynamics, which negatively impacted reported growth by 15%; and an increase in gross to net deductions in the quarter, which negatively impacted reported growth by 7% following the fourth quarter, which included several non-recurring gross to net benefits. In our international markets, GIVLAARI delivered 11% growth in Q1 compared with Q4 '21, with the growth primarily driven by new patient adds across key markets and geographic expansion, including an initial contribution from the U.K., following Q1 commercial launch. Moving now to OXLUMO, we achieved $50 million in global net product revenues in the first quarter, representing a 24% decrease compared with Q4 '21and 59% growth versus Q1 2021. At the end of Q1, over 160 patients were on commercial OXLUMO treatment worldwide, up from over 140 at year-end '21, representing 14% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S., sales of OXLUMO decreased by 5% versus Q4 2021 and were primarily impacted by the following. A 6% increase in patient demand, driven by an increase in patients on therapy, and an increase in gross to net deductions in the quarter, which more than offset the demand growth and negatively impacted reported growth by 11%. OXLUMO sales decreased in our international markets by 32% during the first quarter compared with Q4, despite an increase in patients on therapy during the quarter, primarily due to an increase in gross to net deductions following Q4, which included several non-recurring benefits, as well as the timing of order in partner in emerging markets. In conclusion, as expected, despite the reduction in reported revenue growth during the quarter, and challenges from COVID in the early part of the quarter, we remain encouraged by the steady growth in patients, we achieved across three products, particularly our performance with ONPATTRO during the quarter. Additionally, even though we were disappointed by the 3-month PDUFA delay for vutrisiran in the U.S., we are poised to launch the product upon potential FDA approval by the new July 14 PDUFA date, and we remain confident that this will continue to represent an attractive option for TTR polyneuropathy patients and an incremental growth opportunity for our TTR franchise. With that, I will now turn it over to Pushkal, to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal? Yes. Hi, good morning. Look, at the end of the day, this is a multisystem disease and we do know that both neurologists and cardiologists play a very important role in the treatment. We have not really seen any change in the way the product is prescribed across the globe. We certainly had seen some, as we indicated on the call, some softness in January and February, particularly in the adherence compliance rate. But we are very encouraged by what we've seen in March. And the Omicron impact obviously is dissipating as we also seen in April. Yes, I mean, look, we're really excited about vutri. It clearly provides another growth opportunity for the TTR franchise. We built what we'd like to think a good strong growth engine within the TTR franchise across our key markets. And vutrisiran will be a great addition to that. What we've also seen is, although anecdotally, patients are excited about this, there is a group of patients that actually are going to be making an important decision. They're early in their disease progression. So, they're not -- they may not be willing to get and start with the infusion, and it's going to be a really great treatment option for those patients who would then be able to take advantage of our subcutaneous quarterly injection. Yes. Yes. Hi, Paul. So, this study was obviously designed with physician administered routing. Therefore, we are eligible for Part B in the U.S. Through the Omicron and COVID, we actually were able to build a pretty substantial site of care and home injection capabilities. Therefore, we believe these capabilities will be nicely applied to a quarterly dosing and subsequently 6 monthly dosing. And given the severity of these patients, we still believe these patients are being monitored by the physician and quarterly or biannual checkups of these patients are actually very much parallel to the regimen that the doctors would like to see. So, in either way, we have the right capabilities that we'll be able to accommodate what the patient needs are. That's exactly right. And right now, at the moment, we actually serve about 20% of our patients through home infusion. Right. So, Tazeen, I think, if you -- we should kind of maybe take a quick step back and look at the numbers that we're discussing here. I think, from -- both from vutri opportunity as well as any new competitive entrant dynamic, we're still looking at 20,000 to 30,000 patients PN and mix identified patients. And being the market leader, we're now -- as we announced this quarter, we moved from 1,525, in Q1 '21 to 2,200 patients in this past quarter. So we're adding a steady increase of patients for the treatment of this devastating condition. And vutri will certainly help us, I believe, to bring in some net naive patients, especially those patients that are diagnosed early in their treatment. We start seeing that dynamic already with ONPATTRO. We also certainly anticipate an acceleration of switches from the existing therapies that they may have been progressing or may not have found the best treatment regimen, which will certainly provide that opportunity. And we do anticipate number of ONPATTRO patients that might be interested in this new treatment regimen they may prefer it. We're not guiding right now about the net and switch numbers, but we do overall anticipate growth to accelerate. Yes, I mean, specifically with the PN category, we see an accelerated growth also in diagnosis. And I think, more share of voice, increased share of voice, I think, is going to certainly help that pattern. If you think of vutri profile of subcutaneous injection every quarter is certainly we believe is it will remain an attractive and will continue to help us be the market leader. But I think again, we shouldn't think of this category as a zero-sum game. Believe more entrants like in the MS category will probably help further the expansion of the category and given what Yvonne indicated that there are still a lot of undiagnosed or untreated patients."

            "name": "Pushkal Garg",
            "content": "Thanks, Tolga, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by updating you on our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis, where we are advancing two product candidates, patisiran and vutrisiran across a number of clinical indications. While patisiran or ONPATTRO is currently approved in multiple markets around the world to the polyneuropathy associated with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. We are committed to expanding the products labeled to the treatment of cardiomyopathy, in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. To this end, we're conducting the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study, and we remain on track to report top line results in the middle of this year. We're also advancing vutrisiran, which is delivered by a quarterly subcutaneous injection, and it's also in development for ATTR amyloidosis, as well as Stargardt disease. In ATTR amyloidosis, we're conducting two Phase 3 studies. The first is HELIOS-A, which is evaluating vutrisiran and hereditary ATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. In April 2021, we presented positive results from the study at the AAN meeting, which shows the study met its primary and secondary endpoints at 9 months. Those data form the basis for our regulatory submissions to both the FDA and EMA, which are currently under review. As we announced a few weeks ago, the FDA has extended the review timeline of the NDA to allow for the review of newly added information related to a new secondary packaging and labeling facility. Specifically, we submitted an amendment to our NDA, upon learning that the original third-party secondary packaging and labeling facility we plan to use for the vutrisiran launch was recently inspected as part of a routine cGMP inspection. This inspection was unrelated to the vutrisiran application, but as its outcome was unknown, it nevertheless could have resulted in vutrisiran receiving a complete response letter with uncertainty regarding the timeframe for resolution. While our amendment resulted in a 3-month extension, we believe that this approach offers the fastest path to a potential approval. The updated PDUFA goal date to allow for this review is July 14, 2022. I'd like to reiterate that the inspection issues raised at the original facility were not specifically related to vutrisiran, there have been no questions with regard to the safety or efficacy of the product, and there have been no additional clinical data or trials requested. In addition to these 9-month results, we all presented positive data from the 18-month analysis of the study in January of this year at the SFNP meeting in France. We're delighted that HELIOS-A met all secondary endpoints measured at 18 months including statistically significant improvements in neuropathy, as measured by the modified neuropathy impairment score or mNIS+7, quality of life, gait speed, nutritional status, and overall disability relative to external placebo data from the APOLLO Phase 3 study. Furthermore, at 18 months, vutrisiran also demonstrated improvement compared to external placebo, and the exploratory cardiac endpoint NT-proBNP and trend towards improvement in echocardiographic parameters as well as improvement compared to baseline in cardiac uptake of technetium on scintigraphy imaging. We believe that taken together these data, along with the exploratory cardiac data from the original APOLLO study, provide evidence to suggest that TTR silencing by patisiran and vutrisiran treatment may potentially improve the cardiac manifestations of this disease. Patisiran also demonstrate encouraging safety and tolerability profile, as shown by the data on this slide.  We're very pleased with the totality of these results and the profile of vutrisiran that continues to evolve. We believe that based on these data, vutrisiran, if approved, will present an exciting commercial opportunity, providing an attractive treatment option for patients with ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. In addition, I'll also remind you that we are seeking to further reduce the burden of treatment for patients by evaluating in every 6-month regimen of vutrisiran and the extension period of HELIOS-A, with data expected later this year. Of course, this is just the start for vutrisiran, as we're also conducting another Phase 3 study, HELIOS-B, which is our ongoing Phase 3 cardiac outcome study with vutrisiran in hereditary and wild-type amyloidosis patients with cardiomyopathy. HELIOS-B, which is fully enrolled as a 30-month endpoint of all-cause mortality and CV events, and we expect the full results in early 2024. The study design includes the potential for an interim analysis, and we will consider this after reviewing the results from the APOLLO-B and engaging with regulatory authorities. In addition to our late-stage clinical programs, we believe we've also been making great progress with our early and mid-stage programs. As we've highlighted for some time, a key growth driver from Alnylam is our expansion beyond rare diseases into prevalent conditions. A great example is our program in hypertension. Zilebesiran is our investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting angiotensinogen or AGT, which is in development for the treatment of hypertension. Zilebesiran is being evaluated in the Phase 2 KARDIA program. The first of these two studies KARDIA-1 is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran as a monotherapy in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. The second of these studies KARDIA-2 was initiated late last year and is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zilebesiran as an add on therapy in patients with hypertension despite treatment with standard of care agents. We've announced this morning that we are experiencing enrollment delays in KARDIA-1 in part due to impacts of the situation in Ukraine, as well as the ongoing pandemic. We're expanding the geographic footprint of the study, and are also streamlining certain aspects of the protocol to facilitate enrollment. As a result, we now expect to complete enrollment in KARDIA-1 in early 2023 with top line results expected in mid-2023. We are implementing similar measures in KARDIA-2 as well, so as to complete enrollment at/or around year-end. Another key growth driver for Alnylam in the years to come will be our organic product engine driving sustainable innovation, with the goal of bringing two to four new molecules into the clinic each year. Here we achieved some notable progress in the first quarter. We announced this morning that the Phase 1 study of ALN-XDH in patients with gout has been initiated. This is an exciting program based on our work with the U.K Biobank, where we found that heterozygous loss of function of XDH was associated with significantly reduced serum urate and a lower risk of gout. We expect top line results in late 2022. We also achieved a major milestone with the initiation of our Phase 1 study of ALN-APP, our first RNAi therapeutic targeting a CNS disorder. ALN-APP is an innovative program with the potential to address both Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Initiating this program is a key step towards expanding our pipeline into extrahepatic tissues and we look forward to top line results in late 2022 here as well. These are just a few highlights among the many exciting programs we're advancing to address important unmet needs for patients. And we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff? Yes. So, I think -- look, in terms of -- I probably have to reiterate a little bit of what I said on the call already. This is really all a result of a third-party secondary packaging and labeling facility that had a routine CGMP or Current Good Manufacturing Practice inspection, just a routine inspection. It was not really vutrisiran. But this is a facility that we were going to -- we had proposed for to help with the launch of vutrisiran. But as a result of that, there was some inspection findings and the FDA has a timeline by which they have to reclassify that determine what action is necessary. That timeline was beyond the PDUFA date, the April 14 PDUFA date for vutrisiran. And so as a result, if it wasn't classified, we ran a risk of getting a complete response letter. And the timeline for resolution of that, as you know, can be somewhat uncertain. So based on that, we had discussions with the FDA and we elected to file an amendment to bring on board a secondary, a different facility. And we were able to do that quickly and file an amendment to the existing NDA. That resulted in this 3-month clock extension and the PDUFA date. But just to reiterate, there was no request for additional clinical data of any sort. There's no more safety or efficacy data that we're asked for. There's no new clinical trials, et cetera. This really just came about because of this inspection finding at this facility unrelated to vutrisiran and our decision to really find the most expedited path to get vutrisiran approved into patients. And we think this was the best path to do that. So that's what this is all about. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Maury for your question. Look, I think we've talked about this at some length over the last several months since the BridgeBio results. We remain quite confident about the design and the execution of the APOLLO-B study. For a variety of reasons, both the criteria we're using to include patients with the disease, the clinical criteria that were required to show that they have disease that's likely to progress during the course of the study and likely to benefit from therapy, the sizing and powering of the study, the methods that we put in place in terms of the oversight and execution of 6-minute walk test. To your specific question, Maury, about we do allow in APOLLO-B up to 30% of patients to have been previously on tafamidis. They -- assuming that they have been determined to progress based on the investigator's assessment. There's no formal criteria for that. That's really based on the investigator's assessment of the patient. And, I think, we powered very conservatively our study to allow for that. It's a global study. And so, there was -- we knew there was going to be some background to tafamidis use in the population. We certainly want to establish what the effect size of the drug is, both as a monotherapy and in combination, because we know that some of the reality of what's going to be happening in the marketplace. We took very conservative powering assumptions. And I'll remind you, we actually over enrolled by 20% in the study as well. So, I think we're very well-positioned for that. With regard to what gives us confidence, I think ultimately, what gives us confidence is really the fact that we're targeting an upstream mechanism. And in every data set that we've generated both APOLLO as well as with HELIOS-A as well as external datasets that have been generated to investigators studies, there's an accumulating amount of data that suggests that silencing may have an important effect on the cardiac aspects of this disease, whether it's measured by biomarkers, whether it's measured by echocardiographic parameters, or even outcomes. So, we look forward to the results in the middle of this year. Does that help, Maury? Sure. Thanks, Yvonne. Yes. And thanks, Salveen, for your question. So, look, we've got these two studies that we've kicked off, as we said, for zilebesiran, which is a very exciting program for us, that we think can actually transform the landscape for hypertension. KARDIA-1 is a monotherapy study started in the middle of last year. And then KARDIA-2 is a study looking at combination therapy that started towards the end of last year. As is pretty common in diseases like hypertension, other common diseases, we do have -- we did envision a geographic footprint for this study that was heavily reliant on Eastern European countries and for KARDIA-1, specifically Ukraine. That was the first study -- the first country that was up and running. And we were expecting -- there was a lot of investigator interest in this study in the Ukraine unfortunately, because of global events that's been severely impacted, so we -- while we were enrolling, we've actually had to stop -- curtail all our activities in the Ukraine, including interacting with investigators being able to  patients, et cetera, and have had to put those activities on hold. There was also a headwind with COVID with regard to the sort of a prevalent condition that we were also facing. So, what we've done is we've actually expanded the geographic footprint to this study, we're bringing additional countries online, additional sites online, as an important mitigation measure. And then the second thing is that we've had the opportunity to go back and look at our protocol, and look for areas where we can actually just facilitate enrollment by streamlining certain activities, reducing any burdens that may have been included in the protocol, as originally conceived and streamline that. And we think that's going to help as well. So that's what's led to that change. KARDIA-2 was not formally in the Ukraine, but it wasn't some -- it has been -- there are sites in Eastern European countries that may have some effect impact as well or feel some impact. And so, we're also really employing similar measures there broadening the footprint, and to have amended the protocol to sort of streamline some of the procedures in the study as well. So that's the story there. Yes. Thanks for your question, Paul. I think -- look, I think what I will say is, again, this amendment was solely prompted by this inspection issue at the secondary packaging and labeling facility. We feel all other activities with regard to the review that the agency was conducting, we're on track and we felt good about it. I can't comment specifically about the label. But I think we feel everything else was really going well and on track. And this is really solely about this one issue that needed to be as I've discussed. Absolutely. So, as we announced today, we're very excited that we kicked off this program, we found the CTA at the end of last year with ALN-APP, which is our first CNS directed RNAi therapeutics. And we kicked off the initial study in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease, we're going directly into patients with this therapeutic, first with some single doses and ultimately with some multiple doses in the context of the study. And it is a very interesting upstream target that we think has applications for broadly Alzheimer's disease as well as for other indications, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which is a devastating disease that results in cerebral hemorrhage. So, both of those are part of the development plan. The initial study, as I said goes into EOAD patients as a population that we think has a tremendous unmet need, lacks a lot of other confounding comorbidities that centers should allow for a clean background for us to assess the safety and tolerability and knockdown of this of CNS therapeutics. So we'll be looking closely in the single ascending dose cohorts for safety and tolerability. And then important biomarkers that we'll be looking at particularly soluble APP alpha and beta in the CSF, that's going to help us understand knockdown. There are also imaging modalities that are incorporated into study other biomarkers that we'll be looking at in the context of study to follow patients and look at clinical pharmacologic activity. But the main thing we'll be looking at will be soluble APP alpha and beta in the CSF. In terms of the exact timeframe that we're actively conducting the study at multiple sites. And as we've said, assuming enrollment goes as predicted, we expect to be able to report out some proof-of-concept data at the end of the year. Yes. So, Ritu, it\u2019s Pushkal. I think -- yes, I mean, what I can say is that we've had a late cycle meeting. We -- labeled discussions, et cetera, is an ongoing process. And that happens in parallel with the regulatory review of the application. So all those activities were underway. And as I said, this was really all about this unrelated inspection that happened at this packaging and labeling facility. And I actually -- I think we -- what I would say is that it's a complement to our teams in the discussions that we were actually able to -- with agility put in an amendment quickly for the second facility, and actually mitigate this risk quite substantially. So, I think that's a testament. To your second question, which is somewhat related to that. The facility that we've amended to is one that we actually have experience with. It's a facility that we already use for ONPATTRO. We use it for GIVLAARI, we were actually planning to be using it for OXLUMO. And it's been in fact inspected by FDA and EMA in 2020 and 2021. So, we have a lot of reasons to have confidence in sort of regulatory standing of that particular facility. It's always up to the FDA with an amendment to make their own determination as to whether inspection is necessary and obviously, we defer to their judgment. But what we do feel is quite confident in the facility that we\u2019ve supplemented or amended to in our application, and the quality of what's done in that facility. So hopefully that answers your question. Absolutely. I mean, look, each variant humbles us. We always learn new things about how the health system impacts. We have actually anticipated and I think shared some of our insights early on, particularly with the AHP patient when it comes to GIVLAARI. With ONPATTRO, given the elderly patient population and given the health care system, the health care system reacted across the world. We certainly had seen that. Some skip dosing, but it has nicely recovered in March. So, we're rather comfortable where the direction is going. Yes, absolutely. Hi, Gena. So, look on a couple of these blinded data, so as every sponsor does running a blinded clinical trial, we have folks in our clinical team, data management, et cetera, who are responsible for looking at blinded data over the course of study. That's really to ensure that the study is being conducted properly to make sure the proper patients are being enrolled and they meet enrollment criteria to look at outlying data points. Someone has a 2-meter walk at six -- in 6-minutes or 2,000 meters to query the site and see if there was a data entry error, for instance, to see if there's patterns where sites are not conducting following procedures properly. So that's all part of what's happening. So, there are people who are looking at wanting to data over the course of study. It is all blinded. And so that's just part of the norms of the how a study is done and conducted to ensure that when we finally lock the database, that we have a clean data set that allows for interpretable data. And so those activities are underway, as it's done in every clinical trial that's done by every sponsor. In terms of overlapping sites, we don't actually have the exact count, but we probably estimate the 20% to 25% of sites may be overlapping. I'd remind you that doesn't: a, reflect necessarily the number of patients that are overlapping between the two different studies. And three, where we do our study, it's all under the context of our protocol with the CROs that we work with. And our protocol has clear trial procedures, training procedures, oversight, et cetera, that is all specific to APOLLO-B. I can't comment on the CROs that BridgeBio used. I actually don't know. And then I think your third question was, what you called hypothetical, what I will say is, we'll be looking at the totality of data coming out of this study. As you know, the primary endpoint is around a 6-minute walk test. But we'll be looking at KCCQ, which is an important secondary endpoint, we'll be looking at BNP, we'll be looking at echocardiographic parameters. And importantly, we'll be looking, although it's a short study of 12 months, we will be looking at event rates with regard to mortality, and importantly, hospitalization and be looking at the totality of those data to understand what we're seeing in terms of the impact of silencing in this patient population. And that will help us: a, interpret the data within APOLLO-B, but also help us think about the impact in this disease overall, as it relates to HELIOS-B. So hopefully, that answers your questions. Gena, it's really -- it's impossible to answer that question. I think we'll be looking at the totality of the data to really make that assessment. So, there's no single data point that we're looking at. There's no single number that we'll be looking at. Yes. So, Anupam, we -- those are pre-specified secondary endpoints. It's been our practice to when we report top line results to speak to P values with regard to primary and secondary endpoints. You can expect that we provided in the top line, but additional color and detail, of course, will come at a medical conference subsequently. And I'm sorry, I think I missed the second part of your question. Oh, yes. So, what I would say is, the study was not powered for those endpoints at all. So, they are being captured, but they're not powered endpoints and that we -- as you can imagine, 12 months is a relatively short time to necessarily see effects on those. I will remind you that to tafamidis, it took 9 months to start to see a hospitalization separation and roughly 12 to 18 months to see a mortality separation. That said, our post-hoc data from APOLLO showed potentially ha much earlier separation on those events, some of the data that have been published in circulation a few years ago. So, there's some potential and we've seen on other parameters, effects of silencing potentially on echocardiographic parameters, technetium at  earlier time point. So, I think you're looking forward to seeing the results and seeing what that looks like. So, there's -- and that's why we've captured these as important secondary endpoints to look at."

            "name": "Jeff Poulton",
            "content": "Thanks, Pushkal, good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting on Alnylam's Q1 2022 financial results, and I will also provide an update on our 2022 financial guidance. Turning now to a summary of our full P&L results for Q1 2022. Total product revenues for the quarter were $187 million or 38% growth versus Q1 2021 with all three marketed products contributing more than 30% year-over-year growth. It is also worth highlighting that year-over-year growth in combined product revenue was held back by approximately 5% due to the foreign exchange impact of a strengthening U.S dollar and given that approximately 50% of our product revenues are generated via sales in international markets. Net revenue from collaborations for the first quarter was approximately $26 million, representing a 38% decrease compared with Q1 2021, primarily due to reduction in revenue from our Regeneron collaboration, which is subject to quarter-to-quarter variability dependent on a variety of factors including the level of work completed during the quarter, which is reimbursed by Regeneron. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses decreased 2% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to modestly reduced clinical trial expenses across the portfolio. However, we do expect an increase in year-over-year R&D expenses for the balance of the year, primarily driven by an increase in spend associated with our plans to increase enrollment and our zilebesiran KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2 Phase 2 studies. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 18% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to increased legal expenses, charitable contributions, and other expenses to support our strategic growth. Our combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses were approximately $295 million in Q1 2022, representing 6% growth versus Q1 2021 as we continue to advance our pipeline and deliver strong top line growth, while maintaining discipline in how we invest in our operations. Our non-GAAP operating loss for Q1 2022 was $117 million representing a $13 million improvement compared with Q1 2021 as we continue to progress on our journey towards building a self-sustainable financial profile, aligned with our P5x25 goals. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.2 billion, compared to $2.4 billion at the end of 2021. Now turning to our financial guidance. Despite steady progress and adding patients across our three commercial brands in Q1, we have decided to reduce our combined product revenue guidance for two primary reasons. First, as we announced earlier this month, our FDA PDUFA date for vutrisiran has been delayed by 3 months. And secondly, a strengthening U.S dollar has created a foreign exchange headwind for our international operations, which today comprise approximately 50% of our global sales. As a result, we have reduced our full year combined product revenue guidance from an original range of $900 million to $1 billion to a revised range of $870 million to $930 million, representing a 5% reduction at the midpoint of the ranges. This updated guidance assumes approval of vutrisiran in the U.S by the revised PDUFA date of July 14, as well as foreign exchange rates as of April 18, that are footnoted at the bottom of our guidance slide. Additionally, we've also reduced or non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expense guidance from an original range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion to a revised range of $1,390 million to $1,450 million as we seek partially offset the reduction in our top line guidance. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones on deck through mid-2022. To start, we will continue executing on our global commercialization of ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. On the R&D side, we have an exciting clinical readout coming up with cemdisiran where we plan to report Phase 2 monotherapy results in IgA nephropathy in early 2022. We plan to continue advancing our TTR franchise with patisiran. We look forward to top line results from the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study in mid-2022. With patisiran, we look forward to the potential approval and U.S launch of our fifth RNAi therapeutic with a new PDUFA date of July 14. Approval in the EU is anticipated mid-year with subsequent launches in key markets to follow, pending finalization of pricing and reimbursement. With ALN-HSD, we expect to report top line results from Part B of the Phase 1 study in patients with NASH in mid-2022. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? Yes, hi. This is Jeff. We updated our guidance, as I said on the call for two primary reasons. One is the FX strengthening U.S dollar, given the percentage of revenue that we generate from ex U.S markets. And secondly, because of the delay in the PDUFA date for vutrisiran. And the thinking there is that, we've talked about vutrisiran being a growth driver overall for the TTR franchise for, I would say, for three primary reasons. One is that we think it'll be very attractive, attractively positioned for those mixed phenotype patients. We think for potential switches from competitive products. And then lastly, for patients that have been diagnosed, but not yet on treatment, we think vutrisiran will grow our overall franchise as a result of its profile. So, the guidance just reflects the fact that we'll have -- assuming approval by July 14, that we'll have the product on the market for one less quarter than we originally anticipated when we got it in February. Yes, let me give you a little bit -- little more detail, Salveen. So, we -- in our guidance slide, updated guidance slide, we did footnote at the bottom what the FX rates are that we've included in the updated guidance, which were as of April 18. And we also provided what we included in our original guidance on January 31. So, you can see the strengthening of the dollar there. Just to make sure it's clear, the exposure that we've got to ex U.S revenue. Based on our Q1 revenues, 49% of our revenues were in the U.S dollar in Q1, 38% were in Europe, so primarily in the Euro; and 13% were in ROW markets, primarily Japan. So those are -- the yen and the euro are our two biggest exposures. If you use the revised rates that we have compared to what we used in the original guidance, that's about a $20 million headwind relative to the original guidance that we gave. And the dollar is actually further strengthened since April 18. Now in terms of the sensitivity to that, just as a rough estimate, sort of from this point going forward each, 1% strengthening of the dollar against ex U.S currencies is about a $3 million headwind for us. So, the guidance range that we gave, hopefully would accommodate additional movements in FX, but we're not -- obviously we're not in the business of predicting which way the FX rates are going to move."

            "name": "Yvonne Greenstreet",
            "content": "Thanks, Christine, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. The first quarter of 2022 was another quarter of continued progress at Alnylam across our commercial and pipeline portfolios. First, despite an expected quarter-on-quarter decrease in combined product revenues from our commercial portfolio of ONPATTRO, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, we observed a steady increase in patients on therapy. Alongside that commercial progress, our RNAi therapeutic pipeline programs continued to advance. With the TTR franchise, we present a positive 18-month results from the HELIOS-A Phase 3 study of vutrisiran. The NDA for vutrisiran is under review, with a new PDUFA date of July the 14, 2022, following the 3 months delay, we announced earlier in April to allow for the review of newly added information related to a new secondary packaging and labeling facility. We also brought new programs into the clinic with the initiation of two Phase 1 studies. And today, we announced that the Phase 1 study as ALN-XDH, patients with gout has been initiated. Additionally, the first on Alnylam, RNAi therapeutic, targeting a CNS disorder, ALN-APP has entered Phase 1, a very exciting milestone for our platform. And initial top line results from both of these programs are expected in late 2022. Looking further out, we believe Alnylam is poised for significant growth based on three key drivers. First is the potential near-term expansion of our TTR franchise, where we aim to become the global leader in delivering impactful and highly differentiated medicines to patients. Second, is our expansion beyond rare diseases into prevalent diseases. And a third key growth driver for the company comes from our sustainable innovation engine comprised of new platform enhancements, opportunities with extrahepatic delivery, and our ability to find new genetically validated targets, which can drive further pipeline expansion to 2025 and beyond. We believe all of this positions us well to deliver on our Alnylam P5x25 goals, making Alnylam a top biotech company developing and commercializing transformative medicines for rare and common diseases for patients around the world, driven by a high-yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering exceptional financial results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga, for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga? So, thanks for that question, David. Real quick, we're pleased with the growth that we're seeing with respect to patient demand with ONPATTRO. But I'll turn it over to Tolga to answer your specific question. Tolga, any anything you'd like to add? Thanks, Tolga. Does that answer your question? Pushkal? That was going to be absolutely ready to launch, assuming FDA approval by the July PDUFA date. Thank you, David. Next question. That's  summary. Great questions. Clearly the KARDIA studies are incredibly important to us. And we're focused on enrolling these as expeditiously as we can. Obviously, the Ukraine situation is devastating from a geopolitical and human perspective, but has had an impact on enrollment in KARDIA-1. But perhaps, Pushkal, you can address that, and also some of the approaches that we're taking to try and assure enrollment into the study. And we will go to Jeff for the revenue guidance question. Yes, and just to remind everybody that we expect to complete enrollment of KARDIA-1 in early 2023 with the top line data expected mid-2023. And for KARDIA-2 complete enrollment at around year-end 2022. So, the data will be forthcoming. In due course, which will be looking forward to. So, Jeff, I think, a question for you in terms of how we thought about FX. So, I think first question, Pushkal, I think is for you. How confident are we in achieving approval by the new PDUFA date, given the proximity to putting in the amendment? Thanks, Pushkal. And Tolga, actually you could take the second question with respect to whether there's a market opportunity or subpopulation with respect to home dosing for people? Yes, so maybe with the first question with respect to the filing. Yes, it was a voluntary action that we decided in close consultation with the FDA. So, I think that's another factor that gives us confidence in actually achieving an approval by the PDUFA date. Maybe Pushkal, you could take the question on the CNS opportunity where we are with ALN-APP. And just to add, one of the reasons why we're so excited about this program is obviously there's huge unmet medical needs in patients with Alzheimer's as well as cerebral amyloid angiopathy. But if we're successful with these indications that  are not the opportunity to be able to bring the power of RNAi platform to many, many other CNS diseases where it's the huge medical needs. So, we're very focused on ensuring progress with this program and hope to delivering data . So, I think there's a few questions for you, Pushkal,  discussions and indications around the potential for an inspection. I think, Tolga, that's a question for you. I mean, some more color because it impacts specifically with  ONPATTRO. Yes, that's great, Tolga. So, I mean, we're optimistic with you going forward. But as Tolga said, I think this virus has shown the potential for surprises on multiple occasions . . Tolga, I think you can answer the first question around the interplay with respect to vutri and ONPATTRO, how are we thinking about the early days of the launch? Yes, that's a great answer, Tolga. And maybe just to add that we really are still in the early stages of building the TTR franchise. We're currently addressing the needs of 2,200 patients with ONPATTRO. But there are another 30,000 or 40,000 patients there who are addressable by ONPATTRO. So, there's still lots of growth to come here. The second question, Tolga, I think is also for you. How are you thinking about new entrants into the market, particularly for ? Next question? Pushkal, I think, three questions for you there. Thanks, Pushkal. Gena, does that answer your question? We are indeed. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on this call. 2022 is off to a steady start as we continue to advance our  system. We did with all the exciting pipeline programs that we have in development. There are lot of exciting and important upcoming milestones over the course of the year and we look forward to updating you on these. So, thank you to everybody for joining our call today and have a great day."

This includes the robust product growth for our four wholly earned commercial medicines, delivering $1.24 billion in global net product revenues and hitting the remarkable milestone of over 5,000 patients now on an Alnylam commercial RNAi therapeutic. We also extended our leadership in RNAi, including the first-ever demonstration of RNAi-mediated target gene silencing of a human brain and preclinical data showing for the first time delivery of RNAi therapeutics to adipose and muscle tissues. Zilebesiran also made exciting progress for hypertension with encouraging results in the KARDIA-1 Phase 2 study. Further with zilebesiran, we strengthened our business for the future through business development with a landmark collaboration with Roche. Looking forward, we are excited to continue this progress in 2024, delivering continued commercial execution, notable clinical trial readouts and advancing programs across all stages of development. As you are aware, a key clinical milestone anticipated this year is the readouts from our HELIOS-B Phase 3 study of vutrisiran in patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. As we indicated in our press release this morning, we are announcing a few updates to the analysis plan that we believe will enhance the study, enable the best demonstration of vutrisiran\u2019s impact across the entirety of the patient population and supports a strong and competitive label. Pushkal will walk through these updates in detail later in the call. We believe all of this puts us on track with our Alnylam P5x25 goals, making Alnylam a top-tier biotech developing and commercializing transformative medicines for patients around the world with rare and prevalent diseases driven by a high-yielding pipeline, the first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering exceptional financial results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks, Yvonne and good morning, everyone. Q4 was another strong quarter for our commercial portfolio, with both our TTR franchise and our Ultra-Rare franchise, delivering growth in excess of 30% compared with Q4 2022. Total net product revenues grew 32% in the fourth quarter versus prior year or 30% at a constant exchange rate as we continue to steadily increase the number of patients on each of our therapies. Let me now turn to a summary of our fourth quarter TTR performance. Our TTR franchise achieved $254 million in global net product revenues, representing a 10% increase compared with the third quarter and 33% growth compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. At the end of the fourth quarter, more than 4,060 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA treatment worldwide, up from over 3,790 patients at the end of the third quarter, representing 7% quarterly patient growth. Now, let me provide highlights of our U.S. and international TTR performance. In the U.S. combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased by 5% compared with the third quarter and a robust 38% year-over-year driven by AMVUTTRA\u2019s launch. The U.S. quarter-over-quarter growth was primarily driven by an increase in demand resulting from the strength of ongoing AMVUTTRA patient uptake, more than offsetting a decrease in ONPATTRO patients switching to AMVUTTRA. At the end of the fourth quarter, more than 85% of U.S. hATTR polyneuropathy patients are now on AMVUTTRA, a testament to its clearly differentiated market-leading profile, including rapid knockdown, reversal of polyneuropathy manifestations, well-established safety profile with thousands of patient years of experience, along with only 4 times a year administration. We also continue to progress on increasing our prescriber base, which has grown over 50% since AMVUTTRA was launched in the third quarter of 2022. While we have been able to facilitate the development of multi-disciplined center approach for the treatment of hATTR polyneuropathy, driven primarily by cardiologists and neurologists in these centers. Now, let me turn to our international markets, where the TTR franchise growth increased by 18% compared with the third quarter and a strong 28% year-over-year. The quarter-over-quarter growth was driven by the following: demand growth driven by AMVUTTRA\u2019s performance, including recent launches in Spain and Italy and continued strong ONPATTRO performance in markets, where AMVUTTRA is not yet available, an improvement in gross to net deductions in the quarter following price reductions in Q3, primarily in Germany that were highlighted on our Q3 call. Lastly, consistent with our prior years, growth in the fourth quarter was also favorably impacted by increased inventories in Japan and the timing of orders in various partner markets. In summary, AMVUTTRA with its market-leading profile is now available and reimbursed in all major markets across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan, driving robust patient and revenue growth in 2023 and we believe we are well-positioned for future growth. Moving to our Ultra-Rare franchise. GIVLAARI and OXLUMO delivered $92 million in combined product sales during the fourth quarter, representing an 11% increase compared with the third quarter and a solid 30% growth compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. We ended the quarter with more than 1,080 patients on our two Ultra-Rare products with approximately 650 patients on GIVLAARI and approximately 430 patients on OXLUMO, representing an 8% combined quarterly growth in patients on our Ultra-Rare products compared with the third quarter of 2023. For GIVLAARI, product sales increased by 10% in Q4 compared with the third quarter, with the following regional dynamics. A 7% increase in U.S. primarily driven by a higher net price achieved in the quarter due to favorable gross to net adjustments, a 16% increase in our international markets, driven by continued demand growth, timing of orders in partner markets and favorable gross to net adjustments. For OXLUMO, well positioned as the market-leading therapy in PH1, we delivered a robust 14% increase in product sales compared with the third quarter, which was driven by the following: a 9% increase in the U.S. driven by demand growth; a 16% increase in our international markets, driven by increased demand; and the timing of orders in our partner markets. In conclusion, we are very pleased with the results in the fourth quarter with both our TTR and Ultra-Rare franchises, which delivered strong growth in patients on therapy during the quarter as well as robust year-over-year growth in revenues with both franchises delivering 30% or greater growth versus the fourth quarter of 2022. We are well positioned as we enter 2024 to continue delivering our medicines to more patients in need around the world. Now with that, I will turn it over to Pushkal to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal?\nPushkal Garg: Thank you, Tolga and good morning everyone. I am going to begin with some important updates that we are announcing this morning regarding HELIOS-B. As you know, HELIOS-B is an outcome study, being conducted to expand the label for AMVUTTRA to include the treatment of cardiomyopathy in patients with hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis. Today, ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA are approved to treat polyneuropathy in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with an estimated prevalence of 25,000 to 30,000 patients worldwide. Assuming successful results from the HELIOS-B study and regulatory approval, we expect to expand into a market approximately 10x larger with a global prevalence greater than 300,000 patients. And furthermore, we are committed to continuing to innovate from patients with this disease as we advance ALN-TTRsc04, another medicine that can deliver rapid knockdown with the potential for greater efficacy and once annual dosing through clinical development. Moreover, as illustrated in this graphic for the United States, we expect this already sizable market to continue to grow substantially in the coming years due to increasing disease awareness, earlier diagnosis and the availability of new treatments. Just given these dynamics, we are laser-focused on bringing our industry leading portfolio of potentially transformative therapeutics to ATTR-CM patients and being leaders in this important growth category. Now as we previously highlighted, between now and tafamidis loss of exclusivity anticipated in late 2028, we expect the market to be primarily monotherapy-driven given the cumulative costs of combination therapy. Our research with payers has confirmed that they plan to restrict combination use, given that it would drive substantially higher cost. And even today, with tafamidis and AMVUTTRA have non-overlapping labels, about 90% of commercial plans restrict combination use. More importantly, we have seen very limited instances in which two branded rare disease products are used in combination regardless of the therapeutic area. Assuming positive data from HELIOS-B and regulatory approval, we anticipate that vutrisiran has the potential product profile, including compelling efficacy, safety and a quarterly subcu dosing regimen to become primarily a first line treatment for newly diagnosed ATTR-CM patients and a switch therapy for those who experienced disease progression with stabilizers and to be combined with the stabilizer in those limited situations where payers support access. Once tafamidis goes generic and again, pending the label, we believe that combination therapy will become more common. With this backdrop in mind, let\u2019s now turn to HELIOS-B, why we are confident it\u2019s poised for success and the endpoint refinements that we are announcing today. The reasons for our continued confidence are summarized here. The impact of TTR silencing with an RNAi therapeutic on cardiomyopathy was demonstrated in the 12-month APOLLO-B study. We believe these data are exceedingly informative and support the potential for vutrisiran to demonstrate an outcomes benefit in HELIOS-B. On functional outcomes such as 6-minute walk test as well as quality of life, we saw evidence of disease stabilization over time. We also saw a profound impact on NT-proBnP troponin, which are highly validated indicators of disease severity and prognosis. These four parameters, all of which showed the greatest magnitude of effect in the monotherapy setting are important predictors of cardiovascular outcomes, which we would expect to manifest in a larger and longer study like HELIOS-B. And accordingly, as we shared at AHA last November, we were encouraged to see a favorable trend in mortality that separated beginning as early as 9 months and continuing to expand over 24 months. While not powered for mortality, the hazard ratio at 24 months was 0.67 favoring patisiran and the benefits were seen in both the monotherapy and combination settings. We find these data very compelling as while APOLLO-B was too short and too small to establish an outcomes benefit and impact on mortality appeared to occur earlier than seen in other ATTR-CM studies to-date was durable and in fact, grew over time, despite crossover of all patients to active treatment at 12 months. Now moving on to HELIOS-B itself, the study is designed and powered to deliver outcomes and is twice as large and 3x as long as APOLLO-B. Previous studies have shown that intervention in ATTR cardiomyopathy most benefits patients with NYHA Class 1 and 2 and the HELIOS-B study is enriched specifically for these patients as they are most likely to show the largest treatment effect. And HELIOS-B provides the longest follow-up of any study conducted in ATTR cardiomyopathy to-date. The study was conservatively powered at the outset with additional tailwinds that include over enrollment by 10% and tafamidis based on the drop in rates that are below the expectations of use to power the study. In fact, the tafamidis rates at baseline were 40%, substantially less than the 50% we had assumed when powering the study. So putting all this together, we have several key takeaways. First, existing plan restrictions and prior precedents suggest that for the next several years, the market is expected to be primarily monotherapy driven. And second, we have data from APOLLO-B that demonstrate substantial effects on multiple endpoints that provide evidence of a differentiated profile with disease stabilization, along with evidence of an early emerging benefit mortality. And finally and as expected, the treatment effect in APOLLO-B was shown to be largest in the monotherapy population, which was the dominant population of the study and best suited to demonstrate the treatment benefits of patisiran. Today, we are announcing enhancements to the HELIOS-B statistical plan to optimize the study for success and a strong and competitive label. These changes are informed by the insights from the APOLLO-B data and emerging data from the field. With these optimizations, we remain focused on clinical outcomes of death and hospitalization, which are critical to all stakeholders, the plan to evaluate this in the overall population as well as the monotherapy population, which is expected to have the largest treatment effect and best demonstrate the drug\u2019s true impact. We also are focusing the secondary endpoint structure on critical clinical elements that highlight the drug\u2019s potentially differentiated profile and its benefits on stabilization of this progressive disease. And we are enhancing the overall statistical powering of the study by incorporating up to an additional 3 months of event collection at the tail end of the study period. The most critical period and firmly establishing HELIOS-B as the longest placebo-controlled study conducted to-date in ATTR-CM. Let me review the key changes one by one. First, we are sharing today that we are increasing the minimum follow-up in the study from 30 to 33 months with variable follow-up to 36 months. This adds up to 3 months of event collection for the patients who enrolled later in the study thereby providing greater statistical power. With these changes, approximately 60% of patients remaining on study will have greater follow-up, with about 20% or a third more having follow-up all the way out to month 36. This is an important change as these 3 additional months of observation constitute a short, but meaningful prolongation during the critical late part of the study, which is when we expect to see the greatest number of outcome events happening in the placebo arm. As a result, this enhancement leads to greater study power as we know that survival curves typically diverge more and more over time, a phenomenon that was seen in the 24-month APOLLO-B data as well. Second, we are modifying the methodology used to analyze the primary endpoint. The primary outcome measure remains the composite of all-cause mortality in recurrent cardiovascular events. This will now be tested in parallel in two populations, the overall population and the monotherapy population that is the subgroup of patients not on tafamidis at baseline. We are maintaining the analysis in the overall population, which has the largest sample size and an opportunity to show a broad effect across the full patient spectrum. We are confident that there is a combo effect as demonstrated by the fact that the overall population remains in the primary end point. In parallel, we are elevating an analysis of the composite in the monotherapy population, which constitutes the majority of the study population at 60%. Additionally, the analysis in the monotherapy population allows us to demonstrate the true impact of vutrisiran as the standalone treatment, providing a dataset that will be particularly relevant to patients, prescribers and others as it closely aligns with where we see the treatment landscape over the next several years. It\u2019s important to note that these are not co-primary endpoints. Rather the primary endpoint will be tested in parallel in both populations such that if each p-value is less than or equal to 0.05 and statistical significance can be claimed for both. Alternatively, the study will be declared a positive study either of the p-values for the two analyses is less than or equal to 0.025. This study will be deemed positive in both or either of the analyses achieved the predefined criteria for statistical significance. Based on our assumptions, as informed by APOLLO-B and other studies as well as the conduct and execution of HELIOS-B, we remain confident about HELIOS-B and its ability to deliver a positive result. Finally, we have streamlined the secondary endpoints. Specifically, the structure now includes 6-minute walk test, KCCQ OS, all cause mortality and change from baseline in NYHA Class. These endpoints are considered clinically meaningful and will help to demonstrate the impact of vutrisiran on disease stabilization and including them as formal secondary endpoints enables them to potentially be included in the label and support differentiation in the marketplace. Based on the three optimizations I\u2019ve just outlined, here is the updated study design. I do want to note that the changes I have shared today were made after consultation with the FDA and other health authorities. We are supportive of this approach, particularly as it relates to the handling of the primary endpoint. With the 3-month extension in the overall study duration we are sharing today the top line results are now expected in late June or early July. At that time, we plan to provide p-values on the primary and secondary end points as well as key details regarding safety. We also expect to provide some high-level information on subgroups, including patients on baseline tafamidis. Full results are expected to be presented at a scientific congress soon thereafter. Assuming positive results from HELIOS-B, we expect to submit a supplemental NDA to the FDA in late 2024. We are confident that the study updates I\u2019ve just reviewed, refinements to endpoints and extension of the blinded study period further enhance the power of the study and our confidence that HELIOS-B will deliver a positive result. Assuming positive data and regulatory approval, we believe that vutrisiran will be well positioned to serve patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy, addressing unmet needs with the potential for a highly competitive market-leading profile, including a unique mechanism of action that works upstream of protein production and enables rapid knockdown of TTR, an impactful clinical profile with the potential to reduce mortality and CV hospitalizations and helping exorable decline in functional capacity and quality of life, an attractive quarterly dosing schedule that aligns with physician visits, support strong adherence and provides the flexibility of in-office or at-home dose administration, and favorable payer dynamics, where coverage under Medicare Part B is expected to result in the majority of patients having zero out-of-pocket costs and where we also expect payers to favor monotherapies for the next several years. We look forward to sharing top line results from HELIOS-B in the late June to early July timeframe, bringing this transformative medicine one step closer to patients. Let me now turn to some recent and exciting developments with ALN-APP in development for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The early clinical data from this program continue to be very encouraging. At CTAD, we presented data showing that single doses of ALN-APP achieved sustained pharmacodynamic activity up to 10 months after administration with marked reductions in A beta 42 and A beta 40, Amyloid fragments implicated in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and CAA respectively, as well as an encouraging safety profile. As we announced in our press release today, we are very pleased to share that the FDA has provided clearance to initiate the multi-dose Part B of the Phase 1 study in the United States. This decision came after we submitted additional non-clinical data as well as emerging clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 study. The FDA has confirmed that multiple dosing in the Phase 1 study may proceed at doses as high as 180 milligrams every 6 months, while a partial clinical hold remains for doses that are higher or more frequent than that. We are delighted by the FDA\u2019s decision and are encouraged that we will be able to proceed in Phase 1 with multiple doses at levels up to and even exceeding all the dose levels that we plan to test in Part B of the study based on the high and sustained levels of knockdown that we have already seen with single doses of 75 milligrams in Part A. Let me now move on to recent \u2013 to highlight recent progress across the rest of the pipeline. For zilebesiran, we presented the KARDIA Phase 2 results, which demonstrated over 16 millimeters of placebo-adjusted reduction in 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure at 3 months after a single dose with an encouraging safety and tolerability profile. On ALN-TTRsc04, we recently shared single dose data, which showed deep and rapid knockdown with mean serum TTR reduction up to 97% with durability supporting the potential for annual dosing. We also announced positive initial results from the Phase 1 study of ALN-KHK with robust target engagement and encouraging safety that supported continued development as a novel treatment for Type 2 diabetes. And wrapping up on the pipeline, we announced several exciting updates from our research portfolio at our R&D Day, including progress with extrahepatic delivery of RNAi to muscle and adipose, compelling new targets in areas of high unmet need and advancement of RNAi in oncology with a Phase 1 study for ALN-BCAT, hepatocellular carcinoma on track to initiate early this year. And this progress is accelerating as we plan to file proprietary INDs for nine programs by the end of 2025 against targets in the liver, CNS, muscle and adipose. If we include partnered programs, we anticipate 15 new INDs by the end of 2025, representing a doubling of the Alnylam clinical pipeline by the end of next year. This remarkable and unique pace of innovation puts us in a great position to have a robust, self-sustainable pipeline that can deliver meaningful impact to patients across multiple disease areas. And with that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff?\nJeff Poulton: Thanks, Pushkal. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be presenting Alnylam\u2019s full year 2023 financial results and providing our financial guidance for 2024. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for the full year. Total product revenues for 2023 were $1.24 billion or 39% growth versus 2022 with both our TTR and ultra rare franchises reporting strong growth of 35% or greater for the full year. The full year net revenue from collaborations was $546 million, representing more than a fourfold increase compared with 2022 and with the increase being primarily driven by revenue recognized under our co-development and co-commercialization collaboration with Roche as executed in July 2023. Gross margin on product sales was 78% for the full year, representing a 6% decrease compared with 2022, primarily due to increased excess and obsolete charges due to canceling manufacturing commitments and the impairment of ONPATTRO inventory that had been manufactured for future demand associated with the ATTR cardiomyopathy indication for patisiran for which we did not receive regulatory approval in addition to a higher royalty rate payable on net sales of AMVUTTRA. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 15% for the full year, primarily related to increased head count and infrastructure related costs to support our growing pipeline and increased clinical costs driven by Cardio 1 and Cardio, 2, two of our Phase 2 studies in support of our zilebesiran hypertension program. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 6% for the full year, lower than in prior years as we seek to increase the operating leverage associated with our existing commercial and corporate infrastructure. The 6% increase for the year was primarily driven by increased head count related costs and other investments supporting our strategic growth, including the global launch of AMVUTTRA. Our non-GAAP operating loss for 2023 was $60 million, representing a nearly $500 million improvement compared with 2022 primarily driven by strong top line results, both in product sales as well as revenue from collaborations, as I previously highlighted. Delivering non-GAAP operating profit by the end of 2025 remains a key focus for the organization per [indiscernible] by \u201825 goals. Finally, we ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion at the end of 2022 with the increase primarily related to the $310 million upfront payment from our zilebesiran co-development, co-commercialization collaboration with Roche, $100 million from Regeneron for achievement of the ALN-APP proof-of-principle milestone and approximately $150 million from employee option exercises, offset by our operating loss for the year. We continue to believe our current cash balance is sufficient to bridge us to a self-sustainable financial profile. Now I\u2019d like to turn to our financial guidance for 2024. Starting with net product revenues. We are providing combined net product revenue guidance for ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. Our guidance assumes foreign exchange rates as of January 31, 2024, which are noted in the footnote on our guidance slide. We anticipate combined net product revenues for these four products will be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, corresponding to a 13% to 21% growth rate at January 31 FX rates. Consistent with 2023, we are providing constant exchange rate growth guidance for our net product revenues with a projected range of 13% to 21% as well, highlighting no current difference between our guidance using January 31 FX rates and 2023 constant exchange rates. The collaboration and royalty revenue guidance is $325 million to $425 million. We anticipate that collaboration revenue associated with our partnerships with Roche and Regeneron and LEQVIO royalties from Novartis will drive the majority of our collaboration and royalty revenue in 2024. Our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses is a range between $1.675 billion and $1.775 billion, with the midpoint of the guidance range representing 9% growth versus 2023. Growth highlights for R&D expense in 2024 include increased clinical investment in our zilebesiran, TTRS-C04 and APP programs as well as growth in pre-PC and IND-enabling efforts across our preclinical portfolio as we continue to invest in creating new organic growth opportunities for the future. As a reminder, reimbursement from partners for R&D OpEx for some partnered programs highlighted by zilebesiran is accounted for as collaboration revenue. Growth highlights for SG&A expense in 2024 include increased medical and commercial investment as we prepare for the potential launch of vutrisiran in the U.S. for ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones slated for early 2024. We will, of course, be executing on global commercialization of our products, ONPATTRO, AMVUTTRA, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. We also intend to report top line results from the KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study of zilebesiran as well as initiate the KARDIA-3 multi-agent combo study. We also expect three other trial initiations in early 2024, including the Phase 2 study of ALN-APP in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Part B of the Phase 1 study of ALN-KHK in Type 2 diabetes and a Phase 1 study of ALN-BCAT in hepatocellular carcinoma. And as Pushkal previously noted, we expect to report top line results from the HELIOS-B Phase 3 study of vutrisiran in late June or early July. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, we can now open the call to questions. To those dialed in, we would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each and then get back in the queue if you have additional questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ritu Baral from TD.\nRitu Baral: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Quick question on the updated stat analysis. It makes a lot of sense, but I\u2019m wondering about a certain scenario that is outlined on Slide 18 versus some of the proceedings of the APOLLO-B Adcomm. If you succeed on the monotherapy population with a p-value of 0.025 only, what has FDA feedback been on this, just given the importance placed on combination therapy and lack of benefit from the prior proceedings? And could that lead to a more restrictive label for the drug versus second line or something based on your interactions on the SAP on this final SAP? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Ritu. That\u2019s a great question. And I just want to kind of underscore that we\u2019re really confident on the potential effects of [indiscernible] outcomes and the [indiscernible] was already well designed and executed to deliver these results. And the changes that we\u2019re announcing today enhance an already robust study given how important the study is for patients and for Alnylam. And clearly, as Pushkal said, we consulted with the FDA as we made these changes. It\u2019s important to note that this is study that is focused on outcomes, and it\u2019s outcomes that are most important to physicians, patients and payers. And that\u2019s very different from base scenario assessing endpoints like 6-minute walk test and KCCQ, really, if we\u2019re able to deliver the primary endpoint as we\u2019ve described. We\u2019re confident that this will be a study that should be approved by health authorities. But happy for Pushkal to add any additional color to that.\nPushkal Garg: No, I think, Yvonne, you\u2019ve really covered it. Ritu, I think we remain focused on both the overall population. And what we\u2019re doing today is highlighting that based on all the learnings from APOLLO-B and in terms of delivering a strong and competitive label and aligning with what is \u2013 where we see the market being for the next several years that we\u2019ve elevated our analysis of the monotherapy group. And as I mentioned, as Yvonne has highlighted, we\u2019ve made these adjustments after consultation with FDA and other health authorities. And so we think that will support an approvable package.\nRitu Baral: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Paul Matteis from Stifel.\nPaul Matteis: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it. I totally agree with Ritu that these changes at base makes sense. But I think my main question is why now? It feels like when the study started, we all knew that 33 months is better than 30, that your drug alone would probably have a bigger effect size alone and effect size, that could be a little bit diluted by tafamidis. So what changed? What have you seen in the blinded data? Is there something that\u2019s more nuanced here that\u2019s leading you to make these changes? And accepting the fact that there is going to be a small delay versus initial guidance? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Paul. That\u2019s a great question. Look, I mean, these changes were primarily influenced by learnings from APOLLO-B. And important to note, not just the 12-month data, with the open-label extension data at 24 months and beyond. And these data have really informed the enhancements that we\u2019ve announced today. And I think for us, it\u2019s important to make sure we had as much information as we possibly could prior to making any changes before database. And also as Pushkal emphasized, to make sure that we consulted with the FDA and other health authorities and that takes time. So I think we\u2019re in this sweet spot, if you like, between really understanding all the data that we\u2019re going to have prior to database lock and obviously, database lock beyond, which is not possible to make changes.\nPushkal Garg: Yes. I think building on what you said, Yvonne. Paul, I think, look, it makes sense for us to have the maximum amount of information before we make changes to an analysis plan as we\u2019re announcing today. These are not changes in the operational conduct of the study \u2013 there to the analytic plan. And again, it makes the most sense to have as much information that\u2019s come out of APOLLO-B. We\u2019ve gotten \u2013 we were in a very fortunate position to run that study and gotten all the information that we did out of that study on a variety of endpoints to have that extended follow-up and then to have the opportunity to align with health authorities.\nPaul Matteis: In the long-term APOLLO-B data, are you seeing a more pronounced monotherapy effect versus an effect on tafamidis on outcomes and tafamidis-treated patients on outcomes endpoints? Is that part of the nuance here?\nPushkal Garg: Paul, what I\u2019d say is that what we\u2019ve seen in the long-term data, and we presented some data last fall at the AdCom and then I think at HFSA are really encouraging to us in both populations, frankly, as it relates to outcomes, right? If you look at the monotherapy group, what we\u2019ve seen was really sizable effects on a variety of endpoints, as I highlighted in my opening remarks, on a variety of endpoints that predict outcomes. And we saw a mortality separation. And as we\u2019ve looked also in the combination group over time, what we saw was favorable effects on outcomes there as well. And so I think both of this just builds into our confidence. But I think certainly, what we\u2019re seeing in monotherapy. And again, this is not just APOLLO-B, when we look back at the original APOLLO study when we look at HELIOS-A. All of this really highlights a very compelling effect. When you look at that overall hazard ratio for mortality was 0.67 at 24 months in the overall population. So we have a lot of confidence in what we\u2019re seeing here. And we think these refinements to the analysis plan will only optimize the study for success in getting a strong and competitive label.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Let me just jump in as well, Paul. This is Akshay. I think if we stand back and look just to put some numbers to what Pushkal has mentioned, in APOLLO itself, a hazard ratio for mortality 0.5:3. And that showed up as early as 6 months and then the curve started separating. In APOLLO-B, the hazard ratio for mortalities was 0.36 at 12 months, both in the monotherapy as well as [indiscernible], patisiran 1 is 0.67, as you said at 24 months. And this is now APOLLO-B, that\u2019s half the size and changes showing up at 9 months and continue to separate since then. So I think the changes we\u2019ve made today, I\u2019m glad you agree why and a 3-month addition to further increase the robustness of the encouraging data we already see from APOLLO and APOLLO-B, I think just further consolidates that we anticipate a positive study, and we\u2019re confident about that. And today\u2019s changes just further attest to our confidence in our approach. So I\u2019ll leave it at that, but I hope that makes sense folks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Akshay. That\u2019s great. We will have the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ellie Merle from UBS.\nEllie Merle: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Can you just elaborate a bit more on the changes you did on the secondary endpoint analysis? Specifically, what the hierarchy is of this streamlined secondary endpoint analysis? And what this does for the powering of key secondaries like mortality? And your latest expectation for what we could see on the mortality secondary, particularly in the monotherapy arm? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. No, that\u2019s a great question, Ellie. And as you note, that we took the decision to streamline the secondary point because we really want to focus on the most clinically important end points to support differentiation. We\u2019ve seen evidence of disease stabilization and this doesn\u2019t appear to be true of evidence generated with stabilizers. So we\u2019ve really been thoughtful about what are the endpoints that focus on important clinical learnings and had therefore remove some of the endpoints from the hierarchical structure, but obviously, we will be looking at all those data as exploratory endpoints. But Pushkal, perhaps you could just go through a little bit of specific changes that we\u2019ve made to the secondary endpoints?\nPushkal Garg: Yes, absolutely. So Ellie, what we\u2019ve done is \u2013 obviously, the primary as we talked about, remains a focus on outcomes of death and recurrent CV events that we will be looking in the two populations. Then going down, we put 6-minute walk test in KCCQ next. We think we have ample power for those, and we think those are great endpoints based on what we learned from APOLLO-B to really demonstrate what we seem to see \u2013 be seeing is in terms of differentiated profile. Whereas patients on an RNAi therapeutic appear to have disease stabilization over an extended period of time. And while no head-to-head, it looks very different than the progressive decline that we\u2019ve seen now in two pivotal trials with stabilizer therapies. And so we look forward to hopefully seeing those patterns emerge again in HELIOS-B. The third endpoint is all-cause mortality. Obviously, that\u2019s a higher bar than the primary endpoint. But again, based on what we\u2019re seeing and while the study is primarily powered for the composite, we think it\u2019s important to be able to demonstrate to look for all-cause mortality. And so we will be testing that formally in the secondary endpoint structure. And last, we\u2019ve added an endpoint of NYHA class because we saw some very encouraging data merging out of APOLLO-B that suggested that, again, consistent with an emerging profile that this class of drugs can actually delay disease progression and stabilize the disease that we may see benefits on NYHA class. And we think all of those are clinically important differentiating factors that may \u2013 that we want to make sure that we look at with the potential to include them in the label and differentiate in the marketplace.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. And just building off that last point in Pushkal, I think you went through the different endpoints very carefully. From our perspective, we\u2019re focusing on the most stringent outcomes, whether it\u2019s mortality, hospitalization, quality of life, new [indiscernible]. This is what matters to us. It will show the true impact of this drug and it\u2019s what matters to patients and doctors. And ultimately, we hope to get this into the label. And you note that we\u2019ve avoided putting things like BNP and other endpoints, which we could have put in but we want to focus on the strongest outcomes. And I hope that\u2019s a surrogate for the confidence we feel in what we can achieve with vutrisiran. So I\u2019ll leave it at that.\nEllie Merle: Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Akshay. Next question, please. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kostas Biliouris from BMO Capital Markets.\nKostas Biliouris: Hello, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. One question from us on the [indiscernible] so far Helios-B. Looking back at the acoramidis trial, we are wondering whether there was any information there in the readout last year that help you decide on the changes you are making? And maybe looking forward, how do these changes that you are making help you position AMVUTTRA compared to [indiscernible], which is reading out next year and also has a well-powered trial. Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Okay. If I heard you correctly, Kostas, I\u2019m trying to understand whether there is any information from the acoramidis study that influenced these changes? And maybe Pushkal, if you can take that question. And then there was a second question around how do these changes influence our views on the commercial opportunity and Tolga, it would be great if you would take that question. So Pushkal?\nPushkal Garg: Sure. Kostas, I think \u2013 look I think what was \u2013 a couple of things that we took away from looking at the attribute data that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, I think first and foremost, I think it\u2019s important to note that study as well as APOLLO-B for that matter. Enrolled patients in a contemporary era where we know patients are being diagnosed earlier in their disease through noninvasive means as opposed to what was done in the original ATTRACT trial. And what it showed is that patients in those earlier stages of disease can continue to grow events at a precipitous rate if they are not treated and that an effective therapy can show a benefit on top of that. Second of all, it also showed sort of confirming what was seen in the original ATTRACT study that patients with earlier stages of disease like NYHA Class 1 and 2 appear to have the largest magnitude of effect, right? And three, as we\u2019ve seen in lots of different outcomes trials, not just in this disease, but right, the longer exposure leads to greater separation of curves, right? And so all of those things were learnings that we learned and that patients with \u2013 on stabilizers continue to decline month by month in terms of functional ability and quality of life. And so \u2013 on average. And so I think \u2013 all of those are aspects that we look at, again, and sort of we\u2019re in \u2013 to help inform some of the choices we made, in particular, but most importantly, it was the APOLLO-B results as well. As we look at them, again, no head-to-head studies, but we see a contrast in terms of the profile that\u2019s emerging here of these classes of medicines and the end points and refinements we made really to use the opportunity to extend the double-blind period so that we can increase study power, to optimize the study endpoints \u2013 the primary endpoint structure to allow us to elevate the monotherapy and include secondary endpoints that can elaborate on some of those potential points of differentiation and disease stabilization that these other datasets seem to suggest.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Pushkal. Great answer. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. I mean, as Pushkal indicated, these analytical enhancements obviously makes us very confident and HELIOS-B visibility to show headed benefit on vutrisiran on top of TAP as well as obviously demonstrating the value of vutrisiran in a pure placebo. Now HELIOS-B really empowers us to position AMVUTTRA in a very unique way, both in first line utilization as well as on the switch with the tafamidis until eplontersen comes into market. Couple of key, I think attributes that we really need to highlight is the rapid knockdown and sustained knockdown of disease closing protein is very unique to AMVUTTRA. Along with clear outcomes benefit in total population as well as in mono, halting the decline in functional capacity and quality of life, demonstrated years of safety, which we zhave already established with our polyneuropathy indication, attractively sub-quarterly dosing and also limited co-pay burden in patients. These are really going to be unique for AMVUTTRA, which we believe is going to position us a year before potentially even plan coming into the marketplace.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. No, that\u2019s great. And just to add that this is in the context of market that is growing really rapidly. And a market where we know that patients who are on current treatments continue to progress. So, with the profile that Tolga has described, we think we are in a really good position to drive broad commercial uptick of AMVUTTRA and obviously assuming positive results from HELIOS-B and approval. And both in first line, as Tolga described, but also switch from stabilized as we have shown how AMVUTTRA has led to a significant switch in the polyneuropathy market. And we anticipate we will see the same in cardiomyopathy as well with positive data. So, I think the changes that we have made, I think continue to support our confidence in the profile of AMVUTTRA and the potential that will be delivered in the cardiomyopathy market. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of David Lebowitz from Citi.\nDavid Lebowitz: Thank you very much for taking my question. In terms of the primary readout, I know historically, you have released p-values as part of the update, will you be sticking to that plan, or is there additional data points you might be able to offer in the top line to allow for some level of differentiation between AMVUTTRA and the other therapies? And just kind of attached to that, when you look \u2013 since you are targeting really the front line here with your new analysis plan, what do you actually need in your mind to achieve in the study to be able to unseat tafamidis in the front line? I mean given that the trials are quite different, and it\u2019s not necessarily going to be able to be easy to compare on a head-to-head basis. Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. And just briefly, first question. Look, we will do what we normally do, and we will share p-values on the primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints as well as some qualitative assessment on safety. We will also present information on subgroups such as the tafamidis subgroups. So, I hope that answers that question for you. Tolga, if you could just very briefly respond to I mean take the commercial question.\nTolga Tanguler: Right. Look, we have extensive research that such as physicians believe 75% of their patients on a stabilizer continue to progress or experience inadequate treatment, which indicates to us that there is a significant remaining unmet need and a sizable potential to switch to AMVUTTRA and particularly prior to the tafamidis LOE, when payers are implementing already restrictions on combo use. And as Yvonne indicated, we have actually already that great experience starting with ONPATTRO first, and now with AMVUTTRA in ex-U.S. markets, where we actually compete with great data.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Great. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Fye from JPMorgan.\nJessica Fye: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Another one on HELIOS-B. Recognizing that the comparison is going to be versus placebo, what do you want to see in terms of how the event rate in the monotherapy AMVUTTRA patients looks relative to the monotherapy tafamidis patients?\nPushkal Garg: Yes. Jessica, thanks for the question. Look, I think it\u2019s important to note this was not a head-to-head study looking at AMVUTTRA versus tafamidis. This is a study looking at AMVUTTRA or patisiran versus placebo where a proportion of the patients, 40% are on background tafamidis. And so really, the comparisons are AMVUTTRA placebo in those two situations. And as we have said, the primary analysis will be looking at this in the two populations, the blended population of overall as well as the monotherapy population.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thanks for your question, Jessica. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Luca Issi from RBC Capital.\nLuca Issi: Great. Thank you so much for \u2013 yes, thank you so much for taking my questions. Pushkal actually, if I may, circling back on a prior question, maybe ask a little more directly \u2013 is this informed by blinded event rates tracking below your expectation? And then maybe separately, is this considered a formal protocol amendment? And if so, will you incur any statistical penalties for changing the trial so late in the game? Any color there I much appreciate it. Thanks so much.\nPushkal Garg: Yes. Luca, let me take your second point first. There is no change to the operational conduct of the study. This was just a change in the statistical analysis plan. And we outlined in the slides really how the statistics around the primary endpoints are going to be analyzed. So, there is no statistical penalty for that at all. It\u2019s just a change to the analytic plan that we have talked about, so no, not at all. And with regard to the first question, I think as trying to highlight the changes are really driven by what we have seen with APOLLO-B over 2-plus years. And the patterns that we are seeing there and our heightened confidence in terms of the impact of this class of medicines on this disease and what we can do to further optimize the study and set it up well for a strong and competitive label. Of course, we have, as we have said before, have teams that are looking at the blinded data primarily to ensure excellent study conduct and execution, make sure the right patients are enrolled, make sure that the data are clean, make sure that we have got a complete capture of all the events, etcetera. And of course, they are looking at event rates, etcetera. But we are not going to be sharing dribs and drabs the data, and that\u2019s not the driver here. Those types of events rates are extremely variable \u2013 subject to a lot of variability and interpretation. If I told you we had a very high event rate, you might say, well, that\u2019s because that\u2019s great. The placebo event patients are accruing events or you might say, wow, the drug is not working, or conversely, if we have a low event rate that might indicate that, oh, we don\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t enrolled the right patients or maybe the drug is working remarkably well. So, the primary drivers here are what we understand about science, biology and prior precedent from clinical medicine and clinical trials. And that\u2019s the driver.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Let me just add, Pushkal. I think we will go to stand back a little bit. It\u2019s obviously in Alnylam\u2019s interest for patients and for everybody concerned to show definitive outcome for vutrisiran. If there had been mass panic at Alnylam, that the study design is wrong or too small or too short, there are many changes we could have made, and we could have made them well in advance. We have reiterated our confidence over and over again in the study, which was outlined today, deep insights from APOLLO-B, understanding the landscape. And what you see today is a three-month extension for the last patient giving a reasonable amount of additional data, just further enhance the robustness of what we are going to share with the world come June, July. So, I think it\u2019s well worth it. It reiterates our confidence in this study. And we haven\u2019t fundamentally changed the design to a 1,500 patients or 2,000 patients study for 5 years. If we were panicked, you would have seen those things some time ago. Others have done what they have done. You have seen what we have done. And on the backdrop of the scientific edits we have built with the TTR mechanism in APOLLO, in APOLLO-B, I think we should have the confidence.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thanks Akshay. Great. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs.\nSalveen Richter: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. How much of a differential does extending the duration by three months provide instead of conducting the primary analysis at 36 months for all patients? And I am asking this in the context of recently announced studies in the field that are flexible up to 48 months or based on events, so just any clarity there. And then secondly, does the monotherapy analysis heighten the need to show significance on all-cause mortality alone just given task on label benefit for frontline use?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Pushkal, are you going to take this?\nPushkal Garg: Yes, absolutely. So, Salveen, look, I think what we have done here is we think meaningfully add to the duration of the study or the experience in the study in the tail end. And what we have done is actually for patients who are on the back end of the study, which is where the most \u2013 the greatest events accrue in the placebo arm and where you see the cause [ph] diverge, we have added exposure. It turns out that 60% of patients will actually have additional exposure in the study. And about a third of those, 20% more will actually complete all the way up to 36 months, which is when patients roll over into open-label extension. And so we really \u2013 and we think that, that critical addition, frankly, becomes a no-brainer for us, and it\u2019s an important way to further add to study power. So, that\u2019s why that was done. And again, based on all the trends we have seen in APOLLO-B, which \u2013 where we start to see separation as we have highlighted much, much earlier, we \u2013 it\u2019s just \u2013 we think this is a great enhancement that we were able to institute in the study. With regard to your question around monotherapy and all-cause mortality, look, I think it\u2019s really important to just remember that in cardiovascular disease, we have about 40 years or 50 years of doing outcome studies and they typically focus on MACE type of endpoints, which include death and hospitalization. And the reason that, that\u2019s been the focus and accepted by regulators and by the clinical community is because, in general, those events all go hand-in-hand. Hospitalization events, predict mortality and doing mortality alone studies typically are \u2013 tend to be inefficient. They are too large and too long, and we need to get therapies to patients. So, we have designed a study that is focused on death and hospitalization, and we expect to show a positive result in that study. As well as we will of course, have the breakdown of events under those two, and we expect them to go in a consistent manner, which is what you would expect to see based on the biology and precedent in almost every other cardiovascular outcomes trial that\u2019s been done.\nChristine Lindenboom: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Gena Wang from Barclays.\nGena Wang: Thank you for taking my questions. I have two very quick questions. One is for the 60% monotherapy subgroup. Will your stats analysis or assumption, do you assume most of the tafamidis droppings will be in the placebo arm? And my second question, just wanted to double check my math is correct. And that\u2019s based on the Slide 17, you said 60% of the patients remaining on study will have a greater follow-up. 20% more patients will have follow-up to full 36 months. , my calculation will be 40% plus 20% that equals 60% of the patient that will reach for 36 months? Just want to make sure that my math is correct.\nPushkal Garg: Yes. So, Gena, in terms of your questions, the \u2013 as we have said, our TAP drop-in rates are lower than we expected. Obviously, when we designed the study to, we are very encouraged by that. That represents another tailwind that supports the success in the powering of the study. And so I can\u2019t get into any more specifics other than that, but to tell you that that\u2019s \u2013 we are encouraged by those data. In terms of the additional follow-up, maybe what I can clarify is those are changes relative to what the study looked like when it was a 30-month to 36-month follow-up study. And so what we are seeing is \u2013 and of course, what we are focusing on is patients who remain on study. Throughout the study, we have had patients, for example, who have passed away because of their disease, etcetera. And so what we are saying is that in the patients who remain on study, approximately 60% of them will have some extension of their follow-up in the study and roughly a third of those or 20% additional will get to the full \u2013 the full 36 months. So, I hope that clarifies.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Great. Okay. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Maury Raycroft from Jefferies.\nMaury Raycroft: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. With the new stats plan and the latest conversations with regulators, can you talk more at this point on what the minimum delta and the composite endpoint is that you need to achieve to be stat sig [ph] for monotherapy and combo therapy? And in the top line update, can you commit to reporting when you first hit stat sig on the separation of the curve, so we get a sense of kinetics versus competitor drugs?\nPushkal Garg: Yes. Maury, I think what I would say is a couple of things. First of all, I think it\u2019s widely accepted that death and hospitalization are incredibly clinically relevant endpoints, and so there is no sort of minimum threshold there. Obviously, there is always benefit risk. But in general, any benefit in terms of death and hospitalization is considered clinically significant, is very different than scenarios of looking at NT-proBNP or six-minute walk test or things like that. And as we have said, what we are committing to in the primary \u2013 in the top line results is we will provide p-values on the primary and secondary endpoints, we will provide a statement on safety, and we will make \u2013 we will provide information on relevant subgroups, including the TAP subgroup. And of course, we will be providing a lot more data as is our custom, we tend to be quite transparent with our data at scientific and congresses, etcetera, thereafter.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: And as to the kinetics of the effects of either patisiran or vutrisiran for that matter, it\u2019s quite clear that the onset is \u2013 appears to be much more rapid than has been seen in other trials with other drugs. So, for example, in the original APOLLO with patisiran, by six months, you are seeing the separation post of analysis, but you are seeing a separation in mortality and hospitalization. The same was true in APOLLO-B emerging at nine months. When you look at recent studies in the ATTR-CM space, it\u2019s nothing like that. And my point is that more timely are further attested to by the time separation of six-minute walk distance or KCCQ, which also promptly occurred within the first few months of the study. So, I think not just the magnitude of effect that the kinetics of how our drugs work by depleting the pathogenic protein, which certainly in the [indiscernible] seems to be very potent way to treat the disease, will undoubtedly show the impact, I think ultimately and towards\u2026\nYvonne Greenstreet: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ulz from Morgan Stanley.\nMike Ulz: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one on APOLLO-B. You highlighted the AMVUTTRA monotherapy arm did better than the combination of arm of AMVUTTRA and tafamidis. And I think you highlighted that back at the R&D Day. But just curious, what\u2019s the rationale or the mechanism or reason why the combo performs worse than the monotherapy arm? Thanks.\nPushkal Garg: Yes. Mike, maybe just to clarify a couple of points, right. I think first of all, what we are saying is that we \u2013 when we look at the monotherapy data, it\u2019s \u2013 you are looking at the effects of \u2013 effect of one drug and certainly comparing that to placebo. And so those placebo patients tend to decline, and it gives the cleanest perspective on the impact that your drug is having, right. And what we have seen out of APOLLO-B, like, was really quite potent substantial effects on the four key powered endpoints that we looked at in that study, six-minute walk test, KCCQ, NT-proBNP and troponin that were sizable and durable. We also saw benefits on mortality as we have been talking about. Some people have brought up some of the data around time to event or \u2013 and the recurrent CV events. And I would just point out that, one, it\u2019s one endpoint out of all. So, I think you would have to kind of question why that would be the case, and if that makes any clinical or biologic sense. Moreover, when we look at those data, actually, the lack of apparent separation was due to a few early events that happened in the patisiran arm in the first three months. And if you look beyond three months, in the first three months, the drug is just starting to take effect. Beyond three months, we actually see good separation even in the monotherapy group even on outcomes and recurrent CV events specifically. So, I think all of that bodes very well. And as it relates to combination, as we have said along, we are very encouraged. But certainly, just like you see in blood pressure medicines or other things when you start to combine effective therapeutics together with different mechanisms of action, it can change the magnitude of effect that you might detect. But everything that we are seeing coming out of APOLLO-B suggest that there will be an effect there, and it\u2019s most visibly seen by the outcomes data that we talked about in that study.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. We are going to have a much larger study with HELIOS-B and on the\u2026\nYvonne Greenstreet: Large and longer study.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Absolutely.\nYvonne Greenstreet: And investments that large and long the study and that is our friend here, then for the patients and solutions ultimately showing a positive outcome. Just before this Pushkal, you and I were looking at the calmative space. And if they would look at month 18, tafamidis was faring worse than placebo for mortality. So, looking at the wrong time point in a study that\u2019s smaller can really lead you a spread and so APOLLO-B was highly informative, but targeting that one or two of the endpoints didn\u2019t line up where the vast majority did. And ultimately, our friend is the largest, longest study that\u2019s ever been conducted and will shortly be completed in ATTR, and that CSB. So, I think getting too over-indexed on one endpoint that went in the wrong direction, you have to be careful about that.\nChristine Lindenboom: Good. I think we have got time for one more question, one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of William Pickering from Bernstein.\nWilliam Pickering: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. What is the powering of the study with respect to the overall population at the 0.025 significance level, like, I think a lot of the changes make sense, but you have also said in the past that the study is not powered for stat-sig in monotherapy. So, if that doesn\u2019t hit, are you then in like a more difficult position than you were before the stats plan change? Thank you.\nPushkal Garg: Yes. Well, no, I think what I would take away from today is that the changes we make really we think we have actually enhanced the overall statistical power of the study by adding an extra follow-up for those patients. At the tail end of the study, we think we have added \u2013 we certainly have added statistical power there. And the way that we have constructed this endpoint, which again remains focused on the most critical endpoint, which is outcomes, we were allowed to \u2013 we were able to look now in the full totality of the population, 660-plus patients in the combination \u2013 in the overall as well as \u2013 the way I would think about it an enriched population of the monotherapy patients, who we expect to be \u2013 have the largest treatment effect and the purist demonstration of what vutrisiran can accomplish in this and do in this disease. And so we really think we have \u2013 that\u2019s really what we have done here. And so we don\u2019t think that we have, in any way, made it harder. We think that we have actually made the study better and aligned it where, as Tolga highlighted, where we think the market is going to be for the next several years.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, absolutely. That\u2019s great. I think we need to bring the call to a close. I would like to thank everybody for joining us today. As I have said, we are really pleased with the execution. We were looking at 2023, hitting on our 2024 goals and coming [Technical Difficulty] company. So, thank you all and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tolga Tanguler",
            "content": "Thanks, Yvonne and good morning, everyone. Q4 was another strong quarter for our commercial portfolio, with both our TTR franchise and our Ultra-Rare franchise, delivering growth in excess of 30% compared with Q4 2022. Total net product revenues grew 32% in the fourth quarter versus prior year or 30% at a constant exchange rate as we continue to steadily increase the number of patients on each of our therapies. Let me now turn to a summary of our fourth quarter TTR performance. Our TTR franchise achieved $254 million in global net product revenues, representing a 10% increase compared with the third quarter and 33% growth compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. At the end of the fourth quarter, more than 4,060 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA treatment worldwide, up from over 3,790 patients at the end of the third quarter, representing 7% quarterly patient growth. Now, let me provide highlights of our U.S. and international TTR performance. In the U.S. combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased by 5% compared with the third quarter and a robust 38% year-over-year driven by AMVUTTRA\u2019s launch. The U.S. quarter-over-quarter growth was primarily driven by an increase in demand resulting from the strength of ongoing AMVUTTRA patient uptake, more than offsetting a decrease in ONPATTRO patients switching to AMVUTTRA. At the end of the fourth quarter, more than 85% of U.S. hATTR polyneuropathy patients are now on AMVUTTRA, a testament to its clearly differentiated market-leading profile, including rapid knockdown, reversal of polyneuropathy manifestations, well-established safety profile with thousands of patient years of experience, along with only 4 times a year administration. We also continue to progress on increasing our prescriber base, which has grown over 50% since AMVUTTRA was launched in the third quarter of 2022. While we have been able to facilitate the development of multi-disciplined center approach for the treatment of hATTR polyneuropathy, driven primarily by cardiologists and neurologists in these centers. Now, let me turn to our international markets, where the TTR franchise growth increased by 18% compared with the third quarter and a strong 28% year-over-year. The quarter-over-quarter growth was driven by the following: demand growth driven by AMVUTTRA\u2019s performance, including recent launches in Spain and Italy and continued strong ONPATTRO performance in markets, where AMVUTTRA is not yet available, an improvement in gross to net deductions in the quarter following price reductions in Q3, primarily in Germany that were highlighted on our Q3 call. Lastly, consistent with our prior years, growth in the fourth quarter was also favorably impacted by increased inventories in Japan and the timing of orders in various partner markets. In summary, AMVUTTRA with its market-leading profile is now available and reimbursed in all major markets across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Japan, driving robust patient and revenue growth in 2023 and we believe we are well-positioned for future growth. Moving to our Ultra-Rare franchise. GIVLAARI and OXLUMO delivered $92 million in combined product sales during the fourth quarter, representing an 11% increase compared with the third quarter and a solid 30% growth compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. We ended the quarter with more than 1,080 patients on our two Ultra-Rare products with approximately 650 patients on GIVLAARI and approximately 430 patients on OXLUMO, representing an 8% combined quarterly growth in patients on our Ultra-Rare products compared with the third quarter of 2023. For GIVLAARI, product sales increased by 10% in Q4 compared with the third quarter, with the following regional dynamics. A 7% increase in U.S. primarily driven by a higher net price achieved in the quarter due to favorable gross to net adjustments, a 16% increase in our international markets, driven by continued demand growth, timing of orders in partner markets and favorable gross to net adjustments. For OXLUMO, well positioned as the market-leading therapy in PH1, we delivered a robust 14% increase in product sales compared with the third quarter, which was driven by the following: a 9% increase in the U.S. driven by demand growth; a 16% increase in our international markets, driven by increased demand; and the timing of orders in our partner markets. In conclusion, we are very pleased with the results in the fourth quarter with both our TTR and Ultra-Rare franchises, which delivered strong growth in patients on therapy during the quarter as well as robust year-over-year growth in revenues with both franchises delivering 30% or greater growth versus the fourth quarter of 2022. We are well positioned as we enter 2024 to continue delivering our medicines to more patients in need around the world. Now with that, I will turn it over to Pushkal to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal? Yes. I mean, as Pushkal indicated, these analytical enhancements obviously makes us very confident and HELIOS-B visibility to show headed benefit on vutrisiran on top of TAP as well as obviously demonstrating the value of vutrisiran in a pure placebo. Now HELIOS-B really empowers us to position AMVUTTRA in a very unique way, both in first line utilization as well as on the switch with the tafamidis until eplontersen comes into market. Couple of key, I think attributes that we really need to highlight is the rapid knockdown and sustained knockdown of disease closing protein is very unique to AMVUTTRA. Along with clear outcomes benefit in total population as well as in mono, halting the decline in functional capacity and quality of life, demonstrated years of safety, which we zhave already established with our polyneuropathy indication, attractively sub-quarterly dosing and also limited co-pay burden in patients. These are really going to be unique for AMVUTTRA, which we believe is going to position us a year before potentially even plan coming into the marketplace. Right. Look, we have extensive research that such as physicians believe 75% of their patients on a stabilizer continue to progress or experience inadequate treatment, which indicates to us that there is a significant remaining unmet need and a sizable potential to switch to AMVUTTRA and particularly prior to the tafamidis LOE, when payers are implementing already restrictions on combo use. And as Yvonne indicated, we have actually already that great experience starting with ONPATTRO first, and now with AMVUTTRA in ex-U.S. markets, where we actually compete with great data."

            "content": "Thanks, Christine and thank you everyone for joining the call today. Alnylam made great strides in 2023, delivering strong progress across all areas of our business. This includes the robust product growth for our four wholly earned commercial medicines, delivering $1.24 billion in global net product revenues and hitting the remarkable milestone of over 5,000 patients now on an Alnylam commercial RNAi therapeutic. We also extended our leadership in RNAi, including the first-ever demonstration of RNAi-mediated target gene silencing of a human brain and preclinical data showing for the first time delivery of RNAi therapeutics to adipose and muscle tissues. Zilebesiran also made exciting progress for hypertension with encouraging results in the KARDIA-1 Phase 2 study. Further with zilebesiran, we strengthened our business for the future through business development with a landmark collaboration with Roche. Looking forward, we are excited to continue this progress in 2024, delivering continued commercial execution, notable clinical trial readouts and advancing programs across all stages of development. As you are aware, a key clinical milestone anticipated this year is the readouts from our HELIOS-B Phase 3 study of vutrisiran in patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. As we indicated in our press release this morning, we are announcing a few updates to the analysis plan that we believe will enhance the study, enable the best demonstration of vutrisiran\u2019s impact across the entirety of the patient population and supports a strong and competitive label. Pushkal will walk through these updates in detail later in the call. We believe all of this puts us on track with our Alnylam P5x25 goals, making Alnylam a top-tier biotech developing and commercializing transformative medicines for patients around the world with rare and prevalent diseases driven by a high-yielding pipeline, the first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering exceptional financial results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga? Thanks, Ritu. That\u2019s a great question. And I just want to kind of underscore that we\u2019re really confident on the potential effects of [indiscernible] outcomes and the [indiscernible] was already well designed and executed to deliver these results. And the changes that we\u2019re announcing today enhance an already robust study given how important the study is for patients and for Alnylam. And clearly, as Pushkal said, we consulted with the FDA as we made these changes. It\u2019s important to note that this is study that is focused on outcomes, and it\u2019s outcomes that are most important to physicians, patients and payers. And that\u2019s very different from base scenario assessing endpoints like 6-minute walk test and KCCQ, really, if we\u2019re able to deliver the primary endpoint as we\u2019ve described. We\u2019re confident that this will be a study that should be approved by health authorities. But happy for Pushkal to add any additional color to that. Thanks, Paul. That\u2019s a great question. Look, I mean, these changes were primarily influenced by learnings from APOLLO-B. And important to note, not just the 12-month data, with the open-label extension data at 24 months and beyond. And these data have really informed the enhancements that we\u2019ve announced today. And I think for us, it\u2019s important to make sure we had as much information as we possibly could prior to making any changes before database. And also as Pushkal emphasized, to make sure that we consulted with the FDA and other health authorities and that takes time. So I think we\u2019re in this sweet spot, if you like, between really understanding all the data that we\u2019re going to have prior to database lock and obviously, database lock beyond, which is not possible to make changes. Thanks, Akshay. That\u2019s great. We will have the next question. Yes. No, that\u2019s a great question, Ellie. And as you note, that we took the decision to streamline the secondary point because we really want to focus on the most clinically important end points to support differentiation. We\u2019ve seen evidence of disease stabilization and this doesn\u2019t appear to be true of evidence generated with stabilizers. So we\u2019ve really been thoughtful about what are the endpoints that focus on important clinical learnings and had therefore remove some of the endpoints from the hierarchical structure, but obviously, we will be looking at all those data as exploratory endpoints. But Pushkal, perhaps you could just go through a little bit of specific changes that we\u2019ve made to the secondary endpoints? Thanks, Akshay. Next question, please. Okay. If I heard you correctly, Kostas, I\u2019m trying to understand whether there is any information from the acoramidis study that influenced these changes? And maybe Pushkal, if you can take that question. And then there was a second question around how do these changes influence our views on the commercial opportunity and Tolga, it would be great if you would take that question. So Pushkal? Thanks, Pushkal. Great answer. Tolga? Yes. No, that\u2019s great. And just to add that this is in the context of market that is growing really rapidly. And a market where we know that patients who are on current treatments continue to progress. So, with the profile that Tolga has described, we think we are in a really good position to drive broad commercial uptick of AMVUTTRA and obviously assuming positive results from HELIOS-B and approval. And both in first line, as Tolga described, but also switch from stabilized as we have shown how AMVUTTRA has led to a significant switch in the polyneuropathy market. And we anticipate we will see the same in cardiomyopathy as well with positive data. So, I think the changes that we have made, I think continue to support our confidence in the profile of AMVUTTRA and the potential that will be delivered in the cardiomyopathy market. Next question please. Yes. And just briefly, first question. Look, we will do what we normally do, and we will share p-values on the primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints as well as some qualitative assessment on safety. We will also present information on subgroups such as the tafamidis subgroups. So, I hope that answers that question for you. Tolga, if you could just very briefly respond to I mean take the commercial question. Great. Next question, please. Pushkal, are you going to take this? Great. Okay. Next question. Great. Thank you. Large and longer study. And investments that large and long the study and that is our friend here, then for the patients and solutions ultimately showing a positive outcome. Just before this Pushkal, you and I were looking at the calmative space. And if they would look at month 18, tafamidis was faring worse than placebo for mortality. So, looking at the wrong time point in a study that\u2019s smaller can really lead you a spread and so APOLLO-B was highly informative, but targeting that one or two of the endpoints didn\u2019t line up where the vast majority did. And ultimately, our friend is the largest, longest study that\u2019s ever been conducted and will shortly be completed in ATTR, and that CSB. So, I think getting too over-indexed on one endpoint that went in the wrong direction, you have to be careful about that. Yes, absolutely. That\u2019s great. I think we need to bring the call to a close. I would like to thank everybody for joining us today. As I have said, we are really pleased with the execution. We were looking at 2023, hitting on our 2024 goals and coming [Technical Difficulty] company. So, thank you all and have a great day."

            "content": "Thanks, Pushkal. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to be presenting Alnylam\u2019s full year 2023 financial results and providing our financial guidance for 2024. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for the full year. Total product revenues for 2023 were $1.24 billion or 39% growth versus 2022 with both our TTR and ultra rare franchises reporting strong growth of 35% or greater for the full year. The full year net revenue from collaborations was $546 million, representing more than a fourfold increase compared with 2022 and with the increase being primarily driven by revenue recognized under our co-development and co-commercialization collaboration with Roche as executed in July 2023. Gross margin on product sales was 78% for the full year, representing a 6% decrease compared with 2022, primarily due to increased excess and obsolete charges due to canceling manufacturing commitments and the impairment of ONPATTRO inventory that had been manufactured for future demand associated with the ATTR cardiomyopathy indication for patisiran for which we did not receive regulatory approval in addition to a higher royalty rate payable on net sales of AMVUTTRA. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 15% for the full year, primarily related to increased head count and infrastructure related costs to support our growing pipeline and increased clinical costs driven by Cardio 1 and Cardio, 2, two of our Phase 2 studies in support of our zilebesiran hypertension program. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 6% for the full year, lower than in prior years as we seek to increase the operating leverage associated with our existing commercial and corporate infrastructure. The 6% increase for the year was primarily driven by increased head count related costs and other investments supporting our strategic growth, including the global launch of AMVUTTRA. Our non-GAAP operating loss for 2023 was $60 million, representing a nearly $500 million improvement compared with 2022 primarily driven by strong top line results, both in product sales as well as revenue from collaborations, as I previously highlighted. Delivering non-GAAP operating profit by the end of 2025 remains a key focus for the organization per [indiscernible] by \u201825 goals. Finally, we ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion at the end of 2022 with the increase primarily related to the $310 million upfront payment from our zilebesiran co-development, co-commercialization collaboration with Roche, $100 million from Regeneron for achievement of the ALN-APP proof-of-principle milestone and approximately $150 million from employee option exercises, offset by our operating loss for the year. We continue to believe our current cash balance is sufficient to bridge us to a self-sustainable financial profile. Now I\u2019d like to turn to our financial guidance for 2024. Starting with net product revenues. We are providing combined net product revenue guidance for ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. Our guidance assumes foreign exchange rates as of January 31, 2024, which are noted in the footnote on our guidance slide. We anticipate combined net product revenues for these four products will be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, corresponding to a 13% to 21% growth rate at January 31 FX rates. Consistent with 2023, we are providing constant exchange rate growth guidance for our net product revenues with a projected range of 13% to 21% as well, highlighting no current difference between our guidance using January 31 FX rates and 2023 constant exchange rates. The collaboration and royalty revenue guidance is $325 million to $425 million. We anticipate that collaboration revenue associated with our partnerships with Roche and Regeneron and LEQVIO royalties from Novartis will drive the majority of our collaboration and royalty revenue in 2024. Our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses is a range between $1.675 billion and $1.775 billion, with the midpoint of the guidance range representing 9% growth versus 2023. Growth highlights for R&D expense in 2024 include increased clinical investment in our zilebesiran, TTRS-C04 and APP programs as well as growth in pre-PC and IND-enabling efforts across our preclinical portfolio as we continue to invest in creating new organic growth opportunities for the future. As a reminder, reimbursement from partners for R&D OpEx for some partnered programs highlighted by zilebesiran is accounted for as collaboration revenue. Growth highlights for SG&A expense in 2024 include increased medical and commercial investment as we prepare for the potential launch of vutrisiran in the U.S. for ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones slated for early 2024. We will, of course, be executing on global commercialization of our products, ONPATTRO, AMVUTTRA, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. We also intend to report top line results from the KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study of zilebesiran as well as initiate the KARDIA-3 multi-agent combo study. We also expect three other trial initiations in early 2024, including the Phase 2 study of ALN-APP in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Part B of the Phase 1 study of ALN-KHK in Type 2 diabetes and a Phase 1 study of ALN-BCAT in hepatocellular carcinoma. And as Pushkal previously noted, we expect to report top line results from the HELIOS-B Phase 3 study of vutrisiran in late June or early July. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?"

            "name": "Pushkal Garg",
            "content": "Thank you, Tolga and good morning everyone. I am going to begin with some important updates that we are announcing this morning regarding HELIOS-B. As you know, HELIOS-B is an outcome study, being conducted to expand the label for AMVUTTRA to include the treatment of cardiomyopathy in patients with hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis. Today, ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA are approved to treat polyneuropathy in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with an estimated prevalence of 25,000 to 30,000 patients worldwide. Assuming successful results from the HELIOS-B study and regulatory approval, we expect to expand into a market approximately 10x larger with a global prevalence greater than 300,000 patients. And furthermore, we are committed to continuing to innovate from patients with this disease as we advance ALN-TTRsc04, another medicine that can deliver rapid knockdown with the potential for greater efficacy and once annual dosing through clinical development. Moreover, as illustrated in this graphic for the United States, we expect this already sizable market to continue to grow substantially in the coming years due to increasing disease awareness, earlier diagnosis and the availability of new treatments. Just given these dynamics, we are laser-focused on bringing our industry leading portfolio of potentially transformative therapeutics to ATTR-CM patients and being leaders in this important growth category. Now as we previously highlighted, between now and tafamidis loss of exclusivity anticipated in late 2028, we expect the market to be primarily monotherapy-driven given the cumulative costs of combination therapy. Our research with payers has confirmed that they plan to restrict combination use, given that it would drive substantially higher cost. And even today, with tafamidis and AMVUTTRA have non-overlapping labels, about 90% of commercial plans restrict combination use. More importantly, we have seen very limited instances in which two branded rare disease products are used in combination regardless of the therapeutic area. Assuming positive data from HELIOS-B and regulatory approval, we anticipate that vutrisiran has the potential product profile, including compelling efficacy, safety and a quarterly subcu dosing regimen to become primarily a first line treatment for newly diagnosed ATTR-CM patients and a switch therapy for those who experienced disease progression with stabilizers and to be combined with the stabilizer in those limited situations where payers support access. Once tafamidis goes generic and again, pending the label, we believe that combination therapy will become more common. With this backdrop in mind, let\u2019s now turn to HELIOS-B, why we are confident it\u2019s poised for success and the endpoint refinements that we are announcing today. The reasons for our continued confidence are summarized here. The impact of TTR silencing with an RNAi therapeutic on cardiomyopathy was demonstrated in the 12-month APOLLO-B study. We believe these data are exceedingly informative and support the potential for vutrisiran to demonstrate an outcomes benefit in HELIOS-B. On functional outcomes such as 6-minute walk test as well as quality of life, we saw evidence of disease stabilization over time. We also saw a profound impact on NT-proBnP troponin, which are highly validated indicators of disease severity and prognosis. These four parameters, all of which showed the greatest magnitude of effect in the monotherapy setting are important predictors of cardiovascular outcomes, which we would expect to manifest in a larger and longer study like HELIOS-B. And accordingly, as we shared at AHA last November, we were encouraged to see a favorable trend in mortality that separated beginning as early as 9 months and continuing to expand over 24 months. While not powered for mortality, the hazard ratio at 24 months was 0.67 favoring patisiran and the benefits were seen in both the monotherapy and combination settings. We find these data very compelling as while APOLLO-B was too short and too small to establish an outcomes benefit and impact on mortality appeared to occur earlier than seen in other ATTR-CM studies to-date was durable and in fact, grew over time, despite crossover of all patients to active treatment at 12 months. Now moving on to HELIOS-B itself, the study is designed and powered to deliver outcomes and is twice as large and 3x as long as APOLLO-B. Previous studies have shown that intervention in ATTR cardiomyopathy most benefits patients with NYHA Class 1 and 2 and the HELIOS-B study is enriched specifically for these patients as they are most likely to show the largest treatment effect. And HELIOS-B provides the longest follow-up of any study conducted in ATTR cardiomyopathy to-date. The study was conservatively powered at the outset with additional tailwinds that include over enrollment by 10% and tafamidis based on the drop in rates that are below the expectations of use to power the study. In fact, the tafamidis rates at baseline were 40%, substantially less than the 50% we had assumed when powering the study. So putting all this together, we have several key takeaways. First, existing plan restrictions and prior precedents suggest that for the next several years, the market is expected to be primarily monotherapy driven. And second, we have data from APOLLO-B that demonstrate substantial effects on multiple endpoints that provide evidence of a differentiated profile with disease stabilization, along with evidence of an early emerging benefit mortality. And finally and as expected, the treatment effect in APOLLO-B was shown to be largest in the monotherapy population, which was the dominant population of the study and best suited to demonstrate the treatment benefits of patisiran. Today, we are announcing enhancements to the HELIOS-B statistical plan to optimize the study for success and a strong and competitive label. These changes are informed by the insights from the APOLLO-B data and emerging data from the field. With these optimizations, we remain focused on clinical outcomes of death and hospitalization, which are critical to all stakeholders, the plan to evaluate this in the overall population as well as the monotherapy population, which is expected to have the largest treatment effect and best demonstrate the drug\u2019s true impact. We also are focusing the secondary endpoint structure on critical clinical elements that highlight the drug\u2019s potentially differentiated profile and its benefits on stabilization of this progressive disease. And we are enhancing the overall statistical powering of the study by incorporating up to an additional 3 months of event collection at the tail end of the study period. The most critical period and firmly establishing HELIOS-B as the longest placebo-controlled study conducted to-date in ATTR-CM. Let me review the key changes one by one. First, we are sharing today that we are increasing the minimum follow-up in the study from 30 to 33 months with variable follow-up to 36 months. This adds up to 3 months of event collection for the patients who enrolled later in the study thereby providing greater statistical power. With these changes, approximately 60% of patients remaining on study will have greater follow-up, with about 20% or a third more having follow-up all the way out to month 36. This is an important change as these 3 additional months of observation constitute a short, but meaningful prolongation during the critical late part of the study, which is when we expect to see the greatest number of outcome events happening in the placebo arm. As a result, this enhancement leads to greater study power as we know that survival curves typically diverge more and more over time, a phenomenon that was seen in the 24-month APOLLO-B data as well. Second, we are modifying the methodology used to analyze the primary endpoint. The primary outcome measure remains the composite of all-cause mortality in recurrent cardiovascular events. This will now be tested in parallel in two populations, the overall population and the monotherapy population that is the subgroup of patients not on tafamidis at baseline. We are maintaining the analysis in the overall population, which has the largest sample size and an opportunity to show a broad effect across the full patient spectrum. We are confident that there is a combo effect as demonstrated by the fact that the overall population remains in the primary end point. In parallel, we are elevating an analysis of the composite in the monotherapy population, which constitutes the majority of the study population at 60%. Additionally, the analysis in the monotherapy population allows us to demonstrate the true impact of vutrisiran as the standalone treatment, providing a dataset that will be particularly relevant to patients, prescribers and others as it closely aligns with where we see the treatment landscape over the next several years. It\u2019s important to note that these are not co-primary endpoints. Rather the primary endpoint will be tested in parallel in both populations such that if each p-value is less than or equal to 0.05 and statistical significance can be claimed for both. Alternatively, the study will be declared a positive study either of the p-values for the two analyses is less than or equal to 0.025. This study will be deemed positive in both or either of the analyses achieved the predefined criteria for statistical significance. Based on our assumptions, as informed by APOLLO-B and other studies as well as the conduct and execution of HELIOS-B, we remain confident about HELIOS-B and its ability to deliver a positive result. Finally, we have streamlined the secondary endpoints. Specifically, the structure now includes 6-minute walk test, KCCQ OS, all cause mortality and change from baseline in NYHA Class. These endpoints are considered clinically meaningful and will help to demonstrate the impact of vutrisiran on disease stabilization and including them as formal secondary endpoints enables them to potentially be included in the label and support differentiation in the marketplace. Based on the three optimizations I\u2019ve just outlined, here is the updated study design. I do want to note that the changes I have shared today were made after consultation with the FDA and other health authorities. We are supportive of this approach, particularly as it relates to the handling of the primary endpoint. With the 3-month extension in the overall study duration we are sharing today the top line results are now expected in late June or early July. At that time, we plan to provide p-values on the primary and secondary end points as well as key details regarding safety. We also expect to provide some high-level information on subgroups, including patients on baseline tafamidis. Full results are expected to be presented at a scientific congress soon thereafter. Assuming positive results from HELIOS-B, we expect to submit a supplemental NDA to the FDA in late 2024. We are confident that the study updates I\u2019ve just reviewed, refinements to endpoints and extension of the blinded study period further enhance the power of the study and our confidence that HELIOS-B will deliver a positive result. Assuming positive data and regulatory approval, we believe that vutrisiran will be well positioned to serve patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy, addressing unmet needs with the potential for a highly competitive market-leading profile, including a unique mechanism of action that works upstream of protein production and enables rapid knockdown of TTR, an impactful clinical profile with the potential to reduce mortality and CV hospitalizations and helping exorable decline in functional capacity and quality of life, an attractive quarterly dosing schedule that aligns with physician visits, support strong adherence and provides the flexibility of in-office or at-home dose administration, and favorable payer dynamics, where coverage under Medicare Part B is expected to result in the majority of patients having zero out-of-pocket costs and where we also expect payers to favor monotherapies for the next several years. We look forward to sharing top line results from HELIOS-B in the late June to early July timeframe, bringing this transformative medicine one step closer to patients. Let me now turn to some recent and exciting developments with ALN-APP in development for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The early clinical data from this program continue to be very encouraging. At CTAD, we presented data showing that single doses of ALN-APP achieved sustained pharmacodynamic activity up to 10 months after administration with marked reductions in A beta 42 and A beta 40, Amyloid fragments implicated in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and CAA respectively, as well as an encouraging safety profile. As we announced in our press release today, we are very pleased to share that the FDA has provided clearance to initiate the multi-dose Part B of the Phase 1 study in the United States. This decision came after we submitted additional non-clinical data as well as emerging clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1 study. The FDA has confirmed that multiple dosing in the Phase 1 study may proceed at doses as high as 180 milligrams every 6 months, while a partial clinical hold remains for doses that are higher or more frequent than that. We are delighted by the FDA\u2019s decision and are encouraged that we will be able to proceed in Phase 1 with multiple doses at levels up to and even exceeding all the dose levels that we plan to test in Part B of the study based on the high and sustained levels of knockdown that we have already seen with single doses of 75 milligrams in Part A. Let me now move on to recent \u2013 to highlight recent progress across the rest of the pipeline. For zilebesiran, we presented the KARDIA Phase 2 results, which demonstrated over 16 millimeters of placebo-adjusted reduction in 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure at 3 months after a single dose with an encouraging safety and tolerability profile. On ALN-TTRsc04, we recently shared single dose data, which showed deep and rapid knockdown with mean serum TTR reduction up to 97% with durability supporting the potential for annual dosing. We also announced positive initial results from the Phase 1 study of ALN-KHK with robust target engagement and encouraging safety that supported continued development as a novel treatment for Type 2 diabetes. And wrapping up on the pipeline, we announced several exciting updates from our research portfolio at our R&D Day, including progress with extrahepatic delivery of RNAi to muscle and adipose, compelling new targets in areas of high unmet need and advancement of RNAi in oncology with a Phase 1 study for ALN-BCAT, hepatocellular carcinoma on track to initiate early this year. And this progress is accelerating as we plan to file proprietary INDs for nine programs by the end of 2025 against targets in the liver, CNS, muscle and adipose. If we include partnered programs, we anticipate 15 new INDs by the end of 2025, representing a doubling of the Alnylam clinical pipeline by the end of next year. This remarkable and unique pace of innovation puts us in a great position to have a robust, self-sustainable pipeline that can deliver meaningful impact to patients across multiple disease areas. And with that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff? No, I think, Yvonne, you\u2019ve really covered it. Ritu, I think we remain focused on both the overall population. And what we\u2019re doing today is highlighting that based on all the learnings from APOLLO-B and in terms of delivering a strong and competitive label and aligning with what is \u2013 where we see the market being for the next several years that we\u2019ve elevated our analysis of the monotherapy group. And as I mentioned, as Yvonne has highlighted, we\u2019ve made these adjustments after consultation with FDA and other health authorities. And so we think that will support an approvable package. Yes. I think building on what you said, Yvonne. Paul, I think, look, it makes sense for us to have the maximum amount of information before we make changes to an analysis plan as we\u2019re announcing today. These are not changes in the operational conduct of the study \u2013 there to the analytic plan. And again, it makes the most sense to have as much information that\u2019s come out of APOLLO-B. We\u2019ve gotten \u2013 we were in a very fortunate position to run that study and gotten all the information that we did out of that study on a variety of endpoints to have that extended follow-up and then to have the opportunity to align with health authorities. Paul, what I\u2019d say is that what we\u2019ve seen in the long-term data, and we presented some data last fall at the AdCom and then I think at HFSA are really encouraging to us in both populations, frankly, as it relates to outcomes, right? If you look at the monotherapy group, what we\u2019ve seen was really sizable effects on a variety of endpoints, as I highlighted in my opening remarks, on a variety of endpoints that predict outcomes. And we saw a mortality separation. And as we\u2019ve looked also in the combination group over time, what we saw was favorable effects on outcomes there as well. And so I think both of this just builds into our confidence. But I think certainly, what we\u2019re seeing in monotherapy. And again, this is not just APOLLO-B, when we look back at the original APOLLO study when we look at HELIOS-A. All of this really highlights a very compelling effect. When you look at that overall hazard ratio for mortality was 0.67 at 24 months in the overall population. So we have a lot of confidence in what we\u2019re seeing here. And we think these refinements to the analysis plan will only optimize the study for success in getting a strong and competitive label. Yes, absolutely. So Ellie, what we\u2019ve done is \u2013 obviously, the primary as we talked about, remains a focus on outcomes of death and recurrent CV events that we will be looking in the two populations. Then going down, we put 6-minute walk test in KCCQ next. We think we have ample power for those, and we think those are great endpoints based on what we learned from APOLLO-B to really demonstrate what we seem to see \u2013 be seeing is in terms of differentiated profile. Whereas patients on an RNAi therapeutic appear to have disease stabilization over an extended period of time. And while no head-to-head, it looks very different than the progressive decline that we\u2019ve seen now in two pivotal trials with stabilizer therapies. And so we look forward to hopefully seeing those patterns emerge again in HELIOS-B. The third endpoint is all-cause mortality. Obviously, that\u2019s a higher bar than the primary endpoint. But again, based on what we\u2019re seeing and while the study is primarily powered for the composite, we think it\u2019s important to be able to demonstrate to look for all-cause mortality. And so we will be testing that formally in the secondary endpoint structure. And last, we\u2019ve added an endpoint of NYHA class because we saw some very encouraging data merging out of APOLLO-B that suggested that, again, consistent with an emerging profile that this class of drugs can actually delay disease progression and stabilize the disease that we may see benefits on NYHA class. And we think all of those are clinically important differentiating factors that may \u2013 that we want to make sure that we look at with the potential to include them in the label and differentiate in the marketplace. Sure. Kostas, I think \u2013 look I think what was \u2013 a couple of things that we took away from looking at the attribute data that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, I think first and foremost, I think it\u2019s important to note that study as well as APOLLO-B for that matter. Enrolled patients in a contemporary era where we know patients are being diagnosed earlier in their disease through noninvasive means as opposed to what was done in the original ATTRACT trial. And what it showed is that patients in those earlier stages of disease can continue to grow events at a precipitous rate if they are not treated and that an effective therapy can show a benefit on top of that. Second of all, it also showed sort of confirming what was seen in the original ATTRACT study that patients with earlier stages of disease like NYHA Class 1 and 2 appear to have the largest magnitude of effect, right? And three, as we\u2019ve seen in lots of different outcomes trials, not just in this disease, but right, the longer exposure leads to greater separation of curves, right? And so all of those things were learnings that we learned and that patients with \u2013 on stabilizers continue to decline month by month in terms of functional ability and quality of life. And so \u2013 on average. And so I think \u2013 all of those are aspects that we look at, again, and sort of we\u2019re in \u2013 to help inform some of the choices we made, in particular, but most importantly, it was the APOLLO-B results as well. As we look at them, again, no head-to-head studies, but we see a contrast in terms of the profile that\u2019s emerging here of these classes of medicines and the end points and refinements we made really to use the opportunity to extend the double-blind period so that we can increase study power, to optimize the study endpoints \u2013 the primary endpoint structure to allow us to elevate the monotherapy and include secondary endpoints that can elaborate on some of those potential points of differentiation and disease stabilization that these other datasets seem to suggest. Yes. Jessica, thanks for the question. Look, I think it\u2019s important to note this was not a head-to-head study looking at AMVUTTRA versus tafamidis. This is a study looking at AMVUTTRA or patisiran versus placebo where a proportion of the patients, 40% are on background tafamidis. And so really, the comparisons are AMVUTTRA placebo in those two situations. And as we have said, the primary analysis will be looking at this in the two populations, the blended population of overall as well as the monotherapy population. Yes. Luca, let me take your second point first. There is no change to the operational conduct of the study. This was just a change in the statistical analysis plan. And we outlined in the slides really how the statistics around the primary endpoints are going to be analyzed. So, there is no statistical penalty for that at all. It\u2019s just a change to the analytic plan that we have talked about, so no, not at all. And with regard to the first question, I think as trying to highlight the changes are really driven by what we have seen with APOLLO-B over 2-plus years. And the patterns that we are seeing there and our heightened confidence in terms of the impact of this class of medicines on this disease and what we can do to further optimize the study and set it up well for a strong and competitive label. Of course, we have, as we have said before, have teams that are looking at the blinded data primarily to ensure excellent study conduct and execution, make sure the right patients are enrolled, make sure that the data are clean, make sure that we have got a complete capture of all the events, etcetera. And of course, they are looking at event rates, etcetera. But we are not going to be sharing dribs and drabs the data, and that\u2019s not the driver here. Those types of events rates are extremely variable \u2013 subject to a lot of variability and interpretation. If I told you we had a very high event rate, you might say, well, that\u2019s because that\u2019s great. The placebo event patients are accruing events or you might say, wow, the drug is not working, or conversely, if we have a low event rate that might indicate that, oh, we don\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t enrolled the right patients or maybe the drug is working remarkably well. So, the primary drivers here are what we understand about science, biology and prior precedent from clinical medicine and clinical trials. And that\u2019s the driver. Yes, absolutely. So, Salveen, look, I think what we have done here is we think meaningfully add to the duration of the study or the experience in the study in the tail end. And what we have done is actually for patients who are on the back end of the study, which is where the most \u2013 the greatest events accrue in the placebo arm and where you see the cause [ph] diverge, we have added exposure. It turns out that 60% of patients will actually have additional exposure in the study. And about a third of those, 20% more will actually complete all the way up to 36 months, which is when patients roll over into open-label extension. And so we really \u2013 and we think that, that critical addition, frankly, becomes a no-brainer for us, and it\u2019s an important way to further add to study power. So, that\u2019s why that was done. And again, based on all the trends we have seen in APOLLO-B, which \u2013 where we start to see separation as we have highlighted much, much earlier, we \u2013 it\u2019s just \u2013 we think this is a great enhancement that we were able to institute in the study. With regard to your question around monotherapy and all-cause mortality, look, I think it\u2019s really important to just remember that in cardiovascular disease, we have about 40 years or 50 years of doing outcome studies and they typically focus on MACE type of endpoints, which include death and hospitalization. And the reason that, that\u2019s been the focus and accepted by regulators and by the clinical community is because, in general, those events all go hand-in-hand. Hospitalization events, predict mortality and doing mortality alone studies typically are \u2013 tend to be inefficient. They are too large and too long, and we need to get therapies to patients. So, we have designed a study that is focused on death and hospitalization, and we expect to show a positive result in that study. As well as we will of course, have the breakdown of events under those two, and we expect them to go in a consistent manner, which is what you would expect to see based on the biology and precedent in almost every other cardiovascular outcomes trial that\u2019s been done. Yes. So, Gena, in terms of your questions, the \u2013 as we have said, our TAP drop-in rates are lower than we expected. Obviously, when we designed the study to, we are very encouraged by that. That represents another tailwind that supports the success in the powering of the study. And so I can\u2019t get into any more specifics other than that, but to tell you that that\u2019s \u2013 we are encouraged by those data. In terms of the additional follow-up, maybe what I can clarify is those are changes relative to what the study looked like when it was a 30-month to 36-month follow-up study. And so what we are seeing is \u2013 and of course, what we are focusing on is patients who remain on study. Throughout the study, we have had patients, for example, who have passed away because of their disease, etcetera. And so what we are saying is that in the patients who remain on study, approximately 60% of them will have some extension of their follow-up in the study and roughly a third of those or 20% additional will get to the full \u2013 the full 36 months. So, I hope that clarifies. Yes. Maury, I think what I would say is a couple of things. First of all, I think it\u2019s widely accepted that death and hospitalization are incredibly clinically relevant endpoints, and so there is no sort of minimum threshold there. Obviously, there is always benefit risk. But in general, any benefit in terms of death and hospitalization is considered clinically significant, is very different than scenarios of looking at NT-proBNP or six-minute walk test or things like that. And as we have said, what we are committing to in the primary \u2013 in the top line results is we will provide p-values on the primary and secondary endpoints, we will provide a statement on safety, and we will make \u2013 we will provide information on relevant subgroups, including the TAP subgroup. And of course, we will be providing a lot more data as is our custom, we tend to be quite transparent with our data at scientific and congresses, etcetera, thereafter. Yes. Mike, maybe just to clarify a couple of points, right. I think first of all, what we are saying is that we \u2013 when we look at the monotherapy data, it\u2019s \u2013 you are looking at the effects of \u2013 effect of one drug and certainly comparing that to placebo. And so those placebo patients tend to decline, and it gives the cleanest perspective on the impact that your drug is having, right. And what we have seen out of APOLLO-B, like, was really quite potent substantial effects on the four key powered endpoints that we looked at in that study, six-minute walk test, KCCQ, NT-proBNP and troponin that were sizable and durable. We also saw benefits on mortality as we have been talking about. Some people have brought up some of the data around time to event or \u2013 and the recurrent CV events. And I would just point out that, one, it\u2019s one endpoint out of all. So, I think you would have to kind of question why that would be the case, and if that makes any clinical or biologic sense. Moreover, when we look at those data, actually, the lack of apparent separation was due to a few early events that happened in the patisiran arm in the first three months. And if you look beyond three months, in the first three months, the drug is just starting to take effect. Beyond three months, we actually see good separation even in the monotherapy group even on outcomes and recurrent CV events specifically. So, I think all of that bodes very well. And as it relates to combination, as we have said along, we are very encouraged. But certainly, just like you see in blood pressure medicines or other things when you start to combine effective therapeutics together with different mechanisms of action, it can change the magnitude of effect that you might detect. But everything that we are seeing coming out of APOLLO-B suggest that there will be an effect there, and it\u2019s most visibly seen by the outcomes data that we talked about in that study. Yes. Well, no, I think what I would take away from today is that the changes we make really we think we have actually enhanced the overall statistical power of the study by adding an extra follow-up for those patients. At the tail end of the study, we think we have added \u2013 we certainly have added statistical power there. And the way that we have constructed this endpoint, which again remains focused on the most critical endpoint, which is outcomes, we were allowed to \u2013 we were able to look now in the full totality of the population, 660-plus patients in the combination \u2013 in the overall as well as \u2013 the way I would think about it an enriched population of the monotherapy patients, who we expect to be \u2013 have the largest treatment effect and the purist demonstration of what vutrisiran can accomplish in this and do in this disease. And so we really think we have \u2013 that\u2019s really what we have done here. And so we don\u2019t think that we have, in any way, made it harder. We think that we have actually made the study better and aligned it where, as Tolga highlighted, where we think the market is going to be for the next several years."

            "name": "Akshay Vaishnaw",
            "content": "Yes. Let me just jump in as well, Paul. This is Akshay. I think if we stand back and look just to put some numbers to what Pushkal has mentioned, in APOLLO itself, a hazard ratio for mortality 0.5:3. And that showed up as early as 6 months and then the curve started separating. In APOLLO-B, the hazard ratio for mortalities was 0.36 at 12 months, both in the monotherapy as well as [indiscernible], patisiran 1 is 0.67, as you said at 24 months. And this is now APOLLO-B, that\u2019s half the size and changes showing up at 9 months and continue to separate since then. So I think the changes we\u2019ve made today, I\u2019m glad you agree why and a 3-month addition to further increase the robustness of the encouraging data we already see from APOLLO and APOLLO-B, I think just further consolidates that we anticipate a positive study, and we\u2019re confident about that. And today\u2019s changes just further attest to our confidence in our approach. So I\u2019ll leave it at that, but I hope that makes sense folks. Yes. And just building off that last point in Pushkal, I think you went through the different endpoints very carefully. From our perspective, we\u2019re focusing on the most stringent outcomes, whether it\u2019s mortality, hospitalization, quality of life, new [indiscernible]. This is what matters to us. It will show the true impact of this drug and it\u2019s what matters to patients and doctors. And ultimately, we hope to get this into the label. And you note that we\u2019ve avoided putting things like BNP and other endpoints, which we could have put in but we want to focus on the strongest outcomes. And I hope that\u2019s a surrogate for the confidence we feel in what we can achieve with vutrisiran. So I\u2019ll leave it at that. Let me just add, Pushkal. I think we will go to stand back a little bit. It\u2019s obviously in Alnylam\u2019s interest for patients and for everybody concerned to show definitive outcome for vutrisiran. If there had been mass panic at Alnylam, that the study design is wrong or too small or too short, there are many changes we could have made, and we could have made them well in advance. We have reiterated our confidence over and over again in the study, which was outlined today, deep insights from APOLLO-B, understanding the landscape. And what you see today is a three-month extension for the last patient giving a reasonable amount of additional data, just further enhance the robustness of what we are going to share with the world come June, July. So, I think it\u2019s well worth it. It reiterates our confidence in this study. And we haven\u2019t fundamentally changed the design to a 1,500 patients or 2,000 patients study for 5 years. If we were panicked, you would have seen those things some time ago. Others have done what they have done. You have seen what we have done. And on the backdrop of the scientific edits we have built with the TTR mechanism in APOLLO, in APOLLO-B, I think we should have the confidence. And as to the kinetics of the effects of either patisiran or vutrisiran for that matter, it\u2019s quite clear that the onset is \u2013 appears to be much more rapid than has been seen in other trials with other drugs. So, for example, in the original APOLLO with patisiran, by six months, you are seeing the separation post of analysis, but you are seeing a separation in mortality and hospitalization. The same was true in APOLLO-B emerging at nine months. When you look at recent studies in the ATTR-CM space, it\u2019s nothing like that. And my point is that more timely are further attested to by the time separation of six-minute walk distance or KCCQ, which also promptly occurred within the first few months of the study. So, I think not just the magnitude of effect that the kinetics of how our drugs work by depleting the pathogenic protein, which certainly in the [indiscernible] seems to be very potent way to treat the disease, will undoubtedly show the impact, I think ultimately and towards\u2026 Yes. We are going to have a much larger study with HELIOS-B and on the\u2026 Absolutely."

Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks Christine and thank you everyone for joining the call today. In the third quarter of 2023, we continue to make great progress across our business, while also experiencing a disappointment. As we announced last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to approve the supplemental New Drug Application for Patisiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic that was in development for the treatment of the cardiomyopathy of ATTR amyloidosis. As we have conveyed, we're extremely disappointed with this outcome, particularly with regard to the needs of patients, many of whom spoke at the Advisory Committee Meeting in September. We have been steadfastly committed to this underserved application for over a decade and remain confident in our long-term strategy to building a leading TTR franchise with Patisiran and the HELIOS-B Study serving as a very important next step in this journey. We look forward to sharing those top line results which remain on track for early 2024. As we continue to progress our plans in ATTR cardiomyopathy, our commercial strength in the third quarter was driven by the ongoing successful launch of AMVUTTRA in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. This contributed to a 35% year-over-year growth in total net product revenues compared to the third quarter of 2022. We also delivered important clinical updates from key pipeline programs in the third quarter. In September, we announced positive top line results in the KARDIA-1 Phase 2 dose ranging study of zilebesiran, which demonstrated greater than 15 mmHg reduction of systolic blood pressure at three months of treatment compared to placebo, as well as an encouraging safety and tolerability profile in adult patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Additionally, the results also reflected sustained reductions of systolic blood pressure at six months, supporting the potential for quarterly or biannual dosing. We also shared updated positive interim results from the Phase 1 study of ALN-APP in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease, which showed rapid and robust target engagement with sustained effects out to 10 months with a single dose and an encouraging clinical safety and tolerability profile. Additionally, we presented data from the APOLLO-B study of patisiran at HFSA showing that the effects of patisiran treatment on 6- minute walk test and KCCQ were maintained through 24 months of treatment. This type of relative stabilization in what is otherwise a steadily progressive disease is very encouraging and further bolsters our confidence in PTSD. We're thrilled to have had these results published in the New England Journal of Medicine just a few weeks ago, which is accompanied by a favorable editorial highlighting the step forward represented by RNAi therapeutics in this disease. Lastly, we're excited to have achieved the third place ranking in Science Magazine's top employer survey for 2023. This marks the fifth year that our Alnylam was featured as one of the top three companies in their annual survey of industry professionals. We are poised to deliver a couple more pipeline updates by the end of the year, including top line Phase 1 results for ALN-TTRsc04 as well as ALN-KHK, our investigational RNAi therapeutics for type 2 diabetes. And I encourage you all to save the date and tune into our Annual R&D Day, which will be held virtually on December the 13th, where we will discuss all of the exciting progress across our pipeline and platform. We believe all of this puts us on track with our Alnylam P5x25 goals making Alnylam a top tier biotech developing and commercializing transformative medicines for patients around the world with rare diseases and beyond, driven by a high yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering exceptional financial results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for review of our commercial performance. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks, Yvonne, and good morning everyone. Q3 was another strong quarter for our commercial portfolio with both our TTR franchise driven by another robust quarter of AMVUTTRA performance in the U.S. market and our Ultra-Rare franchise delivering growth in excess of 30% compared with the prior year, as we continue to steadily increase the number of patients on all of our therapies. Total net product revenues grew 35% year-over-year for the third quarter or 33% at a constant exchange rate. Let me now turn to a summary of our third quarter TTR performance. Our TTR franchise achieved $230 million in global net product revenues for ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA representing a 3% increase compared with the second quarter and 35% growth compared with the third quarter of 2022. At the end of the third quarter, more than 3790 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA treatment worldwide, up from over 3490 patients at the end of the second quarter, representing 8% quarterly patient growth. Now let me provide highlights of our U.S. and international TTR performance. In the U.S. combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased by 11% compared with the second quarter and a robust 47% year-over-year driven by AMVUTTRA's launch. The U.S. growth was primarily driven by the following. A 6% increase in demand, which was driven by the strength of ongoing AMVUTTRA patient uptake, more than offsetting a decrease in ONPATTRO patients that switched to AMVUTTRA. At the end of the third quarter, more than 80% of Alnylam USP care [ph] patients are now on AMVUTTRA, a positive sign indicating how well the product profile has been received by both prescribing physicians and patients. In addition to the demand growth, reported growth was also favorably impacted by approximately 5% due to an increase in AMVUTTRA inventory in the distribution channel. Now let me turn to our international markets where TTR franchise growth decreased by 7% compared with the second quarter. Although there was growth in patients on therapy during the quarter, this growth was offset by a variety of factors including price adjustments in Germany following the end of the six-month free pricing period, inventory destocking in Japan and the timing of orders in emerging and partner markets. It is worth noting that we have now launched AMVUTTRA in all major international markets following recent launches in Spain and Italy. I'm proud of the efforts of our Market Access team as we have made AMVUTTRA available to patients and secured reimbursements significantly faster than industry benchmarks. Now moving to our Ultra-Rare products and the performance of GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, which delivered $83 million in combined product sales during the third quarter, representing a 1% increase compared with the second quarter and a solid 33% growth compared with the third quarter of 2022. We ended the quarter with more than 1000 patients on our two Ultra-Rare products, an exciting milestone with more than 625 patients on GIVLAARI commercial therapy and more than 375 patients on OXLUMO commercial therapy, representing 8% combined quarterly growth in patients on our Ultra-Rare products compared with the second quarter 2023. For GIVLAARI product sales declined 6% in Q3 compared with the second quarter with the following regional dynamics. A 5% increase in demand in the U.S. market driven by an increase in patients on therapy, a 25% decrease in our international markets driven by the timing of orders in emerging and partner markets, where as we previously indicated Q2 results benefited from a large order and higher gross to net deductions. For OXLUMO, we delivered a robust 19% increase in product sales compared with the second quarter, which was driven by the following. A 10% increase in the U.S. driven by 16% demand growth, partially offset by a reduction of inventory in the distribution channel, a 23% increase in our international markets driven by increased demand and the timing of orders in our emerging and partner markets. We were pleased with the results in the quarter, particularly the strong patient growth with both our TTR and Ultra-Rare franchises delivering an 8% increase in patients on therapy during the quarter as well as delivering robust year-over-year growth in revenues with both franchises growing in excess of 30%. As we look ahead to the end of the year, we anticipate a strong fourth quarter positioning us to end the year at the approximate midpoint of our net product revenue guidance range. With that, I will now turn it over to Pushkal to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal ?\nPushkal Garg: Thanks, Tolga, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our TTR franchise. As you know, we have two products approved for the polyneuropathy of hereditary ATR amyloidosis, ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA. We have also been pursuing expansion into ATTR cardiomyopathy through two large studies, APOLLO-B for patisiran and HELIOS-B for vutrisiran. As previously announced, while APOLLO-B delivered positive results, not just on the primary endpoint, but consistently across additional secondary and exploratory endpoints as well, all with a positive safety profile, the FDA declined to approve the SNDA for patisiran, citing insufficient evidence of clinical meaningfulness. As a result of this decision and with the top line readout from HELIOS-B expected in early 2024, we have elected not to invest further into additional development to secure approval for patisiran in ATTR cardiomyopathy in the United States. The positive data on multiple aspects of ATTR cardiomyopathy coming out of the APOLLO-B study reaffirm our confidence and success of HELIOS-B. In particular, the 24-month data show that both 6-minute walk test and KCCQ were relatively stable over the entire period in contrast to the large expected decline expected in this disease and suggest the potential that RNAi mediated TTR silencing may result in a differentiated efficacy profile in this disease. The HELIOS-B study is designed and powered to demonstrate a benefit of vutrisiran in patients very similar to those studies in APOLLO-B on the composite outcome of all 'cause mortality and recurrent cardiovascular events over a 30 to 36-month period. The study is on track to read out in early 2024 and assuming positive data, we then plan to seek a label expansion for AMVUTTRA and if approved ultimately launch that medicine into the growing market of patients around the world with wild type or hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. We believe that the convenient quarterly subcutaneous dosing regimen with a therapeutic profile that includes cardiovascular outcomes data in its label could potentially position AMVUTTRA as a transformative therapy with a market leading profile for patients with this disease. Moving on, following announcement of initial human proof-of-concept data on ALN-APP, our RNAi therapeutic design for CNS delivery, which is in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, we are excited by the positive results we've seen from the Phase 1 study to date. At the clinical trials on Alzheimer's Disease Conference a few weeks ago, we've presented additional positive interim results from the Phase 1 study in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease. At the time of this interim look, 20 patients had been enrolled in three single dose cohorts in Part A of the ongoing Phase 1 study. To date, we've studied 3 dose levels, 25, 50 and 75 mg, with four to six patients dosed in each cohort. Excitingly, ALN-APP treatment resulted in rapid dose dependent and sustained reductions, both soluble APP Alpha and Beta biomarkers of target engagement in the CSF. We saw rapid knockdown as early as day 15 and observed peak mean reduction of 69% and 82% respectively for soluble APP Alpha and soluble APP Beta. Reduction was sustained with a mean reduction of 33% and 39% respectively for soluble APP Alpha and Beta ten months after a single 75 mg dose.\nAb42: The safety of single doses of ALN-APP has been encouraging as well. All adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and CSF parameters have not revealed any significant abnormalities to date. Further exploration of single doses of ALN-APP is ongoing in Part A. In addition, Part B, the multiple dose part of the study has been initiated in Canada and has now also received all required approvals to proceed in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. A multiple dose part of the study remains on partial clinical hold in the United States due to findings observed in prior nonclinical chronic toxicology studies. In sum, I'm thrilled about these impressive human data showing the potential for RNAI to silence disease causing transcripts in the CNS and look forward to providing additional program updates in the future. Let me now turn to recent progress with zilebesiran in development for the treatment of hypertension. We are very excited to have reported positive top line results from the KARDIA-1 Phase 2 dose-ranging study. In KARDIA-1 zilebesiran met the primary endpoint demonstrating a dose dependent clinically significant reduction in 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring at month three, achieving a placebo subtracted reduction greater than 15 mmHg mercury with both 300 mg and 600 mg doses. The study also met key secondary endpoints, including significant change in 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure as measured by ABPM at month six, as well as significant change in office synthetic blood pressure at months three and six all zilebesiran arms compared to placebo. The study results indicate zilebesiran was associated with dose dependent, potent and durable knockdown of serum AGT levels through month six. Importantly, zilebesiran demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability profile. We look forward to sharing complete results for KARDIA-1 at the upcoming AHA Scientific sessions this month and we remain on track to deliver top line results from the KARDIA-2 Phase 2 combination study of zilebesiran in early 2024. Before I wrap up, I'd like to briefly update on one of our partnered programs, fitusiran, which is in development for the treatment of hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors. Sanofi just reported encouraging safety and efficacy data for the anti-thrombin based dosing regimen in a Phase 3 study and indicated they are currently in discussions with the FDA regarding filing an NDA in 2024. These are just a few highlights from a broad and innovative pipeline, driven by our underlying organic product engine, that we expect will deliver sustainable innovation and represents a key growth driver for Alnylam in the years to come. With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff?\nAb40: The safety of single doses of ALN-APP has been encouraging as well.

With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff?\nJeff Poulton: Thanks, Pushkal and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam's Q3 2023 financial results and discussing our full year guidance. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for Q3 2023. Total product revenues for the quarter were $313 million or 35% growth versus Q3 2022. As Tolga previously mentioned, the increase was driven by strong growth from our TTR and Ultra-Rare franchises with both reporting growth greater than 30% during the quarter compared with the prior year. Our reported results in the quarter benefited modestly from foreign exchange as constant exchange rate product sales growth was 2% lower at 33%. Net revenue from collaborations for the third quarter was $427 million representing nearly a $400 million increase from Q3 2022, primarily due to increases in revenue from our zilebesiran co-development and co-commercialization collaboration with Roche, which included full recognition of the $310 million upfront payment received in the third quarter as well as $65 million in revenue in connection with our Regeneron collaboration. The $65 million represents the portion of revenue recognized from a $100 million milestone earned from achieving certain criteria during early clinical development for our CNS program ALN-APP. Royalty revenue during the quarter was $10 million, which was driven by Novartis sales of Leqvio, which continued to increase following launch in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2022. Gross margin on product sales was 75% in Q3, representing a 10% decrease compared with the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to a Q3 write-off of ONPATTRO inventory that had been manufactured for future demand associated with the ATTR cardiomyopathy indication for patisiran for which we did not receive regulatory approval. Recall that I mentioned on our ONPATTRO CRL investor call on October 9th that we expect ONPATTRO demand to decrease on a go forward basis as AMVUTTRA continues to cannibalize existing ONPATTRO polyneuropathy business in markets where AMVUTTRA has launched. As a result for 2024 we anticipate ONPATTRO product sales will be in the $200 million to $225 million range. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 16% in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to higher costs related to clinical activities and increased headcount to support our R&D pipeline and an expense for achievement of certain milestones payable to a partner. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 2% in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increased headcount and other investments supporting our strategic growth including the global launch of AMVUTTRA. For the first time in Q3, we generated non-GAAP operating profit during the quarter equal to $278 million driven by the significant revenue recognized during the quarter from our collaborations with Roche and Regeneron. We anticipate that in future quarters we will revert to a non-GAAP operating loss as we have not yet achieved sustainable profitability. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion at the end of 2022, with the increase primarily related to the $310 million upfront payment from Roche offset by our operating loss year-to-date. We continue to believe our current cash balance is sufficient to bridge us to a self-sustainable financial profile. Now I'd like to turn to our full year 2023 financial guidance. We are increasing our collaboration and royalty revenue guidance from $100 million to $175 million to $575 million to $625 million. The substantial increase is primarily attributable to two factors that were not included in our previous guidance. First, recognition of the full $310 million upfront payment received from Roche in the third quarter in conjunction with our zilebesiran collaboration. I would also like to note that our accounting conclusions associated with the Roche collaboration are summarized on Slide 27 in the appendix of today's presentation. And secondly, achievement of the $100 million ALN-APP milestone from Regeneron during the third quarter, the majority of which will be recognized as revenue during 2023. All other elements of our 2023 financial guidance remain unchanged. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals in our upcoming milestones slated for the remainder of 2023. We will of course be executing on global commercialization of our products ONPATTRO, AMVUTTRA, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. We intend to report top line results from Phase 1 studies of ALN-TTRsc04 in development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis and ALN-KHK, and development for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. With our partnered programs, Vir expects to report further results from Phase 2 combination trials of ALN-HBV02 in development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, we will now open the call for your questions. To those dialed in we would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each and then get back in the queue if you have additional questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ritu Baral of TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nRitu Baral: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about the HELIOS-B statistical -- sorry, the statistical plan. I understand that you're using the Anderson-Gill method, in which our statistical consultant, anyway, said that any kind of CV event would be analyzed as a recurring event and would count versus what has been used by other developers where they had ranks of -- they had two rank events. Within this Anderson-Gill are events of different types in the composite weighted equally? Or are certain events like death and hospitalization weighted more such that the analysis may be more meaningful to doctors for serious events and regulators as well? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet:\nair and:\nPushkal Garg: Yes. Thanks, Ritu. Look, I think there's lots of ways that people look at these types of data. As you mentioned, our focus is really on death in recurrent hospitalizations, and both a Finkelstein-Schoenfeld and an Anderson-Gill can do that. I think one of the unique aspects of the study that we've done to sort of increase and maximize power is actually have differential follow up for patients. So we have follow up that can range from 30 months to 36 months. And the Anderson-Gill allows us to actually incorporate that variable follow up, whereas in the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld, that follow up has to sort of be aligned to the lowest common denominator. So it actually gives us some additional power and that's why our statisticians and our team, we've prioritized that in the statistical analysis plan. So certainly it weights death, but we look at all of those death into hospitalization events as well as recurrent events as you talked about. So we think that really optimizes the power for the study.\nRitu Baral: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Paul Matteis of Stifel. Your line is now open.\nPaul Matteis: Great, thanks so much for taking the question. I appreciate it. We've been trying to think about what, if any, learnings there are from the recent advisory committee to HELIOS-B and, we fully understand, right that HELIOS-B is generating outcomes data and the issues with APOLLO-B at the FDA level are related to a lack of that to some extent. That said, I was curious if you think from a regulatory perspective it's important that you show some level of added outcomes benefit on top of tafamidis. And I'm assuming the study is not really powered for a p value, but how would you kind of delineate what the line is on a clinically meaningful effect in the combo therapy subset of HELIOS-B? Thanks so much.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Pushkal that's probably a question that goes straight to you.\nPushkal Garg: Yes. Thanks, Paul. Look, I think maybe a couple of points as reflected previously, obviously we're disappointed in the decision that was made, but as we look at the APOLLO-B results with regard to TAP and non-TAP, the add on TAP it was a very small group, only 91 patients. Study wasn't designed to characterize that subgroup. But we are encouraged that when we looked at the data that were presented at the AdCom and at various congresses that the outcomes data in both groups actually are trending favorably for the patisiran arm and that bodes well for HELIOS-B. The other point I would just make around that is that we have an experience now in that study, as we've mentioned that we targeted operationally about 50% of patients. We've come in somewhat less than that, which certainly adds in the overall powering of the study while we over enrolled as well by 10%. I think with regard to the add on factor that you were mentioning from a regulatory perspective, I think one of the points that probably is worth noting is that I think that point was raised in particular because tafamidis has a mortality claim. And what APOLLO-B, what ONPATTRO was coming forward was with a functional claim in terms of six minute walk test in KCCQ. And so that raises questions about how these drugs are going to be used in combination or in sequence, et cetera. In contrast, as you've just highlighted, HELIOS-B is going to deliver outcomes results and so that issue becomes much less of an issue. The other point is that we have a much larger experience in this study and much longer follow up. So, I do think that we're going to be able to look at the consistency of effect across both the monotherapy and the baseline TAP group. And that's really what we'll be focusing on as we look at that subgroup as well as a number of other subgroups in the study.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Excellent. Thank you.\nPaul Matteis: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Luca Issi of RBC. Your line is now open.\nLisa Munro: Oh, great. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Lisa on for Luca. I just want to touch base on HELIOS-B. Is it possible that you will elevate NT-proBNP and six-minute walk test as part of the composite primary endpoint? You obviously have shown promising results from both of those endpoints in the APOLLO-B, and in that way, if they're elevated, you would have a primary endpoint that ends up replicating BridgeBio. So you could, in theory, use that as a regulatory precedent to facilitate your conversation with Norman Stockbridge. Would that be a fair way to think about it? Any color there would be much appreciated. Thanks.\nPushkal Garg: Thanks, Lisa, for your question. Look, I think what you're pointing out and raising is the fact that when we looked at the APOLLO-B data, we did see really pretty much every endpoint lining up in favor of TTR lowering, whether it was functional like six-minute walk test or quality of life echocardiographic parameters, and biomarkers like NT-proBNP. And so I appreciate the point that you're raising, and certainly, as Yvonne highlighted, we're laser focused on delivering a successful study. We're very confident in the overall design of the study, the execution of the study. I think to your point about the BridgeBio results, I think they point to the fact that in the modern era that this is still a progressive disease despite patients being caught earlier in their disease process, and that an effective therapy can show a benefit on top of that in that setting. So we're overall really encouraged by what the study is and how it's designing out. And as we've mentioned, look, we're laser focused on this. If there are any Tweaks adjustments that we make to the statistical analysis plan, we'll follow up in due course.\nLisa Munro: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Ellie Merle of UBS, your line is now open.\nEllie Merle: Hey, guys, thanks so much for taking the question. Just, again, kind of on potential for combination. Just commercially, how are you thinking about the proportion of ATTR cardiomyopathy patients that will be treated with, say, monotherapy versus, say, a combination with tafamidis, assuming the success of HELIOS-B? And then just from a commercial perspective, what do you think payers want to see in terms of the benefit of vutrisiran on top of tafamidis, say, in terms of mortality, hospitalization, sort of anything coming out of any kind of initial conversations there? And then just a second, quick question. What data can we expect from the Phase 1 KHK data this year? And will the readout include weight loss data? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Maybe we'll take your first. We believe that AMVUTTRA is going to be a really important option for patients with the potential for a differentiated profile given its infrequent administration, minimal copays. And if you look at the progress that Tolga highlighted earlier with respect to the growth in patient demand for AMVUTTRA patients with probably, we believe that this is going to be a really important addition to the treatment armamentarium for physicians. Tolga maybe you could speak specifically to how we're thinking about use with tafamidis.\nA \u2013 TolgaTanguler: I mean, I think one of the points that we really need to make it clear is innovation really rules the day. And AMVUTTRA has been a game changer already in polyneuropathy, and I believe \u2013 we believe very strongly based on our research, AMVUTTRA\u2019s availability in cardiomyopathy is going to be important, especially if you look at our track records in price sensitive markets where actually tafamidis is available in Europe for polyneuropathy, we've been able to actually build an attractive business tablet versus infusion, tablet versus then subcutaneous and be able to build that business not just by net patients, but also with switches. Now in the U.S., which is similar to sort of the profile that you alluded to in terms of how we would actually think about in combination is our business is already built with the mixed phenotype patients, about 30% of our patients already on tafamidis granted we're indicated for polyneuropathy and tafamidis is now indicated for cardiomyopathy. Obviously, for us to be able to really elucidate how the positioning is going to work out, we need the HELIOS-B data that's going to be really important and that will obviously inform the best way we're going to position this and the best way we're going to engage with the payers. But again, just to give you a sense about the unmet medical needs, if you look at the early access program that we have, we've already been able to enroll 200 patients because patients do progress and we believe this is going to be an important alternative.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thanks, Tolga. That was a kind of great answer. With respect to your final question about KHK, we're obviously trying to avoid taking multipart questions in the call to give everybody a chance to ask the question and respect to KHK. We look forward to seeing more data, as Pushkal explained at the end of the year. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from David Lebowitz of Citi. Your line is now open.\nDavid Lebowitz: Thank you very much for taking my question. You spoke earlier about talking that HELIOS-B can allow for a very differentiated profile versus the other therapies in the space. And my question is regarding to some extent linked to some of the earlier questions. Given the trial differences, they have different populations with different levels of severity. Their endpoints are slightly different from each other with slightly modified statistical analyses. How easy is it going to be to actually demonstrate to physicians that a profile is actually differentiated? And what aspects of the data would you focus upon?\nYvonne Greenstreet: I think maybe you can start off by maybe also reflecting on some of the data we've seen already from APOLLO-B and the 24-month data that demonstrated actually sort of stabilization of disease in many patients.\nPushkal Garg: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Yvonne, and thanks, Dave, for your question. Look, I think it's important to acknowledge, first of all, there aren't any head to head data in this field, right? So what we're looking at, though, is a field that's evolving fairly rapidly, right, with because of the growing recognition of the unmet need and, for the benefit of patients multiple therapies coming forward. And you're right to point out that everyone is using there are some variations, for example, in the way that endpoints and statistical analyses you\u2019ve done. But I think what you have to do is think about it from the way that the clinician thinks about it when they step back and they look at a patient who's coming in and they're progressing with this. They present with this disease at a various stages. It's marked by dyspnea, by exercise, fatigue, poor quality of life, and you're seeing a decline over time. Their echocardiographic parameters are worsening, their heart is thickening, their NT-proBNP is rising, they may develop arrhythmias, et cetera. And that's what clinicians are looking at. And when they look at clinical data, I think what they're looking at then is, I believe, is looking at all of the data that are coming forward in terms of how are these various drugs affecting the disease process. And I think, as Yvonne was alluding to, I think what we're starting to see coming out of APOLLO-B really indicates the potential for a very unique profile when you silence TTR upstream using an RNAi mechanism of action, where we are seeing really favorable effects across all of these different parameters that we've looked at. Whether it's functional, quality of life, whether it's echocardiographic, whether it's biomarker based. And that in a disease that's otherwise steadily progressive. To see stability out to two years on both six-minute walk test and KCCQ stands out. And I think that's what's quite remarkable. So, look, I think over time, as clinicians will get experience, and I think this is, again, where clinicians are having experience as Tolga highlighted with AMVUTTRA both ONPATTRO and now AMVUTTRA for now many years taking care of PN patients and mixed phenotype patients. I think they're also getting accustomed to the efficacy profile, the tolerability the safety profile of these medicines. So all of that helps, I think, in terms of physicians understanding of how to use medicines for their patients.\nChristine Lindenboom: Great. Thank you, Pushkal. Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking our question. This is Tommy on for Salveen. So on HELIOS-B, how similar do you expect the APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B patient populations to be in terms of genotype and baseline characteristics? And besides the higher cap on HELIOS-B for baseline TAF use, are there any other notable differences? And do you have the flexibility to potentially push back top line data from HELIOS-B until all patients get to 36 months of follow up, if that was seen as necessary? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Great question. Thank you, Pushkal?\nPushkal Garg: Yes, Tommy? I think what I would say is that in general, I would think about the patient populations in APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B as being fairly similar. Right. We started these studies around the same time. The entry criteria in general are the same as you talked about. The one exception is that we allowed for a higher baseline proportion of patients to come in on tafamidis. But by and large, I would think about these similar. And I think that's, again, what helps us here is the fact that we've seen the positive results out of APOLLO-B across all the different measures that we've talked about. But this study has the benefit of being twice as large and three times as long. The follow up, as you know, is designed to allow for differential follow up and really to maximize the follow up that we have on the patients. So I think that was asked earlier as well. I think this really maximizes or optimizes the power that we can sort of gain on some of the endpoints. So we're looking forward to presenting the results in early 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Jessica Fye of JPM Chase. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys, this is [indiscernible] on for Jessica Fye. Assuming HELIOS-B is positive, do you envision the net price of AMVUTTRA changing from the current polyneuropathy conscious and cardiomyopathy? Why or why not? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Right, so it's pretty early days. As Pushkal said, we're expecting top line results from HELIOS-B in early 2024. And really, at this point in time, I don't think it's appropriate for us to make any specific comments about pricing other than to say, obviously we want to provide value to patients, physicians, and the ecosystem in general according to our patients access principles. I think that's about all we can say at this point in time. Thank you for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Maury Raycroft of Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nMaury Raycroft: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I think it was mentioned on our recent conference call that you have the opportunity to make tweaks to the HELIOS-B statistical analysis plan up until the database locks. Can you elaborate more on what that could entail? Would it require FDA buy in and how this flexibility factors into your chances of success for HELIOS-B?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, I know. That's a great question. Pushkal, any comments you'd like to make on the question?\nPushkal Garg: Yes, Maury, I think I'm going to probably restate what we've talked about previously, which is it\u2019s our teams are looking obviously at data in the study. We're looking at external data sets, et cetera. And as is normal in the industry, has been normal practice here at Alnylam, there are tweaks that can be made. In past instances, we've looked and changed from parametric to non-parametric statistical tests, et cetera. We've added subgroups, et cetera. So there are things that can be done, that can help either in the primary analysis or the overall data set that are being done in terms of may be, it terms of prespecified analyses or methodologies that are applied. It\u2019s I'm not going to speculate or hypothesize about what's going to be aligned with agencies or not, so I think but if there's material information there, we'll certainly share that with you in due course.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Our next question, give us one moment. Gena Wang of Barclays. Your line is now open.\nGena Wang: Thank you. Maybe just follow Maury's question. So are you planning to add, say, adding additional follow up time, flexibility regarding because right now when I look at your slides, it's still saying the last patient follow up reach month 30 and do you have a flexibility and a willingness or plan to extend to 36-months? And then another very quick question regarding tafamidis, I just wanted to make sure I heard it correctly. Pushkal, I think you mentioned 50% of patient on baseline tafamidis. Was that correct or was it close to 50%? And also regarding the tafamidis dropping, is BridgeBio 14% is a good benchmark for HELIOS-B?\nPushkal Garg: Yes. Thanks, Gena. Maybe a couple of points, just to clarify. So look, in terms of the study design, the study design has variable follow up of 30 to 36 months and so we will be following the majority of the patients out to the 36 months because of the way that enrollment occurred. But there is variable follow up in the context of the study. During the blinded portion of the study, in terms of baseline tafamidis, we had an operational target of 50%. But as we've stated previously, we came in under that number. And then with regard to drop-ins, what we've said is that the drop in rate remains below the assumptions that we had when we designed the study. So, again, all of these offer tailwinds in terms of what we believe in the overall powering of the study. So hopefully that helps.\nGena Wang: Thank you.\nChristine Lindenboom: Great. Any other questions?\nOperator: Yes, our next question. Give me one moment. Our next question comes from Mike Ulz of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMike Ulz: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just another follow up on HELIOS-B. When you share the data early next year, can you give us a sense of what level of detail and data that you will include in the top line results. For example, will we see the tafamidis combo subgroup analysis? Thanks.\nPushkal Garg: Yes, thanks for the question, Mike. Look, I think, as it's our norm during top line results, we will present the pre specified hierarchical endpoints along with P values, along with an update on safety and then with subsequent data presented at a scientific congress.\nChristine Lindenboom: Great. Next question?\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to now turn it back to the company for closing remarks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Great. Thank you everyone, for joining us on this call. We're very pleased with our progress in the third quarter of 2023 across the business and look forward to sharing more progress with you in the coming months as we deliver on our goals. Thank you very much and have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Yvonne, and good morning everyone. Q3 was another strong quarter for our commercial portfolio with both our TTR franchise driven by another robust quarter of AMVUTTRA performance in the U.S. market and our Ultra-Rare franchise delivering growth in excess of 30% compared with the prior year, as we continue to steadily increase the number of patients on all of our therapies. Total net product revenues grew 35% year-over-year for the third quarter or 33% at a constant exchange rate. Let me now turn to a summary of our third quarter TTR performance. Our TTR franchise achieved $230 million in global net product revenues for ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA representing a 3% increase compared with the second quarter and 35% growth compared with the third quarter of 2022. At the end of the third quarter, more than 3790 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA treatment worldwide, up from over 3490 patients at the end of the second quarter, representing 8% quarterly patient growth. Now let me provide highlights of our U.S. and international TTR performance. In the U.S. combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased by 11% compared with the second quarter and a robust 47% year-over-year driven by AMVUTTRA's launch. The U.S. growth was primarily driven by the following. A 6% increase in demand, which was driven by the strength of ongoing AMVUTTRA patient uptake, more than offsetting a decrease in ONPATTRO patients that switched to AMVUTTRA. At the end of the third quarter, more than 80% of Alnylam USP care [ph] patients are now on AMVUTTRA, a positive sign indicating how well the product profile has been received by both prescribing physicians and patients. In addition to the demand growth, reported growth was also favorably impacted by approximately 5% due to an increase in AMVUTTRA inventory in the distribution channel. Now let me turn to our international markets where TTR franchise growth decreased by 7% compared with the second quarter. Although there was growth in patients on therapy during the quarter, this growth was offset by a variety of factors including price adjustments in Germany following the end of the six-month free pricing period, inventory destocking in Japan and the timing of orders in emerging and partner markets. It is worth noting that we have now launched AMVUTTRA in all major international markets following recent launches in Spain and Italy. I'm proud of the efforts of our Market Access team as we have made AMVUTTRA available to patients and secured reimbursements significantly faster than industry benchmarks. Now moving to our Ultra-Rare products and the performance of GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, which delivered $83 million in combined product sales during the third quarter, representing a 1% increase compared with the second quarter and a solid 33% growth compared with the third quarter of 2022. We ended the quarter with more than 1000 patients on our two Ultra-Rare products, an exciting milestone with more than 625 patients on GIVLAARI commercial therapy and more than 375 patients on OXLUMO commercial therapy, representing 8% combined quarterly growth in patients on our Ultra-Rare products compared with the second quarter 2023. For GIVLAARI product sales declined 6% in Q3 compared with the second quarter with the following regional dynamics. A 5% increase in demand in the U.S. market driven by an increase in patients on therapy, a 25% decrease in our international markets driven by the timing of orders in emerging and partner markets, where as we previously indicated Q2 results benefited from a large order and higher gross to net deductions. For OXLUMO, we delivered a robust 19% increase in product sales compared with the second quarter, which was driven by the following. A 10% increase in the U.S. driven by 16% demand growth, partially offset by a reduction of inventory in the distribution channel, a 23% increase in our international markets driven by increased demand and the timing of orders in our emerging and partner markets. We were pleased with the results in the quarter, particularly the strong patient growth with both our TTR and Ultra-Rare franchises delivering an 8% increase in patients on therapy during the quarter as well as delivering robust year-over-year growth in revenues with both franchises growing in excess of 30%. As we look ahead to the end of the year, we anticipate a strong fourth quarter positioning us to end the year at the approximate midpoint of our net product revenue guidance range. With that, I will now turn it over to Pushkal to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal ?"

            "name": "Pushkal Garg",
            "content": "Thanks, Tolga, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our TTR franchise. As you know, we have two products approved for the polyneuropathy of hereditary ATR amyloidosis, ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA. We have also been pursuing expansion into ATTR cardiomyopathy through two large studies, APOLLO-B for patisiran and HELIOS-B for vutrisiran. As previously announced, while APOLLO-B delivered positive results, not just on the primary endpoint, but consistently across additional secondary and exploratory endpoints as well, all with a positive safety profile, the FDA declined to approve the SNDA for patisiran, citing insufficient evidence of clinical meaningfulness. As a result of this decision and with the top line readout from HELIOS-B expected in early 2024, we have elected not to invest further into additional development to secure approval for patisiran in ATTR cardiomyopathy in the United States. The positive data on multiple aspects of ATTR cardiomyopathy coming out of the APOLLO-B study reaffirm our confidence and success of HELIOS-B. In particular, the 24-month data show that both 6-minute walk test and KCCQ were relatively stable over the entire period in contrast to the large expected decline expected in this disease and suggest the potential that RNAi mediated TTR silencing may result in a differentiated efficacy profile in this disease. The HELIOS-B study is designed and powered to demonstrate a benefit of vutrisiran in patients very similar to those studies in APOLLO-B on the composite outcome of all 'cause mortality and recurrent cardiovascular events over a 30 to 36-month period. The study is on track to read out in early 2024 and assuming positive data, we then plan to seek a label expansion for AMVUTTRA and if approved ultimately launch that medicine into the growing market of patients around the world with wild type or hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. We believe that the convenient quarterly subcutaneous dosing regimen with a therapeutic profile that includes cardiovascular outcomes data in its label could potentially position AMVUTTRA as a transformative therapy with a market leading profile for patients with this disease. Moving on, following announcement of initial human proof-of-concept data on ALN-APP, our RNAi therapeutic design for CNS delivery, which is in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, we are excited by the positive results we've seen from the Phase 1 study to date. At the clinical trials on Alzheimer's Disease Conference a few weeks ago, we've presented additional positive interim results from the Phase 1 study in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease. At the time of this interim look, 20 patients had been enrolled in three single dose cohorts in Part A of the ongoing Phase 1 study. To date, we've studied 3 dose levels, 25, 50 and 75 mg, with four to six patients dosed in each cohort. Excitingly, ALN-APP treatment resulted in rapid dose dependent and sustained reductions, both soluble APP Alpha and Beta biomarkers of target engagement in the CSF. We saw rapid knockdown as early as day 15 and observed peak mean reduction of 69% and 82% respectively for soluble APP Alpha and soluble APP Beta. Reduction was sustained with a mean reduction of 33% and 39% respectively for soluble APP Alpha and Beta ten months after a single 75 mg dose. Yes. Thanks, Ritu. Look, I think there's lots of ways that people look at these types of data. As you mentioned, our focus is really on death in recurrent hospitalizations, and both a Finkelstein-Schoenfeld and an Anderson-Gill can do that. I think one of the unique aspects of the study that we've done to sort of increase and maximize power is actually have differential follow up for patients. So we have follow up that can range from 30 months to 36 months. And the Anderson-Gill allows us to actually incorporate that variable follow up, whereas in the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld, that follow up has to sort of be aligned to the lowest common denominator. So it actually gives us some additional power and that's why our statisticians and our team, we've prioritized that in the statistical analysis plan. So certainly it weights death, but we look at all of those death into hospitalization events as well as recurrent events as you talked about. So we think that really optimizes the power for the study. Yes. Thanks, Paul. Look, I think maybe a couple of points as reflected previously, obviously we're disappointed in the decision that was made, but as we look at the APOLLO-B results with regard to TAP and non-TAP, the add on TAP it was a very small group, only 91 patients. Study wasn't designed to characterize that subgroup. But we are encouraged that when we looked at the data that were presented at the AdCom and at various congresses that the outcomes data in both groups actually are trending favorably for the patisiran arm and that bodes well for HELIOS-B. The other point I would just make around that is that we have an experience now in that study, as we've mentioned that we targeted operationally about 50% of patients. We've come in somewhat less than that, which certainly adds in the overall powering of the study while we over enrolled as well by 10%. I think with regard to the add on factor that you were mentioning from a regulatory perspective, I think one of the points that probably is worth noting is that I think that point was raised in particular because tafamidis has a mortality claim. And what APOLLO-B, what ONPATTRO was coming forward was with a functional claim in terms of six minute walk test in KCCQ. And so that raises questions about how these drugs are going to be used in combination or in sequence, et cetera. In contrast, as you've just highlighted, HELIOS-B is going to deliver outcomes results and so that issue becomes much less of an issue. The other point is that we have a much larger experience in this study and much longer follow up. So, I do think that we're going to be able to look at the consistency of effect across both the monotherapy and the baseline TAP group. And that's really what we'll be focusing on as we look at that subgroup as well as a number of other subgroups in the study. Thanks, Lisa, for your question. Look, I think what you're pointing out and raising is the fact that when we looked at the APOLLO-B data, we did see really pretty much every endpoint lining up in favor of TTR lowering, whether it was functional like six-minute walk test or quality of life echocardiographic parameters, and biomarkers like NT-proBNP. And so I appreciate the point that you're raising, and certainly, as Yvonne highlighted, we're laser focused on delivering a successful study. We're very confident in the overall design of the study, the execution of the study. I think to your point about the BridgeBio results, I think they point to the fact that in the modern era that this is still a progressive disease despite patients being caught earlier in their disease process, and that an effective therapy can show a benefit on top of that in that setting. So we're overall really encouraged by what the study is and how it's designing out. And as we've mentioned, look, we're laser focused on this. If there are any Tweaks adjustments that we make to the statistical analysis plan, we'll follow up in due course. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Yvonne, and thanks, Dave, for your question. Look, I think it's important to acknowledge, first of all, there aren't any head to head data in this field, right? So what we're looking at, though, is a field that's evolving fairly rapidly, right, with because of the growing recognition of the unmet need and, for the benefit of patients multiple therapies coming forward. And you're right to point out that everyone is using there are some variations, for example, in the way that endpoints and statistical analyses you\u2019ve done. But I think what you have to do is think about it from the way that the clinician thinks about it when they step back and they look at a patient who's coming in and they're progressing with this. They present with this disease at a various stages. It's marked by dyspnea, by exercise, fatigue, poor quality of life, and you're seeing a decline over time. Their echocardiographic parameters are worsening, their heart is thickening, their NT-proBNP is rising, they may develop arrhythmias, et cetera. And that's what clinicians are looking at. And when they look at clinical data, I think what they're looking at then is, I believe, is looking at all of the data that are coming forward in terms of how are these various drugs affecting the disease process. And I think, as Yvonne was alluding to, I think what we're starting to see coming out of APOLLO-B really indicates the potential for a very unique profile when you silence TTR upstream using an RNAi mechanism of action, where we are seeing really favorable effects across all of these different parameters that we've looked at. Whether it's functional, quality of life, whether it's echocardiographic, whether it's biomarker based. And that in a disease that's otherwise steadily progressive. To see stability out to two years on both six-minute walk test and KCCQ stands out. And I think that's what's quite remarkable. So, look, I think over time, as clinicians will get experience, and I think this is, again, where clinicians are having experience as Tolga highlighted with AMVUTTRA both ONPATTRO and now AMVUTTRA for now many years taking care of PN patients and mixed phenotype patients. I think they're also getting accustomed to the efficacy profile, the tolerability the safety profile of these medicines. So all of that helps, I think, in terms of physicians understanding of how to use medicines for their patients. Yes, Tommy? I think what I would say is that in general, I would think about the patient populations in APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B as being fairly similar. Right. We started these studies around the same time. The entry criteria in general are the same as you talked about. The one exception is that we allowed for a higher baseline proportion of patients to come in on tafamidis. But by and large, I would think about these similar. And I think that's, again, what helps us here is the fact that we've seen the positive results out of APOLLO-B across all the different measures that we've talked about. But this study has the benefit of being twice as large and three times as long. The follow up, as you know, is designed to allow for differential follow up and really to maximize the follow up that we have on the patients. So I think that was asked earlier as well. I think this really maximizes or optimizes the power that we can sort of gain on some of the endpoints. So we're looking forward to presenting the results in early 2024. Yes, Maury, I think I'm going to probably restate what we've talked about previously, which is it\u2019s our teams are looking obviously at data in the study. We're looking at external data sets, et cetera. And as is normal in the industry, has been normal practice here at Alnylam, there are tweaks that can be made. In past instances, we've looked and changed from parametric to non-parametric statistical tests, et cetera. We've added subgroups, et cetera. So there are things that can be done, that can help either in the primary analysis or the overall data set that are being done in terms of may be, it terms of prespecified analyses or methodologies that are applied. It\u2019s I'm not going to speculate or hypothesize about what's going to be aligned with agencies or not, so I think but if there's material information there, we'll certainly share that with you in due course. Yes. Thanks, Gena. Maybe a couple of points, just to clarify. So look, in terms of the study design, the study design has variable follow up of 30 to 36 months and so we will be following the majority of the patients out to the 36 months because of the way that enrollment occurred. But there is variable follow up in the context of the study. During the blinded portion of the study, in terms of baseline tafamidis, we had an operational target of 50%. But as we've stated previously, we came in under that number. And then with regard to drop-ins, what we've said is that the drop in rate remains below the assumptions that we had when we designed the study. So, again, all of these offer tailwinds in terms of what we believe in the overall powering of the study. So hopefully that helps. Yes, thanks for the question, Mike. Look, I think, as it's our norm during top line results, we will present the pre specified hierarchical endpoints along with P values, along with an update on safety and then with subsequent data presented at a scientific congress."

            "name": "Jeff Poulton",
            "content": "Thanks, Pushkal and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam's Q3 2023 financial results and discussing our full year guidance. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for Q3 2023. Total product revenues for the quarter were $313 million or 35% growth versus Q3 2022. As Tolga previously mentioned, the increase was driven by strong growth from our TTR and Ultra-Rare franchises with both reporting growth greater than 30% during the quarter compared with the prior year. Our reported results in the quarter benefited modestly from foreign exchange as constant exchange rate product sales growth was 2% lower at 33%. Net revenue from collaborations for the third quarter was $427 million representing nearly a $400 million increase from Q3 2022, primarily due to increases in revenue from our zilebesiran co-development and co-commercialization collaboration with Roche, which included full recognition of the $310 million upfront payment received in the third quarter as well as $65 million in revenue in connection with our Regeneron collaboration. The $65 million represents the portion of revenue recognized from a $100 million milestone earned from achieving certain criteria during early clinical development for our CNS program ALN-APP. Royalty revenue during the quarter was $10 million, which was driven by Novartis sales of Leqvio, which continued to increase following launch in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2022. Gross margin on product sales was 75% in Q3, representing a 10% decrease compared with the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to a Q3 write-off of ONPATTRO inventory that had been manufactured for future demand associated with the ATTR cardiomyopathy indication for patisiran for which we did not receive regulatory approval. Recall that I mentioned on our ONPATTRO CRL investor call on October 9th that we expect ONPATTRO demand to decrease on a go forward basis as AMVUTTRA continues to cannibalize existing ONPATTRO polyneuropathy business in markets where AMVUTTRA has launched. As a result for 2024 we anticipate ONPATTRO product sales will be in the $200 million to $225 million range. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 16% in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to higher costs related to clinical activities and increased headcount to support our R&D pipeline and an expense for achievement of certain milestones payable to a partner. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 2% in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increased headcount and other investments supporting our strategic growth including the global launch of AMVUTTRA. For the first time in Q3, we generated non-GAAP operating profit during the quarter equal to $278 million driven by the significant revenue recognized during the quarter from our collaborations with Roche and Regeneron. We anticipate that in future quarters we will revert to a non-GAAP operating loss as we have not yet achieved sustainable profitability. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion at the end of 2022, with the increase primarily related to the $310 million upfront payment from Roche offset by our operating loss year-to-date. We continue to believe our current cash balance is sufficient to bridge us to a self-sustainable financial profile. Now I'd like to turn to our full year 2023 financial guidance. We are increasing our collaboration and royalty revenue guidance from $100 million to $175 million to $575 million to $625 million. The substantial increase is primarily attributable to two factors that were not included in our previous guidance. First, recognition of the full $310 million upfront payment received from Roche in the third quarter in conjunction with our zilebesiran collaboration. I would also like to note that our accounting conclusions associated with the Roche collaboration are summarized on Slide 27 in the appendix of today's presentation. And secondly, achievement of the $100 million ALN-APP milestone from Regeneron during the third quarter, the majority of which will be recognized as revenue during 2023. All other elements of our 2023 financial guidance remain unchanged. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals in our upcoming milestones slated for the remainder of 2023. We will of course be executing on global commercialization of our products ONPATTRO, AMVUTTRA, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. We intend to report top line results from Phase 1 studies of ALN-TTRsc04 in development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis and ALN-KHK, and development for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. With our partnered programs, Vir expects to report further results from Phase 2 combination trials of ALN-HBV02 in development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?"

            "content": "Thanks Christine and thank you everyone for joining the call today. In the third quarter of 2023, we continue to make great progress across our business, while also experiencing a disappointment. As we announced last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to approve the supplemental New Drug Application for Patisiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic that was in development for the treatment of the cardiomyopathy of ATTR amyloidosis. As we have conveyed, we're extremely disappointed with this outcome, particularly with regard to the needs of patients, many of whom spoke at the Advisory Committee Meeting in September. We have been steadfastly committed to this underserved application for over a decade and remain confident in our long-term strategy to building a leading TTR franchise with Patisiran and the HELIOS-B Study serving as a very important next step in this journey. We look forward to sharing those top line results which remain on track for early 2024. As we continue to progress our plans in ATTR cardiomyopathy, our commercial strength in the third quarter was driven by the ongoing successful launch of AMVUTTRA in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. This contributed to a 35% year-over-year growth in total net product revenues compared to the third quarter of 2022. We also delivered important clinical updates from key pipeline programs in the third quarter. In September, we announced positive top line results in the KARDIA-1 Phase 2 dose ranging study of zilebesiran, which demonstrated greater than 15 mmHg reduction of systolic blood pressure at three months of treatment compared to placebo, as well as an encouraging safety and tolerability profile in adult patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Additionally, the results also reflected sustained reductions of systolic blood pressure at six months, supporting the potential for quarterly or biannual dosing. We also shared updated positive interim results from the Phase 1 study of ALN-APP in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease, which showed rapid and robust target engagement with sustained effects out to 10 months with a single dose and an encouraging clinical safety and tolerability profile. Additionally, we presented data from the APOLLO-B study of patisiran at HFSA showing that the effects of patisiran treatment on 6- minute walk test and KCCQ were maintained through 24 months of treatment. This type of relative stabilization in what is otherwise a steadily progressive disease is very encouraging and further bolsters our confidence in PTSD. We're thrilled to have had these results published in the New England Journal of Medicine just a few weeks ago, which is accompanied by a favorable editorial highlighting the step forward represented by RNAi therapeutics in this disease. Lastly, we're excited to have achieved the third place ranking in Science Magazine's top employer survey for 2023. This marks the fifth year that our Alnylam was featured as one of the top three companies in their annual survey of industry professionals. We are poised to deliver a couple more pipeline updates by the end of the year, including top line Phase 1 results for ALN-TTRsc04 as well as ALN-KHK, our investigational RNAi therapeutics for type 2 diabetes. And I encourage you all to save the date and tune into our Annual R&D Day, which will be held virtually on December the 13th, where we will discuss all of the exciting progress across our pipeline and platform. We believe all of this puts us on track with our Alnylam P5x25 goals making Alnylam a top tier biotech developing and commercializing transformative medicines for patients around the world with rare diseases and beyond, driven by a high yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering exceptional financial results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for review of our commercial performance. Tolga? air and: Pushkal that's probably a question that goes straight to you. Excellent. Thank you. Maybe we'll take your first. We believe that AMVUTTRA is going to be a really important option for patients with the potential for a differentiated profile given its infrequent administration, minimal copays. And if you look at the progress that Tolga highlighted earlier with respect to the growth in patient demand for AMVUTTRA patients with probably, we believe that this is going to be a really important addition to the treatment armamentarium for physicians. Tolga maybe you could speak specifically to how we're thinking about use with tafamidis.\nA \u2013 TolgaTanguler: I mean, I think one of the points that we really need to make it clear is innovation really rules the day. And AMVUTTRA has been a game changer already in polyneuropathy, and I believe \u2013 we believe very strongly based on our research, AMVUTTRA\u2019s availability in cardiomyopathy is going to be important, especially if you look at our track records in price sensitive markets where actually tafamidis is available in Europe for polyneuropathy, we've been able to actually build an attractive business tablet versus infusion, tablet versus then subcutaneous and be able to build that business not just by net patients, but also with switches. Now in the U.S., which is similar to sort of the profile that you alluded to in terms of how we would actually think about in combination is our business is already built with the mixed phenotype patients, about 30% of our patients already on tafamidis granted we're indicated for polyneuropathy and tafamidis is now indicated for cardiomyopathy. Obviously, for us to be able to really elucidate how the positioning is going to work out, we need the HELIOS-B data that's going to be really important and that will obviously inform the best way we're going to position this and the best way we're going to engage with the payers. But again, just to give you a sense about the unmet medical needs, if you look at the early access program that we have, we've already been able to enroll 200 patients because patients do progress and we believe this is going to be an important alternative. I think maybe you can start off by maybe also reflecting on some of the data we've seen already from APOLLO-B and the 24-month data that demonstrated actually sort of stabilization of disease in many patients. Great question. Thank you, Pushkal? Right, so it's pretty early days. As Pushkal said, we're expecting top line results from HELIOS-B in early 2024. And really, at this point in time, I don't think it's appropriate for us to make any specific comments about pricing other than to say, obviously we want to provide value to patients, physicians, and the ecosystem in general according to our patients access principles. I think that's about all we can say at this point in time. Thank you for the question. Yes, I know. That's a great question. Pushkal, any comments you'd like to make on the question? Great. Thank you everyone, for joining us on this call. We're very pleased with our progress in the third quarter of 2023 across the business and look forward to sharing more progress with you in the coming months as we deliver on our goals. Thank you very much and have a good day."

Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks Christine and thank you everyone for joining the call today. In the second quarter of 2023, we continue to make great progress across our business. Starting with our commercial performance, the AMVUTTRA launch once again drove strong growth in our TTR franchise with 46% year-over-year growth and in total product sales with 43% year-over-year growth compared to the second quarter of 2022. We also delivered strong execution across our clinical pipeline, where notable results included positive 18 months data from our APOLLO-B Phase 3 study, reaffirming the potential of patisiran in ATTR amyloidosis of cardiomyopathy. In July, we shared updated positive interim results from the Phase 1 study of ALN-APP in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease, showing rapid and robust target engagement with sustained effect of six months with a single dose and an encouraging clinical safety and tolerability profile. Additionally, our team executed on the business development side. Most notably, we entered into a strategic partnership with Roche for the development and commercialization of zilebesiran, providing us with what we believe is a remarkable opportunity to bring forward a potentially transformative program with a potential to disrupt the global treatment paradigm for hypertension. We're also pleased to announce this morning that following our full cooperation with the government, the US Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts has now concluded and closed their case regarding the marketing and promotion of ONPATTRO in the US with no action. Operating with integrity has always been and will continue to be called to our Alnylam and we will continue to hold our business conduct, and in particular our interactions with healthcare providers and patients, the highest ethical standards. As we move into the back half of 2023, we have several important catalysts, including the initial data from our KARDIA Phase 2 program zilebesiran, and pending a successful AdCom and positive regulatory review, the potential launch of ONPATTRO and ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. We believe all of this puts us on track with our Alnylam P5x25 goals, making Alnylam a top tier biotech company, developing and commercializing transformative medicines for rare diseases and beyond for patients around the world, driven by a high yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering exceptional financial results. Further, before I hand the call over, I'm very pleased to share that Akshay Vaishnaw Alnylam's President and Key Scientific Leader will be transitioning to a new and exciting role within the organization, serving as our first Chief Innovation officer. Akshay has been at the helm of driving science and innovation with Alnylam for nearly 18 years, and that effort has yielded an entirely new class of medicines. In his new role Akshay will become the company's key innovation leader, focused on the future of our R&D engine, which is the lifeblood of how we have and will continue to drive our research and development programs into transformative medicines as we continue to build a top tier biotech company. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks Yvonne, and good morning everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for Alnylam, driven by our TTR franchise and the strength of our ongoing launch of AMVUTTRA across several markets, which has started with the US where it has now been available for over a year. Our total net product revenues across all products grew 43% year-over-year in Q2. Let me now review our TTR performance during Q2. The TTR franchise achieved $224 million in global net product revenues for ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA, representing a 9% increase compared with the first quarter and 46% growth compared with the second quarter of 2022. At the end of the second quarter, over 3,490 patients were on ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA treatment worldwide, up from over 3,160 patients at the end of the first quarter, representing 10% quarterly patient growth. With respect to our international performance, total TTR second quarter product sales increased 6% versus the first quarter, driven by strong AMVUTTRA demand in Japan and the UK, UK being our most recent launch market. After more than six months since its launch, the AMVUTTRA demand growth in Japan is particularly encouraging with new patient growth being driven by a mix of switches from tafamidis, as well as patients naive to therapy.  Importantly, ONPATTRO continue to deliver steady growth in markets where AMVUTTRA is not yet available, a sign of our robust demand generation activities as we position these markets for upcoming AMVUTTRA launches. Now let me turn to the US where combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased by 12% versus the first quarter and a robust 72% year-over-year growth, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of achieving TTR growth in excess of 70% on a year-over-year basis in the US, since the launch of AMVUTTRA in the third quarter of 2022. This significant growth was primarily driven by a 15% increase in demand, which more than offset the decrease in patients on ONPATTRO that switched to AMVUTTRA and the robust demand was slightly offset by inventory dynamics, which decreased reported growth by approximately 2%, with channel inventory reductions to both products. AMVUTTRA continues to expand the overall TTR polyneuropathy franchise as reflected by our year-over-year growth. The steady growth of AMVUTTRA performance in the US is a testament to the significant unmet need of patients with TTR polyneuropathy, our commercial capabilities and naturally the product profile of AMVUTTRA. Our leading performance indicators also continue to trend favorably, including the expansion of our prescriber base and favorable access, resulting in patient compliance rates of over 90%. A year into launch, we have increased our prescriber base by almost 50% through a balanced mix of academic centers and community-based specialists, while switching a majority of the patients who are ONPATTRO at the time of AMVUTTRA launch. Now update on our Ultra-Rare franchise. We are proud to have developed and commercialized two Ultra-Rare products, transforming small patient populations that suffer greatly. GIVLAARI and OXLUMO together delivered $82 million in combined product sales during the second quarter, representing a 14% increase compared with the first quarter and a solid 37% growth compared with the second quarter of 2022. We ended the quarter with more than 570 patients on GIVLAARI commercial therapy and more than 350 patients on OXLUMO commercial therapy, representing 8% combined quarterly growth in patients on our Ultra-Rare products compared with the first quarter of 2023. For GIVLAARI, global revenue growth of 21% in Q2 compared the first quarter was driven by the following. In the US, we had an increase in the number of patients on therapy and an increase in patient compliance rates. A robust 29% in our international markets, which was impacted positively both by demand growth as well as order timing in our partner markets. For OXLUMO, flat quarterly revenue was a result of fewer US patients on a loading dose regimen, which offset modest patient growth. Growth in international markets was primarily driven by order timing in partner markets, which was partially offset by an unfavorable pricing mix in our European markets. Overall, Q2, 2023 was another quarter of healthy growth in revenues in our quest to serve more patients. With our -- with over a year since launch, we are particularly pleased with the steady growth of AMVUTTRA, which represents an important therapy option for hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. With that, I will now turn it over to Pushkal to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal?\nPushkal Garg: Thanks Tolga, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by updating you on our TTR franchise where as you know, we're conducting two large studies, APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B to evaluate the efficacy and safety of patisiran and vutrisiran, respectively in ATTR cardiomyopathy. The sNDA for patisiran is under FDA review based on the positive results of the APOLLO-B study, and as we recently announced, the application will be discussed at the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee on September 13th. We also announced today that enrollment in a US expanded access protocol for patisiran that was open shortly after the APOLLO-B readout last August has completed. The EAP was established to provide access to patisiran for patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy who've had an inadequate response to or cannot tolerate currently available treatment. The EAP was offered at 20 centers in the United States and the pre-specified enrollment target of 200 patients was met in about 10 months, indicating significant demand for this potential therapy. Another important recent update on patisiran was the presentation of 18-month results from APOLLO-B at the recent ESC Heart Failure Meeting. As a reminder, after the 12-month double-blind period of the study, all patients were eligible to receive patisiran during the open-label extension period of the trial. In the new analysis, we were very encouraged to see that favorable effects on functional capacity as assessed by the six-minute walk test, as well as on health status and quality of life as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire were sustained in patients receiving patisiran through 18 months. According to both of these endpoints, patisiran appeared to slow the decline in functional ability and health status that is typical for this disease. And similarly in patients who receive placebo during the double-blind period, initiation of patisiran in the OLE period was associated with initial evidence of stabilization, both six-minute block test and KCCQ relative to the double-blind period. Importantly, patisiran continued to demonstrate an encouraging safety profile through 18 months of treatment with no new safety concerns identified. We saw encouraging evidence of efficacy with other secondary and exploratory endpoints as well. Continued treatment with patisiran through 18 months was associated with relative stability in both NT-proBNP, a measure of cardiac stress and Troponin I, a measure of cardiac injury. And patients who rolled over from placebo to active treatment during the OLE saw slowing in relative stabilization of the rapid increases that were seen during the double-blind period. In addition, while the APOLLO-B study was not designed to show benefits on outcomes of hospitalizations or death, we were encouraged to see non-significant trends favoring patisiran treatment in these outcome endpoints, with extended follow-up during the OLE period. As we previously announced, we've submitted the 18 months results to the FDA as an amendment to our sNDA for patisiran, we look forward to continuing our engagement with the agency, including at the upcoming advisory committee and if patisiran is approved, expanding its label to bring patisiran to patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. We were also very excited to share initial human proof-of-concept data on ALN-APP, our first RNAi therapeutic designed for CNS delivery, which is in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. At the AAIC Congress in July, we presented updated positive interim results from the Phase 1 study in patients with Early-Onset Alzheimer's disease. At the time of this interim look, 20 patients had been enrolled in three single dose cohorts in Part A of the ongoing Phase 1 study. To date, we've studied three dose levels, 25, 50, and 75 milligrams with four to six patients dosed in each cohort. Excitingly, ALN-APP treatment resulted in rapid dose dependent and sustained reductions of both soluble APP alpha and beta, biomarkers of target engagement in the CSF. We saw rapid knockdown as early as day 15 and observed maximum knockdown of 84%, 90% respectively for soluble APP alpha and beta. And at the highest dose tested 75 milligrams, the median knockdown was greater than 55% for both biomarkers and sustained for at least six months. The safety of single doses of ALN-APP has been encouraging as well. All adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, and CSF parameters have not revealed any significant abnormalities to date. Further exploration of single doses of ALN-APP is ongoing in Part A. In addition, Part B, the multiple dose part of the study has been initiated in Canada where the majority of the Part A clinical trial patients were enrolled. The multiple dose part of the study remains on partial clinical hold in the United States due to findings observed in prior non-clinical chronic toxicology studies. In some, I'm thrilled about these impressive human data that provide the first ever evidence that we may be able to use RNAi to sign up disease causing transcripts from the CNS and look forward to providing additional program updates in the future. Let me now turn to recent progress with zilebesiran in development for the treatment of hypertension. We're very excited to recently announce the Phase 1 data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine, highlighting the medical importance of the substantial and durable lowering of blood pressure seen with single doses of zilebesiran. This now marks Alnylam's 11th publication in this prestigious medical journal. Yvonne has already highlighted the exciting collaboration with Roche we recently announced for the development commercialization of zilebesiran on the basis of these impressive Phase 1 data. We're now looking forward to results of the KARDIA-1 dose ranging study, which is on track for top line data in Q3. In addition, we're also pleased to have recently completed enrollment in the KARDIA Phase 2 -- KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study, which aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of zilebesiran in patients with uncontrolled hypertension when added on top of other anti-hypertensive medications. We expect to report top line results from this study in early 2024.  These are just a few highlights from our broad and innovative pipeline driven by our underlying organic product engine that we expect will deliver sustainable growth for Alnylam in the years to come. With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results in upcoming milestones. Jeff?\nJeff Poulton: Thanks Pushkal, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam's Q2 2023 financial results and discussing our full year guidance. Starting with the summary of our P&L results for the second quarter. Total product revenues for the quarter were $306 million or 43% growth versus Q2 2022. Tolga previously indicated the increase is primarily related to growth in TTR product revenues driven by the launch of AMVUTTRA in the US in the third quarter of 2022, as well as increased patients on GIVLAARI and OXLUMO therapies. The impact of foreign exchange rates on our product sales has moderated on a year-over-year basis with constant exchange rate growth now only 1% higher than our reported 43% year-over-year growth. Net revenues from collaborations for the quarter were $6 million or 35% decrease compared with the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to operating variability, including the level of work reimbursed in our collaboration with Regeneron. Royalty revenue during the quarter was $7 million, which was driven by Novartis's sales of Leqvio, which launched in the US in the first quarter of 2022. Despite the modest growth for revenues from collaborations and royalties, we remain confident in achieving a full year result with our $100 million to $175 million guidance range, primarily driven by our Regeneron collaboration and Leqvio royalties and milestones. Gross margin on product sales was 75% in the quarter, representing a 9% decrease compared with the second quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to fees incurred associated with canceling manufacturing commitments for ONPATTRO and other adjustments to inventory as demand for ONPATTRO continues to decrease driven by ongoing patients switching to AMVUTTRA.  Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 11% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increases in headcount to support our R&D pipeline and development expenses associated with the KARDIA-1, KARDIA-2 Phase 2 clinical studies. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 14% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increased headcount and other investments supporting our strategic growth including the global launch of AMVUTTRA. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter was $154 million, representing a $7 million improvement compared with Q2 2022, driven by strong top line growth offset by more moderate growth and operating expenses. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.1 billion compared to $2.2 billion at the end of 2022, with a decrease primarily due to our operating loss year to date. We continue to believe our current cash balance is sufficient to bridge us to a self-sustainable financial profile. Now I'd like to turn to our full year 2023 financial guidance where we are reiterating our previously issued guidance. Starting with net product revenues, we continue to anticipate combined net product revenues for our four commercialized products will be between $1.2 billion and $1.285 billion. Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties remains a range between $100 million and $175 million. And our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses remains unchanged and has arranged between $1.575 billion and $1.65 billion. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones slated for mid and late 2023. We will, of course, be executing on global commercialization of our four commercial products. With patisiran, we look forward to the upcoming meeting of the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee on September 13th with the PDUFA date shortly thereafter on October 8th. Later this quarter, we expect to report top line results from the KARDIA-1 Phase 2 study of zilebesiran. We also intend to report top line results from Phase 1 studies of ALN-TTRsc04, and development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis and ALN-KHK and development for the treatment of type two diabetes. Our partnered programs Sanofi expects to report additional results from the Phase 3 ATLAS program with patisiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic and development for the treatment of hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors. Additionally, Vir expects to report further results from Phase 2 combination trials of ALN-HBV02, and development for the treatment of chronic HPV infection. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, we'll now open the call for questions. To those dialed in, we would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question and then get back in the queue if you have additional questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Ulz of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMichael Ulz: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just quickly, any updated thoughts on the upcoming AdCom ONPATTRO and ATTR CM in terms of why the FDA decided to host the panel and then where you expect the focus to be? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: So, thank you for that question. Clearly, we're actively preparing for the advisory committee. We're really looking forward to presenting the data that we have from APOLLO-B. Whilst there are no specific questions at this time, we believe that the topics are going to be focused on the clinical meaningfulness of changes in the six-minute walk test and the KCCQ, particularly given the fairly recent FDA guidance around the utility of these endpoints and in patients with heart failure. We really believe that we have compelling data for APOLLO-B study across a wide range of endpoints and supported by additional validation from the recent 18-month data that has Pushkal described. We have submitted to the FDA. Pushkal, anything else to add?\nPushkal Garg: I think you've really covered it, Yvonne. I think, it really is -- we're -- our preparations underway. We feel really good about the data set that's been generated with APOLLO-B, and what we're seeing is evidence of stabilization across a series of endpoints, which is really critically important. Patients with this disease really value their functional ability and their quality of life. And what we're seeing across multiple measures is that patisiran appears to enable that, and that's reconfirmed with the extended OE data that we submitted. And we look forward to presenting that to the advisory committee as they -- to their review.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks Pushkal. Next question?\nOperator: One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Luca Issi of RBC. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Lisa on for Luca. I just wanted to dive into some specifics on the Roche deal first, zilebesiran. We know the deal entails $310 million upfront, plus substantial near term milestones. Your partner Roche has said that they expect to invest another $275 million to get to the end of Phase 2. So, just wondering if you can add any clarity on the $275 million and if this is part of the substantial near term milestones that you're expecting. Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: That's a great question, and a good opportunity for clarification. I'll pass it on to Jeff in a moment, but I just wanted to remind everybody that really what we feel that we have here in our hands with zilebesiran is a game changing therapy for patients with hypertension, really to maximize the value and drive a successful global product launch. We want to come to the market with cardiovascular outcomes data to help inform the various stakeholders. And obviously, that's a significant endeavor. And the collaboration with Roche allows us to bring together our leadership and RNAi is what is their proven global commercial footprint and capabilities and help us maximize the resources and capabilities in order to be successful here. But I think it's important to be specific about the -- about some of the details of the milestones. So Jeff, maybe you could\u2026\nJeff Poulton: Yeah. Let me just clarify that. So, the substantial near term development milestones that we had referenced when we announced the deal are, there's actually $365 million in potential development milestones that we could earn, and that's broken down as $65 million for the initiation of KARDIA-3, which is the additional Phase 2 study that Pushkal talked about on the deal call. And we expect that study to initiate next year. And then an additional $300 million for the first patient in on the CPOT [ph], the Phase 3 study. So taken together, that's the $365 million. When you look at that in combination with the development cost sharing, where Roche will put 60% of the bill and Alnylam will put 40% of the bill, really, from an out-of-pocket perspective for Alnylam to take this drug forward to the market really minimizes the financial burden for us, which allows us to then reallocate capital across our pipeline and hopefully drive additional growth.\nYvonne Greenstreet: That's great, Jeff. Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Citi with David Lebowitz. Your line is now open.\nDavid Lebowitz: Thank you very much for taking my question. A question on the submission of the 18 months data for ONPATTRO, inclusion. I know the PDUFA date stands in October. Is there any consideration by the FDA consider this a major amendment and move the PDUFA date three months down the road? Or have they not exhibited any such intent at this point? And on franchise growth, while there's no question the overall franchise is growing quite well, how is ONPATTRO maintaining as much share as it is to this point, given how well AMVUTTRA is doing?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yeah. Two great questions. So, I'll take the question on the PDUFA data and then I'll hand over to Tolga to speak to your overall franchise question around using the dynamics between ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA. We're continuing to anticipate a PDUFA date of October, the eighth, and we're working towards that. If that changes, of course, we'll communicate any new information. But as of this moment, we are continuing to expect the PDUFA date of October, the eighth. Tolga, do you want to turn to the question on ONPATTRO dynamics?\nTolga Tanguler: Sure. Happy to. So, the way I think we should think about this is US and are newly recently AMVUTTRA launch markets and those markets that are continuing to have only ONPATTRO as an option in within the franchise. As I indicated on the call, uh, if you look at our US growth in the TTR categories, 70% quarter-over-quarter growth would last four consecutive quarters, which is quite substantial. And that's really primarily driven by AMVUTTRA. In fact, the number of ONPATTRO patients that remains in the US at the time when we launched AMVUTTRA is getting smaller and smaller. So we're very pleased with how patients are switching over to AMVUTTRA. And we've also seen in other markets like Japan, now we're start seeing in France with very creative AP2 program name patient program as was in the UK. We're getting accelerated approvals in those several key markets to make sure that we're providing AMVUTTRA is an option. Now, the reason why you see a good persistent growth on ONPATTRO and albeit a smaller portion of our business is because markets like Italy and Spain where AMVUTTRA is still not yet available, we're seeing a good robust growth. And that's, again, a testament to the need of an option in this market in polyneuropathy, as well as our commercial abilities that we've been able to drive good, strong, robust growth, which obviously positions us very nicely at the time of AMVUTTRA launch in these other markets. We're going to start seeing -- we'd like to see a good strong uptake of AMVUTTRA and subsequent switches from ONPATTRO to AMVUTTRA.\nDavid Lebowitz: Thanks for taking the question.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yeah, thanks. Thanks. Thanks Dave. Let's turn to the next question.\nOperator: One moment for the next question. Our next question comes from Paul Matteis of Stifel. Your line is now open.\nPaul Matteis: Hey, thanks so much. I wanted to ask about the timing and any reason behind Akshay's role change. I think Akshay became President just 18 months ago. And it's such a pivotal time for Alnylam with the AdCom coming up, the HELIOS-B data. I haven't heard him at all on this call. So, I was just curious if you could expound upon this a little bit, and clarify if there's anything else behind the decision or this announcement today. Thanks so much.\nYvonne Greenstreet: So, thank you for that question. Look, I'm personally delighted that Akshay is going to take on this opportunity to become our first Chief Innovation Officer and that capacity continue to focus on helping to deliver continued success with respect to our R&D organization. We're also delighted that we've built a really strong, robust capability across the research and development organization. And that's allowed Akshay to be able to focus more specifically on innovation as we build a top tier biotech company. So, I think this is a terrific step forward for the company. There's no specific reason for this timing other than the fact that actually felt that that we're now in a position where we have a really strong capability, which allows him to take on a much more focused role for the company and he'll continue to be involved in all the important upcoming catalysts and milestones that you've just described. He's not on the call today because he's actually on vacation, but I'm sure we will -- we may well hear him on a upcoming call in the future. So, thanks for that question, Paul.\nPaul Matteis: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ritu Baral of TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nRitu Baral: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question, Yvonne and Pushkal, I wanted to dig down a little bit more on the preparation into the advisory committee, whether it's yours or ours or FDA's. Right now, are you planning to be able to discuss any additional data cuts later than 18 months from APOLLO-B or any data out of that fully enrolled expanded access plan? And is -- do you believe that there's any shift in understanding around these endpoints, given the recent BridgeBio data and how all of these endpoints and other endpoints like outcomes sort of link together?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks Ritu. There are kind of few questions there and we sort of -- maybe sort of unpick them. So, in terms of our AdCom preparations, any additional data that we're providing the FDA beyond the 18-month data that we've already referenced. And then secondly, kind of is any shifts in understanding with respect to the endpoint selection. So, I mean, Pushkal, maybe you could those two questions.\nPushkal Garg: Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks Ritu. Look, in terms of the AdCom preparations, we're again entering into the period where we're trying to -- we're really pulling together aspects of our preparation. We feel very good about how the team is prepared for this. And it's all based on incredibly strong data coming out of APOLLO-B and reaffirmed by the OEL data that we talked about early -- and earlier. And really it's the fact that across multiple measures, within the study, looking at endpoints like functional ability and quality of life, the biomarker data that are predictive of longer term outcomes, we're seeing evidence of relative stability. Patients who get on this drug appear to have less progressive decline. And we shared data last year at R&D Day showing favorable impacts on progression on NYHA Class and ATTR disease stage. So, all of this really paint a picture of delayed progression when patients are put on a silencer with this disease. And that's really important. We keep hearing from clinicians in the field that that's really important to patients. These are patients in their seventies and eighties. They value their functional ability and their quality of life. And so, these changes are meaningful to them. And I think what I can say is that the AdCom will be pulling together those various arguments. We've received a lot of support both from the data side, but also from external key opinion leaders, et cetera. And so, we'll look forward to making those points at the advisory committee and interacting with the agency and the panel there. Vis-a-vis BridgeBio, look, I think what I would say is, first of all, it's great news for patients. It looks like there may be potentially an additional medicine as we kind of learn more about this data and an additional stabilizer for patients with this disease. And I think it hats off to the patients, the investigators, and the colleagues at BridgeBio because it was -- it's been a challenging time and it's great to see that they've pulled out what looks to be a very positive study in that regard. I think as it relates to our franchise, we really remain excited about what the silencer profile looks to be. Again, building on what I just said about APOLLO-B emerging data that we're seeing, again, not statistically significant, but emerging trends with regard to outcomes coming out of APOLLO-B both on mortality and hospitalization. And I think the key, we'll be looking for more data at the ESC meeting. But I think what the results highlight is that in -- while we are diagnosing patients earlier with this disease, and that's been a big question in the field, these patients still endure ongoing progression. So that in APOLLO-B looks like that's reaffirmed in the BridgeBio data and an effective therapy can show a benefit to that population. And I think that reaffirms the design elements of HELIOS-B. So we're very excited about that as well.\nRitu Baral: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question is coming from Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking our question. This is Tommy on for Salveen and congrats on all the progress. Our question is also on BridgeBio and HELIOS-B. So, we saw from BridgeBio that there is this imbalance in TAF drop-in rates between the two arms that have this impact on separation. How are you thinking about the risk there to HELIOS-B given the drop in allowance? And kind of on the other hand, would HELIOS-B be able to give physicians insight into potential additive benefit when you combine Alnylam insurance stabilizer? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Okay. So, two questions there for you, but maybe I'll just start off by saying that we're actually really pleased to see the BridgeBio results because it really kind of reaffirms that even if patients were diagnosed earlier in the disease, they continue to have disease progression where an effective therapy, is able to demonstrate benefits in these earlier stage patients. So, I think, we're actually really kind of pleased that this gives us increased confidence actually in delivering a successful HELIOS-B. But Pushkal, maybe you can talk specifically about the TAF imbalance in -- TAF drop-in rates, potential impact on HELIOS-B and also, thinking about combination approaches stabilizes and silences.\nPushkal Garg: Yeah. Look, I think, as it relates to TAF drop-in rate, I think as we've talked about in the past, we've got careful measures in place and the way that the study was designed, and we feel good about the drop-in rate, that's there. It's substantially below our internal assumptions as we design the study. We're not going to provide any more specific updates on that, but we're very encouraged by what we're seeing with regard to that and about the overall design of the study. The study allows for a proportion of patients to be on background tafamidis, entering into the study just like we did in the APOLLO-B study. As we've said our targets were around 50%, but we've operationally come in below that. And so, I think we will get interesting data emerging from that study in terms of how the drug functions as a monotherapy, but as well as on top of background tafamidis.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks. Next question please.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Maury Raycroft of Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Hi, Maury.\nMaury Raycroft: Hi, thanks for taking my question. For the 200-patient expanded access program study, can you talk about the types of patients you've enrolled timeline to data, and how the data will be leveraged as it relates to regulatory or commercial plans?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yeah. Pushkal, that's a question for you around the EAP types of patients and then also thinking about how these data may be used going forward.\nPushkal Garg: Yeah. Maury, thanks. When the APOLLO-B data came out, it posed -- it brought forward the potential for an alternative mechanism for patients with this disease. As we've talked about multiple times during the call, these patients despite available standard-of-care therapy with tafamidis, continue to progress. And so what we did was establish an expanded access program, that at 20 US centers that enabled patients who were experiencing progression or were otherwise intolerant of available therapy to avail themselves with patisiran with their physician support. So that was open at 20 centers.  And as I mentioned, that enrolled actually relatively rapidly, we had 200 patients. It was actually on the order of about three patients every two days that was enrolled -- two patients every three days -- sorry, that was enrolled in this EAP program. And it really highlights, I think, what we've been saying and what we've been hearing a lot from the clinical community and the patient communities that patients continue to progress with this disease and they need additional therapies. And so, I think that's important as we think about bringing forward patisiran in this disease. And then, hopefully patisiran as well based on the results of HELIOS-B.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yeah. Thanks Pushkal. I think the point about continued unmet medical need is really the important one here. See the patients who are continuing to progress and patients that need alternative therapeutic approaches. Next question, please.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Eliana Merle of UBS. Your line is now open.\nEliana Merle: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. For HELIOS-B, can you elaborate on your rationale for using Andersen-Gill as a statistical method versus the Finkelstein\u2013Schoenfeld pairwise analysis that was used in the stabilizing Phase 3, such as the recent BridgeBio data? And then second, just in terms of the event rate, how are you thinking about the proportion of cardiovascular hospitalizations that will come from the urgent heart failure visit component and the importance of including the urgent heart failure visit as part of this endpoint definition? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Pushkal, there's maybe two questions for you.\nPushkal Garg: Sure. So, Ellie, I think there's a multitude of approaches to conducting survival analysis and outcome analysis that take advantage of the fact that you're looking at recurrent events and events over time. And our statisticians obviously spend a lot of time thinking about what's the optimal way to demonstrate the clinical benefit. And that's highlighted in a statistical analysis plan that's aligned with the agency. In this instance, one of the reasons for preferring the Andersen-Gill is the fact that there we allow for variable follow up in the context of the outcomes analysis. And the Andersen-Gill really allows us to fully leverage that, whereas other approaches would allow us to use a fixed time of follow-up, and frankly the shortest amount of follow up. So, we think it gives us a little bit of an analytic or power advantage to do it that way. With regard to the various components of the endpoint, I think what's really important, Ellie, is maybe just a larger picture. We're trying to capture clinically relevant events that connote to heart failure worsening, and the need for care in patients with this disease. And so that's why care is increasingly provided in different geographies, in different places, including in hospitals and urgent care centers, et cetera. And so, we look at the totality of all of that as indicating clinically relevant heart failure events that we may have an opportunity to affect with an effective therapy. And that's why that we've kind of captured that aspect in the endpoint structure.\nEliana Merle: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from William Pickering of Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nWilliam Pickering: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering what percent of AMVUTTRA patients are getting dosed at home so far. And yeah, as you look ahead to future competitive dynamics versus vutrisiran [ph], what does your market research tell you about how patients are thinking about the trade-offs between physician delivered therapy quarterly versus monthly self-injection? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Tolga, there's two questions for you. The first relating to home infusion and the second I think relating to vutrisiran, how we're thinking about differentiation.\nTolga Tanguler: Yeah. No, thank you. Great question. Look, I think, the way we should be thinking about this is AMVUTTRA will be the only disease reversing treatment for polyneuropathy dose four times a year. And not only, I think this really positions the product well from a convenience perspective, but there are number of important features that we believe will make AMVUTTRA incredibly competitive. Having a unique MOA, erupted and sustained disease reversal, obviously with a few dose, and we should also remember, we have five years of experience now in this category, and now one full year in the US, promoting AMVUTTRA that we really have been able to establish numbering of important patient and physician capabilities, starting from the fact that, this is a Part B product and where we have excellent coverage of reimbursement benefits and then going into the patients, whether it's site of care and providing various options, not just in the home, but also in other different sites of care, whether it's an infusion center or in a hospital care. And more importantly than supporting the patient benefit. So, one of the question that you ask is since we've launched ONPATTRO and now AMVUTTRA, we have over -- nearly a third of our patients are getting home care. And what's really also important is to remember that, almost all of our patients over 90% stays on therapy. Not only get a good convenience access to these medicines, but also has the ability to stay on therapy. We have a very, very minimal dropouts. So, with all these other features that we offer, we believe this is going to remain a very significant benefit. And another important one is obviously to remember, unlike Part D until 2025, our patients, nearly 70% of them has zero copay. And this will continue to be an important benefit. So, we are very -- we feel very good about how AMVUTTRA is already being positioned in the market, first with the values that we bring on the table, as well as some of the services that we've set out there for the last five years.\nWilliam Pickering: Very helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Genie Wang of Barclays. Your line is now open.\nGena Wang: Thank you for taking my questions. I also have one question regarding HELIOS-B. I think, Pushkal, in the past, you comment on [indiscernible] dropping rate, I think early on was in the low single digit. I don't -- I'm pretty sure now increase. But do you think, so far, say if we're using a TRIBUTE [ph] study as a benchmark where your dropping rate, it will be much lower than that. It's doing say, below 10%. And also do you see blinded events and how's that event's tracking versus your initial assumption?\nPushkal Garg: Yeah. Thanks Gena for your questions. Look, I think in terms of the drop-in rates, as you can imagine, is over the course of a three-year plus study, you're going to see those rates are going to evolve over time. What I can say is that the rates are -- the drop-in rates are significantly below our planning assumptions. And so, we feel very good about the overall powering of the study. There's a multitude of factors that contribute to how a study is powered, et cetera, and how that's going to turn out. And again, when we look at all of those elements, we feel good about the study.  In terms of event rates, of course, we have a cracker jack clinical and statistical team, they're responsible for monitoring a study, and ensuring the quality of the data that come in and the integrity of the study. And we feel, again, really positive about what we're seeing overall. And we have a long history of people in that -- in those teams who've designed and executed really successfully team -- studies in this field, including APOLLO-B, and so again, we feel very good about what we're doing here with HELIOS-B.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks for the question, Gena.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Leland Gershell of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nLeland Gershell: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just a question from me, as we look forward to the ALN-KHK data, obviously it's being looked at in type two diabetes and you'll be looking at glycemic indices. So, we'll see presumably data there. But just wondering, where that target sits could be useful for other related conditions. Weight loss, obesity, essentially NASH. Just wondering what your thoughts may be with respect to taking that, that candidate in one of those directions. As you will be looking at overweight, obese patients in the study, and even though you may have two other programs in NASH, those are both partnered. Wondering if you have freedom to pursue NASH if you'd like for KHK. Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yeah. That's a great question. And just remind everybody that KHK is a genetically validated target involves the metabolism of [indiscernible] and that's relevant to the development of diabetes. And as you point out, obesity as well. And clearly we're focused in our Phase 1 study addressing, target engagement and safety, and also looking at a range of relevant biomarkers with respect to glucose metabolism and insulin levels. But I think you raised an interesting question, which is that broad potential of KHK and metabolism in general. Pushkal, maybe you want to provide some perspective?\nPushkal Garg: Yeah. Leland, I think it's a really insightful question in the sense that this -- we've seen epidemiologically that with rise in fructose consumption, we've seen parallel increases both in diabetes, overweight, NASH, and a number of metabolic syndrome type diseases that all travel together. And it's entirely possible that by perturbing this pathway with a RNAi mechanism, that we actually may have beneficial effects in a number of these different domains. So, what's exciting here is that we have, what we think is a really potent and based on pre-clinically durable, way to silence KHK, that we can elaborate and we have a number of biomarkers that we can measure in the clinic that will help guide us along the path in terms of which of these indications to pursue, how to pursue them, et cetera. And this is also then a proprietary target within Alnylam that we're advancing. And so, we have really freedom to operate across a full range of diseases, and take it where the science and the unmet need drives us. So, look forward to sharing more data on that in the future.\nLeland Gershell: Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Great. And yeah, thank you for highlighting, I think, another exciting opportunity in our pipeline and more to come towards the end of the year. Next question?\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Myles Minter of William Blair & Company. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. You've got Sarah on from Myles. Thanks for taking our question. Is there any clarity you can give on the timeline of advancing ALN-HTT into the clinic or any other assets that are using C16 conjugate technology, and how has this been informed by the clinical ALN-APP data thus far? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: The timelines for ALN-APP and any other programs using -- sorry.\nUnidentified Analyst: HTT.\nYvonne Greenstreet: So HTT.\nPushkal Garg: Yeah. So, thanks Sarah for the question. I think, look, as I said in the remarks, and as you've heard from us in a couple of recent calls, I think what we've seen in the CNS space with ALN-APP has been really we think groundbreaking. It really opens up a whole new vista where we can take RNAi therapeutics to affect a wide variety of neuro-degenerative diseases and beyond in the CNF. When you look at what we see there, we see with the levels of up to 84%, 90% lower of lowering of soluble APP alpha and beta, that really signifies that we're getting deep brain penetration. That's always a big question as you're trying to think about additional targets that you can pursue, can you get into the deeper brain structures? And that level of knockdown signifies that. And then you have durability where we're seeing knockdown pre-clinically that's now translating clinically and comper [ph] to what we saw in the liver. And we think these drugs can be dosed six months a year, or every six months or even less frequently. And so, that's exciting. And then the third, and most critically frankly, is the fact that so far the solubility, this safety and tolerability is really encouraging as well. And so, this really opens up for us the opportunity to pursue multiple targets with our colleagues at Regeneron, who've been -- we've been working on in, in terms of this groundbreaking science. And so, to your point, HTT is another molecule that we recently announced as a development candidate. We're doing preclinical work now, IND enabling work to bring that into the clinic. We haven't formally announced a timeline for that, but you can imagine that we're pursuing that rapidly. Our colleagues at Regeneron are advancing a molecule against for ALS, against SOD, also in preclinical development right now. And we have additional targets behind that that we're going to bring forward.\nYvonne Greenstreet: I think we have time for one last question.\nOperator: One moment for our last question. Our last question comes from Mani Foroohar of Leerink. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Lily on for Mani. We had a question in terms of the commercial positioning for vutrisiran. What will be your strategy to protect the assets from the upcoming tafamidis genericization, and do you expect the need for a potential post-approval head-to-head study?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Tolga, I'm going to hand that question straight over to you.\nTolga Tanguler: Yeah. I mean, first of all, thank you for that question. I guess, the question specifically for tafamidis, for cardiomyopathy indication, which we have yet to receive and obviously, how we're going to position the product is going to be dependent on HELIOS-B results. But one thing to really remind everyone, if you look at our polyneuropathy experience where the product is a different value in Europe and other markets, I wouldn\u2019t say it has been a game changer and we've been able to accelerate growth and demand quite substantially in the markets that now AMVUTTRA is available versus tafamidis. And where we've seen an accelerated switch, particularly in Japan, where they have the polyneuropathy indication, unlike the US. Like any company that wants to continue to drive patient value and patient growth, we will, of course, be looking into the post genericization and we will subsequently consider any alternative in terms of clinical trial and other options. But it's -- I would say it's a little too soon for us to consider that, and we will obviously keep you abreast of any important decision that we would make eventually.\nOperator: I'm now showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Alnylam for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thank you and thanks everybody for joining us on this call. We're clearly very happy with a continued execution that we've seen in 2023 across multiple elements of our business, commercial, R&D and business development. And we look forward to sharing more progress in the coming months as we continue to deliver on our near and long-term goals. Thank you everybody, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tolga Tanguler",
            "content": "Thanks Yvonne, and good morning everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for Alnylam, driven by our TTR franchise and the strength of our ongoing launch of AMVUTTRA across several markets, which has started with the US where it has now been available for over a year. Our total net product revenues across all products grew 43% year-over-year in Q2. Let me now review our TTR performance during Q2. The TTR franchise achieved $224 million in global net product revenues for ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA, representing a 9% increase compared with the first quarter and 46% growth compared with the second quarter of 2022. At the end of the second quarter, over 3,490 patients were on ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA treatment worldwide, up from over 3,160 patients at the end of the first quarter, representing 10% quarterly patient growth. With respect to our international performance, total TTR second quarter product sales increased 6% versus the first quarter, driven by strong AMVUTTRA demand in Japan and the UK, UK being our most recent launch market. After more than six months since its launch, the AMVUTTRA demand growth in Japan is particularly encouraging with new patient growth being driven by a mix of switches from tafamidis, as well as patients naive to therapy.  Importantly, ONPATTRO continue to deliver steady growth in markets where AMVUTTRA is not yet available, a sign of our robust demand generation activities as we position these markets for upcoming AMVUTTRA launches. Now let me turn to the US where combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased by 12% versus the first quarter and a robust 72% year-over-year growth, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of achieving TTR growth in excess of 70% on a year-over-year basis in the US, since the launch of AMVUTTRA in the third quarter of 2022. This significant growth was primarily driven by a 15% increase in demand, which more than offset the decrease in patients on ONPATTRO that switched to AMVUTTRA and the robust demand was slightly offset by inventory dynamics, which decreased reported growth by approximately 2%, with channel inventory reductions to both products. AMVUTTRA continues to expand the overall TTR polyneuropathy franchise as reflected by our year-over-year growth. The steady growth of AMVUTTRA performance in the US is a testament to the significant unmet need of patients with TTR polyneuropathy, our commercial capabilities and naturally the product profile of AMVUTTRA. Our leading performance indicators also continue to trend favorably, including the expansion of our prescriber base and favorable access, resulting in patient compliance rates of over 90%. A year into launch, we have increased our prescriber base by almost 50% through a balanced mix of academic centers and community-based specialists, while switching a majority of the patients who are ONPATTRO at the time of AMVUTTRA launch. Now update on our Ultra-Rare franchise. We are proud to have developed and commercialized two Ultra-Rare products, transforming small patient populations that suffer greatly. GIVLAARI and OXLUMO together delivered $82 million in combined product sales during the second quarter, representing a 14% increase compared with the first quarter and a solid 37% growth compared with the second quarter of 2022. We ended the quarter with more than 570 patients on GIVLAARI commercial therapy and more than 350 patients on OXLUMO commercial therapy, representing 8% combined quarterly growth in patients on our Ultra-Rare products compared with the first quarter of 2023. For GIVLAARI, global revenue growth of 21% in Q2 compared the first quarter was driven by the following. In the US, we had an increase in the number of patients on therapy and an increase in patient compliance rates. A robust 29% in our international markets, which was impacted positively both by demand growth as well as order timing in our partner markets. For OXLUMO, flat quarterly revenue was a result of fewer US patients on a loading dose regimen, which offset modest patient growth. Growth in international markets was primarily driven by order timing in partner markets, which was partially offset by an unfavorable pricing mix in our European markets. Overall, Q2, 2023 was another quarter of healthy growth in revenues in our quest to serve more patients. With our -- with over a year since launch, we are particularly pleased with the steady growth of AMVUTTRA, which represents an important therapy option for hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy. With that, I will now turn it over to Pushkal to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal? Sure. Happy to. So, the way I think we should think about this is US and are newly recently AMVUTTRA launch markets and those markets that are continuing to have only ONPATTRO as an option in within the franchise. As I indicated on the call, uh, if you look at our US growth in the TTR categories, 70% quarter-over-quarter growth would last four consecutive quarters, which is quite substantial. And that's really primarily driven by AMVUTTRA. In fact, the number of ONPATTRO patients that remains in the US at the time when we launched AMVUTTRA is getting smaller and smaller. So we're very pleased with how patients are switching over to AMVUTTRA. And we've also seen in other markets like Japan, now we're start seeing in France with very creative AP2 program name patient program as was in the UK. We're getting accelerated approvals in those several key markets to make sure that we're providing AMVUTTRA is an option. Now, the reason why you see a good persistent growth on ONPATTRO and albeit a smaller portion of our business is because markets like Italy and Spain where AMVUTTRA is still not yet available, we're seeing a good robust growth. And that's, again, a testament to the need of an option in this market in polyneuropathy, as well as our commercial abilities that we've been able to drive good, strong, robust growth, which obviously positions us very nicely at the time of AMVUTTRA launch in these other markets. We're going to start seeing -- we'd like to see a good strong uptake of AMVUTTRA and subsequent switches from ONPATTRO to AMVUTTRA. Yeah. No, thank you. Great question. Look, I think, the way we should be thinking about this is AMVUTTRA will be the only disease reversing treatment for polyneuropathy dose four times a year. And not only, I think this really positions the product well from a convenience perspective, but there are number of important features that we believe will make AMVUTTRA incredibly competitive. Having a unique MOA, erupted and sustained disease reversal, obviously with a few dose, and we should also remember, we have five years of experience now in this category, and now one full year in the US, promoting AMVUTTRA that we really have been able to establish numbering of important patient and physician capabilities, starting from the fact that, this is a Part B product and where we have excellent coverage of reimbursement benefits and then going into the patients, whether it's site of care and providing various options, not just in the home, but also in other different sites of care, whether it's an infusion center or in a hospital care. And more importantly than supporting the patient benefit. So, one of the question that you ask is since we've launched ONPATTRO and now AMVUTTRA, we have over -- nearly a third of our patients are getting home care. And what's really also important is to remember that, almost all of our patients over 90% stays on therapy. Not only get a good convenience access to these medicines, but also has the ability to stay on therapy. We have a very, very minimal dropouts. So, with all these other features that we offer, we believe this is going to remain a very significant benefit. And another important one is obviously to remember, unlike Part D until 2025, our patients, nearly 70% of them has zero copay. And this will continue to be an important benefit. So, we are very -- we feel very good about how AMVUTTRA is already being positioned in the market, first with the values that we bring on the table, as well as some of the services that we've set out there for the last five years. Yeah. I mean, first of all, thank you for that question. I guess, the question specifically for tafamidis, for cardiomyopathy indication, which we have yet to receive and obviously, how we're going to position the product is going to be dependent on HELIOS-B results. But one thing to really remind everyone, if you look at our polyneuropathy experience where the product is a different value in Europe and other markets, I wouldn\u2019t say it has been a game changer and we've been able to accelerate growth and demand quite substantially in the markets that now AMVUTTRA is available versus tafamidis. And where we've seen an accelerated switch, particularly in Japan, where they have the polyneuropathy indication, unlike the US. Like any company that wants to continue to drive patient value and patient growth, we will, of course, be looking into the post genericization and we will subsequently consider any alternative in terms of clinical trial and other options. But it's -- I would say it's a little too soon for us to consider that, and we will obviously keep you abreast of any important decision that we would make eventually."

            "name": "Pushkal Garg",
            "content": "Thanks Tolga, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by updating you on our TTR franchise where as you know, we're conducting two large studies, APOLLO-B and HELIOS-B to evaluate the efficacy and safety of patisiran and vutrisiran, respectively in ATTR cardiomyopathy. The sNDA for patisiran is under FDA review based on the positive results of the APOLLO-B study, and as we recently announced, the application will be discussed at the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee on September 13th. We also announced today that enrollment in a US expanded access protocol for patisiran that was open shortly after the APOLLO-B readout last August has completed. The EAP was established to provide access to patisiran for patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy who've had an inadequate response to or cannot tolerate currently available treatment. The EAP was offered at 20 centers in the United States and the pre-specified enrollment target of 200 patients was met in about 10 months, indicating significant demand for this potential therapy. Another important recent update on patisiran was the presentation of 18-month results from APOLLO-B at the recent ESC Heart Failure Meeting. As a reminder, after the 12-month double-blind period of the study, all patients were eligible to receive patisiran during the open-label extension period of the trial. In the new analysis, we were very encouraged to see that favorable effects on functional capacity as assessed by the six-minute walk test, as well as on health status and quality of life as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire were sustained in patients receiving patisiran through 18 months. According to both of these endpoints, patisiran appeared to slow the decline in functional ability and health status that is typical for this disease. And similarly in patients who receive placebo during the double-blind period, initiation of patisiran in the OLE period was associated with initial evidence of stabilization, both six-minute block test and KCCQ relative to the double-blind period. Importantly, patisiran continued to demonstrate an encouraging safety profile through 18 months of treatment with no new safety concerns identified. We saw encouraging evidence of efficacy with other secondary and exploratory endpoints as well. Continued treatment with patisiran through 18 months was associated with relative stability in both NT-proBNP, a measure of cardiac stress and Troponin I, a measure of cardiac injury. And patients who rolled over from placebo to active treatment during the OLE saw slowing in relative stabilization of the rapid increases that were seen during the double-blind period. In addition, while the APOLLO-B study was not designed to show benefits on outcomes of hospitalizations or death, we were encouraged to see non-significant trends favoring patisiran treatment in these outcome endpoints, with extended follow-up during the OLE period. As we previously announced, we've submitted the 18 months results to the FDA as an amendment to our sNDA for patisiran, we look forward to continuing our engagement with the agency, including at the upcoming advisory committee and if patisiran is approved, expanding its label to bring patisiran to patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. We were also very excited to share initial human proof-of-concept data on ALN-APP, our first RNAi therapeutic designed for CNS delivery, which is in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. At the AAIC Congress in July, we presented updated positive interim results from the Phase 1 study in patients with Early-Onset Alzheimer's disease. At the time of this interim look, 20 patients had been enrolled in three single dose cohorts in Part A of the ongoing Phase 1 study. To date, we've studied three dose levels, 25, 50, and 75 milligrams with four to six patients dosed in each cohort. Excitingly, ALN-APP treatment resulted in rapid dose dependent and sustained reductions of both soluble APP alpha and beta, biomarkers of target engagement in the CSF. We saw rapid knockdown as early as day 15 and observed maximum knockdown of 84%, 90% respectively for soluble APP alpha and beta. And at the highest dose tested 75 milligrams, the median knockdown was greater than 55% for both biomarkers and sustained for at least six months. The safety of single doses of ALN-APP has been encouraging as well. All adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, and CSF parameters have not revealed any significant abnormalities to date. Further exploration of single doses of ALN-APP is ongoing in Part A. In addition, Part B, the multiple dose part of the study has been initiated in Canada where the majority of the Part A clinical trial patients were enrolled. The multiple dose part of the study remains on partial clinical hold in the United States due to findings observed in prior non-clinical chronic toxicology studies. In some, I'm thrilled about these impressive human data that provide the first ever evidence that we may be able to use RNAi to sign up disease causing transcripts from the CNS and look forward to providing additional program updates in the future. Let me now turn to recent progress with zilebesiran in development for the treatment of hypertension. We're very excited to recently announce the Phase 1 data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine, highlighting the medical importance of the substantial and durable lowering of blood pressure seen with single doses of zilebesiran. This now marks Alnylam's 11th publication in this prestigious medical journal. Yvonne has already highlighted the exciting collaboration with Roche we recently announced for the development commercialization of zilebesiran on the basis of these impressive Phase 1 data. We're now looking forward to results of the KARDIA-1 dose ranging study, which is on track for top line data in Q3. In addition, we're also pleased to have recently completed enrollment in the KARDIA Phase 2 -- KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study, which aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of zilebesiran in patients with uncontrolled hypertension when added on top of other anti-hypertensive medications. We expect to report top line results from this study in early 2024.  These are just a few highlights from our broad and innovative pipeline driven by our underlying organic product engine that we expect will deliver sustainable growth for Alnylam in the years to come. With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results in upcoming milestones. Jeff? I think you've really covered it, Yvonne. I think, it really is -- we're -- our preparations underway. We feel really good about the data set that's been generated with APOLLO-B, and what we're seeing is evidence of stabilization across a series of endpoints, which is really critically important. Patients with this disease really value their functional ability and their quality of life. And what we're seeing across multiple measures is that patisiran appears to enable that, and that's reconfirmed with the extended OE data that we submitted. And we look forward to presenting that to the advisory committee as they -- to their review. Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks Ritu. Look, in terms of the AdCom preparations, we're again entering into the period where we're trying to -- we're really pulling together aspects of our preparation. We feel very good about how the team is prepared for this. And it's all based on incredibly strong data coming out of APOLLO-B and reaffirmed by the OEL data that we talked about early -- and earlier. And really it's the fact that across multiple measures, within the study, looking at endpoints like functional ability and quality of life, the biomarker data that are predictive of longer term outcomes, we're seeing evidence of relative stability. Patients who get on this drug appear to have less progressive decline. And we shared data last year at R&D Day showing favorable impacts on progression on NYHA Class and ATTR disease stage. So, all of this really paint a picture of delayed progression when patients are put on a silencer with this disease. And that's really important. We keep hearing from clinicians in the field that that's really important to patients. These are patients in their seventies and eighties. They value their functional ability and their quality of life. And so, these changes are meaningful to them. And I think what I can say is that the AdCom will be pulling together those various arguments. We've received a lot of support both from the data side, but also from external key opinion leaders, et cetera. And so, we'll look forward to making those points at the advisory committee and interacting with the agency and the panel there. Vis-a-vis BridgeBio, look, I think what I would say is, first of all, it's great news for patients. It looks like there may be potentially an additional medicine as we kind of learn more about this data and an additional stabilizer for patients with this disease. And I think it hats off to the patients, the investigators, and the colleagues at BridgeBio because it was -- it's been a challenging time and it's great to see that they've pulled out what looks to be a very positive study in that regard. I think as it relates to our franchise, we really remain excited about what the silencer profile looks to be. Again, building on what I just said about APOLLO-B emerging data that we're seeing, again, not statistically significant, but emerging trends with regard to outcomes coming out of APOLLO-B both on mortality and hospitalization. And I think the key, we'll be looking for more data at the ESC meeting. But I think what the results highlight is that in -- while we are diagnosing patients earlier with this disease, and that's been a big question in the field, these patients still endure ongoing progression. So that in APOLLO-B looks like that's reaffirmed in the BridgeBio data and an effective therapy can show a benefit to that population. And I think that reaffirms the design elements of HELIOS-B. So we're very excited about that as well. Yeah. Look, I think, as it relates to TAF drop-in rate, I think as we've talked about in the past, we've got careful measures in place and the way that the study was designed, and we feel good about the drop-in rate, that's there. It's substantially below our internal assumptions as we design the study. We're not going to provide any more specific updates on that, but we're very encouraged by what we're seeing with regard to that and about the overall design of the study. The study allows for a proportion of patients to be on background tafamidis, entering into the study just like we did in the APOLLO-B study. As we've said our targets were around 50%, but we've operationally come in below that. And so, I think we will get interesting data emerging from that study in terms of how the drug functions as a monotherapy, but as well as on top of background tafamidis. Yeah. Maury, thanks. When the APOLLO-B data came out, it posed -- it brought forward the potential for an alternative mechanism for patients with this disease. As we've talked about multiple times during the call, these patients despite available standard-of-care therapy with tafamidis, continue to progress. And so what we did was establish an expanded access program, that at 20 US centers that enabled patients who were experiencing progression or were otherwise intolerant of available therapy to avail themselves with patisiran with their physician support. So that was open at 20 centers.  And as I mentioned, that enrolled actually relatively rapidly, we had 200 patients. It was actually on the order of about three patients every two days that was enrolled -- two patients every three days -- sorry, that was enrolled in this EAP program. And it really highlights, I think, what we've been saying and what we've been hearing a lot from the clinical community and the patient communities that patients continue to progress with this disease and they need additional therapies. And so, I think that's important as we think about bringing forward patisiran in this disease. And then, hopefully patisiran as well based on the results of HELIOS-B. Sure. So, Ellie, I think there's a multitude of approaches to conducting survival analysis and outcome analysis that take advantage of the fact that you're looking at recurrent events and events over time. And our statisticians obviously spend a lot of time thinking about what's the optimal way to demonstrate the clinical benefit. And that's highlighted in a statistical analysis plan that's aligned with the agency. In this instance, one of the reasons for preferring the Andersen-Gill is the fact that there we allow for variable follow up in the context of the outcomes analysis. And the Andersen-Gill really allows us to fully leverage that, whereas other approaches would allow us to use a fixed time of follow-up, and frankly the shortest amount of follow up. So, we think it gives us a little bit of an analytic or power advantage to do it that way. With regard to the various components of the endpoint, I think what's really important, Ellie, is maybe just a larger picture. We're trying to capture clinically relevant events that connote to heart failure worsening, and the need for care in patients with this disease. And so that's why care is increasingly provided in different geographies, in different places, including in hospitals and urgent care centers, et cetera. And so, we look at the totality of all of that as indicating clinically relevant heart failure events that we may have an opportunity to affect with an effective therapy. And that's why that we've kind of captured that aspect in the endpoint structure. Yeah. Thanks Gena for your questions. Look, I think in terms of the drop-in rates, as you can imagine, is over the course of a three-year plus study, you're going to see those rates are going to evolve over time. What I can say is that the rates are -- the drop-in rates are significantly below our planning assumptions. And so, we feel very good about the overall powering of the study. There's a multitude of factors that contribute to how a study is powered, et cetera, and how that's going to turn out. And again, when we look at all of those elements, we feel good about the study.  In terms of event rates, of course, we have a cracker jack clinical and statistical team, they're responsible for monitoring a study, and ensuring the quality of the data that come in and the integrity of the study. And we feel, again, really positive about what we're seeing overall. And we have a long history of people in that -- in those teams who've designed and executed really successfully team -- studies in this field, including APOLLO-B, and so again, we feel very good about what we're doing here with HELIOS-B. Yeah. Leland, I think it's a really insightful question in the sense that this -- we've seen epidemiologically that with rise in fructose consumption, we've seen parallel increases both in diabetes, overweight, NASH, and a number of metabolic syndrome type diseases that all travel together. And it's entirely possible that by perturbing this pathway with a RNAi mechanism, that we actually may have beneficial effects in a number of these different domains. So, what's exciting here is that we have, what we think is a really potent and based on pre-clinically durable, way to silence KHK, that we can elaborate and we have a number of biomarkers that we can measure in the clinic that will help guide us along the path in terms of which of these indications to pursue, how to pursue them, et cetera. And this is also then a proprietary target within Alnylam that we're advancing. And so, we have really freedom to operate across a full range of diseases, and take it where the science and the unmet need drives us. So, look forward to sharing more data on that in the future. Yeah. So, thanks Sarah for the question. I think, look, as I said in the remarks, and as you've heard from us in a couple of recent calls, I think what we've seen in the CNS space with ALN-APP has been really we think groundbreaking. It really opens up a whole new vista where we can take RNAi therapeutics to affect a wide variety of neuro-degenerative diseases and beyond in the CNF. When you look at what we see there, we see with the levels of up to 84%, 90% lower of lowering of soluble APP alpha and beta, that really signifies that we're getting deep brain penetration. That's always a big question as you're trying to think about additional targets that you can pursue, can you get into the deeper brain structures? And that level of knockdown signifies that. And then you have durability where we're seeing knockdown pre-clinically that's now translating clinically and comper [ph] to what we saw in the liver. And we think these drugs can be dosed six months a year, or every six months or even less frequently. And so, that's exciting. And then the third, and most critically frankly, is the fact that so far the solubility, this safety and tolerability is really encouraging as well. And so, this really opens up for us the opportunity to pursue multiple targets with our colleagues at Regeneron, who've been -- we've been working on in, in terms of this groundbreaking science. And so, to your point, HTT is another molecule that we recently announced as a development candidate. We're doing preclinical work now, IND enabling work to bring that into the clinic. We haven't formally announced a timeline for that, but you can imagine that we're pursuing that rapidly. Our colleagues at Regeneron are advancing a molecule against for ALS, against SOD, also in preclinical development right now. And we have additional targets behind that that we're going to bring forward."

            "name": "Jeff Poulton",
            "content": "Thanks Pushkal, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam's Q2 2023 financial results and discussing our full year guidance. Starting with the summary of our P&L results for the second quarter. Total product revenues for the quarter were $306 million or 43% growth versus Q2 2022. Tolga previously indicated the increase is primarily related to growth in TTR product revenues driven by the launch of AMVUTTRA in the US in the third quarter of 2022, as well as increased patients on GIVLAARI and OXLUMO therapies. The impact of foreign exchange rates on our product sales has moderated on a year-over-year basis with constant exchange rate growth now only 1% higher than our reported 43% year-over-year growth. Net revenues from collaborations for the quarter were $6 million or 35% decrease compared with the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to operating variability, including the level of work reimbursed in our collaboration with Regeneron. Royalty revenue during the quarter was $7 million, which was driven by Novartis's sales of Leqvio, which launched in the US in the first quarter of 2022. Despite the modest growth for revenues from collaborations and royalties, we remain confident in achieving a full year result with our $100 million to $175 million guidance range, primarily driven by our Regeneron collaboration and Leqvio royalties and milestones. Gross margin on product sales was 75% in the quarter, representing a 9% decrease compared with the second quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to fees incurred associated with canceling manufacturing commitments for ONPATTRO and other adjustments to inventory as demand for ONPATTRO continues to decrease driven by ongoing patients switching to AMVUTTRA.  Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 11% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increases in headcount to support our R&D pipeline and development expenses associated with the KARDIA-1, KARDIA-2 Phase 2 clinical studies. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 14% in the second quarter compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increased headcount and other investments supporting our strategic growth including the global launch of AMVUTTRA. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter was $154 million, representing a $7 million improvement compared with Q2 2022, driven by strong top line growth offset by more moderate growth and operating expenses. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.1 billion compared to $2.2 billion at the end of 2022, with a decrease primarily due to our operating loss year to date. We continue to believe our current cash balance is sufficient to bridge us to a self-sustainable financial profile. Now I'd like to turn to our full year 2023 financial guidance where we are reiterating our previously issued guidance. Starting with net product revenues, we continue to anticipate combined net product revenues for our four commercialized products will be between $1.2 billion and $1.285 billion. Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties remains a range between $100 million and $175 million. And our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses remains unchanged and has arranged between $1.575 billion and $1.65 billion. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones slated for mid and late 2023. We will, of course, be executing on global commercialization of our four commercial products. With patisiran, we look forward to the upcoming meeting of the Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee on September 13th with the PDUFA date shortly thereafter on October 8th. Later this quarter, we expect to report top line results from the KARDIA-1 Phase 2 study of zilebesiran. We also intend to report top line results from Phase 1 studies of ALN-TTRsc04, and development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis and ALN-KHK and development for the treatment of type two diabetes. Our partnered programs Sanofi expects to report additional results from the Phase 3 ATLAS program with patisiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic and development for the treatment of hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors. Additionally, Vir expects to report further results from Phase 2 combination trials of ALN-HBV02, and development for the treatment of chronic HPV infection. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? Yeah. Let me just clarify that. So, the substantial near term development milestones that we had referenced when we announced the deal are, there's actually $365 million in potential development milestones that we could earn, and that's broken down as $65 million for the initiation of KARDIA-3, which is the additional Phase 2 study that Pushkal talked about on the deal call. And we expect that study to initiate next year. And then an additional $300 million for the first patient in on the CPOT [ph], the Phase 3 study. So taken together, that's the $365 million. When you look at that in combination with the development cost sharing, where Roche will put 60% of the bill and Alnylam will put 40% of the bill, really, from an out-of-pocket perspective for Alnylam to take this drug forward to the market really minimizes the financial burden for us, which allows us to then reallocate capital across our pipeline and hopefully drive additional growth."

            "content": "Thanks Christine and thank you everyone for joining the call today. In the second quarter of 2023, we continue to make great progress across our business. Starting with our commercial performance, the AMVUTTRA launch once again drove strong growth in our TTR franchise with 46% year-over-year growth and in total product sales with 43% year-over-year growth compared to the second quarter of 2022. We also delivered strong execution across our clinical pipeline, where notable results included positive 18 months data from our APOLLO-B Phase 3 study, reaffirming the potential of patisiran in ATTR amyloidosis of cardiomyopathy. In July, we shared updated positive interim results from the Phase 1 study of ALN-APP in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease, showing rapid and robust target engagement with sustained effect of six months with a single dose and an encouraging clinical safety and tolerability profile. Additionally, our team executed on the business development side. Most notably, we entered into a strategic partnership with Roche for the development and commercialization of zilebesiran, providing us with what we believe is a remarkable opportunity to bring forward a potentially transformative program with a potential to disrupt the global treatment paradigm for hypertension. We're also pleased to announce this morning that following our full cooperation with the government, the US Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts has now concluded and closed their case regarding the marketing and promotion of ONPATTRO in the US with no action. Operating with integrity has always been and will continue to be called to our Alnylam and we will continue to hold our business conduct, and in particular our interactions with healthcare providers and patients, the highest ethical standards. As we move into the back half of 2023, we have several important catalysts, including the initial data from our KARDIA Phase 2 program zilebesiran, and pending a successful AdCom and positive regulatory review, the potential launch of ONPATTRO and ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. We believe all of this puts us on track with our Alnylam P5x25 goals, making Alnylam a top tier biotech company, developing and commercializing transformative medicines for rare diseases and beyond for patients around the world, driven by a high yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering exceptional financial results. Further, before I hand the call over, I'm very pleased to share that Akshay Vaishnaw Alnylam's President and Key Scientific Leader will be transitioning to a new and exciting role within the organization, serving as our first Chief Innovation officer. Akshay has been at the helm of driving science and innovation with Alnylam for nearly 18 years, and that effort has yielded an entirely new class of medicines. In his new role Akshay will become the company's key innovation leader, focused on the future of our R&D engine, which is the lifeblood of how we have and will continue to drive our research and development programs into transformative medicines as we continue to build a top tier biotech company. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga? So, thank you for that question. Clearly, we're actively preparing for the advisory committee. We're really looking forward to presenting the data that we have from APOLLO-B. Whilst there are no specific questions at this time, we believe that the topics are going to be focused on the clinical meaningfulness of changes in the six-minute walk test and the KCCQ, particularly given the fairly recent FDA guidance around the utility of these endpoints and in patients with heart failure. We really believe that we have compelling data for APOLLO-B study across a wide range of endpoints and supported by additional validation from the recent 18-month data that has Pushkal described. We have submitted to the FDA. Pushkal, anything else to add? Thanks Pushkal. Next question? That's a great question, and a good opportunity for clarification. I'll pass it on to Jeff in a moment, but I just wanted to remind everybody that really what we feel that we have here in our hands with zilebesiran is a game changing therapy for patients with hypertension, really to maximize the value and drive a successful global product launch. We want to come to the market with cardiovascular outcomes data to help inform the various stakeholders. And obviously, that's a significant endeavor. And the collaboration with Roche allows us to bring together our leadership and RNAi is what is their proven global commercial footprint and capabilities and help us maximize the resources and capabilities in order to be successful here. But I think it's important to be specific about the -- about some of the details of the milestones. So Jeff, maybe you could\u2026 That's great, Jeff. Thank you. Next question? Yeah. Two great questions. So, I'll take the question on the PDUFA data and then I'll hand over to Tolga to speak to your overall franchise question around using the dynamics between ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA. We're continuing to anticipate a PDUFA date of October, the eighth, and we're working towards that. If that changes, of course, we'll communicate any new information. But as of this moment, we are continuing to expect the PDUFA date of October, the eighth. Tolga, do you want to turn to the question on ONPATTRO dynamics? Yeah, thanks. Thanks. Thanks Dave. Let's turn to the next question. So, thank you for that question. Look, I'm personally delighted that Akshay is going to take on this opportunity to become our first Chief Innovation Officer and that capacity continue to focus on helping to deliver continued success with respect to our R&D organization. We're also delighted that we've built a really strong, robust capability across the research and development organization. And that's allowed Akshay to be able to focus more specifically on innovation as we build a top tier biotech company. So, I think this is a terrific step forward for the company. There's no specific reason for this timing other than the fact that actually felt that that we're now in a position where we have a really strong capability, which allows him to take on a much more focused role for the company and he'll continue to be involved in all the important upcoming catalysts and milestones that you've just described. He's not on the call today because he's actually on vacation, but I'm sure we will -- we may well hear him on a upcoming call in the future. So, thanks for that question, Paul. Thanks Ritu. There are kind of few questions there and we sort of -- maybe sort of unpick them. So, in terms of our AdCom preparations, any additional data that we're providing the FDA beyond the 18-month data that we've already referenced. And then secondly, kind of is any shifts in understanding with respect to the endpoint selection. So, I mean, Pushkal, maybe you could those two questions. Okay. So, two questions there for you, but maybe I'll just start off by saying that we're actually really pleased to see the BridgeBio results because it really kind of reaffirms that even if patients were diagnosed earlier in the disease, they continue to have disease progression where an effective therapy, is able to demonstrate benefits in these earlier stage patients. So, I think, we're actually really kind of pleased that this gives us increased confidence actually in delivering a successful HELIOS-B. But Pushkal, maybe you can talk specifically about the TAF imbalance in -- TAF drop-in rates, potential impact on HELIOS-B and also, thinking about combination approaches stabilizes and silences. Thanks. Next question please. Hi, Maury. Yeah. Pushkal, that's a question for you around the EAP types of patients and then also thinking about how these data may be used going forward. Yeah. Thanks Pushkal. I think the point about continued unmet medical need is really the important one here. See the patients who are continuing to progress and patients that need alternative therapeutic approaches. Next question, please. Pushkal, there's maybe two questions for you. Tolga, there's two questions for you. The first relating to home infusion and the second I think relating to vutrisiran, how we're thinking about differentiation. Thanks for the question, Gena. Yeah. That's a great question. And just remind everybody that KHK is a genetically validated target involves the metabolism of [indiscernible] and that's relevant to the development of diabetes. And as you point out, obesity as well. And clearly we're focused in our Phase 1 study addressing, target engagement and safety, and also looking at a range of relevant biomarkers with respect to glucose metabolism and insulin levels. But I think you raised an interesting question, which is that broad potential of KHK and metabolism in general. Pushkal, maybe you want to provide some perspective? Great. And yeah, thank you for highlighting, I think, another exciting opportunity in our pipeline and more to come towards the end of the year. Next question? The timelines for ALN-APP and any other programs using -- sorry. So HTT. I think we have time for one last question. Tolga, I'm going to hand that question straight over to you."

Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks Christine and thank you everyone for joining the call today. 2023 is off to a great start with AMVUTTRA launch continuing its strong growth with Q1 delivering 48% growth in total product sales compares the first quarter of 2022. We've also made great strides of our pipeline, including the recent exciting announcement of positive interim results from the Phase 1 study of ALN-APP, our investigational RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These results mark a significant milestone for Alnylam as we believe they establish human proof-of-concept for RNAi therapeutics in the CNS and potentially unlock many additional opportunities where we may be able to address significant unmet medical needs. We also have a number of exciting upcoming milestones that highlight the depth and breadth of our pipeline, which includes the presentation of 18-month results from the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study of patisiran at ESC-HF later this month and top line results from the KARDIA-1 Phase 2 study of zilebesiran in patients with hypertension expected in mid 2023. This execution is in line with our focus on the following key drivers for Alnylam's growth over next several years. First is the potential near-term expansion of our TTR franchise opportunity where we aim to become a global leader in delivering impactful and highly differentiated medicines to patients. Second is our expansion beyond rare diseases to also address more common disease areas. And the third growth driver for the company comes from our sustainable innovation engine comprised of new platform enhancements, opportunities with extrahepatic delivery and our ability to find new genetically validated targets, which can drive further pipeline expansion to 2025 and beyond. We believe all of this puts us on track with our Alnylam P5x25 goals making Alnylam a top tier biotech, developing and commercializing transformative medicines for rare diseases and beyond for patients around the world driven by a high yielding pipeline of firsts and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic products engine all while delivering exceptional financial results.  With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks, Yvonne, and good morning everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter for our commercial portfolio driven by our TTR franchise and the strength of our ongoing launch of AMVUTTRA as we delivered 48% total product sales growth or 52% on a content exchange rate basis compared with the first quarter of 2022. Let me now turn to a summary of our first quarter TTR performance. Our TTR franchise achieved $204 million in global net product revenues for ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA representing a 7% increase compared with the fourth quarter and a solid 49% growth compared with the first quarter of 2022. With the U.S. market year-over-year growth standing out at a robust 75% driven by the ongoing launch of AMVUTTRA, at the end of the first quarter over 3,160 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA treatment worldwide, up from over 2,975 patients at the end of the fourth quarter, representing 6% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S. combined sales of ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA increased 5% versus the fourth quarter and were primarily impacted by the following. A 7% increase in demand, which was driven by the strength of ongoing AMVUTTRA patient uptake more than offsetting the decrease in patients on ONPATTRO that switched to AMVUTTRA, inventory dynamics decreased reported growth by approximately 3% as ONPATTRO inventory in the channel continues to decrease with ongoing patients switching to AMVUTTRA. Overall in the U.S., we continue to be very pleased with the impact we're seeing from AMVUTTRA in expanding the opportunity for our TTR franchise as reflected by the robust 75% year-over-year quarterly growth that we achieved in Q1, representing the third consecutive quarter of achieving TTR growth in excess of 70% on a year over year basis in the US following AMVUTTRA's launch in the third quarter of 2022. Additionally, key operating metrics continue to trend favorably including growth in new patient start forms, the switch rate from ONPATTRO, patient compliance rates and the expansion of our prescriber base. In our international markets, total TTR Q1 product sales increased 9% versus the fourth quarter driven by strong demand in Japan following the fourth quarter launch of AMVUTTRA offset by inventory destocking in Japan. The AMVUTTRA demand growth in Japan is particularly encouraging with the new patient growth being driven by a mix of switches from tafamidis as well as patients naive to therapy. Additionally and importantly ONPATTRO continue to deliver steady growth in markets where AMVUTTRA is not yet launched, positioning these markets for the upcoming AMVUTTRA launch. ONPATTRO also benefited from the timing of orders in our distributor markets. Our global results continue to be challenged by foreign exchange headwinds with total TTR year-over-year reported growth of 49%, held back 5 percentage points due to changes in FX rates. Now moving to our ultra rare products and the performance of GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, which delivered $72 million in combined product sales during the first quarter, representing a 2% increase compared with the fourth quarter and a more robust 45% growth compared with the first quarter of 2022. We ended the quarter with more than 550 patients on GIVLAARI commercial therapy and more than 300 patients on OXLUMO commercial therapy representing 6% and 7% quarterly growth compared with the year end 2022 for GIVLAARI and OXLUMO respectively. For GIVLAARI, global growth of 2% in Q1 compared with the fourth quarter was impacted by the following. A decline in U.S. growth of 3% primarily due to reduced patient compliance associated with the seasonal impact from the annual pre-authorization required by payers during the first quarter that we expect will recover in subsequent quarters. Growth in our international markets increased 11% as demand increased in European markets and also benefited from the timing of orders in our distributor markets. For OXLUMO, global growth of 1% in Q1 compared with the fourth quarter was impacted by the following. U.S. reported growth increased 3% driven by an increase in patient demand. Growth in international markets was flat with a demand increase in European markets offset by the timing of orders in our distributor markets. Additionally, changes in year-over-year foreign exchange rates negatively impacted Q1 GIVLAARI and OXLUMO reported growth by 3 and 4 percentage points respectively. In conclusion, we are pleased with the growth in revenues, particularly with the ongoing signs of strong performance associated with the AMVUTTRA launch, which we believe represents an important therapy option for hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy and an accelerated growth opportunity for our TTR franchise. With that, I will now turn it over to Akshay to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Akshay?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Thanks Tolga and good morning everyone. I'd like to start today with a recap of recent news that marks a very important milestone for Alnylam and the broader field of RNAi therapeutics, which is our progress with ALN-APP, an investigational RNAi therapeutics in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. As announced last week, we reported the first ever clinical results within RNAi therapeutic directed to the CNS. Given the importance of the positive data and the intense interest in the study from all parties concerned not least patients and physicians, I think it's worthwhile to further discuss the interim findings from our ALN-APP program. ALN-APP targets amyloid precursor protein, or APP, which we're investigating as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or CAA. Human genetics have shown that certain mutations or duplications in the APP gene can cause early onset Alzheimer's disease where amyloid plaques forming brain tissue and are associated with neurodegeneration. Other mutations in the same gene can cause CAA where A beta fragments distinct from those that aggregate to form Alzheimer's plaque deposit within the walls of blood vessels in the brain and results bleeds. CAA is in fact the second leading cause of intracerebral hemorrhage. So this one parent protein APP can be harmful into distinct pathophysiological processes. In animal studies, we've shown that targeting APP with an siRNA show great promise with broad CNS biodistribution after a single intrathecal injection as shown on the left here with knockdown in all major CNS cell types to the neuron, oligodendrocytes, microglia and astrocytes. On the right, we can see that a single 60 milligram intrathecal dose in non-human primates results in significant and sustained target knockdown with durable \u2013 durability out to six months at which time the experiment was terminated, but APP suppression was still ongoing. These pharmacologic findings, which were reliable, reproducible and appeared safe, increased their excitement around the therapeutic hypothesis, specifically that by lowering APP protein production in the CNS, the RNAi mechanism, we could reduce the downstream fragments that aggregate and deposit in tissues and that therefore hopefully alter the disease force. To support advancement to clinical testing, we conducted short-term IND-enabling GLP toxicology studies in the rat and non-human primate where two low, medium and high doses were given them on the part, i.e., where we greatly exaggerated dose and regimen relative to that expected in the clinic. These studies demonstrated a supportive safety profile and no significant CNS histopathology and thereby enable the ALN-APP Phase 1 study. The Phase 1 trial is designed as a two-part study, a single ascending dose, Part A, followed by a multiple dose, Part B. Part A was enabled by the GLP toxicology studies I've just mentioned. The Phase 1 is being conducted in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease. The primary endpoint of this study is safety and tolerability of ALN-APP. Secondary objectives are focused on characterizing the pharmacology of ALN-APP. The study also includes a variety of exploratory biomarkers, which will allow us to assess whether the ALN-APP is showing any impact on other biomarkers of disease progression. The interim data shared from the initial single-ascending dose cohorts and we continue enrolling in Part A as we explore further doses. Excuse me. At the time of this interim look, 20 patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease have been enrolled in three single dose cohorts in Part A of the ongoing Phase 1 study. Today, ALN-APP has been well tolerated with no study dropouts and all adverse events being mild or moderate in severity. Available CSF data from white blood cells and protein appear similar to placebo. Neurofilament light chain or NFL, which is a mark of neuronal damage and which may be elevated in drug-induced neurotoxicity, was also monitored. Reassuringly early data for NFL, which are currently available from two out of the three cohorts study to date also, looked comparable to the placebo. Now let's look at the pharmacodynamic results after single intrathecal doses. To date, we've studied three dose levels, 25 milligrams, 50 milligrams and 75 milligrams; all available data to three-month time point are shown. Excitingly, we observed that unlike placebo, ALN-APP treatment resulted in rapid, dose-dependent and sustained reductions of both sAPP\u03b1 and soluble APP\u03b2. Both biomarkers of target engagement in the CSF. We saw rapid knockdown as early as Day 15 and observed maximum knockdown of up to 84%, 90% respectively for APP\u03b1 and APP\u03b2. At the highest dose tested 75 milligrams, the median lockdown was greater than 70% for both biomarkers and sustained for at least three months. Initially, per protocol, we intended to dose escalate from 75 to 225 milligrams. However, given that the knockdown observed at 75 milligrams substantially exceeded our initial target of 50% biomarker knockdown, we chose to deescalate to 50 milligrams. As you can see at 50 milligrams, while we have more limited data set, it appears equally promising and similar to the 75 milligram dose with substantial knockdown for both APP\u03b1 and beta. Now notably, the durability we see in humans reflects what we saw in non-human primary studies where single doses gave similar profound durable knockdown extending to six months or beyond. Accordingly, we anticipate that the responses we see here in Part A will continue. Indeed, for the data available beyond three months in this human study, we see continued target suppression. This durability of effect is important for ALN-APP, as well as our overall CNS assays as it suggests the potential for infrequent dosing. We look forward to seeing with longer follow-up indeed how long this knockdown effect is sustained. We believe these data suggest that the drug will be able to dosed quarterly at most, and based on animal data and the translation of our platform in humans, we believe that the potential team dose every six months or less frequently. Enrollment in the single sending dose portion of the Phase 1 study is ongoing in Canada, the Netherlands, the UK, and the United States. Additionally, enrollment in Part A will allow us to continue to explore single dose PK and PD and characterize the durability and effect \u2013 and long-term safety. Results from Part A will also inform the doses and regimens to be put forward into Part B, a multiple dose portion of the study, which will include patients from Part A. In parallel to Part A of the Phase 1 study, we conducted chronic GLP toxicology studies in animals to support the multi-dose Part B of the Phase 1. These chronic GLP tox studies were conducted without knowledge of the impressive knockdown and durability we see today at low doses of ALN-APP, we see in this Phase 1 study. So, as a standard practice, we exaggerated doses and dosing frequency relative to any dose and regimen that would ultimately be used in clinical testing. Specifically, we administered low, medium, and high intrathecal doses monthly for six months in the rat and every other month for nine months in the non-human primates. The data from the chronic studies have been shared with regulatory authorities. Before, we have already received regulatory approval to begin Part B in Canada, where in fact the majority of the chronic patients have been enrolled to date and approval is pending in the UK and Netherlands. In the U.S. the FDA has currently placed a partial clinical hold on the multidose Part B of the Phase 1 study due to findings observed in chronic toxicology studies. Of course, given the high exposure that we achieved with frequent administration of high doses, it's not unexpected that we would observe findings in these chronic toxicology studies. However, it's important to contextualize exposures by relative CSF volumes between toxicology species and humans. For example, relative to a potential clinical dose and regimen of 75 milligrams, given every six months, there is a more than ten-fold greater annualized exposure at all doses tested in the rat and non-human primate. And at the top doses evaluated in those chronic tox studies there's a 75-fold and 50-fold greater annualized exposure in rat and non-human primates respectively, relative to the same potential human dose. And if we scale based on organ weight, then these are annualized exposures would be even greater in the chronic tox studies. I want to nevertheless acknowledge that the FDA will be the ultimate arbiter of the data and we look forward to getting further guidance from them. Accordingly, we plan to engage with them to discuss all preclinical information, as well as these new interim Phase 1 clinical data, which provides important context to support potentially initiation of Part B in the U.S. To close this part of the discussion, I'm absolutely thrilled about these incredible human data that provide the first ever evidence that we may be able to use RNAi to find those disease causing transcription in the CNS. In animal studies, we've already demonstrated the reproducible and modular nature of our CNS platform with the knockdown against the diverse range of targets and hope that we can address disease causing genes not just for Alzheimer's, CAA, ALS and Huntington\u2019s, but also many other disorders. We look forward to presenting these interim data from Part A of the Phase 1 ALN-APP study at an upcoming medical congress. With that, let me turn to our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis where we are advancing three clinical stage product candidates, namely patisiran, vutrisiran and ALN-TTRsc04. As you know, ONPATTRO currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat hereditary ATTR Amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and we are committed to expanding the product's label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. As announced in February, we are delighted that our supplemental New Drug Application patisiran for cardiomyopathy of ATTR Amyloidosis has been accepted by the FDA with a standard review and a PDUFA date of October 8. In their file acceptance letter, the FDA stated that they have not identified any review issues. The agency also noted that they're planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. Currently, we have no further details from the FDA regarding the timing of the outcome or the specific topics they wish to discuss. When we learn more, we will communicate that information in due course. If the sNDA is approved, this will allow us to extend the potential benefits of patisiran to many patients with wild-type and hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. This filing is based on the pivotal APOLLO-B study, which demonstrated improved functional status and quality of life in patients with at ATTR Amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy given patisiran for 12 months relative to placebo. The clinical profile of patisiran is supported by an encouraging safety profile and exploratory data that favored patisiran treatment relative to placebo on various biomarkers of disease progression at month 12. We've announced this morning that 18-month data from the APOLLO-B study have been submitted to the FDA as part of the sNDA review and we will be presenting these results at the ESC heart failure meet at the end of May. Now, similar to ONPATTRO, we are also committed to expanding the label for AMVUTTRA to include the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis. This is being done with the HELIOS-B Phase 3 study of investigational vutrisiran. HELIOS-B, which is fully enrolled, has an endpoint of all-cause mortality and CV events assessed after at least 30 and up to 36 months, and we remain on track to share top line results in early 2024. Wrapping up with ALN-TTRsc04 is an investigational RNAi therapeutic based on our IKARIA platform offers the potential for more durable and potent TTR silencing with the possibility for annual dosing, a potentially transformative profile. ALN-TTRsc04 has entered the clinic and begun dosing in the Phase 1 study, and we expect top line results in late 2023. In addition to our late-stage clinical programs, we believe we've also been making great progress with our early- and mid-stage programs. Notable, our highlight includes zilebesiran, our investigational RNAi therapeutic for hypertension, which we believe could transform the treatment of the disease and offer a highly differentiated profile from all existing antihypertensives, including oral RAS inhibitors. We look forward to the important upcoming milestones from the Phase 2 program and remain on track to deliver top line results from KARDIA-1 in mid-2023 and top line results from KARDIA-2 at or around year-end 2023. These are just a few of the highlights from our broad and innovative pipeline driven by our underlying organic product engine \u2013 where we expect to deliver sustainable innovation representing a key growth driver for Alnylam in the years to come. To wrap up these highlights, we're excited to have initiated dosing in the Phase 1 study of ALN-KHK for the potential treatment of Type 2 diabetes with Regeneron has announced initiation of a Phase 2 study of ALN-HSD in patients with NASH. Now with that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review you our financials and upcoming milestones. Jeff?\nJeff Poulton: Thanks, Akshay. And good morning, everyone. I am pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam\u2019s Q1 2023 financial results and discussing our full year guidance. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for the first quarter. Total product revenues for the quarter were $276 million or 48% growth versus Q1 2022. As Tolga previously indicated, the increase is primarily related to growth in TTR product revenues driven by the launch of AMVUTTRA in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2022 as well as increased patients on GIVLAARI and OXLUMO therapies. It's also worth noting that year-over-year growth in combined product revenues was held back by approximately four percentage points due to impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Net revenue from collaborations for the first quarter was approximately $36 million, representing a 41% increase compared with Q1 2022, primarily due to an increase in revenue from our collaboration arrangements with Regeneron attributed to an increase in reimbursable activities under our research services arrangement in addition to an increase in revenue recognized associated with license programs within the collaboration. Royalty revenue during the quarter was $7 million, which was driven by Novartis\u2019 sales of Leqvio, which launched in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2022. Gross margin on product sales was 85% in Q1, representing a 2% decrease compared with the first quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by increased royalties due to Sanofi on sales of AMVUTTRA, which was partially offset by lower manufacturing costs for AMVUTTRA compared with ONPATTRO. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 35% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increases in headcount to support our R&D pipeline, development expenses associated with the APOLLO-B, HELIOS-B and KARDIA-1, KARDIA-2 clinical studies and manufacturing-related expenses with our preclinical activities. Q1 2022 non-GAAP R&D OpEx was disproportionately lower than all other quarters during 2022. Thus, we expect lower year-over-year quarterly growth rates for R&D in the remaining quarters of 2023. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 17% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increased headcount and other investments supporting our strategic growth, including the global launch of AMVUTTRA. Our non-GAAP operating loss for Q1 2023 was $110 million, representing a $7 million improvement compared with Q1 2022 driven by strong top-line growth, offset by more moderate growth in operating expenses. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.1 billion compared to $2.2 billion at the end of 2022 with the decrease primarily due to our operating loss in the quarter. We continue to believe our current cash balance is sufficient to bridge us to a self-sustainable financial profile. Now I\u2019d like to turn to our full year 2023 financial guidance. We are reiterating the financial guidance we provided on our year-end results call in February. Starting with net product revenues, we continue to anticipate combined net product revenues for our four commercialized products will be between $1.2 billion and $1.285 billion. Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties remains a range between $100 million and $175 million. And our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses remains unchanged and is a range between $1.575 billion and $1.65 billion. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones slated for early and mid-2023. We will, of course, be executing on global commercialization of our products ONPATTRO, AMVUTTRA, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. From our TTR programs, we have a couple of upcoming data presentations. 18-month results from APOLLO-B will be presented at the ESC Heart Failure Meeting later this month and the HELIOS-A randomized treatment extension results looking at a biannual dose regimen for vutrisiran will be presented at ASNP also at the end of May. We expect to report top-line results from the KARDIA-1 Phase 2 study of zilebesiran and also intend to complete enrollment in the KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study. With our partner programs, VIR expect additional results from Phase 2 combination trials of ALN-HBV02. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Jeff. Operator. We\u2019ll now open a call for questions. To those delve we would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each. Then get back in the queue if you have additional questions.\nQ - Ritu Baral: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I know I\u2019m only loud one, so I\u2019m going try and stick to it as much as I can. The 18 month data that we\u2019re \u2013 that\u2019s coming up from APOLLO-B, can you talk a little bit more about what will be presented? Maybe how many patients are in continued follow up at 18 months? Will we have key secondary endpoint like the Kansas City and additional safety follow up as well? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, so as a reminder, on the call, APOLLO-B is double-line randomized study for 12 months. And at this point, patients who are on placebo were given the option to switch to patisiran for continuation of dosing. These data corroborate really what we saw in the 12-month portion of the study. And as we noted on the call, we've submitted these data to the FDA and we'll be presenting these data at the ESC-HF in Prague in May. Pushkal, do you want to add any other comments about the data and engagements would be to the agency?\nPushkal Garg: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Yvonne. Thanks, Ritu, for the question. As Yvonne said, we're really excited about these data. You asked, Ritu, about ongoing follow-up, right? All patients were randomized out to 12 months and then all patients were offered the opportunity to be an active drug from 12 months and beyond. And this is a cut of data out to 18 months, and we've had very high retention on the study, which is important and corroborates the profile. And I think it's going to be an opportunity to look at sort of the continued profile of what we've seen on patients on active drug, which was \u2013 we saw evidence of stabilization across key endpoints, particularly the six-minute walk test, sort of where it was associated with around the age-related decline that's seen in that parameter as well as stabilization in the key secondary endpoint of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. So that's important. It's an opportunity to look at the placebo patients as they cross over to active drug and looked at ongoing safety. Net-net, as Akshay and Yvonne commented, Ritu, we're really \u2013 feel quite confident and good about the data that we've seen and then it corroborates the profile of patisiran and its potential role in this disease.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, and as a reminder, we\u2019ve submitted 120-day safety update as is routine in this submission process.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Tazeen Ahmad from BofA. Your line is open.\nTazeen Ahmad: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one on AMVUTTRA sales. It looks like you're off to a good start on the ramp. Just wondering what your internal data is saying about any kind of market share being taken from ONPATTRO and whether or not if that is the trend, you'd expect that to be the case going forward as well.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Tolga, I think that\u2019s one that goes to you.\nTolga Tanguler: Thank you, Yvonne. Hi, Tazeen. Look, first of all, we're incredibly excited to the fact that we have been able to build a category and essentially grow our business quarter-over-quarter by over 70%, three subsequent quarters in the U.S. And what we see in terms of the dynamic with ONPATTRO is a very healthy switch rate while we're adding net na\u00efve patients in a very robust manner. So what our internal data really suggests is that there is lesser and lesser patients that are stable ONPATTRO as we expect those patient numbers to remain in small double digits or single digit over time.\nTazeen Ahmad: Okay.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, really just I think kind of emphasize how pleased we are with the launch metrics for AMVUTTRA in terms of the balance of new patients as well as switches, and really the expansion of the prescriber brace, which is very encouraging for continued growth in the trajectory of our TTR franchise.\nChristine Lindenboom: So thanks for that question. Tazeen. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ellie Merle from UBS. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi thanks so much for taking our question. This is Sarah on for Ellie. On your CAA program, I guess, can you talk about some of the timelines there and maybe the prioritization of that versus Alzheimer\u2019s and how we should think about the size of the CAA market opportunity?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, thanks for that question, I guess that question has been stimulated actually by the incredible results that we've shown here are quite remarkable results that we've shown in our Phase 1 interim study. And clearly, that's the first step in a journey of bringing RNAi Therapeutics to patients to CNS diseases in general. We're clearly starting off with early onset Alzheimer's disease. But Pushkal, I think cerebral amyloid angiopathy get another important opportunity, potentially for ALN-APP given the genetics, but could you say a few words about and how we're thinking about the opportunity here?\nPushkal Garg: Absolutely. Thanks Yvonne. Thanks, Sarah. Look, has been highlighted by both Akshay and Yvonne, CAA is really devastating the second leading cause of intracerebral hemorrhage only behind hypertension and there's really no available therapies for these patients. And so it's something where the genetics and the biology really strongly suggest that APP lowering may be a benefit in these patients. In some ways, you can think about it is very comparable to the hypothesis we've been pursuing with our TTR program, reducing amyloid can reduce downstream tissue damage in nerves and heart in this case, in the parenchyma of the brain in Alzheimer's disease and the vasculature of the brain in CAA. So these initial data that we've shared today will give us promise that we can advance ALN-APP towards both of these diseases, frankly, in parallel. We've not announced specifically what the time lines for that are. We're obviously working through and continuing the Part A of the study to do further dose exploration and really establish what we're seeing in terms of the knockdown, but also the durability so that we can identify multi-dose regimens, et cetera, characterize safety and then we want to be pursuing Phase 2 studies in both of these indications in due course and we'll update.\nChristine Lindenboom: Akshay, anything to add?\nAkshay Vaishnaw: No. Good answer, Pushkal.\nChristine Lindenboom: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you for taking our question. This is Tommie on for Salveen, and congrats on the progress. So for alvusiran [ph], can you frame what you're hoping to see in this upcoming Phase 2 monotherapy and combo data, the path to registration here given supportive data? And any updates on the Riverce [ph] platform?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. I think your question was referring to zilebesiran. Is that correct? I just wanted to make sure.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes.\nYvonne Greenstreet: As you know, we're very excited about the opportunity for zilebesiran in hypertension. Condition that impacts 100 million or more people and only 70% are able to achieve the goal in blood pressure reduction. So we think it's a really important area that we believe our platform has a real opportunity to completely transform how these patients are treated and hopefully lead to a better outcomes with respect to morbidity and mortality. And we've got two Phase 2 studies ongoing KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2. And clearly we need to wait for those results before we speak more specifically about plans beyond that. But Pushkal, can you talk a little bit maybe around the current stuff at as our studies and how we're thinking about future development?\nPushkal Garg: Sure. Yes. So look, zilebesiran has the potential to be an incredibly transformative medicine for high blood pressure. What we saw in the Phase 1 study that we've already reported was opportunity to realize almost 20 millimeters of systolic blood pressure lowering with 24-hour ABPM lasting, and durability lasting up to six months with a single injection. We think as Yvonne highlighted that that can actually address a multitude of the issues that lead to hypertension being the number one addressable cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality around the world. We've got two studies. The KARDIA-1 study is a monotherapy study. I think that was the first study you asked about, and that study completed enrollment at the end of last year. And so we're looking forward to data in the middle of this year. And that's really going to allow us to establish the dose and the regimen for ongoing pivotal studies. We're looking at a range of doses from 150 to 600 milligrams and Q3 and six-month dosing. And so coming out of that study, we'll hopefully be able to establish what that pivotal regimen is. The second study that we're doing is KARDIA-2 as you're probably familiar in hypertension; combination therapy is sort of standard of care. And so what we're doing in KARDIA-2 is looking at combining zilebesiran with three common classes of medicines, diuretics, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers. And what we want to be seeing there is the additive efficacy and safety, and that will help us design ongoing studies for our registrational program. I'm really excited that their enrollment has really been picking up in that study, and we are on track to be enrollment early this year and report out data towards the \u2013 at or around year-end. So with those data together, we think we'll be able to provide more guidance on what the pivotal registrational program will look like.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. Perhaps important to add that actually from a regulated perspective to achieve an approval in medicine for hypertension have demonstrated a 5-millimeter of mercury lowering of systolic blood pressure. And of course, we've actually already demonstrated more than that in our Phase 1 studies as is highlighted. So as we deliver the Phase 2 data and hopefully move to larger numbers in the Phase 3 and deliver similar efficacy and also robust safety, we feel that it's a fairly straightforward answer and approval here. Thank you for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Matteis from Stifel. Your line is open.\nPaul Matteis: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter and the recent CNS data. I wanted to ask just a commercial question. It looks like you saw this really nice jump in the sequential net patient add rate when AMVUTTRA became available. It looks like that kind of step back down to more than normal rate we were observing throughout 2022. Is that kind of how you're thinking about the likely cadence going forward that maybe there was this bolus of patients that were interested in a much more convenient product and now the growth rate from here is probably steadier?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. Thank you, Paul. I mean, look, first of all, I just want to reiterate the fact that we're incredibly pleased with how AMVUTTRA performance is taking shape in the U.S. and now in Japan and other European markets. What's really important to highlight is the product profile is very compelling that this category growth not only address the pent-up demand that we were anticipating, but it's also continuing to actually help us expand this franchise, mostly noted by the fact that we have \u2013 we are seeing an expanding prescriber base. Our start form rates continue to go up, and what we see is also our ability to get naive patients, that's just ONPATTRO switches are continuing to be at the stated rate. The results that you see in Q1, Paul, is mostly \u2013 it's a bit dilutive because given the insurance renewals that we see in this Q1, tax impact \u2013 the net sales impact in the U.S. We're actually very encouraged with some of those internal metrics that I just shared with you, making us quite confident that in subsequent quarters we see, the uptake continue to be at the similar rates that we see in the prior quarters.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thank you so much, Tolga. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question, excuse me, comes from Jessica Fye from JPMorgan. Jessica, your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thank you for taking our questions. This is Jayal [ph] for Jess. So we have a question on reimbursement around AMVUTTRA. So from a cost-benefit perspective for payers and recognizing the HELIOS-B data has yet to come out. How would you compare AMVUTTRA to tafamidis for cardiomyopathy? And also curious, how are you thinking about this for ONPATTRO where you already have your positive pivotal data? And then moving to Medicare patients specifically, can you remind us what the out-of-pocket cost is like AMVUTTRA per year for the Medicare patients? And how does it compare to the out-of-pocket cost for tafamidis, again for the Medicare patients? And with the upcoming RA changes to Medicare, how do you see this change potentially? How do you see the difference can change potentially? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: So there's a lot of questions here. We'll we try to remember and past the mat [ph]. I mean Tolga maybe start with the last question perhaps and I will talk a little bit about how we're seeing out of pocket cost study and the sort of Medicare context.\nTolga Tanguler: So that's also kind of trade in the record. So we have about 70% of our patients on Medicare and Medicaid. And those are patients that are on Part B, and right now if you look at our current course on those patients, about 70% of our patients pay zero co-pay in the Part B program, and it's consistent with both ONPATTRO as well as AMVUTTRA. As you all know, we have very limited value-based agreements that actually really unburdens the patients to be able to have access and what we really see, that's probably the most important marker is if you look at are these patients that are put on therapy with a start form, do they actually getting the therapy? And are they staying on therapy? And what's really encouraging is both \u2013 and we can say that now with AMVUTTRA three quarters in the market, we see very similar exceptionally high compliance rates, which also suggests that those patients that may have sub-copay burden are continuing to be able to access, thanks to our value-based agreements and other ways that we support those patients. What was the other question?\nYvonne Greenstreet: I think you've actually answered two out of the three questions. And the third is how we're thinking about pricing in cardiomyopathy, particularly with tafamidis. I mean given that we're still awaiting a label for ONPATTRO and we're waiting HELIOS-B for fitusiran, I think it's probably too early to speak to that detail. So thank you for your questions and let's go on for next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gena Wang with Barclays. Your line is open.\nGena Wang: Thank you. Thank you for sharing your APP data. Indeed, a very impressive knockdown profile. I had one question on the data, but with regards and hopefully can cover all three questions. So when we look at the natural nature of biotechnology paper, 60-milligram from non-human primate data was all showing similar knockdown when we look at compared to the 75-milligram in human. So will led to almost nearly ten-fold better translation to human? And then my second question is that you show the median percentage knockdown, so what is the mean and the standard deviation look like if we're only focusing on 75-milligram profile? And then lastly, do you need to run another non-human primate study in order to satisfy FDA to remove the partial clinical hope?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Okay. So three questions there. And I think I would say \u2013 I think they're kind of all for you. I think one was about the translation from the preclinical testing. Second was with respect to the centers that we're seeing and the third, our [indiscernible] address the clinical hold. I think before, actually answers the questions on the clinical hold, I think it's really important to emphasize that Part A is ongoing in a number of countries, including the U.S. and in fact, we have approval to progress with Part B for Health Canada. In fact, as actually said in his remarks, most of the patients actually in Part A come from Canada. So it's really important to note that we're able to progress with Part B. But clearly, still a lot to learn from Part A in terms of PK, PD, durability, et cetera, before we define our plans for the next faster study. Akshay, maybe you want to talk a little bit more about how we're thinking about addressing the clinical hold with the FDA and then the other two questions that relates to the data.\nAkshay Vaishnaw: Yes. Thanks, Yvonne. Thanks, Gena. Let me just go in order. So I think your first question, Gena, if I got it right, the 60-milligram in the monkey expectations in that in terms of translation. I think, I mean, even without thing I'm on calculations, if you think about the size of the monkey brand and the CSF volume, and you have to administer 60 milligrams to get something like the knockdown curves we're seeing at 50 milligrams here in humans and 75 milligrams. It just shows the gain in potency, and we believe will also see durability in humans relative to nonclinical species. Now you've watched us for a long time and you back to the liver data, that's exactly what we see in the liver setting. So these human Phase 1 data are really rather exciting and I think solid product profile where we hope at low doses rather than the animal. We see very important let significant knockdown for highly durable intervals that would allow in a treatment dosing, hopefully, every six months, maybe even annually. So that was question one. Your second question was we showed the medians what about the mean and standard deviations at 75%. Again, we haven't shown the patient-by-patient data we'll share more data at the upcoming meeting. But I can reassure you that as you go from low to high dose, the kind of variability you see patients, patients at high dose, you now see a track after track for each patient is following the same curve. So the data will be very tight in terms of means and standard deviation. We've looked at them that's $50 million and $75 million that we haven't shown today. So again, that conforms exactly to what we see with RNAi and other tissues where at low doses, some pharmacologic doses you see some variability between individuals just as you see in placebo. But once you're at an operative pharmacologic doses, you get a very tight knockdown and little enter [ph] individual variability. Again, these are all small numbers, but very encouraging data. And finally, do we need a nonhuman primate study to get off hold? I mean I think I shared today our impressions of the clinical data, the situation with the chronic tox studies, exaggerations and exposure we have. We want to descale this with the FDA and get their guidance. Obviously, they have a very important voice in this; we want to benefit from their input. So let's go and do that. And from that, we'll learn whether we need to do more studies or not. But if we can administer the low doses and get up to a year of knockdown, who next we'll see, but certainly very exciting times.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Gena, thanks for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lebowitz with Citi. Your line is open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Debolina [ph] on for David. So we wanted to ask like that the ATTR space appears likely to have an additional TTR silencer entry, how does the competition shake out between your offerings and eventual competitors? And maybe one more, ease of time, that assuming ONPATTRO approval for ATTR-CM is going to be based on functional endpoints, how do you see the therapy getting utilized after that approval? Thanks. \nYvonne Greenstreet: Actually, it would be really helpful if you could repeat your question and maybe just kind of hold yourself to kind of one question. So maybe you can just repeat the one key question you'd like us to address.\nUnidentified Analyst: Sure. Okay. So my first question was that the ATTR space appears to likely have an additional TTR silencer entry. How does the competition shake out between your offerings and eventual competitors? Thank you. \nYvonne Greenstreet: Okay. So let's start off with Tolga and then Pushkal will also add some remarks. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. So as you know, AMVUTTRA has really been the game changer and it's been transforming the markets and building the category growth. And frankly, the potential availability of more treatment options is really good for patients. This is a highly devastating disease. Patients are still either undiagnosed or other treated. So similar to other competitive markets, it will increase disease awareness, spot earlier diagnosis, enable earlier treatment initiations, which in turn supports a significant category growth that we already as we expect to see. Now in terms of the product profiles, obviously, what we see is, and I'll have Pushkal come back a little bit on our clinical profile. But what we're really pleased to see is, first of all, the rapid offset is very important for patient outcomes. Disease reversal is important. I am confident \u2013 and we're obviously very confident of our product profile, only four times a year in registration and also given the fact that strong uptake is a clear signal of our profile is \u2013 and our customer-facing profile and how we compete the market. So with that, David, I'll turn it over to Pushkal to comment on the product profile at clinical level.\nPushkal Garg: Yes. I mean I think, Tolga, I think you hit actually most of the key points. I mean, I think it's important to state that there's really no head-to-head studies between ONPATTRO we've just seen some early data here, and we look forward to learning more about it, but there's no head-to-head data between ONPATTRO and vutrisiran. I think as we've been in the marketplace, as we've talked to clinicians, as we've talked to patients, what we've learned about what's important to them, obviously, they're looking for strong efficacy and a good safety profile. And as you dive deeper into that, speed of onset of action is quite important. We've been very pleased by the rapidity of knockdown, TTR knockdown that we see with our agent and that seems to translate actually to patients feeling better. We've noticed that with the BMI [ph] data and nutritional status, and we get reports of patients anecdotally feeling a lot better, very early on therapy. And likewise, ultimately, people want to regain function as much as possible. They want to be able to live their lives basically as free of this disease is humanly possible. And what's this concept of disease reversal that Tolga mentioned becomes very important. And we've been encouraged when you look across key parameters like the mNIS, when you look at the Norfolk quality of life, et cetera, in the PN space, that we have 50% of upwards of patients who are sort of reaching that reversal threshold. And so again, we're really excited about the profile that we have with AMVUTTRA, how it's been received and the feedback that we've been hearing and so I think we're very encouraged. And again, it's great that there'll be another agent out there, as Tolga said, but we're very confident about the profile of AMVUTTRA and what it offers.\nYvonne Greenstreet: No, that's great. And I think having sort of five years of experience, marketing TTR medicines, I think, gives us the opportunity to really understood this market and extract insights that are helpful in terms of educating patients or physicians. So thank you for that question. Next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Ulz from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. \nMike Ulz: Good morning and thanks for taking the question, For ALN-TTRsc04, assuming you get some supportive data later this year, can you talk about the potential path forward there? And if there's opportunity to maybe shorten that time frame? And would you be looking to move forward in both polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy? Thanks. \nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks for that question. We're really excited about progressing ALN-TTRsc04 for a number of reasons. Importantly, the potential for increased knockdown greater than 90% and frequency perhaps annual dosing. So we think this is a real step forward for trial platform in general. And Pushkal, maybe you can talk a little bit about how we're thinking about developing this program going forward.\nPushkal Garg: Yes, absolutely. Yes, ALN-TTRsc04, I think, really represents sort of the next generation of innovation in the TTR space where we want to bring best possible offering to patients. And we believe the deeper knockdown and greater durability are the two things that will make a huge difference for patients. And obviously, from a business perspective, it's also valuable to us because it doesn't \u2013 it frees some of the royalties, et cetera, that we have around AMVUTTRA. So we're obviously motivated and excited to bring this forward to patients as quickly as we can. So to your point, we will be looking for ways to speed up the development program. And while it's early to speak to exactly what the details of that are, this first Phase 1 study is going to allow us to look at both the magnitude of knockdown, the durability of knockdown as well as safety.  And with that, maybe one way to think about this to look back at what we did with the AMVUTTRA program, where we went directly from Phase 2 studies into Phase 3 pivotal trials. And moreover, when we have patient-level data across a number of studies, it allows us to pursue some very innovative develop approaches. For example, with HELIOS-A, we did not have a placebo control group. We were able to use patient-level data and do a historical control against the APOLLO placebo data. And so you can imagine that we will be moving this forward and trying to use similar approaches to speed up development, both in polyneuropathy and particularly in cardiomyopathy. So we'll have more to say about that as we advance our development plans.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Pushkal. I think we've got time for one last question.\nOperator: Yes. Our final question of the day comes from Kostas Biliouris from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nKostas Biliouris: Hi, hello everyone. Congrats on the progress and thanks for taking my question. One quick question on the ONPATTRO filing. I'm wondering whether you have already submitted data to the FDA as part of the format safety update? And if so, whether you can elaborate on the type of additional safety data that you have submitted?\nPushkal Garg: Sure. Kostas, thanks for the question. So the review of the ONPATTRO sNDA for cardiomyopathy is ongoing, and we have submitted both the day 120 safety update, which really just corroborates with additional safety across adverse events, laboratory data, et cetera, with some extended follow-up beyond what we've submitted in the initial NDA. And we also as announced today, have submitted the month 18 efficacy update across primary and secondary endpoints to the agency as well, which we also think corroborate the efficacy that we saw, the clinical importance of those data and a favorable benefit risk profile of the product in this disease population. So we look forward to the agency's ongoing review.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Great. So look, thanks for the question. And thanks to everyone for joining this call. We're really happy with the strong start that we've made in 2023. We've got strong commercial execution, significant pipeline and platform development. We'd really underscore the power of RNAi Therapeutics and addressing major unmet needs for patients. And we look forward to sharing more progress with you in the coming months as we continue to deliver on both our near- and long-term goals. Thank you, everybody.\nChristine Lindenboom: Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tolga Tanguler",
            "content": "Thanks, Yvonne, and good morning everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter for our commercial portfolio driven by our TTR franchise and the strength of our ongoing launch of AMVUTTRA as we delivered 48% total product sales growth or 52% on a content exchange rate basis compared with the first quarter of 2022. Let me now turn to a summary of our first quarter TTR performance. Our TTR franchise achieved $204 million in global net product revenues for ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA representing a 7% increase compared with the fourth quarter and a solid 49% growth compared with the first quarter of 2022. With the U.S. market year-over-year growth standing out at a robust 75% driven by the ongoing launch of AMVUTTRA, at the end of the first quarter over 3,160 patients were on commercial ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA treatment worldwide, up from over 2,975 patients at the end of the fourth quarter, representing 6% quarterly patient growth. In the U.S. combined sales of ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA increased 5% versus the fourth quarter and were primarily impacted by the following. A 7% increase in demand, which was driven by the strength of ongoing AMVUTTRA patient uptake more than offsetting the decrease in patients on ONPATTRO that switched to AMVUTTRA, inventory dynamics decreased reported growth by approximately 3% as ONPATTRO inventory in the channel continues to decrease with ongoing patients switching to AMVUTTRA. Overall in the U.S., we continue to be very pleased with the impact we're seeing from AMVUTTRA in expanding the opportunity for our TTR franchise as reflected by the robust 75% year-over-year quarterly growth that we achieved in Q1, representing the third consecutive quarter of achieving TTR growth in excess of 70% on a year over year basis in the US following AMVUTTRA's launch in the third quarter of 2022. Additionally, key operating metrics continue to trend favorably including growth in new patient start forms, the switch rate from ONPATTRO, patient compliance rates and the expansion of our prescriber base. In our international markets, total TTR Q1 product sales increased 9% versus the fourth quarter driven by strong demand in Japan following the fourth quarter launch of AMVUTTRA offset by inventory destocking in Japan. The AMVUTTRA demand growth in Japan is particularly encouraging with the new patient growth being driven by a mix of switches from tafamidis as well as patients naive to therapy. Additionally and importantly ONPATTRO continue to deliver steady growth in markets where AMVUTTRA is not yet launched, positioning these markets for the upcoming AMVUTTRA launch. ONPATTRO also benefited from the timing of orders in our distributor markets. Our global results continue to be challenged by foreign exchange headwinds with total TTR year-over-year reported growth of 49%, held back 5 percentage points due to changes in FX rates. Now moving to our ultra rare products and the performance of GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, which delivered $72 million in combined product sales during the first quarter, representing a 2% increase compared with the fourth quarter and a more robust 45% growth compared with the first quarter of 2022. We ended the quarter with more than 550 patients on GIVLAARI commercial therapy and more than 300 patients on OXLUMO commercial therapy representing 6% and 7% quarterly growth compared with the year end 2022 for GIVLAARI and OXLUMO respectively. For GIVLAARI, global growth of 2% in Q1 compared with the fourth quarter was impacted by the following. A decline in U.S. growth of 3% primarily due to reduced patient compliance associated with the seasonal impact from the annual pre-authorization required by payers during the first quarter that we expect will recover in subsequent quarters. Growth in our international markets increased 11% as demand increased in European markets and also benefited from the timing of orders in our distributor markets. For OXLUMO, global growth of 1% in Q1 compared with the fourth quarter was impacted by the following. U.S. reported growth increased 3% driven by an increase in patient demand. Growth in international markets was flat with a demand increase in European markets offset by the timing of orders in our distributor markets. Additionally, changes in year-over-year foreign exchange rates negatively impacted Q1 GIVLAARI and OXLUMO reported growth by 3 and 4 percentage points respectively. In conclusion, we are pleased with the growth in revenues, particularly with the ongoing signs of strong performance associated with the AMVUTTRA launch, which we believe represents an important therapy option for hATTR amyloidosis patients with polyneuropathy and an accelerated growth opportunity for our TTR franchise. With that, I will now turn it over to Akshay to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Akshay? Thank you, Yvonne. Hi, Tazeen. Look, first of all, we're incredibly excited to the fact that we have been able to build a category and essentially grow our business quarter-over-quarter by over 70%, three subsequent quarters in the U.S. And what we see in terms of the dynamic with ONPATTRO is a very healthy switch rate while we're adding net na\u00efve patients in a very robust manner. So what our internal data really suggests is that there is lesser and lesser patients that are stable ONPATTRO as we expect those patient numbers to remain in small double digits or single digit over time. Yes. Thank you, Paul. I mean, look, first of all, I just want to reiterate the fact that we're incredibly pleased with how AMVUTTRA performance is taking shape in the U.S. and now in Japan and other European markets. What's really important to highlight is the product profile is very compelling that this category growth not only address the pent-up demand that we were anticipating, but it's also continuing to actually help us expand this franchise, mostly noted by the fact that we have \u2013 we are seeing an expanding prescriber base. Our start form rates continue to go up, and what we see is also our ability to get naive patients, that's just ONPATTRO switches are continuing to be at the stated rate. The results that you see in Q1, Paul, is mostly \u2013 it's a bit dilutive because given the insurance renewals that we see in this Q1, tax impact \u2013 the net sales impact in the U.S. We're actually very encouraged with some of those internal metrics that I just shared with you, making us quite confident that in subsequent quarters we see, the uptake continue to be at the similar rates that we see in the prior quarters. So that's also kind of trade in the record. So we have about 70% of our patients on Medicare and Medicaid. And those are patients that are on Part B, and right now if you look at our current course on those patients, about 70% of our patients pay zero co-pay in the Part B program, and it's consistent with both ONPATTRO as well as AMVUTTRA. As you all know, we have very limited value-based agreements that actually really unburdens the patients to be able to have access and what we really see, that's probably the most important marker is if you look at are these patients that are put on therapy with a start form, do they actually getting the therapy? And are they staying on therapy? And what's really encouraging is both \u2013 and we can say that now with AMVUTTRA three quarters in the market, we see very similar exceptionally high compliance rates, which also suggests that those patients that may have sub-copay burden are continuing to be able to access, thanks to our value-based agreements and other ways that we support those patients. What was the other question? Yes. So as you know, AMVUTTRA has really been the game changer and it's been transforming the markets and building the category growth. And frankly, the potential availability of more treatment options is really good for patients. This is a highly devastating disease. Patients are still either undiagnosed or other treated. So similar to other competitive markets, it will increase disease awareness, spot earlier diagnosis, enable earlier treatment initiations, which in turn supports a significant category growth that we already as we expect to see. Now in terms of the product profiles, obviously, what we see is, and I'll have Pushkal come back a little bit on our clinical profile. But what we're really pleased to see is, first of all, the rapid offset is very important for patient outcomes. Disease reversal is important. I am confident \u2013 and we're obviously very confident of our product profile, only four times a year in registration and also given the fact that strong uptake is a clear signal of our profile is \u2013 and our customer-facing profile and how we compete the market. So with that, David, I'll turn it over to Pushkal to comment on the product profile at clinical level."

            "name": "Yvonne Greenstreet",
            "content": "Thanks Christine and thank you everyone for joining the call today. 2023 is off to a great start with AMVUTTRA launch continuing its strong growth with Q1 delivering 48% growth in total product sales compares the first quarter of 2022. We've also made great strides of our pipeline, including the recent exciting announcement of positive interim results from the Phase 1 study of ALN-APP, our investigational RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. These results mark a significant milestone for Alnylam as we believe they establish human proof-of-concept for RNAi therapeutics in the CNS and potentially unlock many additional opportunities where we may be able to address significant unmet medical needs. We also have a number of exciting upcoming milestones that highlight the depth and breadth of our pipeline, which includes the presentation of 18-month results from the APOLLO-B Phase 3 study of patisiran at ESC-HF later this month and top line results from the KARDIA-1 Phase 2 study of zilebesiran in patients with hypertension expected in mid 2023. This execution is in line with our focus on the following key drivers for Alnylam's growth over next several years. First is the potential near-term expansion of our TTR franchise opportunity where we aim to become a global leader in delivering impactful and highly differentiated medicines to patients. Second is our expansion beyond rare diseases to also address more common disease areas. And the third growth driver for the company comes from our sustainable innovation engine comprised of new platform enhancements, opportunities with extrahepatic delivery and our ability to find new genetically validated targets, which can drive further pipeline expansion to 2025 and beyond. We believe all of this puts us on track with our Alnylam P5x25 goals making Alnylam a top tier biotech, developing and commercializing transformative medicines for rare diseases and beyond for patients around the world driven by a high yielding pipeline of firsts and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic products engine all while delivering exceptional financial results.  With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga? Yes, so as a reminder, on the call, APOLLO-B is double-line randomized study for 12 months. And at this point, patients who are on placebo were given the option to switch to patisiran for continuation of dosing. These data corroborate really what we saw in the 12-month portion of the study. And as we noted on the call, we've submitted these data to the FDA and we'll be presenting these data at the ESC-HF in Prague in May. Pushkal, do you want to add any other comments about the data and engagements would be to the agency? Yes, and as a reminder, we\u2019ve submitted 120-day safety update as is routine in this submission process. Tolga, I think that\u2019s one that goes to you. Yes, really just I think kind of emphasize how pleased we are with the launch metrics for AMVUTTRA in terms of the balance of new patients as well as switches, and really the expansion of the prescriber brace, which is very encouraging for continued growth in the trajectory of our TTR franchise. Yes, thanks for that question, I guess that question has been stimulated actually by the incredible results that we've shown here are quite remarkable results that we've shown in our Phase 1 interim study. And clearly, that's the first step in a journey of bringing RNAi Therapeutics to patients to CNS diseases in general. We're clearly starting off with early onset Alzheimer's disease. But Pushkal, I think cerebral amyloid angiopathy get another important opportunity, potentially for ALN-APP given the genetics, but could you say a few words about and how we're thinking about the opportunity here? Yes. I think your question was referring to zilebesiran. Is that correct? I just wanted to make sure. As you know, we're very excited about the opportunity for zilebesiran in hypertension. Condition that impacts 100 million or more people and only 70% are able to achieve the goal in blood pressure reduction. So we think it's a really important area that we believe our platform has a real opportunity to completely transform how these patients are treated and hopefully lead to a better outcomes with respect to morbidity and mortality. And we've got two Phase 2 studies ongoing KARDIA-1 and KARDIA-2. And clearly we need to wait for those results before we speak more specifically about plans beyond that. But Pushkal, can you talk a little bit maybe around the current stuff at as our studies and how we're thinking about future development? Yes. Perhaps important to add that actually from a regulated perspective to achieve an approval in medicine for hypertension have demonstrated a 5-millimeter of mercury lowering of systolic blood pressure. And of course, we've actually already demonstrated more than that in our Phase 1 studies as is highlighted. So as we deliver the Phase 2 data and hopefully move to larger numbers in the Phase 3 and deliver similar efficacy and also robust safety, we feel that it's a fairly straightforward answer and approval here. Thank you for the question. Tolga? Thank you so much, Tolga. Next question, please. So there's a lot of questions here. We'll we try to remember and past the mat [ph]. I mean Tolga maybe start with the last question perhaps and I will talk a little bit about how we're seeing out of pocket cost study and the sort of Medicare context. I think you've actually answered two out of the three questions. And the third is how we're thinking about pricing in cardiomyopathy, particularly with tafamidis. I mean given that we're still awaiting a label for ONPATTRO and we're waiting HELIOS-B for fitusiran, I think it's probably too early to speak to that detail. So thank you for your questions and let's go on for next question. Okay. So three questions there. And I think I would say \u2013 I think they're kind of all for you. I think one was about the translation from the preclinical testing. Second was with respect to the centers that we're seeing and the third, our [indiscernible] address the clinical hold. I think before, actually answers the questions on the clinical hold, I think it's really important to emphasize that Part A is ongoing in a number of countries, including the U.S. and in fact, we have approval to progress with Part B for Health Canada. In fact, as actually said in his remarks, most of the patients actually in Part A come from Canada. So it's really important to note that we're able to progress with Part B. But clearly, still a lot to learn from Part A in terms of PK, PD, durability, et cetera, before we define our plans for the next faster study. Akshay, maybe you want to talk a little bit more about how we're thinking about addressing the clinical hold with the FDA and then the other two questions that relates to the data. Thanks, Gena, thanks for the question. Next question, please. Actually, it would be really helpful if you could repeat your question and maybe just kind of hold yourself to kind of one question. So maybe you can just repeat the one key question you'd like us to address. Okay. So let's start off with Tolga and then Pushkal will also add some remarks. Tolga? No, that's great. And I think having sort of five years of experience, marketing TTR medicines, I think, gives us the opportunity to really understood this market and extract insights that are helpful in terms of educating patients or physicians. So thank you for that question. Next question please? Thanks for that question. We're really excited about progressing ALN-TTRsc04 for a number of reasons. Importantly, the potential for increased knockdown greater than 90% and frequency perhaps annual dosing. So we think this is a real step forward for trial platform in general. And Pushkal, maybe you can talk a little bit about how we're thinking about developing this program going forward. Thanks, Pushkal. I think we've got time for one last question. Great. So look, thanks for the question. And thanks to everyone for joining this call. We're really happy with the strong start that we've made in 2023. We've got strong commercial execution, significant pipeline and platform development. We'd really underscore the power of RNAi Therapeutics and addressing major unmet needs for patients. And we look forward to sharing more progress with you in the coming months as we continue to deliver on both our near- and long-term goals. Thank you, everybody."

            "name": "Jeff Poulton",
            "content": "Thanks, Akshay. And good morning, everyone. I am pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam\u2019s Q1 2023 financial results and discussing our full year guidance. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for the first quarter. Total product revenues for the quarter were $276 million or 48% growth versus Q1 2022. As Tolga previously indicated, the increase is primarily related to growth in TTR product revenues driven by the launch of AMVUTTRA in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2022 as well as increased patients on GIVLAARI and OXLUMO therapies. It's also worth noting that year-over-year growth in combined product revenues was held back by approximately four percentage points due to impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Net revenue from collaborations for the first quarter was approximately $36 million, representing a 41% increase compared with Q1 2022, primarily due to an increase in revenue from our collaboration arrangements with Regeneron attributed to an increase in reimbursable activities under our research services arrangement in addition to an increase in revenue recognized associated with license programs within the collaboration. Royalty revenue during the quarter was $7 million, which was driven by Novartis\u2019 sales of Leqvio, which launched in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2022. Gross margin on product sales was 85% in Q1, representing a 2% decrease compared with the first quarter of 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by increased royalties due to Sanofi on sales of AMVUTTRA, which was partially offset by lower manufacturing costs for AMVUTTRA compared with ONPATTRO. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 35% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increases in headcount to support our R&D pipeline, development expenses associated with the APOLLO-B, HELIOS-B and KARDIA-1, KARDIA-2 clinical studies and manufacturing-related expenses with our preclinical activities. Q1 2022 non-GAAP R&D OpEx was disproportionately lower than all other quarters during 2022. Thus, we expect lower year-over-year quarterly growth rates for R&D in the remaining quarters of 2023. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 17% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increased headcount and other investments supporting our strategic growth, including the global launch of AMVUTTRA. Our non-GAAP operating loss for Q1 2023 was $110 million, representing a $7 million improvement compared with Q1 2022 driven by strong top-line growth, offset by more moderate growth in operating expenses. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.1 billion compared to $2.2 billion at the end of 2022 with the decrease primarily due to our operating loss in the quarter. We continue to believe our current cash balance is sufficient to bridge us to a self-sustainable financial profile. Now I\u2019d like to turn to our full year 2023 financial guidance. We are reiterating the financial guidance we provided on our year-end results call in February. Starting with net product revenues, we continue to anticipate combined net product revenues for our four commercialized products will be between $1.2 billion and $1.285 billion. Our guidance for net revenue from collaborations and royalties remains a range between $100 million and $175 million. And our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses remains unchanged and is a range between $1.575 billion and $1.65 billion. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones slated for early and mid-2023. We will, of course, be executing on global commercialization of our products ONPATTRO, AMVUTTRA, GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. From our TTR programs, we have a couple of upcoming data presentations. 18-month results from APOLLO-B will be presented at the ESC Heart Failure Meeting later this month and the HELIOS-A randomized treatment extension results looking at a biannual dose regimen for vutrisiran will be presented at ASNP also at the end of May. We expect to report top-line results from the KARDIA-1 Phase 2 study of zilebesiran and also intend to complete enrollment in the KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study. With our partner programs, VIR expect additional results from Phase 2 combination trials of ALN-HBV02. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?"

            "name": "Pushkal Garg",
            "content": "Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Yvonne. Thanks, Ritu, for the question. As Yvonne said, we're really excited about these data. You asked, Ritu, about ongoing follow-up, right? All patients were randomized out to 12 months and then all patients were offered the opportunity to be an active drug from 12 months and beyond. And this is a cut of data out to 18 months, and we've had very high retention on the study, which is important and corroborates the profile. And I think it's going to be an opportunity to look at sort of the continued profile of what we've seen on patients on active drug, which was \u2013 we saw evidence of stabilization across key endpoints, particularly the six-minute walk test, sort of where it was associated with around the age-related decline that's seen in that parameter as well as stabilization in the key secondary endpoint of the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. So that's important. It's an opportunity to look at the placebo patients as they cross over to active drug and looked at ongoing safety. Net-net, as Akshay and Yvonne commented, Ritu, we're really \u2013 feel quite confident and good about the data that we've seen and then it corroborates the profile of patisiran and its potential role in this disease. Absolutely. Thanks Yvonne. Thanks, Sarah. Look, has been highlighted by both Akshay and Yvonne, CAA is really devastating the second leading cause of intracerebral hemorrhage only behind hypertension and there's really no available therapies for these patients. And so it's something where the genetics and the biology really strongly suggest that APP lowering may be a benefit in these patients. In some ways, you can think about it is very comparable to the hypothesis we've been pursuing with our TTR program, reducing amyloid can reduce downstream tissue damage in nerves and heart in this case, in the parenchyma of the brain in Alzheimer's disease and the vasculature of the brain in CAA. So these initial data that we've shared today will give us promise that we can advance ALN-APP towards both of these diseases, frankly, in parallel. We've not announced specifically what the time lines for that are. We're obviously working through and continuing the Part A of the study to do further dose exploration and really establish what we're seeing in terms of the knockdown, but also the durability so that we can identify multi-dose regimens, et cetera, characterize safety and then we want to be pursuing Phase 2 studies in both of these indications in due course and we'll update. Sure. Yes. So look, zilebesiran has the potential to be an incredibly transformative medicine for high blood pressure. What we saw in the Phase 1 study that we've already reported was opportunity to realize almost 20 millimeters of systolic blood pressure lowering with 24-hour ABPM lasting, and durability lasting up to six months with a single injection. We think as Yvonne highlighted that that can actually address a multitude of the issues that lead to hypertension being the number one addressable cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality around the world. We've got two studies. The KARDIA-1 study is a monotherapy study. I think that was the first study you asked about, and that study completed enrollment at the end of last year. And so we're looking forward to data in the middle of this year. And that's really going to allow us to establish the dose and the regimen for ongoing pivotal studies. We're looking at a range of doses from 150 to 600 milligrams and Q3 and six-month dosing. And so coming out of that study, we'll hopefully be able to establish what that pivotal regimen is. The second study that we're doing is KARDIA-2 as you're probably familiar in hypertension; combination therapy is sort of standard of care. And so what we're doing in KARDIA-2 is looking at combining zilebesiran with three common classes of medicines, diuretics, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers. And what we want to be seeing there is the additive efficacy and safety, and that will help us design ongoing studies for our registrational program. I'm really excited that their enrollment has really been picking up in that study, and we are on track to be enrollment early this year and report out data towards the \u2013 at or around year-end. So with those data together, we think we'll be able to provide more guidance on what the pivotal registrational program will look like. Yes. I mean I think, Tolga, I think you hit actually most of the key points. I mean, I think it's important to state that there's really no head-to-head studies between ONPATTRO we've just seen some early data here, and we look forward to learning more about it, but there's no head-to-head data between ONPATTRO and vutrisiran. I think as we've been in the marketplace, as we've talked to clinicians, as we've talked to patients, what we've learned about what's important to them, obviously, they're looking for strong efficacy and a good safety profile. And as you dive deeper into that, speed of onset of action is quite important. We've been very pleased by the rapidity of knockdown, TTR knockdown that we see with our agent and that seems to translate actually to patients feeling better. We've noticed that with the BMI [ph] data and nutritional status, and we get reports of patients anecdotally feeling a lot better, very early on therapy. And likewise, ultimately, people want to regain function as much as possible. They want to be able to live their lives basically as free of this disease is humanly possible. And what's this concept of disease reversal that Tolga mentioned becomes very important. And we've been encouraged when you look across key parameters like the mNIS, when you look at the Norfolk quality of life, et cetera, in the PN space, that we have 50% of upwards of patients who are sort of reaching that reversal threshold. And so again, we're really excited about the profile that we have with AMVUTTRA, how it's been received and the feedback that we've been hearing and so I think we're very encouraged. And again, it's great that there'll be another agent out there, as Tolga said, but we're very confident about the profile of AMVUTTRA and what it offers. Yes, absolutely. Yes, ALN-TTRsc04, I think, really represents sort of the next generation of innovation in the TTR space where we want to bring best possible offering to patients. And we believe the deeper knockdown and greater durability are the two things that will make a huge difference for patients. And obviously, from a business perspective, it's also valuable to us because it doesn't \u2013 it frees some of the royalties, et cetera, that we have around AMVUTTRA. So we're obviously motivated and excited to bring this forward to patients as quickly as we can. So to your point, we will be looking for ways to speed up the development program. And while it's early to speak to exactly what the details of that are, this first Phase 1 study is going to allow us to look at both the magnitude of knockdown, the durability of knockdown as well as safety.  And with that, maybe one way to think about this to look back at what we did with the AMVUTTRA program, where we went directly from Phase 2 studies into Phase 3 pivotal trials. And moreover, when we have patient-level data across a number of studies, it allows us to pursue some very innovative develop approaches. For example, with HELIOS-A, we did not have a placebo control group. We were able to use patient-level data and do a historical control against the APOLLO placebo data. And so you can imagine that we will be moving this forward and trying to use similar approaches to speed up development, both in polyneuropathy and particularly in cardiomyopathy. So we'll have more to say about that as we advance our development plans. Sure. Kostas, thanks for the question. So the review of the ONPATTRO sNDA for cardiomyopathy is ongoing, and we have submitted both the day 120 safety update, which really just corroborates with additional safety across adverse events, laboratory data, et cetera, with some extended follow-up beyond what we've submitted in the initial NDA. And we also as announced today, have submitted the month 18 efficacy update across primary and secondary endpoints to the agency as well, which we also think corroborate the efficacy that we saw, the clinical importance of those data and a favorable benefit risk profile of the product in this disease population. So we look forward to the agency's ongoing review."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Akshay Vaishnaw",
            "content": "Thanks Tolga and good morning everyone. I'd like to start today with a recap of recent news that marks a very important milestone for Alnylam and the broader field of RNAi therapeutics, which is our progress with ALN-APP, an investigational RNAi therapeutics in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. As announced last week, we reported the first ever clinical results within RNAi therapeutic directed to the CNS. Given the importance of the positive data and the intense interest in the study from all parties concerned not least patients and physicians, I think it's worthwhile to further discuss the interim findings from our ALN-APP program. ALN-APP targets amyloid precursor protein, or APP, which we're investigating as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or CAA. Human genetics have shown that certain mutations or duplications in the APP gene can cause early onset Alzheimer's disease where amyloid plaques forming brain tissue and are associated with neurodegeneration. Other mutations in the same gene can cause CAA where A beta fragments distinct from those that aggregate to form Alzheimer's plaque deposit within the walls of blood vessels in the brain and results bleeds. CAA is in fact the second leading cause of intracerebral hemorrhage. So this one parent protein APP can be harmful into distinct pathophysiological processes. In animal studies, we've shown that targeting APP with an siRNA show great promise with broad CNS biodistribution after a single intrathecal injection as shown on the left here with knockdown in all major CNS cell types to the neuron, oligodendrocytes, microglia and astrocytes. On the right, we can see that a single 60 milligram intrathecal dose in non-human primates results in significant and sustained target knockdown with durable \u2013 durability out to six months at which time the experiment was terminated, but APP suppression was still ongoing. These pharmacologic findings, which were reliable, reproducible and appeared safe, increased their excitement around the therapeutic hypothesis, specifically that by lowering APP protein production in the CNS, the RNAi mechanism, we could reduce the downstream fragments that aggregate and deposit in tissues and that therefore hopefully alter the disease force. To support advancement to clinical testing, we conducted short-term IND-enabling GLP toxicology studies in the rat and non-human primate where two low, medium and high doses were given them on the part, i.e., where we greatly exaggerated dose and regimen relative to that expected in the clinic. These studies demonstrated a supportive safety profile and no significant CNS histopathology and thereby enable the ALN-APP Phase 1 study. The Phase 1 trial is designed as a two-part study, a single ascending dose, Part A, followed by a multiple dose, Part B. Part A was enabled by the GLP toxicology studies I've just mentioned. The Phase 1 is being conducted in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease. The primary endpoint of this study is safety and tolerability of ALN-APP. Secondary objectives are focused on characterizing the pharmacology of ALN-APP. The study also includes a variety of exploratory biomarkers, which will allow us to assess whether the ALN-APP is showing any impact on other biomarkers of disease progression. The interim data shared from the initial single-ascending dose cohorts and we continue enrolling in Part A as we explore further doses. Excuse me. At the time of this interim look, 20 patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease have been enrolled in three single dose cohorts in Part A of the ongoing Phase 1 study. Today, ALN-APP has been well tolerated with no study dropouts and all adverse events being mild or moderate in severity. Available CSF data from white blood cells and protein appear similar to placebo. Neurofilament light chain or NFL, which is a mark of neuronal damage and which may be elevated in drug-induced neurotoxicity, was also monitored. Reassuringly early data for NFL, which are currently available from two out of the three cohorts study to date also, looked comparable to the placebo. Now let's look at the pharmacodynamic results after single intrathecal doses. To date, we've studied three dose levels, 25 milligrams, 50 milligrams and 75 milligrams; all available data to three-month time point are shown. Excitingly, we observed that unlike placebo, ALN-APP treatment resulted in rapid, dose-dependent and sustained reductions of both sAPP\u03b1 and soluble APP\u03b2. Both biomarkers of target engagement in the CSF. We saw rapid knockdown as early as Day 15 and observed maximum knockdown of up to 84%, 90% respectively for APP\u03b1 and APP\u03b2. At the highest dose tested 75 milligrams, the median lockdown was greater than 70% for both biomarkers and sustained for at least three months. Initially, per protocol, we intended to dose escalate from 75 to 225 milligrams. However, given that the knockdown observed at 75 milligrams substantially exceeded our initial target of 50% biomarker knockdown, we chose to deescalate to 50 milligrams. As you can see at 50 milligrams, while we have more limited data set, it appears equally promising and similar to the 75 milligram dose with substantial knockdown for both APP\u03b1 and beta. Now notably, the durability we see in humans reflects what we saw in non-human primary studies where single doses gave similar profound durable knockdown extending to six months or beyond. Accordingly, we anticipate that the responses we see here in Part A will continue. Indeed, for the data available beyond three months in this human study, we see continued target suppression. This durability of effect is important for ALN-APP, as well as our overall CNS assays as it suggests the potential for infrequent dosing. We look forward to seeing with longer follow-up indeed how long this knockdown effect is sustained. We believe these data suggest that the drug will be able to dosed quarterly at most, and based on animal data and the translation of our platform in humans, we believe that the potential team dose every six months or less frequently. Enrollment in the single sending dose portion of the Phase 1 study is ongoing in Canada, the Netherlands, the UK, and the United States. Additionally, enrollment in Part A will allow us to continue to explore single dose PK and PD and characterize the durability and effect \u2013 and long-term safety. Results from Part A will also inform the doses and regimens to be put forward into Part B, a multiple dose portion of the study, which will include patients from Part A. In parallel to Part A of the Phase 1 study, we conducted chronic GLP toxicology studies in animals to support the multi-dose Part B of the Phase 1. These chronic GLP tox studies were conducted without knowledge of the impressive knockdown and durability we see today at low doses of ALN-APP, we see in this Phase 1 study. So, as a standard practice, we exaggerated doses and dosing frequency relative to any dose and regimen that would ultimately be used in clinical testing. Specifically, we administered low, medium, and high intrathecal doses monthly for six months in the rat and every other month for nine months in the non-human primates. The data from the chronic studies have been shared with regulatory authorities. Before, we have already received regulatory approval to begin Part B in Canada, where in fact the majority of the chronic patients have been enrolled to date and approval is pending in the UK and Netherlands. In the U.S. the FDA has currently placed a partial clinical hold on the multidose Part B of the Phase 1 study due to findings observed in chronic toxicology studies. Of course, given the high exposure that we achieved with frequent administration of high doses, it's not unexpected that we would observe findings in these chronic toxicology studies. However, it's important to contextualize exposures by relative CSF volumes between toxicology species and humans. For example, relative to a potential clinical dose and regimen of 75 milligrams, given every six months, there is a more than ten-fold greater annualized exposure at all doses tested in the rat and non-human primate. And at the top doses evaluated in those chronic tox studies there's a 75-fold and 50-fold greater annualized exposure in rat and non-human primates respectively, relative to the same potential human dose. And if we scale based on organ weight, then these are annualized exposures would be even greater in the chronic tox studies. I want to nevertheless acknowledge that the FDA will be the ultimate arbiter of the data and we look forward to getting further guidance from them. Accordingly, we plan to engage with them to discuss all preclinical information, as well as these new interim Phase 1 clinical data, which provides important context to support potentially initiation of Part B in the U.S. To close this part of the discussion, I'm absolutely thrilled about these incredible human data that provide the first ever evidence that we may be able to use RNAi to find those disease causing transcription in the CNS. In animal studies, we've already demonstrated the reproducible and modular nature of our CNS platform with the knockdown against the diverse range of targets and hope that we can address disease causing genes not just for Alzheimer's, CAA, ALS and Huntington\u2019s, but also many other disorders. We look forward to presenting these interim data from Part A of the Phase 1 ALN-APP study at an upcoming medical congress. With that, let me turn to our efforts in ATTR amyloidosis where we are advancing three clinical stage product candidates, namely patisiran, vutrisiran and ALN-TTRsc04. As you know, ONPATTRO currently approved in multiple markets around the world to treat hereditary ATTR Amyloidosis with polyneuropathy and we are committed to expanding the product's label for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis patients. As announced in February, we are delighted that our supplemental New Drug Application patisiran for cardiomyopathy of ATTR Amyloidosis has been accepted by the FDA with a standard review and a PDUFA date of October 8. In their file acceptance letter, the FDA stated that they have not identified any review issues. The agency also noted that they're planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. Currently, we have no further details from the FDA regarding the timing of the outcome or the specific topics they wish to discuss. When we learn more, we will communicate that information in due course. If the sNDA is approved, this will allow us to extend the potential benefits of patisiran to many patients with wild-type and hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. This filing is based on the pivotal APOLLO-B study, which demonstrated improved functional status and quality of life in patients with at ATTR Amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy given patisiran for 12 months relative to placebo. The clinical profile of patisiran is supported by an encouraging safety profile and exploratory data that favored patisiran treatment relative to placebo on various biomarkers of disease progression at month 12. We've announced this morning that 18-month data from the APOLLO-B study have been submitted to the FDA as part of the sNDA review and we will be presenting these results at the ESC heart failure meet at the end of May. Now, similar to ONPATTRO, we are also committed to expanding the label for AMVUTTRA to include the treatment of cardiomyopathy in both hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis. This is being done with the HELIOS-B Phase 3 study of investigational vutrisiran. HELIOS-B, which is fully enrolled, has an endpoint of all-cause mortality and CV events assessed after at least 30 and up to 36 months, and we remain on track to share top line results in early 2024. Wrapping up with ALN-TTRsc04 is an investigational RNAi therapeutic based on our IKARIA platform offers the potential for more durable and potent TTR silencing with the possibility for annual dosing, a potentially transformative profile. ALN-TTRsc04 has entered the clinic and begun dosing in the Phase 1 study, and we expect top line results in late 2023. In addition to our late-stage clinical programs, we believe we've also been making great progress with our early- and mid-stage programs. Notable, our highlight includes zilebesiran, our investigational RNAi therapeutic for hypertension, which we believe could transform the treatment of the disease and offer a highly differentiated profile from all existing antihypertensives, including oral RAS inhibitors. We look forward to the important upcoming milestones from the Phase 2 program and remain on track to deliver top line results from KARDIA-1 in mid-2023 and top line results from KARDIA-2 at or around year-end 2023. These are just a few of the highlights from our broad and innovative pipeline driven by our underlying organic product engine \u2013 where we expect to deliver sustainable innovation representing a key growth driver for Alnylam in the years to come. To wrap up these highlights, we're excited to have initiated dosing in the Phase 1 study of ALN-KHK for the potential treatment of Type 2 diabetes with Regeneron has announced initiation of a Phase 2 study of ALN-HSD in patients with NASH. Now with that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review you our financials and upcoming milestones. Jeff? No. Good answer, Pushkal. Yes. Thanks, Yvonne. Thanks, Gena. Let me just go in order. So I think your first question, Gena, if I got it right, the 60-milligram in the monkey expectations in that in terms of translation. I think, I mean, even without thing I'm on calculations, if you think about the size of the monkey brand and the CSF volume, and you have to administer 60 milligrams to get something like the knockdown curves we're seeing at 50 milligrams here in humans and 75 milligrams. It just shows the gain in potency, and we believe will also see durability in humans relative to nonclinical species. Now you've watched us for a long time and you back to the liver data, that's exactly what we see in the liver setting. So these human Phase 1 data are really rather exciting and I think solid product profile where we hope at low doses rather than the animal. We see very important let significant knockdown for highly durable intervals that would allow in a treatment dosing, hopefully, every six months, maybe even annually. So that was question one. Your second question was we showed the medians what about the mean and standard deviations at 75%. Again, we haven't shown the patient-by-patient data we'll share more data at the upcoming meeting. But I can reassure you that as you go from low to high dose, the kind of variability you see patients, patients at high dose, you now see a track after track for each patient is following the same curve. So the data will be very tight in terms of means and standard deviation. We've looked at them that's $50 million and $75 million that we haven't shown today. So again, that conforms exactly to what we see with RNAi and other tissues where at low doses, some pharmacologic doses you see some variability between individuals just as you see in placebo. But once you're at an operative pharmacologic doses, you get a very tight knockdown and little enter [ph] individual variability. Again, these are all small numbers, but very encouraging data. And finally, do we need a nonhuman primate study to get off hold? I mean I think I shared today our impressions of the clinical data, the situation with the chronic tox studies, exaggerations and exposure we have. We want to descale this with the FDA and get their guidance. Obviously, they have a very important voice in this; we want to benefit from their input. So let's go and do that. And from that, we'll learn whether we need to do more studies or not. But if we can administer the low doses and get up to a year of knockdown, who next we'll see, but certainly very exciting times."

We specifically disclaim any obligation to update such statements. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Yvonne. Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Christine, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. The third quarter of 2024 marked a period of continued progress for Alnylam on all fronts. Commercially, we achieved 34% year-over-year growth in global net product revenue, generating $420 million across our four marketed products. We made great progress with our TTR franchise, sharing additional results from the HELIOS-B study of vutrisiran and filing regulatory submissions in the U.S. and EU. We also hosted a TTR Investor Day to highlight our preparations in anticipation of a potential launch in ATTR cardiomyopathy next year. We believe that AMVUTTRA and our broader TTR portfolio will serve as our flagship franchise, similar and potential impact to what EYLEA has been for Regeneron or what the cystic fibrosis franchise has been for Vertex delivering to those companies durable growth and enabling those companies to invest in R&D, new product development and portfolio diversification for the long term. Lastly, our early pipeline saw continued momentum as well, particularly our efforts in CNS. We initiated a Phase 1 study of ALN-HTT02 in Huntington's disease, and we're pleased to announce today initial results from the multi-dose portion of the Phase 1 study of mivelsiran in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease. These results are encouraging for our CNS platform as they provide early evidence that multiple doses of an intrathecally administered siRNA are well tolerated. We're continuing to progress towards achievement by year-end 2025 of our Alnylam P5x25 goals and are steadfast in our belief that we're on track to become a top-tier biotech developing and ctransformative medicines for patients around the world with rare and prevalent diseases driven by a high-yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering strong financial results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks, Yvonne, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was another strong quarter for our commercial portfolio with our combined commercial portfolio delivering year-over-year growth of 34% compared with the third quarter of 2023 as we continue to consistently increase the number of patients on therapy in both our TTR and rare franchises. Let me now turn to a summary of our third quarter TTR performance. Our TTR franchise achieved $309 million in global net product revenues, representing a 34% increase compared with the third quarter of 2023 as we continue to increase the number of hATTR polyneuropathy patients on our therapies, particularly noteworthy in the U.S. given the competitive environment. We are approaching 5,000 patients on treatment with ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA globally, and there is still a significant growth opportunity given that our belief that 25,000 to 30,000 patients across the globe suffer from this devastating disease. Now let me provide highlights of our U.S. and Rest of World TTR performance. In the U.S., combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased by 8% compared with the second quarter and a robust 37% year-over-year as momentum in new patient adds continues to drive strong growth. The U.S. 37% year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the following, a 31% increase in demand driven by the strength of ongoing AMVUTTRA patient uptake, more than offsetting the decrease in patients on ONPATTRO who have switched to AMVUTTRA. We are pleased with the growth in demand, which has been consistent throughout the year despite new competition entering the market at the end of 2023. Favorability is also driven by gross to net adjustment. Now let me turn to our international market, where the TTR franchise growth decreased by minus 9% compared to the second quarter of 2024, yet our quarter-over-quarter patient demand remains strong with plus 6% growth. The 9% quarter-on-quarter decrease was driven by a gross to net adjustment in Portugal that was booked in Q3 and large orders of ONPATTRO in our partner markets in Q2, including Australia, where we built inventory as we launched ONPATTRO in this market. On a year-over-year basis, the TTR business in international markets grew by 31% compared with the third quarter of 2023. At our recent TTR Investor Day, we shared our plans for the promising potential of vutrisiran in addressing ATTR cardiomyopathy pending regulatory approval. We're confident in our journey towards leadership in this field, driven by several key factors. ATTR cardiomyopathy is a rare and progressive disease where there is significant unmet need and substantial number of patients remain undiagnosed or not optimally treated. With HELIOS-B, we've shown very compelling results across key endpoints in a population reflective of today's patients. We have a track record of success in polyneuropathy and experience operating in a competitive environment. And our dedicated focus on ATTR will be instrumental as we scale for a successful launch, building Alnylam's flagship franchise and ushering a new phase of growth. Now moving to our rare franchise and the performance of GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, which delivered $111 million in combined net product sales during the third quarter, representing an 8% increase compared with the second quarter of 2024 and 34% growth compared with the third quarter of 2023. For GIVLAARI, Q3 product sales increased by 14% versus Q2, primarily due to the timing of orders in partner markets and a robust 31% compared with the third quarter of 2023 with the following year-over-year regional highlights. a 9% increase in the U.S., primarily driven by growth in new patients on therapy, a 79% increase in our rest of world markets, primarily driven by the timing of orders in our partner markets, primarily Brazil and increased demand growth across European markets. For OXLUMO, Q3 product sales were relatively flat versus Q2 2024, while delivering robust 40% year-over-year growth compared to Q3 2023 with the following regional dynamics, a 54% increase in the U.S., primarily driven by strong patient demand growth, a 33% growth from our rest of world markets, primarily driven by strong patient demand growth across both EU and our partner markets. In conclusion, our third quarter results reflect consistent strength with both our TTR and rare franchises achieving impressive patient and revenue growth. This performance positions us well to meet the midpoint of our full year revenue guidance, which we updated and raised during our second quarter earnings call. We remain intensely focused on preparing for a potential ATTR cardiomyopathy launch next year. And with that, I will now turn it over to Pushkal to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal?\nPushkal Garg: Thanks, Tolga, and good morning, everyone. As you all know, Q3 was very exciting for our TTR franchise. We shared the full results from the pivotal HELIOS-B study at ESC in August and additional exploratory findings at HFSA in September. Together, these data presentations highlighted vutrisiran's potentially transformational profile in today's population of patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy with benefits across a comprehensive series of assessments. This started with rapid knockdown of TTR, characteristic of the RNAi mechanism of action. We then saw favorable impact on cardiac biomarkers as well as echocardiographic assessments, reflecting impact on the underlying pathophysiology of this disease. This was then followed by impact on a number of important clinical measures of function and health status, indicating delays in disease progression. And ultimately, we saw profound benefits on outcomes with a greater than 30% reduction in all-cause mortality. Based on these compelling data, we've now completed regulatory submissions in the United States, where we've used a priority review voucher and in the EU with additional global regulatory submissions to follow in late 2024. Turning now to another important program for Alnylam. We're excited today to share new results from the multiple dose portion of the Phase 1 study of mivelsiran in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease. As you recall, mivelsiran is a leading program in our effort to expand our RNAi platform to target organ systems beyond the liver and address the high unmet need that exists for neurologic diseases. Mivelsiran is a C16 conjugated RNAi therapeutic targeting amyloid beta precursor protein or APP, and is in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy or CAA. APP is the upstream precursor of all amyloid beta peptides that form the amyloid deposits that are characteristic of these two diseases. We believe that by lowering APP production, we can reduce the substrate for new amyloid deposition, potentially enable natural clearance and slow, halt or even improve the clinical manifestations of these devastating diseases. Today, we are sharing initial interim data from the first multiple dose cohort from the Phase 1 study of mivelsiran in early onset Alzheimer's disease patients. In the chart here in the dotted line, you can see the rapid, robust and sustained target engagement we achieved with a single 50-milligram dose during the single-dose part of the study as measured by the target engagement biomarker soluble APP beta. After a single dose on day zero, mean reductions of approximately 75% in soluble APP beta were seen at month 1 with sustained reduction of approximately 50% still apparent at month 6 and a slow return towards baseline thereafter. In pink, you can see the initial interim data from the multiple dose portion of the study where patients were administered 50 milligrams at month zero and 6 and then followed through month 7 or 30 days after that second dose. You can see that APP beta follows a very similar trajectory to the patients after the single dose of 50 milligrams through the first 6 months. But then after the second 50-milligram dose at month 6, we see further reductions of APP beta at month 7, with patients achieving above 90% lowering of APP beta. So these are very encouraging data as they indicate we can achieve sustained robust lowering of APP with relatively low doses. Importantly, mivelsiran has been generally well tolerated in both the single and multiple dose parts of the study. No new safety signals have been identified in Phase 1 and no significant abnormalities have been seen on CSF safety labs such as total protein and CSF white cell count or on the exploratory biomarker neurofilament light chain. Given these encouraging results, we continue to aggressively advance this program through clinical development. Specifically, we have continued dose escalation in the single ascending dose portion of the study to fully explore the safety and pharmacology profile of mivelsiran. We've now also initiated multiple ascending dose cohort in the study to explore additional dose regimens. As we announced earlier this year, we've begun a Phase 2 study in CAA, the second leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke and for which there is no existing disease-modifying treatment. And in parallel, we're defining next steps for a Phase 2 study in Alzheimer's disease and we'll provide updates in due course. Moving to another exciting pipeline update. We moved our third CNS program into the clinic with initiation of a Phase 1 study of ALN-HTT02, which targets the disease-causing Huntington protein in patients with Huntington's disease. In Q3, we shared nonclinical data supporting the broad CNS distribution as well as the tolerability of deep and sustained lowering of HTT in nonhuman primates after single and repeated intrathecal administration of ALN-HTT02. We look forward to sharing updates on this exciting program in the future as we seek to address this progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease. As we've discussed, our potential upcoming launch in ATTR cardiomyopathy, assuming regulatory approval and near-term achievement of sustainable profitability are going to give us a strong foundation to continue investing in the promise of RNAi therapeutics to treat a broad variety of diseases with critical unmet needs. But as we've also discussed, we continue to be disciplined about resource allocation in this key phase of growth. As part of that ongoing commitment to optimize our efforts, we've announced today a decision to stop clinical development of ALN-KHK, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting ketohexokinase for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This decision furthers our efforts to allocate clinical, managerial and financial resources carefully to bring transformative medicines to patients, including our other programs in the metabolic space, which is an exciting one for RNAi therapeutics. We continue to explore multiple targets for metabolic disorders and look forward to sharing updates in the future. So in sum, we've made great progress in advancing our pipeline and platform with much more to come. As a reminder, we're working towards filing proprietary INDs for 9 programs by the end of 2025 against targets in the liver, CNS, muscle and adipose. If we include partnered programs, we anticipate the potential for 15 new INDs by the end of 2025, representing a near doubling of our clinical pipeline by the end of next year. This remarkable and unique pace of innovation puts us in a great position to have a robust, self-sustainable pipeline that can deliver meaningful impact to patients across multiple disease areas. With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff?\nJeff Poulton: Thanks, Pushkal, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam's Q3 2024 financial results and discussing our full year guidance. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for Q3 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. Total product revenue for the quarter was $420 million or 34% growth versus 2023, with both our TTR and rare franchises reporting strong growth of 34%, primarily driven by continued strong demand, as Tolga previously highlighted. Net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was $57 million, representing a $370 million decrease when compared with last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the recognition in Q3 2023 of the $310 million upfront payment from Roche as well as the $65 million in revenue recognized from a $100 million milestone earned for achieving certain criteria during early clinical development for mivelsiran. Royalty revenue for the quarter was $23 million or more than double what was recognized in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by higher Leqvio sales as Novartis continues to grow demand for Leqvio worldwide. Gross margin on product sales was 80% for the quarter compared with 75% in the third quarter of 2023. The improvement in margin is primarily due to higher costs in 2023 associated with canceled manufacturing commitments for ONPATTRO and other adjustments to inventory, for which similar expenses did not occur this year, offset by an increased rate of royalties payable on net sales of AMVUTTRA. I expect our gross margin on product sales will be lower in Q4, driven by a higher royalty rate payable on sales of AMVUTTRA. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 12% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, primarily due to increased costs associated with our preclinical activities as we progress our 225 strategy to expand our clinical pipeline by the end of 2025 as well as clinical activities, which mainly grew with expenses associated with zilebesiran KARDIA-3 Phase 2 clinical study and increased personnel costs. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 19% in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher costs associated with marketing investments to promote our TTR therapies and preparations for the potential launch of AMVUTTRA for cardiomyopathy, along with increased personnel costs. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter was $31 million, representing more than a $300 million decrease compared with Q3 2023, primarily driven by the recognition of collaboration revenue related to our Roche agreement and achievement of a mivelsiran milestone last year, as previously highlighted. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.8 billion compared with $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, with the increase primarily due to improved operating performance and net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with employee stock option exercises. Now I'd like to turn to our financial guidance for 2024. Today, we are reiterating our 2024 guidance that was updated on our Q2 earnings call. We anticipate combined net product revenues for our four commercial products will be within a range of $1.575 billion and $1.65 billion. Our collaboration and royalty revenue guidance range is $575 million to $650 million. And lastly, our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses remains a range of between $1.775 billion and $1.875 billion. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones for late 2024. We announced that we'll present additional findings from the ongoing Phase I study of ALN-TTRsc04 in patients with ATTR amyloidosis at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in November. We plan to share our Phase 3 development plan for ALN-TTRsc04 in the first quarter of 2025. We also intend to initiate a Phase 2 study for mivelsiran in patients with Alzheimer's disease at or around year-end. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, we will now open the call for questions. Those dialed in, we would like to ask you to limit yourself to one question each and then get back in the queue if you have any additional questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ellie Merle with UBS. Your line is open.\nEllie Merle: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just in terms of your earlier-stage pipeline, can you elaborate a bit on some of the work that you've done to improve the ability to deliver RNAi to adipose tissue and muscle? And how are you thinking about what makes the most sense as initial targets or diseases in these tissues? And any specific advantages to your approach versus other modalities? Thanks.\nPushkal Garg: Yes. Thanks, Ellie. As Jeff highlighted, we've talked about, we are very excited about the emerging profile of RNAi therapeutics, right? What we're seeing is that these therapies appear to be well tolerated, and we can get sustained knockdown of a disease-causing protein that allows for infrequent administration. And we're guided by human genetics in terms of the diseases that we pursue, which can allow us to validate both efficacy and safety using population genetics as well as preclinical work. So adipose and muscle are two of the areas that we've highlighted in our 225 strategy as new tissues to pursue. We highlighted a little bit at R&D Day earlier in the year, some of the approaches that we're taking, and we remain on track to progress those. We actually are - we'll be talking about an R&D Day early next year, and we'll give the specific timing of that. And that's probably the best time for us to give a more substantive update on those programs. But we're making good progress. And for competitive reasons, we're probably not going to say a lot more at this point.\nA -: Thanks, Pushkal. That's great. And I think it's one of the opportunities of our platform really is to continue delivering ongoing innovation as we start to make progress in some of these extrahepatic issues. Thank you, Ellie. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Gena Wang with Barclays. Your line is open.\nGena Wang: Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask one question regarding the ALN-HTT02. It seems like very impressive data in nonhuman primates. I believe this is one of very few showing actual knocking down in nonhuman primate brains instead of most of others showing rodent brain. So I know everyone is using 50% as a benchmark. Is that something you are looking for? What else you will be looking for regarding the Phase 1 data?\nPushkal Garg: Yeah. Thanks, Gena. I'm glad you highlighted the Huntington's program because it's one that we're particularly excited about. This now represents our third CNS program that we're moving into the clinic. And what we're seeing here is that many of the insights that we learned from our APP program in terms of being able to have sustained knockdown of a disease-causing gene and appears to be well tolerated in preclinical studies is very encouraging. So we believe we will have something that will allow sustained knockdown as well as hopefully be well tolerated in the clinic as we've seen with our APP program to date. The nonclinical findings were actually quite benign in the preclinical studies that we saw, as we highlighted in the slide, it was well tolerated both in rodent and nonhuman primate species. And then the targeting approach we're taking is quite unique. We're going after an upstream portion of the gene, which includes the exon 1 fragment. And there's been an emerging amount of data in the literature that suggests that beyond targeting the full-length mutant protein that targeting the exon 1 fragment may also help in progression of this otherwise very, very rapidly progressive and fatal disease. So we think we may have an opportunity for unique efficacy with this molecule. So we're moving forward in our single ascending dose study. These are in patients with symptomatic disease. We'll be looking at safety and tolerability, PK, PD, we'll be looking at changes in mutant Huntington's level - mutant Huntington levels. And we'll also have in that, as we go forward, clinical and imaging and biomarker measures, measures such as NfL, et cetera, that can be very useful in looking at progression in this disease. The study is in active start-up mode in the U.K., Canada. And then in the United States, we also have a green light to proceed. I'll note that we do have a dose cap in the United States. And so we still have a green light to proceed in all three territories, and we're moving forward. So I'm very excited that we'll be able to do that. And we'll work with the FDA going forward if and when we need to sort of lift that dose cap. It may give us enough coverage as it is to cover the doses that we're interested in, but we'll work with the FDA in terms of lifting that dose cap over time. And so we're very excited about this program.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Okay. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Lebowitz with Citi. Your line is open.\nDavid Lebowitz: Thank you very much for taking my question. In terms of polyneuropathy at this point in time, how would you say the impact of a second silencer has been on the market and your overall trajectory? And additionally, I know that plenty of your prescribers for polyneuropathy are cardiologists. Have you noticed an inflection in the number of questions coming regarding the ATTR cardiomyopathy data?\nTolga Tanguler: Hi, Dave. Yeah. Look, I mean, now we have 9 months under our belt with another competitor in the marketplace in the United States. And what you will see in our - both our quarter-over-quarter growth in the U.S., which is 8% up, as well as our year-over-year growth that is 37% up is a good indicative actually not only how this category still there's a significant unmet need, but how we've been able to actually compete versus a competitor. And we believe the fact that our route of administration is quarterly with a number of optionalities in terms of where those patients actually can receive their treatment. The fact that our patients remain on treatment due to this quarterly dosing and our patient services as well as, obviously, what you'll see in our platform that the ability to provide rapid knockdown as quickly as within the first dose at 60% and up to 88% after the second dose are important differentiators, and we believe this is really getting good traction, both with patients as well as physicians. In terms of the cardiologists, the second part of your question, look, we've put established very clear guardrails to make sure that we are promoting compliantly and making sure that the launch is ahead of us, not - we're not in the launch phase. And when there is questions around HELIOS-B, we appropriately address that and triage that with our medical affairs colleagues. But in terms of the number of patients that are coming in with that indication, that would not be something that we would allow as an organization. But overall, again, I'm very pleased with the performance of Q3, and we are seeing - we're continuing to see good robust demand in our polyneuropathy hereditary indication.\nYvonne Greenstreet: That's terrific, Tolga. I think it illustrates that we've actually built a really high-performing commercial engine and we have a compelling profile for AMVUTTRA. So we're very excited about the future. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Paul Matteis with Stifel. Your line is open.\nPaul Matteis: Hi. Great. Thanks so much. I wanted to ask one more follow-up question just on recent prescribing dynamics in TTR in light of the HELIOS-B data. And Tolga, I totally understand where you're coming from, right, that you guys promote solely in polyneuropathy. But just as it relates to a cardiologist if they want to prescribe AMVUTTRA right now, what are the prior auth requirements that you see? Do they need to have a neurologist offer corroboration of a polyneuropathy diagnosis? Like are there kind of significant impediments in place that really can find this drug to that true mixed phenotype population at this point before getting an expanded label? Thank you.\nTolga Tanguler: Yeah, Paul, that's a great question. And you clearly grasp some of the complications and how the patients are actually getting diagnosed. So if you're in a cardiomyopathy if you're suspected of having a cardiomyopathy, physicians, especially in the United States, tend to go through scintigraphy. And if the patient actually is determined to have the condition as suspected, they would then be quickly put on the treatment. Now in polyneuropathy, not only because of our indication is hereditary that you would actually go to a genetic testing to validate that. And then you would also have an additional neurological workout to make sure that, that patient actually has the neurological manifestations of the disease and then you would be put on the treatment. Now in terms of the access challenges, nearly all of our patients actually end up getting good sustained access regardless of what source of reimbursement channel they have. So that's really not the challenge. It's mostly is - is the challenge on the diagnostic pathway, polyneuropathy hereditary being the last stage of that pathway rather than the first stage what we see in cardiomyopathy.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Ritu Baral with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nRitu Baral: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask just how Tolga and maybe, Jeff, how you are thinking about payer discussions now even ahead of potential label expansion. What are the levers, what are the topics that you're discussing? And how are you viewing the potential for volume-based discounts upon potential label expansion and increasing number of patients on AMVUTTRA?\nJeff Poulton: That's a great question, Ritu. I think it's actually for Tolga.\nTolga Tanguler: Yeah. So Ritu, as we shared at the TTR Day, what payers care as they should be is the value proposition, which is really driven by the clinical outcome. And as we have demonstrated in HELIOS-B, the product really does provide an incredible and important differentiator in terms of CV outcome in today's patient population. So that's what we're so far seeing is payers understanding, acknowledging that this remains a rare, albeit growing disease and the fact that the HELIOS-B results outcomes are compelling. In terms of how we're going to be able to navigate the access landscape has a lot to do with our patient access philosophy. I think what we've been able to demonstrate within the polyneuropathy indication, how we've been able to get seamless access to our patients and a big majority of them not having any co-pay burden and about 30% of them end up having about $2,000 or less co-pay burden. And part of our patient access philosophy has to do with value-based agreements and appropriate rebates. This is an area where, obviously, we're going to be disclosing more. We understand and appreciate why there is interest in this. But we will actually communicate that as we get more closer to our PDUFA date, which is not set yet.\nRitu Baral: Got it. And let me ask very quick follow-up, guys, just on Paul's question. It's a follow-up to Paul's. So I'm going to squeeze this in. How is there how is the cardiologists and neurologists understanding of compressive neuropathies factor into Paul's question?\nYvonne Greenstreet: You mean carpal tunnel or spinal...\nRitu Baral: Carpal tunnel spinal stenosis. Yeah, in that.\nTolga Tanguler: So I mean, yeah. Look, I mean, I think TTR is a systemic disease, and that's why you have multicenters that actually treat multidisciplinary physicians that actually treat this disease. Now this doesn't also, of course, exist in every market, every academic - even every academic center. But in most centers, you have a good collaboration between a cardiologist and a neurologist and in some cases, even orthopedic surgeon. But because the disease has been evolved, the genesis of the disease evolved by the cardiologists, the first stop tends to be the cardiologists where they actually do the scintigraphy and do the preliminary diagnosis. And if there is not suspicion of additional manifestations of disease, they tend to go with the only approved product that's available today. And we believe that's obviously going to change over time.\nYvonne Greenstreet: I think it's a great question actually, Ritu, because these red flag symptoms, I think, are going to be an important part of physician education and awareness going forward. So thanks for the question. The two questions. Let's take the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking our question. This is Tommy on for Salveen. So you talked about how there is this initial focus on frontline for cardiomyopathy. But wondering if - what's your thoughts on if there could be a bolus of path progressors in the second half of next year who are aware and kind of want something new? Thank you.\nTolga Tanguler: Yeah. I mean at our TTR Day, we delayered the strategy. And the reason why we explained that strategy has a lot to do with what the data suggests and where today's patients are. So as we've highlighted, this is a fast progressing and severe disease. So our understanding is the treaters are really focusing to make sure that they - as soon as they diagnose these patients, they want to diag them early and they want to hit hard, hit hard with a product that we believe is going to be providing data with today's patient population, where the subgroup patients where a portion of them are on the only stabilizers that is available or with GLP-1 or they are on diuretic intensification. Those are the patients that they are currently seeing. And if you look at the dynamic of the market, we see ever larger number of patients that are coming into the category. So you want to be able to establish yourself as a first-line product because of the data and because of the fast progress of the nature of the disease, so those patients actually can get treated. Now in terms of patients that might be progressing on a stabilizer, of course, I'm sure physicians will start identifying those patients if they haven't already done so and we'll probably eventually either depending on the access limitations or challenges that they may have, either put them switch them on those patients or use a combination therapy. Now it's important to highlight that until tafamidis will become generic, there is no switch behavior that's been established in this category. Therefore, we do believe that will take some time to establish. And obviously, we will be doing our part to make sure that those patients are identified, those patients that are progressing are well identified. But I think it's important to highlight that given the number of patients that are coming into the category and the dynamic and the data that we have, we believe AMVUTTRA will be well positioned to become a first-line standard of care therapy.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Tolga.\nTolga Tanguler: Assuming approval of [indiscernible]\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thank you for answering that question. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJessica Fye: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I got another one on TTR. Is there anything that you're going to be watching for in the acoramidis label with their PDUFA coming up? And I guess, stepping back, do you see any of the potential label scenarios for that product as relevant to your expectations for your own launch in TTR cardiomyopathy? Thank you.\nTolga Tanguler: Yeah. Look, like everybody, obviously, we're interested in seeing the acoramidis label assuming approval. I mean, we feel very confident about the data that we've generated with HELIOS-B. And we're looking forward actually to moving through the regulatory process in both the U.S. and in Europe and using our priority review voucher, assuming a potential approval early next year. So we feel really good about where we are. And I think we'll just have to wait to see exactly what gets delivered with respect to acoramidis.\nPushkal Garg: Yeah. The only thing I would add is, obviously, to comment on their label would be speculative. But from a broader market dynamic perspective, we believe acoramidis will be a twice daily stabilizer. And how that market dynamic will shape, I think we'll have to do a lot to do with our orthogonal mechanism of action and how we would be able to compete in the patient population that are still, again, as a first-line agent or those patients that are progressing on a stabilizer.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Terrific. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Gary Nachman with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nGary Nachman: Thanks. Good morning. So as we anticipate the launches of vutri and ATTR-CM next year in both the U.S. and then the EU, how should we think about spending levels in SG&A relative to this year for all the commercial activities you'll be doing, just order of magnitude? And then remind us of the infrastructure you have in Europe and how you think of the CM opportunity there relative to the U.S. in terms of both accessing patients and also pricing? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: That's a great question. Thank you. I think Jeff will take the first part of it, and then Tolga will follow up with his plans for making sure that we kind of execute on our plans for potential AMVUTTRA launch.\nJeff Poulton: Yeah. I mean, I would say we upgraded our guidance this year at Q2 on OpEx, right? And that reflected the confidence that we had in the HELIOS-B results and sort of playing to win. And so you'll see in the second half of the year this year an increase in investment. And the commercial team has made very good progress in starting to prepare for the launch, particularly in the U.S. with the hiring that's been done. So with a lot of that happening in the second half of the year, that's obviously going to create growth for next year. And we'll continue to invest more broadly even than just in the U.S. as we move towards the second half of the year and launches in Europe. I don't have specific guidance, but I would expect that certainly double-digit growth in terms of SG&A. But we'll provide our annual guidance for '25 on our year-end call in February.\nPushkal Garg: Yeah. And what's been great is that we've actually built a very strong foundation actually in TTR polyneuropathy. And so really, it's been more of a sort of incremental growth to make sure that we're absolutely well positioned to be successful in the CM indication. But Tolga, anything else to...\nTolga Tanguler: I mean, the only thing I would add is from an organizational focus perspective, we have established an end-to-end organization, which has actually demonstrated excellent results, not only in TTR, but also in rare. So our TTR organization, not only in Europe, but also in Japan, has been demonstrating really robust growth numbers. I mean we've just posted a 31% year-over-year growth. If you look at the performance of - on the demand side of our international business has been up at 6% quarter-over-quarter. Now that's been done in a market where there is significant price sensitivity, where we have a PN product that's priced for the narrower indication. And we've been able to become a market leader at 80% versus tafamidis in that specific PN indication where we also compete with them in that indication. So we actually are quite pleased with the structure that we've established and as Jeff indicated, we're going to play to win and make sure that we are providing the right access options in those markets. And so far, we've been able to compete well, and we believe we'll be able to do that with the HELIOS-B data as a tailwind.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Great. Thank you, Tolga. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kostas Biliouris with BMO Capital. Your line is open.\nKostas Biliouris: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for [Technical Difficulty] and outside of your pipeline, acknowledging that your pipeline is large and very robust and can drive growth. I'm wondering whether you can comment on potential BD activities that could potentially support even additional growth in addition to your internal efforts? Thank you.\nTolga Tanguler: Yeah. No, that's a great question. Look, we're very privileged actually to have kind of an incredibly rich pipeline. I mean we think it's one of the most exciting pipelines in the industry. And Pushkal touched on the fact that we'll be doubling the pipeline by the end of '25. So we've got a lot of really, really interesting opportunities in the company. And clearly, we're also going to make sure that we focus on a successful AMVUTTRA launch. And so we're really focused on driving both our internal pipeline, as well as continuing to optimize the platform. When we think about BD, we're also very open to considering opportunities that really enable our platform and help us continue to access all the other tissues, and Pushkal described some of these. And so really, that's our focus at the moment. Clearly, we obviously pay a lot of attention to what's happening in the innovation landscape around us. But really, we have - we're in a very privileged position to have an awful lot that we can progress within the company, and we're excited to move all of that forward.\nChristine Lindenboom: Next question. I think this is our last question.\nOperator: We'll take our last question from Tazeen Ahmad with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTazeen Ahmad: Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. Maybe this last one is for Tolga going back to the launch. In terms of expectations, for the early part of any rare disease launch, I think companies talk about the time it's going to take from the time the script is written to the time that the script is dispensed to the patient. But since this is going to be the second indication for your product, do you expect those traditional sometimes conservative time lines as to extended time period, at least initially to hold true here? Or do you expect that to already have been smoothed out from your PN launch? Thanks.\nTolga Tanguler: Yeah. Thank you, Tazeen. We recognize that this is an area where we do need to provide some additional color. And we will do that closer to our launch time lines and the respective engagements that we will have, and we should be able to provide additional context as we get closer to the launch.\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Tolga. And look, thank you to everyone for joining us on the call. We feel very pleased with the third quarter of 2024. It was one of continued progress. We delivered robust financial growth as well as advancements in our pipeline. So thank you, everybody, and have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tolga Tanguler",
            "content": "Thanks, Yvonne, and good morning, everyone. Q3 was another strong quarter for our commercial portfolio with our combined commercial portfolio delivering year-over-year growth of 34% compared with the third quarter of 2023 as we continue to consistently increase the number of patients on therapy in both our TTR and rare franchises. Let me now turn to a summary of our third quarter TTR performance. Our TTR franchise achieved $309 million in global net product revenues, representing a 34% increase compared with the third quarter of 2023 as we continue to increase the number of hATTR polyneuropathy patients on our therapies, particularly noteworthy in the U.S. given the competitive environment. We are approaching 5,000 patients on treatment with ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA globally, and there is still a significant growth opportunity given that our belief that 25,000 to 30,000 patients across the globe suffer from this devastating disease. Now let me provide highlights of our U.S. and Rest of World TTR performance. In the U.S., combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased by 8% compared with the second quarter and a robust 37% year-over-year as momentum in new patient adds continues to drive strong growth. The U.S. 37% year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the following, a 31% increase in demand driven by the strength of ongoing AMVUTTRA patient uptake, more than offsetting the decrease in patients on ONPATTRO who have switched to AMVUTTRA. We are pleased with the growth in demand, which has been consistent throughout the year despite new competition entering the market at the end of 2023. Favorability is also driven by gross to net adjustment. Now let me turn to our international market, where the TTR franchise growth decreased by minus 9% compared to the second quarter of 2024, yet our quarter-over-quarter patient demand remains strong with plus 6% growth. The 9% quarter-on-quarter decrease was driven by a gross to net adjustment in Portugal that was booked in Q3 and large orders of ONPATTRO in our partner markets in Q2, including Australia, where we built inventory as we launched ONPATTRO in this market. On a year-over-year basis, the TTR business in international markets grew by 31% compared with the third quarter of 2023. At our recent TTR Investor Day, we shared our plans for the promising potential of vutrisiran in addressing ATTR cardiomyopathy pending regulatory approval. We're confident in our journey towards leadership in this field, driven by several key factors. ATTR cardiomyopathy is a rare and progressive disease where there is significant unmet need and substantial number of patients remain undiagnosed or not optimally treated. With HELIOS-B, we've shown very compelling results across key endpoints in a population reflective of today's patients. We have a track record of success in polyneuropathy and experience operating in a competitive environment. And our dedicated focus on ATTR will be instrumental as we scale for a successful launch, building Alnylam's flagship franchise and ushering a new phase of growth. Now moving to our rare franchise and the performance of GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, which delivered $111 million in combined net product sales during the third quarter, representing an 8% increase compared with the second quarter of 2024 and 34% growth compared with the third quarter of 2023. For GIVLAARI, Q3 product sales increased by 14% versus Q2, primarily due to the timing of orders in partner markets and a robust 31% compared with the third quarter of 2023 with the following year-over-year regional highlights. a 9% increase in the U.S., primarily driven by growth in new patients on therapy, a 79% increase in our rest of world markets, primarily driven by the timing of orders in our partner markets, primarily Brazil and increased demand growth across European markets. For OXLUMO, Q3 product sales were relatively flat versus Q2 2024, while delivering robust 40% year-over-year growth compared to Q3 2023 with the following regional dynamics, a 54% increase in the U.S., primarily driven by strong patient demand growth, a 33% growth from our rest of world markets, primarily driven by strong patient demand growth across both EU and our partner markets. In conclusion, our third quarter results reflect consistent strength with both our TTR and rare franchises achieving impressive patient and revenue growth. This performance positions us well to meet the midpoint of our full year revenue guidance, which we updated and raised during our second quarter earnings call. We remain intensely focused on preparing for a potential ATTR cardiomyopathy launch next year. And with that, I will now turn it over to Pushkal to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal? Hi, Dave. Yeah. Look, I mean, now we have 9 months under our belt with another competitor in the marketplace in the United States. And what you will see in our - both our quarter-over-quarter growth in the U.S., which is 8% up, as well as our year-over-year growth that is 37% up is a good indicative actually not only how this category still there's a significant unmet need, but how we've been able to actually compete versus a competitor. And we believe the fact that our route of administration is quarterly with a number of optionalities in terms of where those patients actually can receive their treatment. The fact that our patients remain on treatment due to this quarterly dosing and our patient services as well as, obviously, what you'll see in our platform that the ability to provide rapid knockdown as quickly as within the first dose at 60% and up to 88% after the second dose are important differentiators, and we believe this is really getting good traction, both with patients as well as physicians. In terms of the cardiologists, the second part of your question, look, we've put established very clear guardrails to make sure that we are promoting compliantly and making sure that the launch is ahead of us, not - we're not in the launch phase. And when there is questions around HELIOS-B, we appropriately address that and triage that with our medical affairs colleagues. But in terms of the number of patients that are coming in with that indication, that would not be something that we would allow as an organization. But overall, again, I'm very pleased with the performance of Q3, and we are seeing - we're continuing to see good robust demand in our polyneuropathy hereditary indication. Yeah, Paul, that's a great question. And you clearly grasp some of the complications and how the patients are actually getting diagnosed. So if you're in a cardiomyopathy if you're suspected of having a cardiomyopathy, physicians, especially in the United States, tend to go through scintigraphy. And if the patient actually is determined to have the condition as suspected, they would then be quickly put on the treatment. Now in polyneuropathy, not only because of our indication is hereditary that you would actually go to a genetic testing to validate that.

Now in terms of the access challenges, nearly all of our patients actually end up getting good sustained access regardless of what source of reimbursement channel they have. So that's really not the challenge. It's mostly is - is the challenge on the diagnostic pathway, polyneuropathy hereditary being the last stage of that pathway rather than the first stage what we see in cardiomyopathy. Yeah. So Ritu, as we shared at the TTR Day, what payers care as they should be is the value proposition, which is really driven by the clinical outcome. And as we have demonstrated in HELIOS-B, the product really does provide an incredible and important differentiator in terms of CV outcome in today's patient population. So that's what we're so far seeing is payers understanding, acknowledging that this remains a rare, albeit growing disease and the fact that the HELIOS-B results outcomes are compelling. In terms of how we're going to be able to navigate the access landscape has a lot to do with our patient access philosophy. I think what we've been able to demonstrate within the polyneuropathy indication, how we've been able to get seamless access to our patients and a big majority of them not having any co-pay burden and about 30% of them end up having about $2,000 or less co-pay burden.

            "content": "Thanks, Tolga, and good morning, everyone. As you all know, Q3 was very exciting for our TTR franchise. We shared the full results from the pivotal HELIOS-B study at ESC in August and additional exploratory findings at HFSA in September. Together, these data presentations highlighted vutrisiran's potentially transformational profile in today's population of patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy with benefits across a comprehensive series of assessments. This started with rapid knockdown of TTR, characteristic of the RNAi mechanism of action. We then saw favorable impact on cardiac biomarkers as well as echocardiographic assessments, reflecting impact on the underlying pathophysiology of this disease. This was then followed by impact on a number of important clinical measures of function and health status, indicating delays in disease progression. And ultimately, we saw profound benefits on outcomes with a greater than 30% reduction in all-cause mortality. Based on these compelling data, we've now completed regulatory submissions in the United States, where we've used a priority review voucher and in the EU with additional global regulatory submissions to follow in late 2024. Turning now to another important program for Alnylam. We're excited today to share new results from the multiple dose portion of the Phase 1 study of mivelsiran in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease. As you recall, mivelsiran is a leading program in our effort to expand our RNAi platform to target organ systems beyond the liver and address the high unmet need that exists for neurologic diseases. Mivelsiran is a C16 conjugated RNAi therapeutic targeting amyloid beta precursor protein or APP, and is in development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy or CAA. APP is the upstream precursor of all amyloid beta peptides that form the amyloid deposits that are characteristic of these two diseases. We believe that by lowering APP production, we can reduce the substrate for new amyloid deposition, potentially enable natural clearance and slow, halt or even improve the clinical manifestations of these devastating diseases. Today, we are sharing initial interim data from the first multiple dose cohort from the Phase 1 study of mivelsiran in early onset Alzheimer's disease patients. In the chart here in the dotted line, you can see the rapid, robust and sustained target engagement we achieved with a single 50-milligram dose during the single-dose part of the study as measured by the target engagement biomarker soluble APP beta. After a single dose on day zero, mean reductions of approximately 75% in soluble APP beta were seen at month 1 with sustained reduction of approximately 50% still apparent at month 6 and a slow return towards baseline thereafter. In pink, you can see the initial interim data from the multiple dose portion of the study where patients were administered 50 milligrams at month zero and 6 and then followed through month 7 or 30 days after that second dose. You can see that APP beta follows a very similar trajectory to the patients after the single dose of 50 milligrams through the first 6 months. But then after the second 50-milligram dose at month 6, we see further reductions of APP beta at month 7, with patients achieving above 90% lowering of APP beta. So these are very encouraging data as they indicate we can achieve sustained robust lowering of APP with relatively low doses. Importantly, mivelsiran has been generally well tolerated in both the single and multiple dose parts of the study. No new safety signals have been identified in Phase 1 and no significant abnormalities have been seen on CSF safety labs such as total protein and CSF white cell count or on the exploratory biomarker neurofilament light chain. Given these encouraging results, we continue to aggressively advance this program through clinical development. Specifically, we have continued dose escalation in the single ascending dose portion of the study to fully explore the safety and pharmacology profile of mivelsiran. We've now also initiated multiple ascending dose cohort in the study to explore additional dose regimens. As we announced earlier this year, we've begun a Phase 2 study in CAA, the second leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke and for which there is no existing disease-modifying treatment. And in parallel, we're defining next steps for a Phase 2 study in Alzheimer's disease and we'll provide updates in due course. Moving to another exciting pipeline update. We moved our third CNS program into the clinic with initiation of a Phase 1 study of ALN-HTT02, which targets the disease-causing Huntington protein in patients with Huntington's disease. In Q3, we shared nonclinical data supporting the broad CNS distribution as well as the tolerability of deep and sustained lowering of HTT in nonhuman primates after single and repeated intrathecal administration of ALN-HTT02. We look forward to sharing updates on this exciting program in the future as we seek to address this progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease. As we've discussed, our potential upcoming launch in ATTR cardiomyopathy, assuming regulatory approval and near-term achievement of sustainable profitability are going to give us a strong foundation to continue investing in the promise of RNAi therapeutics to treat a broad variety of diseases with critical unmet needs. But as we've also discussed, we continue to be disciplined about resource allocation in this key phase of growth. As part of that ongoing commitment to optimize our efforts, we've announced today a decision to stop clinical development of ALN-KHK, an investigational RNAi therapeutic targeting ketohexokinase for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This decision furthers our efforts to allocate clinical, managerial and financial resources carefully to bring transformative medicines to patients, including our other programs in the metabolic space, which is an exciting one for RNAi therapeutics. We continue to explore multiple targets for metabolic disorders and look forward to sharing updates in the future. So in sum, we've made great progress in advancing our pipeline and platform with much more to come. As a reminder, we're working towards filing proprietary INDs for 9 programs by the end of 2025 against targets in the liver, CNS, muscle and adipose. If we include partnered programs, we anticipate the potential for 15 new INDs by the end of 2025, representing a near doubling of our clinical pipeline by the end of next year. This remarkable and unique pace of innovation puts us in a great position to have a robust, self-sustainable pipeline that can deliver meaningful impact to patients across multiple disease areas. With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff? Yes. Thanks, Ellie. As Jeff highlighted, we've talked about, we are very excited about the emerging profile of RNAi therapeutics, right? What we're seeing is that these therapies appear to be well tolerated, and we can get sustained knockdown of a disease-causing protein that allows for infrequent administration. And we're guided by human genetics in terms of the diseases that we pursue, which can allow us to validate both efficacy and safety using population genetics as well as preclinical work. So adipose and muscle are two of the areas that we've highlighted in our 225 strategy as new tissues to pursue. We highlighted a little bit at R&D Day earlier in the year, some of the approaches that we're taking, and we remain on track to progress those. We actually are - we'll be talking about an R&D Day early next year, and we'll give the specific timing of that. And that's probably the best time for us to give a more substantive update on those programs. But we're making good progress. And for competitive reasons, we're probably not going to say a lot more at this point. Yeah. Thanks, Gena. I'm glad you highlighted the Huntington's program because it's one that we're particularly excited about. This now represents our third CNS program that we're moving into the clinic. And what we're seeing here is that many of the insights that we learned from our APP program in terms of being able to have sustained knockdown of a disease-causing gene and appears to be well tolerated in preclinical studies is very encouraging. So we believe we will have something that will allow sustained knockdown as well as hopefully be well tolerated in the clinic as we've seen with our APP program to date. The nonclinical findings were actually quite benign in the preclinical studies that we saw, as we highlighted in the slide, it was well tolerated both in rodent and nonhuman primate species. And then the targeting approach we're taking is quite unique. We're going after an upstream portion of the gene, which includes the exon 1 fragment. And there's been an emerging amount of data in the literature that suggests that beyond targeting the full-length mutant protein that targeting the exon 1 fragment may also help in progression of this otherwise very, very rapidly progressive and fatal disease. So we think we may have an opportunity for unique efficacy with this molecule. So we're moving forward in our single ascending dose study. These are in patients with symptomatic disease. We'll be looking at safety and tolerability, PK, PD, we'll be looking at changes in mutant Huntington's level - mutant Huntington levels. And we'll also have in that, as we go forward, clinical and imaging and biomarker measures, measures such as NfL, et cetera, that can be very useful in looking at progression in this disease. The study is in active start-up mode in the U.K., Canada. And then in the United States, we also have a green light to proceed. I'll note that we do have a dose cap in the United States. And so we still have a green light to proceed in all three territories, and we're moving forward. So I'm very excited that we'll be able to do that. And we'll work with the FDA going forward if and when we need to sort of lift that dose cap. It may give us enough coverage as it is to cover the doses that we're interested in, but we'll work with the FDA in terms of lifting that dose cap over time. And so we're very excited about this program. Yeah. The only thing I would add is, obviously, to comment on their label would be speculative. But from a broader market dynamic perspective, we believe acoramidis will be a twice daily stabilizer. And how that market dynamic will shape, I think we'll have to do a lot to do with our orthogonal mechanism of action and how we would be able to compete in the patient population that are still, again, as a first-line agent or those patients that are progressing on a stabilizer. Yeah. And what's been great is that we've actually built a very strong foundation actually in TTR polyneuropathy. And so really, it's been more of a sort of incremental growth to make sure that we're absolutely well positioned to be successful in the CM indication. But Tolga, anything else to..."

            "name": "Jeff Poulton",
            "content": "Thanks, Pushkal, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam's Q3 2024 financial results and discussing our full year guidance. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for Q3 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. Total product revenue for the quarter was $420 million or 34% growth versus 2023, with both our TTR and rare franchises reporting strong growth of 34%, primarily driven by continued strong demand, as Tolga previously highlighted. Net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was $57 million, representing a $370 million decrease when compared with last year. The decrease was primarily driven by the recognition in Q3 2023 of the $310 million upfront payment from Roche as well as the $65 million in revenue recognized from a $100 million milestone earned for achieving certain criteria during early clinical development for mivelsiran. Royalty revenue for the quarter was $23 million or more than double what was recognized in the third quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by higher Leqvio sales as Novartis continues to grow demand for Leqvio worldwide. Gross margin on product sales was 80% for the quarter compared with 75% in the third quarter of 2023. The improvement in margin is primarily due to higher costs in 2023 associated with canceled manufacturing commitments for ONPATTRO and other adjustments to inventory, for which similar expenses did not occur this year, offset by an increased rate of royalties payable on net sales of AMVUTTRA. I expect our gross margin on product sales will be lower in Q4, driven by a higher royalty rate payable on sales of AMVUTTRA. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 12% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, primarily due to increased costs associated with our preclinical activities as we progress our 225 strategy to expand our clinical pipeline by the end of 2025 as well as clinical activities, which mainly grew with expenses associated with zilebesiran KARDIA-3 Phase 2 clinical study and increased personnel costs. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 19% in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher costs associated with marketing investments to promote our TTR therapies and preparations for the potential launch of AMVUTTRA for cardiomyopathy, along with increased personnel costs. Our non-GAAP operating loss for the quarter was $31 million, representing more than a $300 million decrease compared with Q3 2023, primarily driven by the recognition of collaboration revenue related to our Roche agreement and achievement of a mivelsiran milestone last year, as previously highlighted. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.8 billion compared with $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2023, with the increase primarily due to improved operating performance and net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock in connection with employee stock option exercises. Now I'd like to turn to our financial guidance for 2024. Today, we are reiterating our 2024 guidance that was updated on our Q2 earnings call. We anticipate combined net product revenues for our four commercial products will be within a range of $1.575 billion and $1.65 billion. Our collaboration and royalty revenue guidance range is $575 million to $650 million. And lastly, our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses remains a range of between $1.775 billion and $1.875 billion. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones for late 2024. We announced that we'll present additional findings from the ongoing Phase I study of ALN-TTRsc04 in patients with ATTR amyloidosis at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in November. We plan to share our Phase 3 development plan for ALN-TTRsc04 in the first quarter of 2025. We also intend to initiate a Phase 2 study for mivelsiran in patients with Alzheimer's disease at or around year-end. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? That's a great question, Ritu. I think it's actually for Tolga. Yeah. I mean, I would say we upgraded our guidance this year at Q2 on OpEx, right? And that reflected the confidence that we had in the HELIOS-B results and sort of playing to win. And so you'll see in the second half of the year this year an increase in investment. And the commercial team has made very good progress in starting to prepare for the launch, particularly in the U.S. with the hiring that's been done. So with a lot of that happening in the second half of the year, that's obviously going to create growth for next year. And we'll continue to invest more broadly even than just in the U.S. as we move towards the second half of the year and launches in Europe. I don't have specific guidance, but I would expect that certainly double-digit growth in terms of SG&A. But we'll provide our annual guidance for '25 on our year-end call in February."

            "content": "Thanks, Christine, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. The third quarter of 2024 marked a period of continued progress for Alnylam on all fronts. Commercially, we achieved 34% year-over-year growth in global net product revenue, generating $420 million across our four marketed products. We made great progress with our TTR franchise, sharing additional results from the HELIOS-B study of vutrisiran and filing regulatory submissions in the U.S. and EU. We also hosted a TTR Investor Day to highlight our preparations in anticipation of a potential launch in ATTR cardiomyopathy next year. We believe that AMVUTTRA and our broader TTR portfolio will serve as our flagship franchise, similar and potential impact to what EYLEA has been for Regeneron or what the cystic fibrosis franchise has been for Vertex delivering to those companies durable growth and enabling those companies to invest in R&D, new product development and portfolio diversification for the long term. Lastly, our early pipeline saw continued momentum as well, particularly our efforts in CNS. We initiated a Phase 1 study of ALN-HTT02 in Huntington's disease, and we're pleased to announce today initial results from the multi-dose portion of the Phase 1 study of mivelsiran in patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease. These results are encouraging for our CNS platform as they provide early evidence that multiple doses of an intrathecally administered siRNA are well tolerated. We're continuing to progress towards achievement by year-end 2025 of our Alnylam P5x25 goals and are steadfast in our belief that we're on track to become a top-tier biotech developing and ctransformative medicines for patients around the world with rare and prevalent diseases driven by a high-yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering strong financial results. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga? Okay. Next question. That's terrific, Tolga. I think it illustrates that we've actually built a really high-performing commercial engine and we have a compelling profile for AMVUTTRA. So we're very excited about the future. Thank you. Next question. You mean carpal tunnel or spinal... I think it's a great question actually, Ritu, because these red flag symptoms, I think, are going to be an important part of physician education and awareness going forward. So thanks for the question. The two questions. Let's take the next question. Thanks, Tolga. Thank you for answering that question. Next question. Terrific. Thank you. Next question please. That's a great question. Thank you. I think Jeff will take the first part of it, and then Tolga will follow up with his plans for making sure that we kind of execute on our plans for potential AMVUTTRA launch. Great. Thank you, Tolga. Next question."

Yvonne?\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks Christine and thank you everyone for joining the call today. The second quarter of 2024 was a transformative one for Alnylam. Commercially, we achieved a 34% year-over-year growth in global net product revenues, generating $410 million in net product revenues, which was primarily driven by 37% year-over-year growth in our TTR business. And as such, we've raised our revenue guidance for the year by 11% at the midpoint. The commercial capability that we've established over the last five years will continue to drive significant growth for our current business and will be a key to our success as we prepare for a potential launch next year in ATTR cardiomyopathy. To that end, the major highlights of Q2 was our announcement of positive top line results from the HELIOS-B Phase 3 study of vutrisiran in ATTR cardiomyopathy, showing that vutrisiran improved cardiovascular outcomes, including a 35% to 36% mortality benefit compared to placebo and demonstrated encouraging safety. These results reflect the true power of the RNAi mechanism of action, supporting what we believe to be a highly differentiated therapeutic profile and positioned vutrisiran as the new standard of care in ATTR cardiomyopathy, assuming regulatory approval. Moreover, we believe these positive results can establish vutrisiran as an anchor commercial franchise for Alnylam, driving robust top line growth and value creation for many years to come. With an eye towards our Alnylam P5x25 goals, we are firm in our belief that we are on track to become a top-tier biotech, developing and commercializing transformative medicines for patients around the world with rare and prevalent diseases driven by a high-yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering exceptional financial results. Before I turn it over to Tolga, I'm excited to tell you about the TTR Investor Day that we will be hosting in New York City on Wednesday, October 9th. This event, which will be webcast live, will focus on our leadership in ATTR amyloidosis, including the efforts that we are undertaking to optimize the success of the launch of AMVUTTRA in ATTR cardiomyopathy. You'll hear from several of my Alnylam colleagues as well as external experts. We'll be sharing more details about this event shortly, and I hope that you can join us in New York on October 9th. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Thanks, Yvonne, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for our commercial portfolio, delivering net product sales growth of 34% across our portfolio compared with the second quarter of 2023 as we continue to consistently increase the number of patients on Tenke in both our TTR and rare franchises. Let me now turn to a summary of our second quarter TTR performance. Our TTR franchise achieved $307 million in global net product revenues, representing a 16% increase compared with the first quarter of 2024 and a 37% increase compared with the second quarter of 2023. This strong growth, now approaching six years from our initial commercial launch supports our belief that there remains a significant opportunity in hATTR-PN. We are approaching 5,000 patients on treatment with ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA globally, still a small percentage of the estimated tens of thousands of patients that suffer from this devastating disease. Now let me provide highlights of our U.S. and rest of world hATTR-PN performance. In the U.S., combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased by 16% compared with the first quarter and by a robust 40% year-over-year as momentum in new patient adds continue to drive strong growth. The U.S. year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the following: a 34% increase in demand driven by the strength of our ongoing AMVUTTRA patient uptake, more than offsetting the decrease in patients on ONPATTRO that have switched to AMVUTTRA. It is worth noting that at the end of the Q2, approximately 90% of our U.S. TTR are on AMVUTTRA. Now, let me turn to our international markets, where the TTR franchise growth also increased by 16% compared with the first quarter and 35% year-over-year. The strong year-over-year growth was primarily driven by increased demand for AMVUTTRA as patient uptake remains robust, including from our markets where we successfully launched our water in recent months. Finally, timing of orders in our partner markets, particularly Brazil, also contributed positively to the year-over-year growth. As shared previously, our team is looking forward to bringing vutrisiran to patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, assuming successful regulatory review and approval. We believe we have a tremendous opportunity to transform the treatment paradigm based on the product profile and recent HELIOS-B results, combined with the significant unmet patient needs in ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, which is an estimated tenfold larger prevalence than hATTR-PN, where AMVUTTRA is the market leader. We believe vutrisiran has the potential to address unmet patient needs and become the standard of care treatment of ATTR-CM with a first line and market-leading profile in ATTR-CM, given its unique highly differentiated mechanism of action, enabling rapid knockdown of TTR at the source that is deep and durable, reduction in mortality and CV hospitalization events, as well as substantial impact on measures of disease progression and attractive quarterly dosing schedule with the site of care flexibility and favorable payer dynamics. We've been deeply committed to advancing treatment options in ATTR amyloidosis and understanding the unique needs of this community over the past decade and have built a strong foundation that will benefit our efforts to address the tremendous potential of ATTR-CM. At the same time, we recognize the critical importance of scaling our capabilities to establish vutrisiran as a standard of care in ATTR-CM. To this end, we are serially advancing our launch preparation and expanding our capabilities, leveraging our strong foundation, including our deep and credible relations with TTR centers, a global and highly specialized and integrated customer-facing teams that delivers a seamless experience for patients and physicians, our track record of creating strong payer and health system partnerships that supports exceptional patient access, not only in the U.S., but also across all major global markets, including Canada, Europe and Japan, and our award-winning patient support services team that have enabled us to help patients access their online treatments quickly with one of the fastest timelines in the industry transitioning from start form to therapy and also support patient adherence. We're also proud to have established a sustainable rare disease business that addresses a significant unmet patient need. The performance of GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, which delivered $13 million in global revenues, combined product sales during the second quarter remains solid as we continue to increase our patient base. The rare disease franchise grew 2% versus the first quarter of 2024 and 25% compared with the second quarter of 2023. For GIVLAARI, product sales increased by 7% in Q2 compared with the second quarter of 2023, with the following regional highlights, a 17% increase in U.S., primarily driven by growth in new patients on therapy, an 8% decrease in our rest of world markets, primarily driven by the timing of orders in our partner markets, which offset demand growth across European markets. For OXLUMO, we delivered a robust 68% year-over-year growth with the following regional dynamics, a 79% increase in the U.S., primarily driven by demand growth, a 61% growth from our rest of world markets, driven by increased demand in both our European and partner markets. In conclusion, we delivered strong results in the second quarter and first half of the year with both our TTR and rare franchises, delivering continuous robust growth in patients on therapy and revenue. Accordingly, we're pleased to be upgrading our full year net product revenue guidance today by 11% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Jeff will share on that more later. With that, I will now turn it over to Pushkal to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal?\nPushkal Garg: Thanks, Tolga and good morning, everyone. As Yvonne highlighted in her introduction, the major highlight of the second quarter was our announcement of the exciting and overwhelmingly positive top line results from the HELIOS-B Phase 3 study of vutrisiran in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy. With these results, we now have the first clinical trial data that demonstrate the ability of an RNAi therapeutic to improve cardiovascular outcomes. We observed truly outstanding results in this study with vutrisiran meeting an extraordinarily high bar for efficacy with statistical significance on all five prespecified primary and secondary endpoints in both of the study population, highlighting the powerful impact of vutrisiran and its mechanism of action on this disease. Specifically, we observed 28% and 33% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality and recurrent CV events in the overall and monotherapy populations, respectively, and 36% and 35% reductions in all-cause mortality in the overall and monotherapy populations respectively. These outcome benefits were accompanied by clinically significant benefits on six-minute walk test, KCCQ, and NYHA class, all of which are key measures of disease progression. We observed consistent effects in all key subgroups, including patients who are on baseline tafamidis. And finally, vutrisiran demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability consistent with its established profile. We're announcing this morning that the detailed results from the HELIOS-B study will be presented as a hotline oral presentation at the European Society of Cardiology Congress on Friday, August 30th, 2024, in London. We will also host a conference call and webcast during the Congress to discuss these detailed results with investors. We're also hard at work engaging with regulators as we work towards a supplemental NDA filing in the United States in late 2024 with additional global regulatory filings thereafter. As a reminder, we will be using our priority review voucher to accelerate the U.S. regulatory review in hopes of bringing this medicine to patients as quickly as possible. In addition to HELIOS-B, we made progress across a number of other pipeline programs, highlighting the breadth of opportunity we have with our RNAi platform. As we discussed on the last earnings call, we recently reported positive results from our KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study of zilebesiran, showing additive efficacy and good tolerability on top of standard of care antihypertensives in patients with inadequately controlled hypertension. KARDIA-3 is now underway, evaluating zilebesiran on top of two or more agents in patients who are at high cardiovascular risk. And following that, we look forward to running a cardiovascular outcomes trial, where our goal is to demonstrate the benefits, photonic blood pressure control in patients with high cardiovascular risk by showing reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We're also excited to have initiated dosing in the Capricorn 1 Phase 2 study of mivelsiran, formerly ALN-APP in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. CAA is the second most common cause of intracerebral hemorrhage and remains highly underdiagnosed with major unmet need. We've also advanced ALN-KHK, which is in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with initiation of the Part B phase of the Phase 1 study. Our partners continue to make great progress as well. Sanofi submitted regulatory filings for vutrisiran for patients with hemophilia in China, Brazil, and the United States, where the FDA has set a target action date of March 28, 2025. We've also announced today a pair of updates to our ongoing collaboration with Regeneron. First, we amended the license agreement for cemdisiran, investigational RNA therapeutic in development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases under which Regeneron gained exclusive rights to the asset as a monotherapy. In exchange, we received a $10 million upfront payment and are eligible to receive certain regulatory milestones and low double-digit royalties on sales, if approved. Additionally, as part of their regular portfolio review and prioritization efforts, Regeneron has decided to opt out of further co-development and co-commercialization of mivelsiran. As such, we now have full global development and commercialization rights to mivelsiran in all indications. We're extremely excited about the potential of this program, our first in the CNS to address the unmet needs of patients in two significant disease areas. CAA, where we've just initiated a Phase 2 study in Alzheimer's disease, where we plan to start a Phase 2 study at or around the end of the year. So, in sum, we've made great progress advancing our pipeline and platform with much more to come. As a reminder, we plan to file proprietary INDs for 9 programs by the end of 2025 against targets in the liver, CNS, muscle and adipose. If we include partnered programs, we anticipate 15 new INDs by the end of 2025, representing a doubling of our clinical pipeline by the end of next year. This remarkable and unique pace of innovation puts us in a great position to have a robust, self-sustainable pipeline that can deliver a meaningful impact to patients across multiple disease areas. With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff?\nJeff Poulton: Thanks, Pushkal and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam's Q2 2024 financial results and discussing our full year guidance. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for Q2 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. Total product revenue for the quarter was $410 million or 34% growth versus 2023 with both our TTR and rare franchises reporting strong growth of 37% and 25%, respectively, primarily driven by continued strong demand, as Tolga previously highlighted. Net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was $227 million, representing a $221 million increase when compared with Q2 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the modification of our collaboration agreement with Regeneron resulting in approximately $185 million of revenue, which was previously deferred. Royalty revenue for the quarter was $22 million or more than 3 times what was recognized in the second quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by higher Leqvio sales as Novartis continues to grow demand for Leqvio worldwide. Gross margin on product sales was 84% for the quarter compared with 75% in the second quarter of 2023. The improvement in margin is primarily due to higher costs in 2023 associated with canceled manufacturing commitments for ONPATTRO and other adjustments to inventory, for which similar expenses were not realized in 2024. I expect our gross margin on product sales will be lower for the balance of the year, driven by higher royalties paid on AMVUTTRA as AMVUTTRA growth continues at a brisk pace. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 14% in the second quarter compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased costs associated with our preclinical activities, increased development expenses associated with start-up activities for the zilebesiran and mivelsiran clinical studies and increased employee compensation expenses. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 21% in the second quarter compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased marketing investment associated with promotion of our TTR therapies and increased employee compensation expenses. Our non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $138 million, representing a $292 million improvement compared with Q2 2023, primarily driven by strong top line results, both in product sales as well as revenue from collaborations, as previously highlighted. We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.6 billion compared with $2.4 billion as of December 31st, 2023, with the increase primarily due to increased net product revenues and increased net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with employee stock option exercises. We continue to believe our current cash balance is sufficient to bridge us to a self-sustainable financial profile. Now, I'd like to turn to our 2024 guidance where we are updating all components of our full year guidance with the specific details as follows: we are increasing our net product revenue guidance from a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion to a range of $1.575 billion to $1.65 billion, representing an 11% increase from the midpoint of the prior to the updated guidance. The primary driver of the increased guidance is the ongoing strength of performance in our hereditary ATTR polyneuropathy franchise. We are increasing our collaboration and royalty revenue guidance from a range of $325 million to $425 million to a range of $575 million to $650 million. The primary driver of the increase is the modification of our collaboration agreement with Regeneron, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $185 million of previously deferred revenue this quarter. And lastly, we are increasing our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses from a range of $1.675 billion to $1.775 billion to a range of $1.775 billion to $1.875 billion. There are two primary drivers of the increase. First, the opt out of mivelsiran by Regeneron will result in increased R&D investment as the program is now wholly owned by Alnylam. Second, given the strong HELIOS-B top line results, we are increasing our planned ATTR cardiomyopathy launch prep efforts to optimize their preparedness for an early 2025 launch in the U.S. Given the strong momentum in our business, underpinning these guidance changes, along with the strength of the HELIOS-B study results and our efforts to prepare for a highly successful ATTR cardiomyopathy launch next year, we are very confident in our ability to achieve both of the Alnylam P5x25 financial goals that we established three and a half years ago, which include achieving a 40% plus compounded annual growth rate and total revenues across the five-year period and achieving sustainable non-GAAP operating income within the period. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones slated for mid and late 2024. As was mentioned earlier, we will be presenting detailed results from HELIOS-B at the ESC Congress on Friday, August 30 in London. We will also be hosting a conference call and webcast to discuss the data. We've also announced today that we plan to host a TTR Investor Day on October 9th in New York City. At this event, we will feature senior leaders from Alnylam as well as external experts to highlight the potential of our TTR business. This will be webcast as well. We will be submitting a supplemental new drug application for vutrisiran to the FDA using a priority review voucher. We plan to report interim results from Part B of the Phase 1 study of mivelsiran in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We expect three trial initiations by the end of 2024, including a Phase 3 study of ALN-TTRsc04 in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy at or around year-end, a Phase 2 study for mivelsiran in patients with Alzheimer's disease at or around year-end and a Phase 1 study of ALN-BCAT and hepatocellular carcinoma. And we remain on track to file three investigational new drug applications by year-end. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine?\nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, we will now open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ellie Merle with UBS. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Jasmine on for Ellie. Thank you so much for taking our question. So, can you discuss the reimbursement landscape in ATTR cardiomyopathy? And how you're thinking about the potential difference in pricing between polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy for AMVUTTRA? And how could the difference in Medicare Part B versus Part D effect this, especially given some of the IRA changes? Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, I think that's the question for Tolga. Maybe just to start off by emphasizing how pleased we are with the commercial performance to date, how peas at the commercial performance to date and really see so much opportunity ahead of us, both in polyneuropathy. And that is we expand the label to include patients with cardiomyopathy, assuming positive regulatory approval, but Tolga, you may want to respond to the specific questions.\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. Specific to the PN, I think it's actually a testament of the growth that we've been able to deliver this quarter and the prior quarters where patients get on therapy seamlessly. Thanks for our patient support services and preferable position that we have in terms of our access and patients actually stay on therapy. And that, again, has a lot to do with our profile of the product and quarterly injectables as well as our ability to continue to secure access for those patients. When it comes to CM, we'll be leveraging a similar level of principles, meaning we will obviously make sure that patients have seamless access and they stay on therapy as without the burden of co-pay as little as possible. And given that we are actually physician administered, which allows patients to be on Part B, we believe is going to be a unique advantage in compared to other available or future available products.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks Tolga. That's great. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Tazeen Ahmad with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTazeen Ahmad: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Mine is on vutrisiran and perhaps you can share feedback that you've gotten from physicians about their expectations for use of the product in first line, just based on the top line results from HELIOS-B, which were impressive? It seems clear that there is definitely a market opportunity. I think investors would like to just get a better sense of what portion of that market could end up being first line and what kind of feedback you've gotten from physicians on that question? thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. No, that's a great question. And clearly, there is an unmet medical need here in this disease, which is rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal and we think we have a profile that's absolutely well set up to be standard of care. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler: Yes, I mean what we see with the physicians, and we know this from other therapy areas as well, in any progressive debilitating and essentially ultimately fatal disease, it really is imperative to start with the most potent treatment option first. And given the top line HELIOS-B results, we believe atresia is going to be well positioned to be the first time agent. Look, I mean, at the end of the day, HELIOS-B is the most contemporary cardiomyopathy study completed to date and patients had real aggressive backgrounds around SGL2, tafamidis and yet against this incredibly high bar of contemporary backdrop, we showed a profound impact. I don't know, Pushkal, if you want to add anything else on this. But I believe this is going to be a key driver in physicians leveraging the first-line treatment.\nPushkal Garg: Yes, I think that building to Tolga I totally agree with everything you said. And I think, Tazeen, its early days, obviously, but as I think what we've heard repeatedly from clinicians is that they're looking for an orthogonal mechanism of action that can have an impact on this disease. And the investigators and authors for the ESC presentation said that we've shared the data deeply with are incredibly excited. And so we're looking forward to being able to roll those data out. But I think we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm based on the data that we've shared so far.\nYvonne Greenstreet: And of course, more to come at ESC, and we look forward to that. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Maury Raycroft with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nMaury Raycroft: Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my question. I'll just -- I'll ask about ESC for the upcoming data. I'm wondering if you'll report KM curves and time to events kinetics for the different mono versus combo subgroups in the study? Or maybe talk more about what types of details you plan to disclose at the conference.\nYvonne Greenstreet: That's a great question, Marin. Clearly, we're working on finalizing the details as we speak. Pushkal?\nPushkal Garg: Yes. Thanks, Maury. Look, we are working with the investigators and authors to sort of finalize the content. But we plan to go into pretty expansive detail on the end points in the study and the results that we presented at the top line, we think we're really excited to be able to share that now broadly with the community, both the clinical community and the investor community. So this will include -- I anticipate this will include baseline characteristics. You'll hear about sort of how this is a very contemporary population of patients that was heavily treated with other medications, effective agents. You'll see the results on the primary endpoint, including the components and all the secondaries. And we'll also be sharing curves for the primary endpoint and secondary endpoint of all-cause mortality. And you'll see that across the key -- you'll see the consistency of effect across a variety of subgroups and specifically, we'll be sharing some curves in the overall and based on baseline tafamidis. So I think you'll get a pretty fulsome view of the results. And of course, we'll have other opportunities to dive deeper into data at HFSA, -- we're limited in how much we can present the ESC. And there's a lot of rich data coming out of this incredible clinical trial that we'll be sharing in the weeks to come.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Pushkal. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Paul Matteis with Stifel. Your line is open.\nJulian Pino: Hey, thanks so much for taking our question. This is Julian Pino on for Paul. I was just wondering, with respect to the ALN-APP program, can you provide a little bit more color on what the potential Phase II design could look like in Alzheimer's and what endpoints you'll be looking at? And then further, I didn't see anything unless I missed it on the HBM obesity program. Is that still ongoing? And curious the status of that as well.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. No. Look, we're delighted with the progress of PLN ACC program, my view answers actually peso. -- ran. It's advancing well, we've been able to demonstrate rapid and robust and sustained reductions in APP, going very well, and we feel there's tremendous potential in the two indications that we are progressing both Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Pushkal, maybe we're looking at the future.\nPushkal Garg: Absolutely. So taking your two questions and building over on said with APP, a very exciting program. We just presented some data at AIC actually, that showed that we had consistent knockdown in both soluble APP alpha and beta, but also the downstream disease-related biomarkers of Abeta-40 and 42 that are involved in CAA and Alzheimer's disease and continue to see very encouraging safety coming out of that program as well. So that program remains on track. We're very excited. As we talked about, we've recently kicked off the study in cerebral amyloid angiopathy like second leading cause of hemorrhage. And as you noted, we will be starting a study in Alzheimer's disease as well. We aren't ready to talk about the specifics of that. We're obviously working through our trial design and -- but we'll share with that with you shortly. But we're very encouraged about this upstream mechanism. Its potential to be very differentiated in this disease space and hopefully have a favorable impact on the disease of Alzheimer's, which I think we all know has a tremendous burden. With regard to your second question on Himani, look, I think -- I don't think there's any really specific updates I want to give on the early preclinical programs other than to say what you heard in the main comments was just we are pushing very aggressively in terms of our 225 strategy to move a multitude of programs forward based on the excitement that we have around the platform here. And so we are on track for 3-plus INDs this year. proprietary INDs by the end of '25 and a doubling of our pipeline by the end of next year. But we'll give updates on those specific programs in due course and then keep you posted.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kostas Biliouris with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nKostas Biliouris: Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on the tremendous progress here. A quick question from us on real world data that recently was published on ATTR polyneuropathy. This study show that a patient under stabilizes progress ONPATTRO very quickly, actually similar rate to national history and then switch to on where the disease progression is almost halting any read-through from this study to cardiomyopathy? And would you expect similar dynamics with some good years.\nYvonne Greenstreet : Great question. Pushkal, I think...\nPushkal Garg: Yeah. Thanks, Kostas. I think you were citing a paper that was recently published coming out of a European experience that looked at a cohort of patients who had been on tafamidis and progressed and a proportion of those patients that were put on ONPATTRO and actually seem to have some stabilization of the disease. These were polyohereditary polyneuropathy patients. Look, I think it's very encouraging. We know that this is a complex disease. Patients do have a progressive do progress with polyneuropathy and with cardiomyopathy. And so I don't think there's any question that there's an unmet need here for patients to have additional modes of therapy that can address what Tolga highlighted earlier, is a very steadily progressive and fatal disease. And so I think we all agree. And this is highlighted by the fact that even we have the APOLLO data, APOLLO-B data and we launched an EAP, there was tremendous need for patients who are on stabilizer therapy to get on to an additional orthogonal mechanism of action that stay enrolled very quickly. So we are very excited about the opportunity where patients need additional therapies and we'll be bringing that forward, we think, now for the CM patients as we have for the PN patients with ONPATTRO.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Great. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJessica Fye : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you set the stage around the level of detail we should expect with the interim results for Part B as the Phase I ALN-APP study later this year? And how we should think about the communication or kind of venue for that update. I'm also curious, would you seek another partner for ALN-APP? Or do you now plan to keep that wholly-owned?\nYvonne Greenstreet : Well, I'll take the second question first. I mean we're actually delighted to be progressing ALN-APP. As I said, we're very excited about the 2 indications. We've already kicked off our Phase II in patients with amyloid angiopathy and planning to start the study in Alzheimer's disease at or around year-end. So we couldn't be more pleased to have another wholly owned program in our pipeline, and I look forward to moving these programs forward ourselves.\nPushkal Garg : Yes. And the other comment -- yes, just to comment on your question, it's a little early to tell you about the specific venue where we'll be talking about the data. But I think what you'll see is starting to see some data with multiple doses in terms of, again, the primary purpose of the study is on safety and pharmacodynamics. And so what you'll be seeing is that with multiple dosing. But over time, we'll be able to share more and more data coming out of that. But I think, again, our confidence in this program is highlighted by the fact that we've kicked off a study of Phase II in CAA, and we'll soon be kicking off a Phase II in Alzheimer's disease. So we couldn't -- we're very excited about the potential therapy and continue to investigate it.\nYvonne Greenstreet : Each potential huge medical knees, we're very, very pleased to be moving forward. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. I'll take our next question from David Lebowitz with Citi. Your line is open.\nDavid Lebowitz : Thank you very much for taking my question. I'm curious, certainly, since Eplontersen has been on the market for a couple of quarters now. Have the nature of the discussions with physicians change since the drug's launch at all? And can you make any commentary on how the market is evolving relative to a new competitive therapy?\nYvonne Greenstreet : Great question. Tolga?\nTolga Tanguler : Yes. I mean, as we discussed before, this is a highly devastating disease, and there's still tens of thousands of patients that are expecting to get diagnosed and treated. Therefore, any addition in the market with increased promotional share of voice is a good thing. In respect to the -- how the conversations are shaping up, as you can see from our Q2 results, now this is a two-player market in the U.S., where we continue to grow very rapidly. And I believe the nuances of the products start becoming a lot clearer. As you know, the product profile on but is one that rapidly knocks down the disease-causing protein durably and with a good sustained quarterly injectables. That is becoming a good differentiator. And last but not least, how patients get on the reimbursement and how they stay on the reimbursement. And we're very pleased with the results that we've seen in Q2, and we expect to drive the momentum as such.\nDavid Lebowitz : Excellent. Thank you for taking my question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Gena Wang with Barclays. Your line is open.\nGena Wang : Thank you. I will also ask another question regarding metro. Given this Part B coverage, have you seen any pattern in terms of the patient population regarding -- sorry, the pattern from ATTR neuropathy patient regarding patient population and the geographic locations. And quickly on the TTRsc04, any latest thoughts on Phase III trial design?\nYvonne Greenstreet : Yes. Maybe I'll start with the TTRsc04 question. I mean clearly, this is an opportunity to really build a durable franchise in TTR for Alnylam we've seen rapid knockdown, very durable knockdown. And we're looking at a program that potentially has improved knockdown with six months of your annual dosing. So we're really excited about moving forward TTRsc04. So early to comment on the specifics of the clinical program at this point in time, but there will be more to come as we get to the end of this year. Tolga, do you want to take the question on...\nTolga Tanguler : Imbursement.\nYvonne Greenstreet : On reimbursement, yes.\nTolga Tanguler : Yes. So I mean I think one thing is really to keep in mind is we strictly adhere to the patient access philosophy that Alnylam has established over the years. And through that, what we really look at is the co-pay burden on the patients. Given that our product is reimbursed because it's a physician-administered product through Part B, what we've seen is nearly 70% of our patients remain -- have zero co-pay and up to 80% of patients pay less than $2,000. This really puts us in an important position where the co-pay burden is quite -- is either less or similar to those products that would be reimbursed in part with the new IR redesign. So we believe this is a good mix of reimbursement. And when it comes to global, we've been able to compete in a very price-sensitive markets across Europe and Japan in polyneuropathy in a very competitive way where we are driving about over 90% market share versus the stabilizer product that's in the market. Therefore, we really like where we are in terms of our reimbursement policy. And obviously, we're keeping an eye on it to make sure that patients get on this treatment if their physicians decide to do so.\nGena Wang : Thank you.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Next question\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ritu Baral with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nRitu Baral : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask to Tolga just how you are now sort of positioning and it sounds like you've been positioning for a while, AMVUTTRA in TTR-CM, -- as far as actual commercial strategies, Jeff mentioned a scale-up of the sales force. Can you talk about the magnitude of that? And are you changing the mix of targeting of the sales force? And then in our docs, do calls have mentioned that they do expect despite the wealth of data that this is going to be a commercially sensitive market. How are things like label language, KCCQ, New York Card Association like those are real endpoints in your study. How are they going to factor into your marketing message? How important are they? Or is it going to be mortality driven all the way? Thanks.\nYvonne Greenstreet : Tolga. Straight to you, a terrific question.\nTolga Tanguler : Sure. I mean one thing I just want to make it clear. Obviously, we're going to start off with a very strong foundation where this disease is being treated by multidisciplinary centers and where our organization is there. But when it comes to positioning, I want to make it very clear that we are strictly promoting our polyneuropathy indication, and we will adhere to that until, obviously, we received the label expansion. So I just want to make that clear. Now again, I think, as you highlighted, one of our great advantages is we have deep equities with TTR centers. We've been able to expand our polyneuropathy prescriber base by 50%. We have a well-integrated customer team. Now we highlight the fact that the prevalence of this disease, obviously tenfold. Having said that, the number of prescribers is not tenfold. It's a lesser magnitude of prescriber base. Therefore, we believe we can actually scale this up in the appropriate way. And then when it comes to in rare diseases, having an integrated customer-facing team where you have good coverage of reimbursement support, you have good coverage of medical and field organization support is going to be key. We have that. And the last piece, I think, of the puzzle is a very good, strong established patient support services, where we are actually quite pleased with the time to treatment from patient start forms into patients getting reimbursed and starting on therapy. Now those are obviously some of the capabilities where we're keeping an eye on, and we're going to scale that out. Now when it comes to your second part of your question, in terms of labeling, how we're going to be positioning the product, obviously, that's going to be depending on the FDA and where we don't comment given the label discussions that we have. I think what you will see at ESC is going to give you further color about the robustness of this data and how we can actually be able to communicate effectively both primary composite and secondary end points as well as the oral cost mortality. We believe there's going to be a clear differentiation for our products. And last but not least is the product profile itself. I mean the -- given that this is a swiftly progressing reversible disease to be able to demonstrate a rapid knockdown that really knocks on the disease closing pathogen as quickly as possible is going to be important. Given the convenience of quarterly dosing is going to be important, given that how patients actually quickly get on access to this treatment is going to be very critical. So combining all this with the data that we have with HELIOS-B and the product profile, we really do strongly believe physicians will choose AMVUTTRA, if approved as a first-line product given where the disease is, given what the product is and given where we have the data.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Tolga. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results. This is Tom on for Salveen. Just a question on your discussions with KOLs and cardiologists. Have you heard a number or range for the additive benefit on top of TA that would be considered meaningful in DC? And just a follow-up on the commercial questions. Over the longer term, what's your strategy here for growing the market beyond taking share or adding on top of tafamidis? Thank you so much.\nPushkal Garg: Yes. So maybe I can take the first part of your question in terms of is there some numerical target in terms of benefit on top of tafamidis. I think really, what I would say is the feedback that we've gotten all along, and I think has only been accentuated since we've shared the top line results with KOLs is just the enthusiasm for a new medicine to help these patients, first and foremost. Second of all, what they're seeing from the top line results is an opportunity for this drug to actually access the broad spectrum of patients with this disease. We saw strong efficacy as a monotherapy across all the endpoints. But we saw equally strong efficacy in the overall population, which I'll remind you includes 40% of patients who start on background tap and a good proportion of people who actually add an on TAP and added on SGLT2 inhibitors had diuretic intensification. And so -- and I think as some have noticed from the top line results -- there is -- if you just look at the mortality numbers, the strength of the data in the overall population, both in terms of the actual magnitude of effect as well as the p-value was somewhat stronger, which implies a pretty substantial effect in the add-on population. Now that's encouraging because it wasn't powered or designed to show an effect in that population. But to see what we're seeing is consistent evidence of additive efficacy, I think, is encouraging. So there's no numerical target, but I think what people are seeing is a picture of a drug that's emerging to them that looks quite -- to be quite effective for this disease.\nYvonne Greenstreet: I think to add a few words about the market. We've talked about how we think about the market pre-tax loss of exclusivity and post-tax loss of exclusivity. Perhaps you could make a few comments on.\nPushkal Garg: Yeah, I mean, thinking of that.\nTolga Tanguler: We believe, given that this is an area of disease, it's unusual for a combination therapy to be used given some of the access challenges. However, I think we believe given the data set, we believe there's going to be some combination use early on prior to the TAF exclusivity. But to your point, what's really important is the category growth. What we've seen is given that the diagnostic tools have advanced over the last six years, there's easy access to -- for patients to get diagnosed early. I think having increased share of voice and promotional awareness of this category is going to help. The only available treatment has actually done a phenomenal job of expanding the diagnosis rates. And with added voices in this category is only going to accelerate the treat diagnosis and treatment rates. And we believe those patients deserve many options to be treated to.\nChristine Lindenboom : Jeff, anything you want to add?\nJeff Poulton: I don't have anything further to add, no.\nChristine Lindenboom : Great. Thank you. Thanks, Tolga.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Mike Ulz with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMike Ulz : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter as well. Maybe just a quick follow-up on some prior questions in terms of the market opportunity for TTR CM. Can you just talk a little bit about why 80% of patients go untreated currently. It sounds like diagnosis is probably one of the key factors, but what are some of the other factors? And then how do you reduce that going forward?\nYvonne Greenstreet: I think another one for you.\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. Look, this is a disease, especially in the wild-type cardiomyopathy. Patients don't start having these symptoms until sometimes it's too late. So that's one of the key drivers. The second thing is there are only a few multi-suite centers. What we've seen is those multidiscipline centers start more expanding more and the awareness of how the disease actually manifests itself is being picked up by authorities as well as much as we say, it's tenfold of the polyneuropathy, it's still a rare disease. In the U.S., it's less than 200,000 patients. Therefore, it is not as common as what doctors used to seeing, cardiologists or neurologists or even in some cases, orthopedic surgeons where they see bilateral carpal tea syndrome or spinal stenosis. It's an area where needs more education, more disease awareness. And we believe having more voices articulating how disease manifests itself and help the patients to get treated early is going to be key. One of the things we're doing, and I believe others will be doing as well is to engage with a lot of centers to make sure that on electronic medical records, patients get start flagged early. I think these are some of the initiatives that the industry is going to be making to make sure those patients get quickly flagged. I don't know, Pushkal, do you have anything?\nPushkal Garg: Yes. No, Tolga, you said it very well. I mean I think the only thing I would just add is just a reminder that until five years ago, there was no therapy for these patients at all that was specific, right? And so they were treated as sort of a [indiscernible] ejection fraction. And I think to point now, we have a therapy, hopefully, assume multiple therapies for these patients. We've now over just the last few years had the proliferation of noninvasive diagnostic methods to identify these patients. And we're starting to understand more where how to identify these patients based on red flag symptoms such as polyneuropathy or spinal stenosis or carpal tunnel syndrome, things like that. So I think there is just a heavy, heavy need for more disease education awareness because we now have, we believe, hopefully, multiple therapies for these patients that can actually stem the progression of this result to otherwise progressive in fatal disease. So I think there is a lot of growth here in terms of patients to treat.\nMike Ulz : Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from William Pickering with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nWilliam Pickering: Yes. Thank you so much for taking my question. Congrats on the great results. Looking ahead to ESC, there seems to be a lot of investor interest in comparing the vutri monotherapy arm with the TAF plus placebo arm. Could you talk about the extent to which you think that is a helpful comparison and any limitations relative to just looking at Q3 versus placebo and the background TAF? Thank you.\nPushkal Garg: Yes. Thanks, Will. Look, I think what we have here with USB is really a very, very rich study, right? This was a study done 655 patients in the modern era. These were patients who were diagnosed with noninvasive means. As we've talked about, and we'll share more at ESC, it was a pretty rigorous test. These are patients, 40% who are already on an effective therapy, a good proportion of the monotherapy arm. We started another effective therapy. In the midst of the study, patients started SGLT2s, other things. So it was a pretty rigorous test and the results we believe are very, very encouraging. The one thing the study was not was a head-to-head study with tafamidis. That is the one thing it was not. It was not designed for that purpose. And so the comparison that you're referring to really is a nonrandomized comparison. And as you can imagine, the patients who entered in on TAF were different because they've been on the drug for a while. Obviously, there were geographic differences in those patients. The minority of the TAF patients came from the U.S. So comparing that then to the vutri patients who are on monotherapy, it's really unfortunately a flawed analysis. I think what we'll see, as we highlighted in the top line results is that vutri appears to have really encouraging efficacy on every parameter we measured both as a monotherapy and evidence of additive efficacy on top of tafamidis and consistent results across the whole series of endpoints that we've looked at process.\nYvonne Greenstreet : Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Myles Minter with William Blair. Your line is open.\nMyles Minter : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just with as releasing that draft guidance on TCICM pricing. I know that was in relevance to tafamidis, but there's also some commentary about vutrisiran in that as well. Is Alnylam intending to be at that public hearing in September 20? And if you are, are you going to be presenting something on cost effectiveness of future [indiscernible]? Thanks very much.\nTolga Tanguler: Yes. Thank you for that question. As ISI think, noted, they made this assessment prior to our disclosure of HELIOS-B top line results, and therefore, it was in a complete analysis. We remain engaged with any health outcomes authority, and we'll continue to engage with ISE and others. We haven't disclosed whether we would be part of the hearing.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Okay. I think we have time for one more question. Last question please.\nOperator: Yes. The last question will come from Luca Issi with RBC Capital. Your line is open.\nLuca Issi : Great. Thanks so much for squeezing me in and congrats on all the progress. Maybe circling back on Gena's question here Pushkal, for TTR S4 [ph], which is obviously super important as we think about the royalty to Sanofi on the Phase 3. Do you basically need to run another HELIOS speed or you can maybe get away with a smaller PK/PD trial? And maybe related, what's the dose that you're going to pursue? I think the sad portion of the trial, you went all the way to 600 milligrams. So just wondering if that is the go-forward dose.\nYvonne Greenstreet: Okay. Well, we're going to come back to that question because as I said, we're not ready really to get into the details of what the next detailed steps in our clinical plans. So we'll come back and share more on that later, but thanks for your interest. We're also very excited about the program. Thanks, Luca. Okay. I think that brings our call to a close. And I just want to thank everybody for joining. I mean really the second quarter of 2024 has marked an inflection point in our items journey. And we really are proud of our progress. As Tolga described, the being robust commercial growth. Pushkal's gone through some of the incredible advancements in our pipeline. And now more than ever, we believe that we're firmly on a path to becoming a top-tier biotech company. So thank you, everybody, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Tolga Tanguler",
            "content": "Thanks, Yvonne, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for our commercial portfolio, delivering net product sales growth of 34% across our portfolio compared with the second quarter of 2023 as we continue to consistently increase the number of patients on Tenke in both our TTR and rare franchises. Let me now turn to a summary of our second quarter TTR performance. Our TTR franchise achieved $307 million in global net product revenues, representing a 16% increase compared with the first quarter of 2024 and a 37% increase compared with the second quarter of 2023. This strong growth, now approaching six years from our initial commercial launch supports our belief that there remains a significant opportunity in hATTR-PN. We are approaching 5,000 patients on treatment with ONPATTRO or AMVUTTRA globally, still a small percentage of the estimated tens of thousands of patients that suffer from this devastating disease. Now let me provide highlights of our U.S. and rest of world hATTR-PN performance. In the U.S., combined sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased by 16% compared with the first quarter and by a robust 40% year-over-year as momentum in new patient adds continue to drive strong growth. The U.S. year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the following: a 34% increase in demand driven by the strength of our ongoing AMVUTTRA patient uptake, more than offsetting the decrease in patients on ONPATTRO that have switched to AMVUTTRA. It is worth noting that at the end of the Q2, approximately 90% of our U.S. TTR are on AMVUTTRA. Now, let me turn to our international markets, where the TTR franchise growth also increased by 16% compared with the first quarter and 35% year-over-year. The strong year-over-year growth was primarily driven by increased demand for AMVUTTRA as patient uptake remains robust, including from our markets where we successfully launched our water in recent months. Finally, timing of orders in our partner markets, particularly Brazil, also contributed positively to the year-over-year growth. As shared previously, our team is looking forward to bringing vutrisiran to patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, assuming successful regulatory review and approval. We believe we have a tremendous opportunity to transform the treatment paradigm based on the product profile and recent HELIOS-B results, combined with the significant unmet patient needs in ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, which is an estimated tenfold larger prevalence than hATTR-PN, where AMVUTTRA is the market leader. We believe vutrisiran has the potential to address unmet patient needs and become the standard of care treatment of ATTR-CM with a first line and market-leading profile in ATTR-CM, given its unique highly differentiated mechanism of action, enabling rapid knockdown of TTR at the source that is deep and durable, reduction in mortality and CV hospitalization events, as well as substantial impact on measures of disease progression and attractive quarterly dosing schedule with the site of care flexibility and favorable payer dynamics. We've been deeply committed to advancing treatment options in ATTR amyloidosis and understanding the unique needs of this community over the past decade and have built a strong foundation that will benefit our efforts to address the tremendous potential of ATTR-CM. At the same time, we recognize the critical importance of scaling our capabilities to establish vutrisiran as a standard of care in ATTR-CM. To this end, we are serially advancing our launch preparation and expanding our capabilities, leveraging our strong foundation, including our deep and credible relations with TTR centers, a global and highly specialized and integrated customer-facing teams that delivers a seamless experience for patients and physicians, our track record of creating strong payer and health system partnerships that supports exceptional patient access, not only in the U.S., but also across all major global markets, including Canada, Europe and Japan, and our award-winning patient support services team that have enabled us to help patients access their online treatments quickly with one of the fastest timelines in the industry transitioning from start form to therapy and also support patient adherence. We're also proud to have established a sustainable rare disease business that addresses a significant unmet patient need. The performance of GIVLAARI and OXLUMO, which delivered $13 million in global revenues, combined product sales during the second quarter remains solid as we continue to increase our patient base. The rare disease franchise grew 2% versus the first quarter of 2024 and 25% compared with the second quarter of 2023. For GIVLAARI, product sales increased by 7% in Q2 compared with the second quarter of 2023, with the following regional highlights, a 17% increase in U.S., primarily driven by growth in new patients on therapy, an 8% decrease in our rest of world markets, primarily driven by the timing of orders in our partner markets, which offset demand growth across European markets. For OXLUMO, we delivered a robust 68% year-over-year growth with the following regional dynamics, a 79% increase in the U.S., primarily driven by demand growth, a 61% growth from our rest of world markets, driven by increased demand in both our European and partner markets. In conclusion, we delivered strong results in the second quarter and first half of the year with both our TTR and rare franchises, delivering continuous robust growth in patients on therapy and revenue. Accordingly, we're pleased to be upgrading our full year net product revenue guidance today by 11% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Jeff will share on that more later. With that, I will now turn it over to Pushkal to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal? Yes. Specific to the PN, I think it's actually a testament of the growth that we've been able to deliver this quarter and the prior quarters where patients get on therapy seamlessly. Thanks for our patient support services and preferable position that we have in terms of our access and patients actually stay on therapy. And that, again, has a lot to do with our profile of the product and quarterly injectables as well as our ability to continue to secure access for those patients. When it comes to CM, we'll be leveraging a similar level of principles, meaning we will obviously make sure that patients have seamless access and they stay on therapy as without the burden of co-pay as little as possible. And given that we are actually physician administered, which allows patients to be on Part B, we believe is going to be a unique advantage in compared to other available or future available products. Yes, I mean what we see with the physicians, and we know this from other therapy areas as well, in any progressive debilitating and essentially ultimately fatal disease, it really is imperative to start with the most potent treatment option first. And given the top line HELIOS-B results, we believe atresia is going to be well positioned to be the first time agent. Look, I mean, at the end of the day, HELIOS-B is the most contemporary cardiomyopathy study completed to date and patients had real aggressive backgrounds around SGL2, tafamidis and yet against this incredibly high bar of contemporary backdrop, we showed a profound impact. I don't know, Pushkal, if you want to add anything else on this. But I believe this is going to be a key driver in physicians leveraging the first-line treatment. Yes. I mean, as we discussed before, this is a highly devastating disease, and there's still tens of thousands of patients that are expecting to get diagnosed and treated. Therefore, any addition in the market with increased promotional share of voice is a good thing. In respect to the -- how the conversations are shaping up, as you can see from our Q2 results, now this is a two-player market in the U.S., where we continue to grow very rapidly. And I believe the nuances of the products start becoming a lot clearer. As you know, the product profile on but is one that rapidly knocks down the disease-causing protein durably and with a good sustained quarterly injectables. That is becoming a good differentiator. And last but not least, how patients get on the reimbursement and how they stay on the reimbursement. And we're very pleased with the results that we've seen in Q2, and we expect to drive the momentum as such. Imbursement. Yes. So I mean I think one thing is really to keep in mind is we strictly adhere to the patient access philosophy that Alnylam has established over the years. And through that, what we really look at is the co-pay burden on the patients. Given that our product is reimbursed because it's a physician-administered product through Part B, what we've seen is nearly 70% of our patients remain -- have zero co-pay and up to 80% of patients pay less than $2,000. This really puts us in an important position where the co-pay burden is quite -- is either less or similar to those products that would be reimbursed in part with the new IR redesign. So we believe this is a good mix of reimbursement. And when it comes to global, we've been able to compete in a very price-sensitive markets across Europe and Japan in polyneuropathy in a very competitive way where we are driving about over 90% market share versus the stabilizer product that's in the market. Therefore, we really like where we are in terms of our reimbursement policy. And obviously, we're keeping an eye on it to make sure that patients get on this treatment if their physicians decide to do so. Sure. I mean one thing I just want to make it clear. Obviously, we're going to start off with a very strong foundation where this disease is being treated by multidisciplinary centers and where our organization is there. But when it comes to positioning, I want to make it very clear that we are strictly promoting our polyneuropathy indication, and we will adhere to that until, obviously, we received the label expansion. So I just want to make that clear. Now again, I think, as you highlighted, one of our great advantages is we have deep equities with TTR centers. We've been able to expand our polyneuropathy prescriber base by 50%. We have a well-integrated customer team. Now we highlight the fact that the prevalence of this disease, obviously tenfold. Having said that, the number of prescribers is not tenfold. It's a lesser magnitude of prescriber base. Therefore, we believe we can actually scale this up in the appropriate way. And then when it comes to in rare diseases, having an integrated customer-facing team where you have good coverage of reimbursement support, you have good coverage of medical and field organization support is going to be key. We have that. And the last piece, I think, of the puzzle is a very good, strong established patient support services, where we are actually quite pleased with the time to treatment from patient start forms into patients getting reimbursed and starting on therapy. Now those are obviously some of the capabilities where we're keeping an eye on, and we're going to scale that out. Now when it comes to your second part of your question, in terms of labeling, how we're going to be positioning the product, obviously, that's going to be depending on the FDA and where we don't comment given the label discussions that we have. I think what you will see at ESC is going to give you further color about the robustness of this data and how we can actually be able to communicate effectively both primary composite and secondary end points as well as the oral cost mortality. We believe there's going to be a clear differentiation for our products. And last but not least is the product profile itself. I mean the -- given that this is a swiftly progressing reversible disease to be able to demonstrate a rapid knockdown that really knocks on the disease closing pathogen as quickly as possible is going to be important. Given the convenience of quarterly dosing is going to be important, given that how patients actually quickly get on access to this treatment is going to be very critical. So combining all this with the data that we have with HELIOS-B and the product profile, we really do strongly believe physicians will choose AMVUTTRA, if approved as a first-line product given where the disease is, given what the product is and given where we have the data. We believe, given that this is an area of disease, it's unusual for a combination therapy to be used given some of the access challenges. However, I think we believe given the data set, we believe there's going to be some combination use early on prior to the TAF exclusivity. But to your point, what's really important is the category growth. What we've seen is given that the diagnostic tools have advanced over the last six years, there's easy access to -- for patients to get diagnosed early. I think having increased share of voice and promotional awareness of this category is going to help. The only available treatment has actually done a phenomenal job of expanding the diagnosis rates. And with added voices in this category is only going to accelerate the treat diagnosis and treatment rates. And we believe those patients deserve many options to be treated to. Yes. Look, this is a disease, especially in the wild-type cardiomyopathy. Patients don't start having these symptoms until sometimes it's too late. So that's one of the key drivers. The second thing is there are only a few multi-suite centers. What we've seen is those multidiscipline centers start more expanding more and the awareness of how the disease actually manifests itself is being picked up by authorities as well as much as we say, it's tenfold of the polyneuropathy, it's still a rare disease. In the U.S., it's less than 200,000 patients. Therefore, it is not as common as what doctors used to seeing, cardiologists or neurologists or even in some cases, orthopedic surgeons where they see bilateral carpal tea syndrome or spinal stenosis. It's an area where needs more education, more disease awareness. And we believe having more voices articulating how disease manifests itself and help the patients to get treated early is going to be key. One of the things we're doing, and I believe others will be doing as well is to engage with a lot of centers to make sure that on electronic medical records, patients get start flagged early. I think these are some of the initiatives that the industry is going to be making to make sure those patients get quickly flagged. I don't know, Pushkal, do you have anything? Yes. Thank you for that question. As ISI think, noted, they made this assessment prior to our disclosure of HELIOS-B top line results, and therefore, it was in a complete analysis. We remain engaged with any health outcomes authority, and we'll continue to engage with ISE and others. We haven't disclosed whether we would be part of the hearing."

            "name": "Pushkal Garg",
            "content": "Thanks, Tolga and good morning, everyone. As Yvonne highlighted in her introduction, the major highlight of the second quarter was our announcement of the exciting and overwhelmingly positive top line results from the HELIOS-B Phase 3 study of vutrisiran in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy. With these results, we now have the first clinical trial data that demonstrate the ability of an RNAi therapeutic to improve cardiovascular outcomes. We observed truly outstanding results in this study with vutrisiran meeting an extraordinarily high bar for efficacy with statistical significance on all five prespecified primary and secondary endpoints in both of the study population, highlighting the powerful impact of vutrisiran and its mechanism of action on this disease. Specifically, we observed 28% and 33% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality and recurrent CV events in the overall and monotherapy populations, respectively, and 36% and 35% reductions in all-cause mortality in the overall and monotherapy populations respectively. These outcome benefits were accompanied by clinically significant benefits on six-minute walk test, KCCQ, and NYHA class, all of which are key measures of disease progression. We observed consistent effects in all key subgroups, including patients who are on baseline tafamidis. And finally, vutrisiran demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability consistent with its established profile. We're announcing this morning that the detailed results from the HELIOS-B study will be presented as a hotline oral presentation at the European Society of Cardiology Congress on Friday, August 30th, 2024, in London. We will also host a conference call and webcast during the Congress to discuss these detailed results with investors. We're also hard at work engaging with regulators as we work towards a supplemental NDA filing in the United States in late 2024 with additional global regulatory filings thereafter. As a reminder, we will be using our priority review voucher to accelerate the U.S. regulatory review in hopes of bringing this medicine to patients as quickly as possible. In addition to HELIOS-B, we made progress across a number of other pipeline programs, highlighting the breadth of opportunity we have with our RNAi platform. As we discussed on the last earnings call, we recently reported positive results from our KARDIA-2 Phase 2 study of zilebesiran, showing additive efficacy and good tolerability on top of standard of care antihypertensives in patients with inadequately controlled hypertension. KARDIA-3 is now underway, evaluating zilebesiran on top of two or more agents in patients who are at high cardiovascular risk. And following that, we look forward to running a cardiovascular outcomes trial, where our goal is to demonstrate the benefits, photonic blood pressure control in patients with high cardiovascular risk by showing reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We're also excited to have initiated dosing in the Capricorn 1 Phase 2 study of mivelsiran, formerly ALN-APP in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. CAA is the second most common cause of intracerebral hemorrhage and remains highly underdiagnosed with major unmet need. We've also advanced ALN-KHK, which is in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with initiation of the Part B phase of the Phase 1 study. Our partners continue to make great progress as well. Sanofi submitted regulatory filings for vutrisiran for patients with hemophilia in China, Brazil, and the United States, where the FDA has set a target action date of March 28, 2025. We've also announced today a pair of updates to our ongoing collaboration with Regeneron. First, we amended the license agreement for cemdisiran, investigational RNA therapeutic in development for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases under which Regeneron gained exclusive rights to the asset as a monotherapy. In exchange, we received a $10 million upfront payment and are eligible to receive certain regulatory milestones and low double-digit royalties on sales, if approved. Additionally, as part of their regular portfolio review and prioritization efforts, Regeneron has decided to opt out of further co-development and co-commercialization of mivelsiran. As such, we now have full global development and commercialization rights to mivelsiran in all indications. We're extremely excited about the potential of this program, our first in the CNS to address the unmet needs of patients in two significant disease areas. CAA, where we've just initiated a Phase 2 study in Alzheimer's disease, where we plan to start a Phase 2 study at or around the end of the year. So, in sum, we've made great progress advancing our pipeline and platform with much more to come. As a reminder, we plan to file proprietary INDs for 9 programs by the end of 2025 against targets in the liver, CNS, muscle and adipose. If we include partnered programs, we anticipate 15 new INDs by the end of 2025, representing a doubling of our clinical pipeline by the end of next year. This remarkable and unique pace of innovation puts us in a great position to have a robust, self-sustainable pipeline that can deliver a meaningful impact to patients across multiple disease areas. With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff? Yes, I think that building to Tolga I totally agree with everything you said. And I think, Tazeen, its early days, obviously, but as I think what we've heard repeatedly from clinicians is that they're looking for an orthogonal mechanism of action that can have an impact on this disease. And the investigators and authors for the ESC presentation said that we've shared the data deeply with are incredibly excited. And so we're looking forward to being able to roll those data out. But I think we're seeing a lot of enthusiasm based on the data that we've shared so far. Yes. Thanks, Maury. Look, we are working with the investigators and authors to sort of finalize the content. But we plan to go into pretty expansive detail on the end points in the study and the results that we presented at the top line, we think we're really excited to be able to share that now broadly with the community, both the clinical community and the investor community. So this will include -- I anticipate this will include baseline characteristics. You'll hear about sort of how this is a very contemporary population of patients that was heavily treated with other medications, effective agents. You'll see the results on the primary endpoint, including the components and all the secondaries. And we'll also be sharing curves for the primary endpoint and secondary endpoint of all-cause mortality. And you'll see that across the key -- you'll see the consistency of effect across a variety of subgroups and specifically, we'll be sharing some curves in the overall and based on baseline tafamidis. So I think you'll get a pretty fulsome view of the results. And of course, we'll have other opportunities to dive deeper into data at HFSA, -- we're limited in how much we can present the ESC. And there's a lot of rich data coming out of this incredible clinical trial that we'll be sharing in the weeks to come. Absolutely. So taking your two questions and building over on said with APP, a very exciting program. We just presented some data at AIC actually, that showed that we had consistent knockdown in both soluble APP alpha and beta, but also the downstream disease-related biomarkers of Abeta-40 and 42 that are involved in CAA and Alzheimer's disease and continue to see very encouraging safety coming out of that program as well. So that program remains on track. We're very excited. As we talked about, we've recently kicked off the study in cerebral amyloid angiopathy like second leading cause of hemorrhage. And as you noted, we will be starting a study in Alzheimer's disease as well. We aren't ready to talk about the specifics of that. We're obviously working through our trial design and -- but we'll share with that with you shortly. But we're very encouraged about this upstream mechanism. Its potential to be very differentiated in this disease space and hopefully have a favorable impact on the disease of Alzheimer's, which I think we all know has a tremendous burden. With regard to your second question on Himani, look, I think -- I don't think there's any really specific updates I want to give on the early preclinical programs other than to say what you heard in the main comments was just we are pushing very aggressively in terms of our 225 strategy to move a multitude of programs forward based on the excitement that we have around the platform here. And so we are on track for 3-plus INDs this year. proprietary INDs by the end of '25 and a doubling of our pipeline by the end of next year. But we'll give updates on those specific programs in due course and then keep you posted. Yeah. Thanks, Kostas. I think you were citing a paper that was recently published coming out of a European experience that looked at a cohort of patients who had been on tafamidis and progressed and a proportion of those patients that were put on ONPATTRO and actually seem to have some stabilization of the disease. These were polyohereditary polyneuropathy patients. Look, I think it's very encouraging. We know that this is a complex disease. Patients do have a progressive do progress with polyneuropathy and with cardiomyopathy. And so I don't think there's any question that there's an unmet need here for patients to have additional modes of therapy that can address what Tolga highlighted earlier, is a very steadily progressive and fatal disease. And so I think we all agree. And this is highlighted by the fact that even we have the APOLLO data, APOLLO-B data and we launched an EAP, there was tremendous need for patients who are on stabilizer therapy to get on to an additional orthogonal mechanism of action that stay enrolled very quickly. So we are very excited about the opportunity where patients need additional therapies and we'll be bringing that forward, we think, now for the CM patients as we have for the PN patients with ONPATTRO. Yes. And the other comment -- yes, just to comment on your question, it's a little early to tell you about the specific venue where we'll be talking about the data. But I think what you'll see is starting to see some data with multiple doses in terms of, again, the primary purpose of the study is on safety and pharmacodynamics. And so what you'll be seeing is that with multiple dosing. But over time, we'll be able to share more and more data coming out of that. But I think, again, our confidence in this program is highlighted by the fact that we've kicked off a study of Phase II in CAA, and we'll soon be kicking off a Phase II in Alzheimer's disease. So we couldn't -- we're very excited about the potential therapy and continue to investigate it. Yes. So maybe I can take the first part of your question in terms of is there some numerical target in terms of benefit on top of tafamidis. I think really, what I would say is the feedback that we've gotten all along, and I think has only been accentuated since we've shared the top line results with KOLs is just the enthusiasm for a new medicine to help these patients, first and foremost. Second of all, what they're seeing from the top line results is an opportunity for this drug to actually access the broad spectrum of patients with this disease. We saw strong efficacy as a monotherapy across all the endpoints. But we saw equally strong efficacy in the overall population, which I'll remind you includes 40% of patients who start on background tap and a good proportion of people who actually add an on TAP and added on SGLT2 inhibitors had diuretic intensification. And so -- and I think as some have noticed from the top line results -- there is -- if you just look at the mortality numbers, the strength of the data in the overall population, both in terms of the actual magnitude of effect as well as the p-value was somewhat stronger, which implies a pretty substantial effect in the add-on population. Now that's encouraging because it wasn't powered or designed to show an effect in that population. But to see what we're seeing is consistent evidence of additive efficacy, I think, is encouraging. So there's no numerical target, but I think what people are seeing is a picture of a drug that's emerging to them that looks quite -- to be quite effective for this disease. Yeah, I mean, thinking of that. Yes. No, Tolga, you said it very well. I mean I think the only thing I would just add is just a reminder that until five years ago, there was no therapy for these patients at all that was specific, right? And so they were treated as sort of a [indiscernible] ejection fraction. And I think to point now, we have a therapy, hopefully, assume multiple therapies for these patients. We've now over just the last few years had the proliferation of noninvasive diagnostic methods to identify these patients. And we're starting to understand more where how to identify these patients based on red flag symptoms such as polyneuropathy or spinal stenosis or carpal tunnel syndrome, things like that. So I think there is just a heavy, heavy need for more disease education awareness because we now have, we believe, hopefully, multiple therapies for these patients that can actually stem the progression of this result to otherwise progressive in fatal disease. So I think there is a lot of growth here in terms of patients to treat. Yes. Thanks, Will. Look, I think what we have here with USB is really a very, very rich study, right? This was a study done 655 patients in the modern era. These were patients who were diagnosed with noninvasive means. As we've talked about, and we'll share more at ESC, it was a pretty rigorous test. These are patients, 40% who are already on an effective therapy, a good proportion of the monotherapy arm. We started another effective therapy. In the midst of the study, patients started SGLT2s, other things. So it was a pretty rigorous test and the results we believe are very, very encouraging. The one thing the study was not was a head-to-head study with tafamidis. That is the one thing it was not. It was not designed for that purpose. And so the comparison that you're referring to really is a nonrandomized comparison. And as you can imagine, the patients who entered in on TAF were different because they've been on the drug for a while. Obviously, there were geographic differences in those patients. The minority of the TAF patients came from the U.S. So comparing that then to the vutri patients who are on monotherapy, it's really unfortunately a flawed analysis. I think what we'll see, as we highlighted in the top line results is that vutri appears to have really encouraging efficacy on every parameter we measured both as a monotherapy and evidence of additive efficacy on top of tafamidis and consistent results across the whole series of endpoints that we've looked at process."

            "name": "Jeff Poulton",
            "content": "Thanks, Pushkal and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam's Q2 2024 financial results and discussing our full year guidance. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for Q2 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. Total product revenue for the quarter was $410 million or 34% growth versus 2023 with both our TTR and rare franchises reporting strong growth of 37% and 25%, respectively, primarily driven by continued strong demand, as Tolga previously highlighted. Net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was $227 million, representing a $221 million increase when compared with Q2 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the modification of our collaboration agreement with Regeneron resulting in approximately $185 million of revenue, which was previously deferred. Royalty revenue for the quarter was $22 million or more than 3 times what was recognized in the second quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by higher Leqvio sales as Novartis continues to grow demand for Leqvio worldwide. Gross margin on product sales was 84% for the quarter compared with 75% in the second quarter of 2023. The improvement in margin is primarily due to higher costs in 2023 associated with canceled manufacturing commitments for ONPATTRO and other adjustments to inventory, for which similar expenses were not realized in 2024. I expect our gross margin on product sales will be lower for the balance of the year, driven by higher royalties paid on AMVUTTRA as AMVUTTRA growth continues at a brisk pace. Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 14% in the second quarter compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased costs associated with our preclinical activities, increased development expenses associated with start-up activities for the zilebesiran and mivelsiran clinical studies and increased employee compensation expenses. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 21% in the second quarter compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased marketing investment associated with promotion of our TTR therapies and increased employee compensation expenses. Our non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $138 million, representing a $292 million improvement compared with Q2 2023, primarily driven by strong top line results, both in product sales as well as revenue from collaborations, as previously highlighted. We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.6 billion compared with $2.4 billion as of December 31st, 2023, with the increase primarily due to increased net product revenues and increased net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with employee stock option exercises. We continue to believe our current cash balance is sufficient to bridge us to a self-sustainable financial profile. Now, I'd like to turn to our 2024 guidance where we are updating all components of our full year guidance with the specific details as follows: we are increasing our net product revenue guidance from a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion to a range of $1.575 billion to $1.65 billion, representing an 11% increase from the midpoint of the prior to the updated guidance. The primary driver of the increased guidance is the ongoing strength of performance in our hereditary ATTR polyneuropathy franchise. We are increasing our collaboration and royalty revenue guidance from a range of $325 million to $425 million to a range of $575 million to $650 million. The primary driver of the increase is the modification of our collaboration agreement with Regeneron, which resulted in the recognition of approximately $185 million of previously deferred revenue this quarter. And lastly, we are increasing our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses from a range of $1.675 billion to $1.775 billion to a range of $1.775 billion to $1.875 billion. There are two primary drivers of the increase. First, the opt out of mivelsiran by Regeneron will result in increased R&D investment as the program is now wholly owned by Alnylam. Second, given the strong HELIOS-B top line results, we are increasing our planned ATTR cardiomyopathy launch prep efforts to optimize their preparedness for an early 2025 launch in the U.S. Given the strong momentum in our business, underpinning these guidance changes, along with the strength of the HELIOS-B study results and our efforts to prepare for a highly successful ATTR cardiomyopathy launch next year, we are very confident in our ability to achieve both of the Alnylam P5x25 financial goals that we established three and a half years ago, which include achieving a 40% plus compounded annual growth rate and total revenues across the five-year period and achieving sustainable non-GAAP operating income within the period. Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones slated for mid and late 2024. As was mentioned earlier, we will be presenting detailed results from HELIOS-B at the ESC Congress on Friday, August 30 in London. We will also be hosting a conference call and webcast to discuss the data. We've also announced today that we plan to host a TTR Investor Day on October 9th in New York City. At this event, we will feature senior leaders from Alnylam as well as external experts to highlight the potential of our TTR business. This will be webcast as well. We will be submitting a supplemental new drug application for vutrisiran to the FDA using a priority review voucher. We plan to report interim results from Part B of the Phase 1 study of mivelsiran in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We expect three trial initiations by the end of 2024, including a Phase 3 study of ALN-TTRsc04 in patients with ATTR cardiomyopathy at or around year-end, a Phase 2 study for mivelsiran in patients with Alzheimer's disease at or around year-end and a Phase 1 study of ALN-BCAT and hepatocellular carcinoma. And we remain on track to file three investigational new drug applications by year-end. Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? I don't have anything further to add, no."

            "content": "Thanks Christine and thank you everyone for joining the call today. The second quarter of 2024 was a transformative one for Alnylam. Commercially, we achieved a 34% year-over-year growth in global net product revenues, generating $410 million in net product revenues, which was primarily driven by 37% year-over-year growth in our TTR business. And as such, we've raised our revenue guidance for the year by 11% at the midpoint. The commercial capability that we've established over the last five years will continue to drive significant growth for our current business and will be a key to our success as we prepare for a potential launch next year in ATTR cardiomyopathy. To that end, the major highlights of Q2 was our announcement of positive top line results from the HELIOS-B Phase 3 study of vutrisiran in ATTR cardiomyopathy, showing that vutrisiran improved cardiovascular outcomes, including a 35% to 36% mortality benefit compared to placebo and demonstrated encouraging safety. These results reflect the true power of the RNAi mechanism of action, supporting what we believe to be a highly differentiated therapeutic profile and positioned vutrisiran as the new standard of care in ATTR cardiomyopathy, assuming regulatory approval. Moreover, we believe these positive results can establish vutrisiran as an anchor commercial franchise for Alnylam, driving robust top line growth and value creation for many years to come. With an eye towards our Alnylam P5x25 goals, we are firm in our belief that we are on track to become a top-tier biotech, developing and commercializing transformative medicines for patients around the world with rare and prevalent diseases driven by a high-yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering exceptional financial results. Before I turn it over to Tolga, I'm excited to tell you about the TTR Investor Day that we will be hosting in New York City on Wednesday, October 9th. This event, which will be webcast live, will focus on our leadership in ATTR amyloidosis, including the efforts that we are undertaking to optimize the success of the launch of AMVUTTRA in ATTR cardiomyopathy. You'll hear from several of my Alnylam colleagues as well as external experts. We'll be sharing more details about this event shortly, and I hope that you can join us in New York on October 9th. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga? Yes, I think that's the question for Tolga. Maybe just to start off by emphasizing how pleased we are with the commercial performance to date, how peas at the commercial performance to date and really see so much opportunity ahead of us, both in polyneuropathy. And that is we expand the label to include patients with cardiomyopathy, assuming positive regulatory approval, but Tolga, you may want to respond to the specific questions. Thanks Tolga. That's great. Next question please. Yes. No, that's a great question. And clearly, there is an unmet medical need here in this disease, which is rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal and we think we have a profile that's absolutely well set up to be standard of care. Tolga? And of course, more to come at ESC, and we look forward to that. Next question please. That's a great question, Marin. Clearly, we're working on finalizing the details as we speak. Pushkal? Thanks, Pushkal. Next question. Yes. No. Look, we're delighted with the progress of PLN ACC program, my view answers actually peso. -- ran. It's advancing well, we've been able to demonstrate rapid and robust and sustained reductions in APP, going very well, and we feel there's tremendous potential in the two indications that we are progressing both Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Pushkal, maybe we're looking at the future. Great question. Pushkal, I think... Great. Next question. Well, I'll take the second question first. I mean we're actually delighted to be progressing ALN-APP. As I said, we're very excited about the 2 indications. We've already kicked off our Phase II in patients with amyloid angiopathy and planning to start the study in Alzheimer's disease at or around year-end. So we couldn't be more pleased to have another wholly owned program in our pipeline, and I look forward to moving these programs forward ourselves. Each potential huge medical knees, we're very, very pleased to be moving forward. Next question. Great question. Tolga? Yes. Maybe I'll start with the TTRsc04 question. I mean clearly, this is an opportunity to really build a durable franchise in TTR for Alnylam we've seen rapid knockdown, very durable knockdown. And we're looking at a program that potentially has improved knockdown with six months of your annual dosing. So we're really excited about moving forward TTRsc04. So early to comment on the specifics of the clinical program at this point in time, but there will be more to come as we get to the end of this year. Tolga, do you want to take the question on... On reimbursement, yes. Next question Tolga. Straight to you, a terrific question. Thanks, Tolga. Next question. I think to add a few words about the market. We've talked about how we think about the market pre-tax loss of exclusivity and post-tax loss of exclusivity. Perhaps you could make a few comments on. I think another one for you. Next question. Okay. I think we have time for one more question. Last question please. Okay. Well, we're going to come back to that question because as I said, we're not ready really to get into the details of what the next detailed steps in our clinical plans. So we'll come back and share more on that later, but thanks for your interest. We're also very excited about the program. Thanks, Luca. Okay. I think that brings our call to a close. And I just want to thank everybody for joining. I mean really the second quarter of 2024 has marked an inflection point in our items journey. And we really are proud of our progress. As Tolga described, the being robust commercial growth. Pushkal's gone through some of the incredible advancements in our pipeline. And now more than ever, we believe that we're firmly on a path to becoming a top-tier biotech company. So thank you, everybody, and have a great day."

Yvonne? \nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Christine, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. 2024 is off to a very strong start and shaping up to be an impactful year for Alnylam. Commercially, in the first quarter, we delivered robust product revenue growth for our 4 wholly-owned medicines, achieving $365 million in revenue or 32% year-over-year growth compared to Q1 2023. An important part of this was the continued momentum from our TTR franchise, which delivered 29% year-over-year growth versus Q1 2023. \n From a pipeline perspective, our zilebesiran hypertension program was a major highlight with positive results presented from the KARDIA-2 Phase II study, evaluating zilebesiran in combination with certain standard-of-care antihypertensives and the initiation of KARDIA-3. This program represents a significant opportunity to reimagine the treatment of hypertension, and could position Alnylam as the leader in treating cardiovascular disease. \n To that end, we're on the cusp of reporting top line results from the HELIOS-B Phase III study of vutrisiran in patients with TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. As we've highlighted previously, we have many reasons to be highly confident in a positive HELIOS-B outcome, including the encouraging data from the APOLLO-B study of vutrisiran, and we remain on track to report top line data from HELIOS-B in late June or early July, which, if positive, is expected to support the filing of an sNDA by the end of this year. \n With this progress, we continue to advance our Alnylam P5x25 goals, making Alnylam a top-tier biotech developing and commercializing transformative medicines for patients around the world with rare and prevalent diseases driven by a high-yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering exceptional financial results. \n With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga? \nTolga Tanguler: Thanks, Yvonne, and good morning, everyone. \n Q1 was another strong quarter for our commercial portfolio delivering $365 million combined net product revenues as we continue our growth momentum with our rare and TTR franchises. Our overall portfolio grew by 32% in the first quarter versus prior year as we continue to steadily increase the number of patients on our therapies. \n First, let me summarize our first quarter TTR results. The TTR franchise achieved $264 million in global net product revenues, representing a 4% increase compared with the fourth quarter of '23 and 29% growth compared with the first quarter of '23. Our U.S. combined TTR sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased by 3% compared with the fourth quarter of '23, and a robust 35% year-over-year, driven by continued strong AMVUTTRA uptake. \n The U.S. year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the following: a 39% increase in total demand versus the first quarter of '23, which was driven by the strength of ongoing AMVUTTRA patient uptake, more than offsetting the decrease in patients on ONPATTRO that switched to AMVUTTRA. \n Inventory dynamics decreased reported growth by approximately 4% as both ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA inventory in the channel decreased in the quarter, another favorable sign of robust Q1 demand. \n Now let me turn to our international markets, where TTR franchise growth increased by 5% compared with the fourth quarter of '23 and 23% year-over-year. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by increased demand for AMVUTTRA as new patient adds remain robust, including launches at the end of last year in Spain, Italy and Sweden, and continued strong ONPATTRO performance in a few markets where AMVUTTRA is not yet available. \n As a reminder, AMVUTTRA is now reimbursed in all major international markets. Demand growth in international markets was partially offset by lower pricing in certain countries, primarily in Germany at the end of the initial 6-month free pricing period for AMVUTTRA occurred in Q2 2023, as previously reported. I would also like to provide additional color on the continued growth momentum of our TTR franchise in the U.S. \n We remain confident and very pleased with the impact we're seeing from AMVUTTRA in expanding the opportunity for our TTR franchise and is reflected by the robust 35% year-over-year growth that we achieved in the first quarter of 2024. This is a growing category with significant unmet needs remaining. Importantly, leading market indicators remain aligned with our demand growth galvanizing AMVUTTRA's market leadership, both in patients and health care providers for the treatment of patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. \n Here are some key highlights. More physicians are prescribing AMVUTTRA evidenced by the more than 50% year-over-year growth in our prescriber base. We strongly believe hATTR-PN is a condition that requires high engagement between health care professionals and their patients. \n AMVUTTRA offers the flexibility for this engagement to happen at the hospital, at an outpatient center or for many patients at home. In alignment with our patient access philosophy, we continue to demonstrate seamless access to AMVUTTRA with more than 99% of our patients having confirmed access and approximately 70% of patients having zero out-of-pocket costs. \n Last, we are monitoring adherence and compliance metrics, which show that more than 95% of our patients remain on therapy and comply with AMVUTTRA's quarterly dosing regimen. As we have previously communicated, we believe approximately 80% of the 25,000 to 30,000 patients with hATTR polyneuropathy globally are undiagnosed or untreated, which represents a significant opportunity to find and treat more patients. \n Given that hATTR polyneuropathy is also a rapidly progressing disease, we believe patients and physicians stand to benefit most from a therapy that rapidly knocks down the disease-causing protein with unparalleled speed, depth and duration. AMVUTTRA offers these benefits in a single quarterly dose and has the ability to reverse the polyneuropathy manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis, combined with a favorable access track record and well-established safety profile. \n With this foundation, we are in a position of strength as we embarked on a branded patient awareness campaign to raise patient awareness of the disease and the benefits of AMVUTTRA and its unique rapid knockdown profile. \n Shifting to our rare franchise and the performance of GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. Our global rare franchise delivered $101 million in combined global net product revenue during the first quarter, representing a solid 9% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2023 and an impressive 40% growth compared with the first quarter of 2023. For GIVLAARI, revenues increased by 21% in Q1 compared to the same period last year. with the following regional dynamics, a 28% increase in the U.S., primarily driven by growth in new patients on therapy with modest additional upside from favorable gross to net changes, 10% growth in rest of the world, primarily driven by demand growth, which was partially offset by an increase in gross to net deduction year-over-year. \n For OXLUMO, we delivered a robust 77% increase in revenues year-over-year, which was driven by the following regional dynamics, a 47% increase in the U.S. primarily driven by demand growth with additional favorability from lower gross to net deductions, a robust 94% growth from rest of world markets driven by increased demand, a favorable gross to net adjustments and the timing of orders in partner markets. \n Given the nature and magnitude of the rest of world Q1 gross to net and partner market timing benefits, we anticipate that we will see a reduction in global sales for OXLUMO in Q2. \n In conclusion, we are very pleased with our continued growth momentum, delivering a robust 32% revenue growth versus prior year that positions us well to reach our 2024 net product revenue guidance. \n With that, I will now turn it over to Pushkal to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal? \nPushkal Garg: Thanks, Tolga. And good morning, everyone. Let's begin with our TTR franchise, where we eagerly await top line results from HELIOS-B, our outcome study designed to expand the label for AMVUTTRA, to include the treatment of patients with hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. \n As you're aware, on our Q4 earnings call in February, we announced enhancements to the HELIOS-B statistical plan to optimize the study for success and to best support a strong and competitive label. These changes were informed by insights from the APOLLO-B data and emerging data from the field. \n With these optimizations, we remain focused on clinical outcomes of death and hospitalization, which are critical to all stakeholders, but now plan to evaluate these outcomes in the overall population as well as the monotherapy population, which is where we believe AMVUTTRA will have the largest treatment effect and will best demonstrate the drug's true impact. \n We also streamlined the secondary endpoint structure to focus on those clinical measures that we believe will best highlight AMVUTTRA's potentially differentiated profile and its benefits on stabilization of this progressive disease. And we enhanced the overall statistical powering of the study by incorporating up to an additional 3 months of event collection at the tail end of the study period, the most critical period and firmly establishing HELIOS-B as the longest placebo-controlled study conducted to date in ATTR-CM. \n We remain on track to report top line results in late June or early July. At that time, we plan to provide p-values on the primary and secondary endpoints as well as key details regarding safety. We also expect to provide some high-level information on subgroups, including patients on baseline tafamidis. Full results are expected to be presented at a scientific congress soon thereafter. And assuming positive results from HELIOS-B, we expect to submit a supplemental NDA to the FDA in late 2024. \n Turning now to zilebesiran, our investigational RNAi therapeutic being evaluated as a treatment for hypertension. We made some very exciting progress in the first quarter on this program. Hypertension is a global health crisis and the leading addressable cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality around the world. Unfortunately, despite available therapies, up to 80% of patients have uncontrolled disease and beyond poor control, there are a number of other aspects of hypertension management that contribute to increased cardiovascular risk, namely poor medication adherence, variability in blood pressure and lack of nighttime dipping. We believe that zilebesiran has the potential to address all of these unmet needs and improve cardiovascular outcomes by providing tonic control of blood pressure. \n At the ACC conference a few weeks ago, we presented the full results from the positive KARDIA-2 Phase II study that evaluates the efficacy and safety of a single subcutaneous dose of zilebesiran when added to 1 of 3 standard-of-care anti-hypertensives, a thiazide-like diuretic, indapamide, a calcium channel blocker, amlodipine or an angiotensin receptor blocker or losartan. \n The study achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating clinically and statistically significant placebo-adjusted reductions of up to 12.1 millimeters of mercury in 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure at month 3 as measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring when zilebesiran was added to 1 of the 3 background medications. The study also achieved a key secondary end point demonstrating clinically significant additive reductions in office systolic blood pressure at month 3 across all 3 independent cohorts. \n Finally, zilebesiran demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile when added to standard-of-care antihypertensives. We are very excited by these results, showing additive efficacy and good tolerability on top of 2 agents with orthogonal mechanisms and on top of an arm which also works in the RAS pathway, which support continued development. \n To that point, we recently initiated the KARDIA-3 Phase II study, which will evaluate zilebesiran on top of 2 or more agents in patients who are at high cardiovascular risk. As this slide shows, we and our partners at Roche have robust plans to bring zilebesiran forward as an agent that can reshape the treatment of cardiovascular disease. This includes our intention after KARDIA-3 to run a cardiovascular outcome trial, where we can demonstrate the benefits of tonic blood pressure control in patients with high CV risk by showing reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. \n Wrapping up with the pipeline, our extrahepatic efforts in the CNS continue to progress this quarter as well. As we announced on our Q4 earnings call, we received FDA clearance to initiate the multiple dose portion of the Phase I study of mivelsiran, formerly known as ALN-APP, in early-onset Alzheimer's disease and remain on track to initiate a Phase II study in cerebral amyloid angiopathy early this year. \n So in sum, we've made great progress in advancing our pipeline and platform with much more to come. As a reminder, we plan to file proprietary INDs for 9 programs by the end of 2025. They get targets in the liver, CNS, muscle and adipose. If we include partnered programs, we anticipate 15 new INDs by the end of 2025, representing a doubling of our clinical pipeline by the end of next year. This remarkable and unique pace of innovation puts us in a great position to have a robust, self-sustainable pipeline that can deliver meaningful impact to patients across multiple disease areas. \n With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff? \nJeffrey Poulton: Thanks, Pushkal, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam's Q1 2024 financial results and discussing our full year guidance. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for Q1 2024 compared with Q1 2023. \n Total product revenues for the quarter were $365 million or 32% growth versus the first quarter of 2023, with both our TTR and rare franchises reporting strong growth of 29% and 40%, respectively, primarily driven by strong demand, as Tolga previously highlighted. \n Net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was $119 million or a 225% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to revenue recognized under our collaboration and license agreement with Roche, including $65 million of milestone revenue associated with initiation of the zilebesiran KARDIA-3 clinical trial and an increase in revenue recognized under our collaboration agreement with Regeneron. \n Royalty revenue for the quarter was $11 million or a 63% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by higher LEQVIO sales compared to the same period in 2023. Gross margin on product sales was 85% for the quarter, which was consistent with the first quarter of 2023. We expect our gross margin on product sales will be lower for the balance of 2024, driven by higher royalties paid on AMVUTTRA, as AMVUTTRA growth continues at a brisk pace. \n Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 13% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2023 and primarily driven by increased investments in zilebesiran, our HELIOS-B trial and our preclinical pipeline. \n Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 15% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2023, lower than our 32% growth in product sales as we continue to deliver operating leverage on our journey to achieving profitability. \n The source of SG&A expense growth was primarily related to TTR marketing investments to help drive polyneuropathy patient finding efforts as well as increased investment in preparation for a potential launch in cardiomyopathy next year. \n Our non-GAAP operating gain for the quarter was $2 million, representing more than a $100 million improvement compared with Q1 2023, primarily driven by strong top line results, both in products with sales as well as revenue from collaborations as previously highlighted. \n Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.4 billion, in line with the $2.4 billion we reported at the end of 2023. We continue to believe our current cash balance will be sufficient to bridge us to a self-sustainable financial profile. \n Now I'd like to turn to our financial guidance for 2024. Today, we are reiterating our 2024 guidance as presented during our earnings call in February. We anticipate combined net product revenues for our 4 wholly-owned commercial products will be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, corresponding to a 13% to 21% growth rate at January 31 FX rates. \n Q1 was a strong start to the year, giving us confidence in our ability to meet or exceed our product sales guidance. We will, of course, carefully review our progress in Q2 to determine if any changes to our guidance are warranted. Our collaboration and royalty revenue guidance range is $325 million to $425 million. \n And lastly, our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses remains a range between $1.675 billion and $1.775 billion, the midpoint of which reflects 9% growth compared with 2023.\n Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones slated for early and mid-2024. We expect 3 trial initiations in early 2024, including a Phase II study for mivelsiran in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Part B of the Phase I study of ALN-KHK and type 2 diabetes and a Phase I study of ALN-BCAT in hepatocellular carcinoma. \n And as been highlighted, we remain on track to report top line results from the HELIOS-B study of vutrisiran in late June or early July. Given how important the readout is, we plan to enter a quiet period beginning May 13 in advance of those results. \n Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? \nChristine Lindenboom: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, we will now open the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Lebowitz with Citi. \nDavid Lebowitz: I'm curious, there has been some talk recently about what is considered to be the relevant improvement over the control arm, certainly on the monotherapy side to make it easier to compare one drug versus another. And numbers have been bandied about 30% relative improvement versus 42% relative improvement. I'm just curious, I know that information won't come in the top line release, but what are your thoughts on that discussion and how do you think we should think about it. \nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks, Dave, for the question. Just as a reminder, HELIOS-B is an outcome study. And that's really what we need to deliver from the study. And it's quite clear in discussions with regulators, payers and physicians that if we're able to show a benefit on outcomes, this will be an important medicine.\n Clearly, we made some changes to the statistical plan, which we shared in some detail on our last call, and we're happy to reprise the rationale behind that. But at this point in time, I think the best way to look at this is delivering outcomes in the study will be the important results. And we also expect to see some other aspects of differentiation if we consider the results that we got out of HELIOS-B with respect to stabilization of disease. And so I think if we're able to deliver all this, we believe that will have a differentiated profile that will be an important contribution to managing the disease of these patients. \n Pushkal, is there anything you want to add? \nPushkal Garg: Yes. I mean, I agree with everything you said, Yvonne. Dave, maybe just a couple of other points. I mean, again, when it comes to clinical outcomes such as death and hospitalization, any change is considered clinically significant. And I think it's important to again go back to the unmet need in this disease. This is a steadily progressive disease, where month-on-month patients continue to decline. They experienced hospitalizations, worsening quality of life, worsening physical function, and ultimately, unfortunately, succumb to this disease. \n And whether you're on a once-a-day stabilizer or twice-a-day stabilizer, patients data -- the clinical trial data suggests that patients unfortunately continue to decline. And the orthogonal class of medicines could be helpful here. So we're encouraged by the APOLLO-B data. We're looking to demonstrate outcomes. And we think that clinicians will be looking at the magnitude of effect as well as when separation occurs as well as whether there's evidence of disease stabilization, which is really important, looking at the totality of the data. So we're looking forward to report the results in late June and early July. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Matteis with Stifel. \nPaul Matteis: I wanted to ask just about what Alnylam may look like organizationally in a scenario where HELIOS-B works versus one where it fails. Jeff, if HELIOS-B succeeds, do you expect to be changing guidance as it relates to spending and ramping up infrastructure ahead of the cardiomyopathy launch? And then conversely, HELIOS-B doesn't work, as you guys talk about 9 INDs by the end of 2025 or 15, if you include partner programs, do you feel like that still stands? Do you think Alnylam is still going to have the balance sheet to execute upon that? Or are you going to have to prioritize within the R&D pipeline? \nJeffrey Poulton: Yes. Paul, thanks for the question. Let me start with the first one, which I think was around our guidance this year and whether or not that would need to change on the spending side if we have a positive HELIOS-B result. The answer is no. The guidance reflects what we think we need for the year with the positive HELIOS-B results. So I don't anticipate that we would be raising the guidance. We think we have plenty of opportunity to invest behind the opportunity to drive success.\n I think the other questions were around how might things evolve if we were in the unlikely scenario of a failed HELIOS-B. Certainly, we would need to look at prioritization across the business in that scenario. And we're doing the work on that. If we're in that scenario, again, we think that's unlikely, but we would be prepared to talk to the market about the prioritization decisions that we would make in that outcome. \nYvonne Greenstreet: I also think it's important just to reflect on the magnitude of opportunity that we have in front of us as a company. I mean, Pushkal, touched on the richness of our pipeline, currently 15 programs in the clinic. We're looking at doubling that number by 2025. So as we look out at the opportunity set in front of us at Alnylam, we couldn't be more excited about being able to move forward the programs that we have. So we're obviously looking forward to a positive outcome from HELIOS-B and then really continuing to drive the pipeline that's in front of us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Maury Raycroft with Jefferies. \nMaurice Raycroft: In both ATTRibute and ATTRACT studies, the slope of the KM curve for events get steeper in the last few months of those studies. And I think it was mentioned in the prepared remarks that, that's a critical time for HELIOS-B. Should we expect a similar trajectory for the placebo arm in the last few additional months for HELIOS-B that you added to the stats plan? And would that widen the delta? And can you talk a little bit more about what your expectations are for the events during that time of the study? \nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, that's a great question. And clearly, I think a critical period of a study, as you say, is at the end of the study in this disease where patients continue to progress. So we do expect that, that's a period where we'll see most events. \n Pushkal, anything else you want to add? \nPushkal Garg: I think there's nothing to add, Yvonne. You covered it. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James. \nGary Nachman: So in ATTR-CM, are you still just thinking of vutri as primarily a monotherapy drug as tafamidis continues to grow as standard of care in ATTR-CM? If the combo data with TAF are positive enough and show enough of a benefit over TAF alone, would you reconsider that thinking? And what are you doing now to prepare for the launch in CM? Just some details there would be helpful. \nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes. Some really good questions. So Tolga, maybe you want to talk about how we're looking at the cardiomyopathy market and how we're preparing for launch. I mean clearly, we're playing to win in this space. We're very excited about the opportunity of getting into this very rapidly growing category. Tolga? \nTolga Tanguler: Yes, no, thank you. That's exactly right. We're really here to play to win. And look, at the end of the day, we need to look at the fundamentals of this category. There are 80 patients -- 80% of the patients remain undiagnosed. This is a rapidly and progressing disease with irreversible damages. And frankly, patients and physicians are both looking at quickly be able to deal with the disease as quickly as possible. \n So if you look at the pharmacodynamics of what AMVUTTRA has to offer and how we impact the disease-causing protein at the upstream and rapidly knocking down the toxic protein, that is going to be a key clear differentiator. At the end of the day, we know that AMVUTTRA provides speed, depth and duration as early as in the first dose, and this is what physicians are really looking for. \n It is true, and it's great to see tafamidis is making great progress, but it's not just the standard of care. It's the only care in this category. So one needs to remember that. And I think they've just reiterate the fact that the LOE in the U.S. in particular is going to remain until the end of 2028, which really means mainly because of the access pressures. \n But also, again, the way this product is going to be positioned and obviously, depending on the data we need to demonstrate, we believe we're going to be able to actually be the first-line agent. And after all, there are going to be, as Pushkal indicated, a substantial number of patients who are being treated that are continuing to progress. And we believe physicians and patients are looking for an alternative. And in that case, we believe it's going to be a very important option in the armamentarium of the physicians in this difficult disease. \nYvonne Greenstreet: That's absolutely spot on, Tolga. And I think it's just instructive when you reflect on our expanded access program, where within a matter of a very short space of time, we max out on the program. I think that, again, is just an illustration the level of unmet medical need is in space and the fact that patients continue to progress on tafamidis and they're looking for alternative therapies. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tazeen Ahmad with BofA Securities. \nTazeen Ahmad: I appreciate all the color you've been giving about expectations for what to show at the top line. But in terms of trying to drill into the detail on mortality specifically, fully understanding there's a lot of unmet need even with what's available right now, how important is it going to be to know when the mortality benefit kicks in for vutri? So I think for tafamidis that benefit in the Pfizer study started around month 18. Is it going to be important to have a number at the end that hovers around that month 18 or potentially, could it be better than that? \nYvonne Greenstreet: Pushkal, that's one for you. \nPushkal Garg: Yes. Thanks, Tazeen. Look, I think what we've seen in terms of mortality separation, if I call both for tafamidis and the acoramidis data that are under review is around month 18 is when we start to see the mortality separation. \n Look, we're encouraged by what we saw coming out of actually the original APOLLO data and then the APOLLO-B data, where we seem to see evidence again, in underpowered studies of separation on mortality occurring earlier, roughly month 9 or so. So we'll have to see in HELIOS-B if we're able to recapitulate those results in this larger-powered study. \n Again, I think it's going to be important to look at the totality of all the data that come out. Obviously, that will be one parameter. What is the mortality difference, when is it emerging, what about hospitalizations? And then again, what's happening in terms of disease stabilization? So we think all of those are going to be important parameters. But look, the early data that we've seen from APOLLO and particularly APOLLO-B, which is in the same patient population, gives us a lot of confidence that we should be able to see a substantial effect and potentially earlier separation. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ritu Baral with TD Cowen. \nRitu Baral: I want to thank you for the detail that you've given on the top line release, but I wanted to just dig a little further if I could. Pushkal and Yvonne, when you mentioned that you would give us some more details on subpopulation, will you be able to give us sort of drivers of potential composite benefit of the TAF subpopulation or the composite -- I'm sorry, combined subpopulation as well? Just given the conversation, investor conversation and focus on hospitalizations driving previous data sets, will we get sort of a tell on what the major drivers are? \n And then just a very quick follow-up on data release. You drop proBNP and echo parameters to exploratory endpoints. And those are ones that at least our KOLs actually deeply, deeply value. We were wondering if those would be released with first medical presentation? \nYvonne Greenstreet: Yes, Ritu, I mean, yes, it's a good question. And I think we've been quite clear about how we're going to be handling the release. I mean, clearly, we're going to show kind of p-values for the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints. So we're going to provide some information on safety. Obviously, that's an important consideration. And we've said we will give some information with respect to subgroups. I know you'll be particularly interested in the tafamidis subgroup, but I think that's where we stand at this point in time. We're kind of obviously looking forward to being able to share the top line results. We're still on track for end of June, early July. And then, of course, we'll present fulsome data at a proximal medical congress. \n So stay tuned. We will be providing some additional color over and above p-values for the primary and secondary endpoints. But that's probably all we can say at this point in time. Your second question? \nRitu Baral: It was on the... \nPushkal Garg: You were just talking about the NT-proBNP and the ECHO data. Look, I think we haven't mapped out exactly what will be the top line presentation. Obviously, it will be limited in terms of what we can -- we want to make sure that we -- we'll work with the investigators to make sure that there's a fulsome presentation. But you can imagine with a data set like this, that there will be a number of presentations to speak to the various aspects of the data. And certainly, BNP, echo, et cetera, Ritu, are important parameters that we'll be reporting on. \nYvonne Greenstreet: Absolutely, Pushkal. I mean, we're clearly very interested in those parameters, but you kind of have to prioritize how many secondary endpoints you have with respect to managing alpha. And clearly, we're pretty confident about what we're going to be able to demonstrate for those additional end points. But they're going to be endpoints that we'll be able to share, but we really wanted to prioritize the very clinically relevant secondary endpoints, and we've discussed what those are with respect to disease progression, mortality as well as 6-minute walk test in KCCQ. \nOperator: And our next question is from Jessica Fye with JPMorgan. \nJessica Fye: For HELIOS-B, when you talk about any impact on outcomes being clinically meaningful. On the one hand, I completely hear you there are outcomes, but then again, when we ask physicians about this, they usually have a magnitude or a threshold in mind that's not just any benefit. So I'm curious how to kind of reconcile that or maybe you could just elaborate there? \nPushkal Garg: Yes. Look, Jessica, I think I don't know that I can give you a lot more information other than to say, just have to, again, remember what the unmet need in this disease is that there are patients who currently -- a large number of patients, as Tolga has outlined, many of them are undiagnosed and untreated who have a steadily progressive disease that leads to irreversible damage and ultimately, patients pass away.\n And so what I think and as evidenced by -- as Yvonne highlighted, our EAP experience after APOLLO-B, and that was in the setting without any outcomes benefit being demonstrated in an IV drug, we rapidly enrolled a population of patients, many of whom were progressing on tafamidis, which was the only available therapy to them. So it highlights the unmet need. \n So we think that when we come forward with hopefully a positive HELIOS-B, showing an outcomes benefit, a mortality and hospitalization, along with these other differentiating factors that we've talked about and an orthogonal mechanism that rapidly knocks down the disease-causing protein of this disease, that we think that, that's going to address the key unmet needs for these patients. So we're looking forward to that, and we'll let the data speak for themselves. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kostas Biliouris with BMO Capital Markets. \nKonstantinos Biliouris: Congrats on the progress. A question from us on HELIOS-B just for a change. How important do you think is the ratio between hospitalization events and deaths as a metric, especially when we compare different drugs? Do you look at this ratio as an important metric or you just look at those 2 types of events together as a composite? \nYvonne Greenstreet: Thanks for the question, Kostas. Pushkal, this one is for you. \nPushkal Garg: Yes. No, I think it's an interesting question, Kostas. I think in general, we look at them together, and we don't make a huge distinction here. I mean, I think part of the reason that composite endpoints like this were created was because hospitalizations tend to correlate very strongly with mortality events. \n And so -- and these are both clinically meaningful outcomes. And so we would expect that they will both go directionally in the same direction. That's what we've seen with other drugs, that's what we've seen throughout the cardiovascular disease area with lots of drugs and lots of different diseases, disease classes. So we would expect them to go in similar directions, Kostas. And I think the main thing is seeing a benefit, hopefully, in both of those, the trend in the right direction. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ellie Merle with UBS. \nEliana Merle: In ATTR, what proportion of patients do you think are mixed phenotype in the real world? And how is this being defined both by doctors and by payers? And do you see silencers is more likely to gain a larger share in this population versus stabilizers longer term when we look to the cardiomyopathy expansion? \nYvonne Greenstreet: I think Pushkal first and then Tolga will follow up. \nPushkal Garg: Yes. Ellie, I think you raised a very important question and I think we've -- oftentimes, people have sort of classified these as 2 very distinct diseases, polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. When in fact, it's the same protein, when it's misfolded, it's causing both manifestations of the disease. And I would -- we've seen, for example, that in the hereditary population, when we looked in APOLLO and HELIOS-A that more than half of those patients had concomitant cardiomyopathy. And conversely, studies that have been done in cardiomyopathy patients suggest that a significant proportion of those patients may have polyneuropathy manifestations. \n So there are reports ranging from 15% to 30% or more of patients with wild-type ATTR or V122I, for example, which might have a primary cardiopathy manifestation have concomitant polyneuropathy. And certainly, we've seen that with the silencer class of drugs, particularly with patisiran and AMVUTTRA, that the magnitude of effect in polyneuropathy is really quite unsurpassed in terms of its clinical profile. And so it will be interesting to see, and Tolga can probably comment more about this, how clinicians will make decisions when they have patients who have multiple manifestations of this disease when they hopefully have multiple classes of therapies available. \nTolga Tanguler: Yes. No, I mean, just to add one quick point on that is, if you look at the clinical practice of how physicians actually diagnose and treat this disease, it starts with the suspicion. And the suspicion usually doesn't necessarily start whether you have cardiac manifestation of diseases or the polyneuropathy manifestations of this disease. \n Eventually, based on the data we have, obviously, both with ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA, physicians are absolutely looking for neuropathic manifestations to make sure that they can treat this as effectively as possible. And the disease is treated always through multidisciplinary centers. So at the end of the day, physicians don't just look at the patients whether they have CM, PN or mixed phenotype, they go through how to best understand the disease and then through a multidisciplinary approach, try to treat the disease in the best possible way and based on the indications of the products. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gena Wang with Barclays. \nHuidong Wang: Sorry, I will ask another AMVUTTRA question. So regarding the subgroup, the top line you will share, will you share the subgroup information on both primary and secondary end point? And also in the scenario that HELIOS-B is positive, will you also, at some point, lower AMVUTTRA price to be competitive compared to, say, tafamidis and other drugs? \nYvonne Greenstreet: I'll just take the pricing question. I mean I think it's really too early for us to talk about kind of specific kind of pricing approaches here, just to remind you, and Tolga touched on this in his introductory remarks. I mean, we will obviously bear in mind our patient access principles, and we'll be making sure that we have considerations around access and affordability to make sure that patients are going to be able to benefit from what we hope will be a medicine with a very robust profile. \n Pushkal, do you want to take the question on... \nPushkal Garg: Yes. I mean, Gena, I don't know that there's a lot more that I can add in terms of the remarks I made and then Yvonne has reiterated in terms of the top line. We plan again to speak to the primary endpoint, which is now in the 2 populations, the secondaries across those populations, safety and we'll make some commentary around subgroups. But it's hard to give you anything more than that today. That's our plan. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. \nTommie Reerink: This is Tommie on for Salveen. So beyond the top line and regarding data analyses, presented on the forward, would you include detailed analysis on AMVUTTRA impact in patients who were defined as past progressors given the unmet need in this population and just to see how AMVUTTRA could benefit these patients? \nPushkal Garg: Yes. Tommie, I think what you're asking about is actually deeper cuts of the data. And certainly, this is going to be a very rich and large data set. So you can imagine that we'll be looking at this in a lot of different ways. But again, I guess the primary thing I would focus on is the fact that we will have a pretty robust data set both with the drug treated as a monotherapy and in patients who came in on tafamidis. And I think you have to ask yourself, why would someone who's on a drug decide to enroll in a 3-plus year clinical trial? And that really indicates that they will -- they are obviously not satisfied with how they're feeling or functioning at that moment in time. And so I think our combination group, where we do have a sizable proportion of patients, and we'll be able to report on that will help address part of your question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ulz with Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Ulz: Maybe just a follow-up on the launch preparation question. Just curious what you guys have sort of done so far in preparing for a potential launch. And then what are the sort of remaining steps that will be triggered by positive data from HELIOS-B? \nYvonne Greenstreet: That's a great question. I'm going to pass it on to Tolga. And I just want to kind of underscore how pleased I am actually with the commercial footprint that we've built. And I think if you look at our performance with respect to AMVUTTRA in patients with polyneuropathy, I think we're really demonstrating strong growth momentum here, and I'm just really pleased with how the commercial organization is focusing on meeting the needs of patients in this indication. I have no doubt that we'll do the same, assuming a positive HELIOS-B and being able to launch into the cardiomyopathy indication. \n But Tolga, you may have some specific comments on how we're thinking about launching. So what I think is going to be actually one of the most exciting categories. \nTolga Tanguler: You took a little bit of wind away, Yvonne, because I was just going to highlight the fact that despite competition, the growth of our TTR franchise in the U.S. is 35% year-over-year, which is quite important, and I think it's an important indicator of the growth momentum that we've built. \n Look, we have a great brand, great data in polyneuropathy, which clearly demonstrated 90% market share in Europe and Japan, where we actually do compete with tafamidis in the same indication. And now in the U.S., we're essentially established very important stronghold in centers that actually treat both cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy. \n We obviously strictly promote our polyneuropathy indication. But it's -- the assay -- the product is now known by -- both by cardiologists who also tend to diagnose this disease as well as neurologists. Therefore, we're really well positioned to launch pending the HELIOS-B outcome results, which is going to be obviously very critical. And as Yvonne indicated, we're going to play to win. We have a great footprint well-informed and trained organization, not just in the customer-facing side but also a patient-facing side. \n And we also are very cognizant that this opportunity is going to be tenfold of the opportunity that we currently have. Therefore, we're going to make the right appropriate adjustments and make sure that we are clearly differentiated and more importantly, set ourselves so that the product is affordable and accessible to the patients. \nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Whitney Ijem with CG. \nWhitney Ijem: I'm just going to throw one non-HELIOS-B question in there because there will be catalysts after that. So can you help remind us, I guess, for Part B of the ALN-APP study, what we should expect to see later this year, particularly around any biomarker or imaging data? \nPushkal Garg: Yes. Thanks, Whitney, for your question about APP. It's a program that we're incredibly excited about. The data that we shared last year really suggested that we can have pretty profound impacts on the protein, on amyloid precursor protein as well as the downstream isoforms of AB40 and AB42 that are involved in both Alzheimer's disease and CAA. \n We have the Part B that's ongoing, and we hopefully will show ongoing data with regards to knockdown safety as well as imaging and biomarker data. So look for that as something we're also going to be initiating our CAA study soon. We're very excited about the opportunity. That's the second leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke, major -- with really no available treatments for these patients. And we think that lowering APP could be beneficial in that disease. We'll be kicking off a Phase II shortly. \n And we've also announced that we plan to kick off an Alzheimer's disease study at or around year-end of this year. So this is a really exciting program. And then it allows us then with our colleagues at Regeneron to move forward a number of other programs in the CNS space. So thanks for your question, lots of excitement there. \nChristine Lindenboom: Great. Thank you, Pushkal, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call. We're really proud of our strong start to 2024. We delivered robust commercial growth and exciting pipeline progress and we look forward to executing on the remainder of our 2024 goals, our path becoming a top-tier biotech chemical. So thanks, everyone, and have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude today's conference call and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tolga Tanguler",
            "content": "Thanks, Yvonne, and good morning, everyone. \n Q1 was another strong quarter for our commercial portfolio delivering $365 million combined net product revenues as we continue our growth momentum with our rare and TTR franchises. Our overall portfolio grew by 32% in the first quarter versus prior year as we continue to steadily increase the number of patients on our therapies. \n First, let me summarize our first quarter TTR results. The TTR franchise achieved $264 million in global net product revenues, representing a 4% increase compared with the fourth quarter of '23 and 29% growth compared with the first quarter of '23. Our U.S. combined TTR sales of ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA increased by 3% compared with the fourth quarter of '23, and a robust 35% year-over-year, driven by continued strong AMVUTTRA uptake. \n The U.S. year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the following: a 39% increase in total demand versus the first quarter of '23, which was driven by the strength of ongoing AMVUTTRA patient uptake, more than offsetting the decrease in patients on ONPATTRO that switched to AMVUTTRA. \n Inventory dynamics decreased reported growth by approximately 4% as both ONPATTRO and AMVUTTRA inventory in the channel decreased in the quarter, another favorable sign of robust Q1 demand. \n Now let me turn to our international markets, where TTR franchise growth increased by 5% compared with the fourth quarter of '23 and 23% year-over-year. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by increased demand for AMVUTTRA as new patient adds remain robust, including launches at the end of last year in Spain, Italy and Sweden, and continued strong ONPATTRO performance in a few markets where AMVUTTRA is not yet available. \n As a reminder, AMVUTTRA is now reimbursed in all major international markets. Demand growth in international markets was partially offset by lower pricing in certain countries, primarily in Germany at the end of the initial 6-month free pricing period for AMVUTTRA occurred in Q2 2023, as previously reported. I would also like to provide additional color on the continued growth momentum of our TTR franchise in the U.S. \n We remain confident and very pleased with the impact we're seeing from AMVUTTRA in expanding the opportunity for our TTR franchise and is reflected by the robust 35% year-over-year growth that we achieved in the first quarter of 2024. This is a growing category with significant unmet needs remaining. Importantly, leading market indicators remain aligned with our demand growth galvanizing AMVUTTRA's market leadership, both in patients and health care providers for the treatment of patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. \n Here are some key highlights. More physicians are prescribing AMVUTTRA evidenced by the more than 50% year-over-year growth in our prescriber base. We strongly believe hATTR-PN is a condition that requires high engagement between health care professionals and their patients. \n AMVUTTRA offers the flexibility for this engagement to happen at the hospital, at an outpatient center or for many patients at home. In alignment with our patient access philosophy, we continue to demonstrate seamless access to AMVUTTRA with more than 99% of our patients having confirmed access and approximately 70% of patients having zero out-of-pocket costs. \n Last, we are monitoring adherence and compliance metrics, which show that more than 95% of our patients remain on therapy and comply with AMVUTTRA's quarterly dosing regimen. As we have previously communicated, we believe approximately 80% of the 25,000 to 30,000 patients with hATTR polyneuropathy globally are undiagnosed or untreated, which represents a significant opportunity to find and treat more patients. \n Given that hATTR polyneuropathy is also a rapidly progressing disease, we believe patients and physicians stand to benefit most from a therapy that rapidly knocks down the disease-causing protein with unparalleled speed, depth and duration. AMVUTTRA offers these benefits in a single quarterly dose and has the ability to reverse the polyneuropathy manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis, combined with a favorable access track record and well-established safety profile. \n With this foundation, we are in a position of strength as we embarked on a branded patient awareness campaign to raise patient awareness of the disease and the benefits of AMVUTTRA and its unique rapid knockdown profile. \n Shifting to our rare franchise and the performance of GIVLAARI and OXLUMO. Our global rare franchise delivered $101 million in combined global net product revenue during the first quarter, representing a solid 9% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2023 and an impressive 40% growth compared with the first quarter of 2023. For GIVLAARI, revenues increased by 21% in Q1 compared to the same period last year. with the following regional dynamics, a 28% increase in the U.S., primarily driven by growth in new patients on therapy with modest additional upside from favorable gross to net changes, 10% growth in rest of the world, primarily driven by demand growth, which was partially offset by an increase in gross to net deduction year-over-year. \n For OXLUMO, we delivered a robust 77% increase in revenues year-over-year, which was driven by the following regional dynamics, a 47% increase in the U.S. primarily driven by demand growth with additional favorability from lower gross to net deductions, a robust 94% growth from rest of world markets driven by increased demand, a favorable gross to net adjustments and the timing of orders in partner markets. \n Given the nature and magnitude of the rest of world Q1 gross to net and partner market timing benefits, we anticipate that we will see a reduction in global sales for OXLUMO in Q2. \n In conclusion, we are very pleased with our continued growth momentum, delivering a robust 32% revenue growth versus prior year that positions us well to reach our 2024 net product revenue guidance. \n With that, I will now turn it over to Pushkal to review our recent R&D and pipeline progress. Pushkal? Yes, no, thank you. That's exactly right. We're really here to play to win. And look, at the end of the day, we need to look at the fundamentals of this category. There are 80 patients -- 80% of the patients remain undiagnosed. This is a rapidly and progressing disease with irreversible damages. And frankly, patients and physicians are both looking at quickly be able to deal with the disease as quickly as possible. \n So if you look at the pharmacodynamics of what AMVUTTRA has to offer and how we impact the disease-causing protein at the upstream and rapidly knocking down the toxic protein, that is going to be a key clear differentiator.

            "content": "Thanks, Pushkal, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be presenting a summary of Alnylam's Q1 2024 financial results and discussing our full year guidance. Starting with a summary of our P&L results for Q1 2024 compared with Q1 2023. \n Total product revenues for the quarter were $365 million or 32% growth versus the first quarter of 2023, with both our TTR and rare franchises reporting strong growth of 29% and 40%, respectively, primarily driven by strong demand, as Tolga previously highlighted. \n Net revenue from collaborations for the quarter was $119 million or a 225% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to revenue recognized under our collaboration and license agreement with Roche, including $65 million of milestone revenue associated with initiation of the zilebesiran KARDIA-3 clinical trial and an increase in revenue recognized under our collaboration agreement with Regeneron. \n Royalty revenue for the quarter was $11 million or a 63% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023. The increase was driven by higher LEQVIO sales compared to the same period in 2023. Gross margin on product sales was 85% for the quarter, which was consistent with the first quarter of 2023. We expect our gross margin on product sales will be lower for the balance of 2024, driven by higher royalties paid on AMVUTTRA, as AMVUTTRA growth continues at a brisk pace. \n Our non-GAAP R&D expenses increased 13% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2023 and primarily driven by increased investments in zilebesiran, our HELIOS-B trial and our preclinical pipeline. \n Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased 15% in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2023, lower than our 32% growth in product sales as we continue to deliver operating leverage on our journey to achieving profitability. \n The source of SG&A expense growth was primarily related to TTR marketing investments to help drive polyneuropathy patient finding efforts as well as increased investment in preparation for a potential launch in cardiomyopathy next year. \n Our non-GAAP operating gain for the quarter was $2 million, representing more than a $100 million improvement compared with Q1 2023, primarily driven by strong top line results, both in products with sales as well as revenue from collaborations as previously highlighted. \n Finally, we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.4 billion, in line with the $2.4 billion we reported at the end of 2023. We continue to believe our current cash balance will be sufficient to bridge us to a self-sustainable financial profile. \n Now I'd like to turn to our financial guidance for 2024. Today, we are reiterating our 2024 guidance as presented during our earnings call in February. We anticipate combined net product revenues for our 4 wholly-owned commercial products will be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, corresponding to a 13% to 21% growth rate at January 31 FX rates. \n Q1 was a strong start to the year, giving us confidence in our ability to meet or exceed our product sales guidance. We will, of course, carefully review our progress in Q2 to determine if any changes to our guidance are warranted. Our collaboration and royalty revenue guidance range is $325 million to $425 million. \n And lastly, our guidance for combined non-GAAP R&D and SG&A expenses remains a range between $1.675 billion and $1.775 billion, the midpoint of which reflects 9% growth compared with 2023.\n Let me now turn from financials and discuss some key goals and upcoming milestones slated for early and mid-2024. We expect 3 trial initiations in early 2024, including a Phase II study for mivelsiran in patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Part B of the Phase I study of ALN-KHK and type 2 diabetes and a Phase I study of ALN-BCAT in hepatocellular carcinoma. \n And as been highlighted, we remain on track to report top line results from the HELIOS-B study of vutrisiran in late June or early July. Given how important the readout is, we plan to enter a quiet period beginning May 13 in advance of those results. \n Let me now turn it back to Christine to coordinate our Q&A session. Christine? Yes. Paul, thanks for the question. Let me start with the first one, which I think was around our guidance this year and whether or not that would need to change on the spending side if we have a positive HELIOS-B result. The answer is no. The guidance reflects what we think we need for the year with the positive HELIOS-B results. So I don't anticipate that we would be raising the guidance. We think we have plenty of opportunity to invest behind the opportunity to drive success.\n I think the other questions were around how might things evolve if we were in the unlikely scenario of a failed HELIOS-B. Certainly, we would need to look at prioritization across the business in that scenario. And we're doing the work on that. If we're in that scenario, again, we think that's unlikely, but we would be prepared to talk to the market about the prioritization decisions that we would make in that outcome."

            "content": "Thanks, Tolga. And good morning, everyone. Let's begin with our TTR franchise, where we eagerly await top line results from HELIOS-B, our outcome study designed to expand the label for AMVUTTRA, to include the treatment of patients with hereditary and wild-type ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. \n As you're aware, on our Q4 earnings call in February, we announced enhancements to the HELIOS-B statistical plan to optimize the study for success and to best support a strong and competitive label. These changes were informed by insights from the APOLLO-B data and emerging data from the field. \n With these optimizations, we remain focused on clinical outcomes of death and hospitalization, which are critical to all stakeholders, but now plan to evaluate these outcomes in the overall population as well as the monotherapy population, which is where we believe AMVUTTRA will have the largest treatment effect and will best demonstrate the drug's true impact. \n We also streamlined the secondary endpoint structure to focus on those clinical measures that we believe will best highlight AMVUTTRA's potentially differentiated profile and its benefits on stabilization of this progressive disease. And we enhanced the overall statistical powering of the study by incorporating up to an additional 3 months of event collection at the tail end of the study period, the most critical period and firmly establishing HELIOS-B as the longest placebo-controlled study conducted to date in ATTR-CM. \n We remain on track to report top line results in late June or early July. At that time, we plan to provide p-values on the primary and secondary endpoints as well as key details regarding safety. We also expect to provide some high-level information on subgroups, including patients on baseline tafamidis. Full results are expected to be presented at a scientific congress soon thereafter. And assuming positive results from HELIOS-B, we expect to submit a supplemental NDA to the FDA in late 2024. \n Turning now to zilebesiran, our investigational RNAi therapeutic being evaluated as a treatment for hypertension. We made some very exciting progress in the first quarter on this program. Hypertension is a global health crisis and the leading addressable cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality around the world. Unfortunately, despite available therapies, up to 80% of patients have uncontrolled disease and beyond poor control, there are a number of other aspects of hypertension management that contribute to increased cardiovascular risk, namely poor medication adherence, variability in blood pressure and lack of nighttime dipping. We believe that zilebesiran has the potential to address all of these unmet needs and improve cardiovascular outcomes by providing tonic control of blood pressure. \n At the ACC conference a few weeks ago, we presented the full results from the positive KARDIA-2 Phase II study that evaluates the efficacy and safety of a single subcutaneous dose of zilebesiran when added to 1 of 3 standard-of-care anti-hypertensives, a thiazide-like diuretic, indapamide, a calcium channel blocker, amlodipine or an angiotensin receptor blocker or losartan. \n The study achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating clinically and statistically significant placebo-adjusted reductions of up to 12.1 millimeters of mercury in 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure at month 3 as measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring when zilebesiran was added to 1 of the 3 background medications. The study also achieved a key secondary end point demonstrating clinically significant additive reductions in office systolic blood pressure at month 3 across all 3 independent cohorts. \n Finally, zilebesiran demonstrated an encouraging safety and tolerability profile when added to standard-of-care antihypertensives. We are very excited by these results, showing additive efficacy and good tolerability on top of 2 agents with orthogonal mechanisms and on top of an arm which also works in the RAS pathway, which support continued development. \n To that point, we recently initiated the KARDIA-3 Phase II study, which will evaluate zilebesiran on top of 2 or more agents in patients who are at high cardiovascular risk. As this slide shows, we and our partners at Roche have robust plans to bring zilebesiran forward as an agent that can reshape the treatment of cardiovascular disease. This includes our intention after KARDIA-3 to run a cardiovascular outcome trial, where we can demonstrate the benefits of tonic blood pressure control in patients with high CV risk by showing reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. \n Wrapping up with the pipeline, our extrahepatic efforts in the CNS continue to progress this quarter as well. As we announced on our Q4 earnings call, we received FDA clearance to initiate the multiple dose portion of the Phase I study of mivelsiran, formerly known as ALN-APP, in early-onset Alzheimer's disease and remain on track to initiate a Phase II study in cerebral amyloid angiopathy early this year. \n So in sum, we've made great progress in advancing our pipeline and platform with much more to come. As a reminder, we plan to file proprietary INDs for 9 programs by the end of 2025. They get targets in the liver, CNS, muscle and adipose. If we include partnered programs, we anticipate 15 new INDs by the end of 2025, representing a doubling of our clinical pipeline by the end of next year. This remarkable and unique pace of innovation puts us in a great position to have a robust, self-sustainable pipeline that can deliver meaningful impact to patients across multiple disease areas. \n With that, let me now turn it over to Jeff to review our financial results and upcoming milestones. Jeff? Yes. I mean, I agree with everything you said, Yvonne. Dave, maybe just a couple of other points. I mean, again, when it comes to clinical outcomes such as death and hospitalization, any change is considered clinically significant. And I think it's important to again go back to the unmet need in this disease. This is a steadily progressive disease, where month-on-month patients continue to decline. They experienced hospitalizations, worsening quality of life, worsening physical function, and ultimately, unfortunately, succumb to this disease. \n And whether you're on a once-a-day stabilizer or twice-a-day stabilizer, patients data -- the clinical trial data suggests that patients unfortunately continue to decline. And the orthogonal class of medicines could be helpful here. So we're encouraged by the APOLLO-B data. We're looking to demonstrate outcomes. And we think that clinicians will be looking at the magnitude of effect as well as when separation occurs as well as whether there's evidence of disease stabilization, which is really important, looking at the totality of the data. So we're looking forward to report the results in late June and early July. I think there's nothing to add, Yvonne. You covered it. Yes. Thanks, Tazeen. Look, I think what we've seen in terms of mortality separation, if I call both for tafamidis and the acoramidis data that are under review is around month 18 is when we start to see the mortality separation. \n Look, we're encouraged by what we saw coming out of actually the original APOLLO data and then the APOLLO-B data, where we seem to see evidence again, in underpowered studies of separation on mortality occurring earlier, roughly month 9 or so. So we'll have to see in HELIOS-B if we're able to recapitulate those results in this larger-powered study. \n Again, I think it's going to be important to look at the totality of all the data that come out. Obviously, that will be one parameter. What is the mortality difference, when is it emerging, what about hospitalizations? And then again, what's happening in terms of disease stabilization? So we think all of those are going to be important parameters. But look, the early data that we've seen from APOLLO and particularly APOLLO-B, which is in the same patient population, gives us a lot of confidence that we should be able to see a substantial effect and potentially earlier separation. You were just talking about the NT-proBNP and the ECHO data. Look, I think we haven't mapped out exactly what will be the top line presentation. Obviously, it will be limited in terms of what we can -- we want to make sure that we -- we'll work with the investigators to make sure that there's a fulsome presentation. But you can imagine with a data set like this, that there will be a number of presentations to speak to the various aspects of the data. And certainly, BNP, echo, et cetera, Ritu, are important parameters that we'll be reporting on. Yes. Look, Jessica, I think I don't know that I can give you a lot more information other than to say, just have to, again, remember what the unmet need in this disease is that there are patients who currently -- a large number of patients, as Tolga has outlined, many of them are undiagnosed and untreated who have a steadily progressive disease that leads to irreversible damage and ultimately, patients pass away.\n And so what I think and as evidenced by -- as Yvonne highlighted, our EAP experience after APOLLO-B, and that was in the setting without any outcomes benefit being demonstrated in an IV drug, we rapidly enrolled a population of patients, many of whom were progressing on tafamidis, which was the only available therapy to them. So it highlights the unmet need. \n So we think that when we come forward with hopefully a positive HELIOS-B, showing an outcomes benefit, a mortality and hospitalization, along with these other differentiating factors that we've talked about and an orthogonal mechanism that rapidly knocks down the disease-causing protein of this disease, that we think that, that's going to address the key unmet needs for these patients. So we're looking forward to that, and we'll let the data speak for themselves. Yes. No, I think it's an interesting question, Kostas. I think in general, we look at them together, and we don't make a huge distinction here. I mean, I think part of the reason that composite endpoints like this were created was because hospitalizations tend to correlate very strongly with mortality events. \n And so -- and these are both clinically meaningful outcomes. And so we would expect that they will both go directionally in the same direction. That's what we've seen with other drugs, that's what we've seen throughout the cardiovascular disease area with lots of drugs and lots of different diseases, disease classes. So we would expect them to go in similar directions, Kostas. And I think the main thing is seeing a benefit, hopefully, in both of those, the trend in the right direction. Yes. Ellie, I think you raised a very important question and I think we've -- oftentimes, people have sort of classified these as 2 very distinct diseases, polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. When in fact, it's the same protein, when it's misfolded, it's causing both manifestations of the disease. And I would -- we've seen, for example, that in the hereditary population, when we looked in APOLLO and HELIOS-A that more than half of those patients had concomitant cardiomyopathy. And conversely, studies that have been done in cardiomyopathy patients suggest that a significant proportion of those patients may have polyneuropathy manifestations. \n So there are reports ranging from 15% to 30% or more of patients with wild-type ATTR or V122I, for example, which might have a primary cardiopathy manifestation have concomitant polyneuropathy. And certainly, we've seen that with the silencer class of drugs, particularly with patisiran and AMVUTTRA, that the magnitude of effect in polyneuropathy is really quite unsurpassed in terms of its clinical profile. And so it will be interesting to see, and Tolga can probably comment more about this, how clinicians will make decisions when they have patients who have multiple manifestations of this disease when they hopefully have multiple classes of therapies available. Yes. I mean, Gena, I don't know that there's a lot more that I can add in terms of the remarks I made and then Yvonne has reiterated in terms of the top line. We plan again to speak to the primary endpoint, which is now in the 2 populations, the secondaries across those populations, safety and we'll make some commentary around subgroups. But it's hard to give you anything more than that today. That's our plan. Yes. Tommie, I think what you're asking about is actually deeper cuts of the data. And certainly, this is going to be a very rich and large data set. So you can imagine that we'll be looking at this in a lot of different ways. But again, I guess the primary thing I would focus on is the fact that we will have a pretty robust data set both with the drug treated as a monotherapy and in patients who came in on tafamidis. And I think you have to ask yourself, why would someone who's on a drug decide to enroll in a 3-plus year clinical trial? And that really indicates that they will -- they are obviously not satisfied with how they're feeling or functioning at that moment in time. And so I think our combination group, where we do have a sizable proportion of patients, and we'll be able to report on that will help address part of your question. Yes. Thanks, Whitney, for your question about APP. It's a program that we're incredibly excited about. The data that we shared last year really suggested that we can have pretty profound impacts on the protein, on amyloid precursor protein as well as the downstream isoforms of AB40 and AB42 that are involved in both Alzheimer's disease and CAA. \n We have the Part B that's ongoing, and we hopefully will show ongoing data with regards to knockdown safety as well as imaging and biomarker data. So look for that as something we're also going to be initiating our CAA study soon. We're very excited about the opportunity. That's the second leading cause of hemorrhagic stroke, major -- with really no available treatments for these patients. And we think that lowering APP could be beneficial in that disease. We'll be kicking off a Phase II shortly. \n And we've also announced that we plan to kick off an Alzheimer's disease study at or around year-end of this year. So this is a really exciting program. And then it allows us then with our colleagues at Regeneron to move forward a number of other programs in the CNS space. So thanks for your question, lots of excitement there."

            "content": "Thanks, Christine, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. 2024 is off to a very strong start and shaping up to be an impactful year for Alnylam. Commercially, in the first quarter, we delivered robust product revenue growth for our 4 wholly-owned medicines, achieving $365 million in revenue or 32% year-over-year growth compared to Q1 2023. An important part of this was the continued momentum from our TTR franchise, which delivered 29% year-over-year growth versus Q1 2023. \n From a pipeline perspective, our zilebesiran hypertension program was a major highlight with positive results presented from the KARDIA-2 Phase II study, evaluating zilebesiran in combination with certain standard-of-care antihypertensives and the initiation of KARDIA-3. This program represents a significant opportunity to reimagine the treatment of hypertension, and could position Alnylam as the leader in treating cardiovascular disease. \n To that end, we're on the cusp of reporting top line results from the HELIOS-B Phase III study of vutrisiran in patients with TTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy. As we've highlighted previously, we have many reasons to be highly confident in a positive HELIOS-B outcome, including the encouraging data from the APOLLO-B study of vutrisiran, and we remain on track to report top line data from HELIOS-B in late June or early July, which, if positive, is expected to support the filing of an sNDA by the end of this year. \n With this progress, we continue to advance our Alnylam P5x25 goals, making Alnylam a top-tier biotech developing and commercializing transformative medicines for patients around the world with rare and prevalent diseases driven by a high-yielding pipeline of first and/or best-in-class product candidates from our organic product engine, all while delivering exceptional financial results. \n With that, let me now turn the call over to Tolga for a review of our commercial performance. Tolga? Thanks, Dave, for the question. Just as a reminder, HELIOS-B is an outcome study. And that's really what we need to deliver from the study. And it's quite clear in discussions with regulators, payers and physicians that if we're able to show a benefit on outcomes, this will be an important medicine.\n Clearly, we made some changes to the statistical plan, which we shared in some detail on our last call, and we're happy to reprise the rationale behind that. But at this point in time, I think the best way to look at this is delivering outcomes in the study will be the important results. And we also expect to see some other aspects of differentiation if we consider the results that we got out of HELIOS-B with respect to stabilization of disease. And so I think if we're able to deliver all this, we believe that will have a differentiated profile that will be an important contribution to managing the disease of these patients. \n Pushkal, is there anything you want to add? I also think it's important just to reflect on the magnitude of opportunity that we have in front of us as a company. I mean, Pushkal, touched on the richness of our pipeline, currently 15 programs in the clinic. We're looking at doubling that number by 2025. So as we look out at the opportunity set in front of us at Alnylam, we couldn't be more excited about being able to move forward the programs that we have. So we're obviously looking forward to a positive outcome from HELIOS-B and then really continuing to drive the pipeline that's in front of us. Yes, that's a great question. And clearly, I think a critical period of a study, as you say, is at the end of the study in this disease where patients continue to progress. So we do expect that, that's a period where we'll see most events. \n Pushkal, anything else you want to add? Yes. Some really good questions. So Tolga, maybe you want to talk about how we're looking at the cardiomyopathy market and how we're preparing for launch. I mean clearly, we're playing to win in this space. We're very excited about the opportunity of getting into this very rapidly growing category. Tolga? That's absolutely spot on, Tolga. And I think it's just instructive when you reflect on our expanded access program, where within a matter of a very short space of time, we max out on the program. I think that, again, is just an illustration the level of unmet medical need is in space and the fact that patients continue to progress on tafamidis and they're looking for alternative therapies. Pushkal, that's one for you. Yes, Ritu, I mean, yes, it's a good question. And I think we've been quite clear about how we're going to be handling the release. I mean, clearly, we're going to show kind of p-values for the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints. So we're going to provide some information on safety. Obviously, that's an important consideration. And we've said we will give some information with respect to subgroups. I know you'll be particularly interested in the tafamidis subgroup, but I think that's where we stand at this point in time. We're kind of obviously looking forward to being able to share the top line results. We're still on track for end of June, early July. And then, of course, we'll present fulsome data at a proximal medical congress. \n So stay tuned. We will be providing some additional color over and above p-values for the primary and secondary endpoints. But that's probably all we can say at this point in time. Your second question? Absolutely, Pushkal. I mean, we're clearly very interested in those parameters, but you kind of have to prioritize how many secondary endpoints you have with respect to managing alpha. And clearly, we're pretty confident about what we're going to be able to demonstrate for those additional end points. But they're going to be endpoints that we'll be able to share, but we really wanted to prioritize the very clinically relevant secondary endpoints, and we've discussed what those are with respect to disease progression, mortality as well as 6-minute walk test in KCCQ. Thanks for the question, Kostas. Pushkal, this one is for you. I think Pushkal first and then Tolga will follow up. I'll just take the pricing question. I mean I think it's really too early for us to talk about kind of specific kind of pricing approaches here, just to remind you, and Tolga touched on this in his introductory remarks. I mean, we will obviously bear in mind our patient access principles, and we'll be making sure that we have considerations around access and affordability to make sure that patients are going to be able to benefit from what we hope will be a medicine with a very robust profile. \n Pushkal, do you want to take the question on... That's a great question. I'm going to pass it on to Tolga. And I just want to kind of underscore how pleased I am actually with the commercial footprint that we've built. And I think if you look at our performance with respect to AMVUTTRA in patients with polyneuropathy, I think we're really demonstrating strong growth momentum here, and I'm just really pleased with how the commercial organization is focusing on meeting the needs of patients in this indication. I have no doubt that we'll do the same, assuming a positive HELIOS-B and being able to launch into the cardiomyopathy indication. \n But Tolga, you may have some specific comments on how we're thinking about launching. So what I think is going to be actually one of the most exciting categories."
