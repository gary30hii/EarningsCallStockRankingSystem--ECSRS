At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Alan Andreini. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Cindy. I would like to welcome you all to the Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Christopher, our Chief Financial Officer. We have posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you've not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only mode and is being webcast. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including FAD. The reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP numbers can be found in the earnings supplement. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements, by their nature, are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our quarterly report filed with the SEC. Now I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Thank you, Alan. To start, today I'm pleased to announce our 23rd dividend as a public company and our 38th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on March 23, based on the shareholder record date of March 12. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD, or funds available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2020 was $46.2 million compared to Q3 2020 of $58.6 million and Q4 2019 of $234 million. On a normalized basis, excluding the gains or losses from the sales, Q4 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $44.3 million compared to $59.7 million in Q3 2020 and $92.1 million in Q4 2019. FAD was $54.2 million in Q4 2020 versus $39.9 million in Q3 2020 and $288.6 in Q4 2019. On a normalized basis, excluding sale proceeds and nonrecurring items, Q4 2020 FAD was $35.7 million compared to $23.9 million in Q3 2020 and $58.1 million in Q4 2019. During the fourth quarter the $54.2 million FAD number was comprised of $89.9 million from our aviation leasing business, negative $1.8 million from our infrastructure business and negative $33.9 million from corporate and other. Now let's look at all of 2020 versus all of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 was $243.3 million versus $503.4 million in 2019. Normalized FAD in 2020 $147.9 million versus $192.4 million in 2019. And by far, the dramatic reductions in passenger air travel due to COVID-19 drove the negative financial impact to 2020.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Joe. Cindy, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.  And your first question comes from Josh Sullivan with Benchmark & Company.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey, good morning. And thank you for taking the questions here. I'm wondering if we could start off just with some color on how airline customers are responding to the FAA certification of the PMA engine parts? Has it been as you expected? You know, what is the inbound inquiries? Like since the approval, and I guess, you\u2019ve seen any customers you didn't think maybe you might see?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, I think the response has been even better than we expected. We've known - you know, PMA has been in use for a long time by many airlines. But I think the combination of this being one of the largest engine markets, the largest engine market in the world. And also the emphasis that all the airlines have now on cost savings, maintenance expenses, the third largest P&L category for an airline after fuel and labor. So there's tremendous focus and the OEMs continue to raise parts prices every year, including this year, when you have a tremendous downturn. So you're either very, very focused on that. And PMA is a solution that we haven\u2019t - I don't think we've found anybody that wasn't interested in hearing about it. So - and there has been a lot of inbound inquiry. And then getting the approval is a big step just because it's now real products shipped this week, one to an airline and one to one set - sets to us. So they're out there now. And there'll be more to come. So I think that it's been a great reception and couldn't ask for, you know, sort of a better backdrop.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. And then just as you mentioned, kind of more to come, what do you think the timeline looks like for any additional parts to make it through the FAA? You know, do you think getting this first one over the line improves the timeline to maybe get those approved? Or just what are you thinking about on those other parts?\nJoseph Adams: I think it will, it should pave the way and I think it should get easier. The second part, we expect to have approval in the second quarter. So right behind it. And then there are three additional parts that, you know, we didn't start work on until 2019. So we're expecting 2022. But there's potential for that to move up a little bit, given you know, that there will be a sort of a pattern, sort of a more paved path to getting there.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. And then just one last one, on the air sterilization product you just mentioned for the aviation market. Can you just expand on that opportunity? Is that an original part, is that a PMA part? Just some color on that would be great.\nJoseph Adams: It's an original part. And it's been - it's actually been installed in some business jets and some commercial jets, but not very widely. And it has been proven to be extremely effective and save as much as 2% on fuel. So probably something that could, you know, have wide application. But it hasn't - I think that what has been missing is the commercial development around that, and so that's I think, where we can add value. And that's what we're hoping to do.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. Thank you for the time\u2026\nJoseph Adams: One thing, about HEPA filters are effective, but HEPA filters effectively trap germs and viruses and then they have to be removed. And that's by - that sort of dangerous hazardous waste when it comes off the airplane. This product actually destroys them. So they're no longer viable. And there's a tremendous savings there as well in terms of the handling.\nJosh Sullivan: Great. Thank you for the time.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Guiliano Bologna with Compass Point.\nGuiliano Bologna: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess starting out on the infrastructure side to pivot a little bit. You obviously have Repauno going live and you also have Jefferson with the new pipelines  service under the river to Exxon. And you also have the power plant coming online. Is there a sense of kind of what EBITDA do you  segment as a whole to generate in 2021? And how that could ramp throughout the year?\nScott Christopher: Yes, I would say $50 million, $60 million of EBITDA this year from the three you mentioned, and the largest being Jefferson, followed by Repauno and then Long Ridge, just because Long Ridge, we will not have a lot of history - it's not a lot of time once it comes on, and we own 50% of that, so in that order. And obviously, it's more back end-loaded. So - but I think that's a reasonable goal. And obviously, then next year, they'll all be in service, you know, full year, which would be better. And then we've got expansion projects, numerous ones that could add substantial to that.\nGuiliano Bologna: That makes sense. And thinking about Jefferson, more specifically, I think the prior discussion was - was you might go and get that into a range of about $70 million to $80 million for the annualized EBITDA. Going from there, what kind of other projects could you explore for Jefferson and kind of what \u2013 representing something what the magnitude could be?\nJoseph Adams: Yeah, there's a long list of projects. You know, I think, the goal was always once you get the pipeline connectivity, then you have many opportunities to add business. And, you know, that's evident with Exxon six pipelines, only one of which today is being used. And so there's five other ones that could - which could include crude, could include refined products, export, could include intermediates, vacuum, gas oils. We sold jet fuel for them at one point before the COVID crisis. So there's a range - there's a long list of, you know, opportunities that we're in discussions on and pursuing just with them. And then there's, I mentioned, the Canadian market is picking up and the Utah markets for crude by rail, there's a DRU that's going to come online this summer, which is - recovery in it, which means that crude will always move by rail. And so we've seen more DRU on the horizon, and that's very good for the Motiva crude movement opportunities. And then we have some Canadian producers that are also in the terminal and have looked at expansion. So those are probably the big three customer groups - groupings and there's an active list with all of them, and it keeps usually every time you meet it ends up - you end up adding to the list instead of subtracting.\nGuiliano Bologna: That\u2019s great. And I am just making sure, from EBITDA range perspective, that the power plant is supposed to generate roughly $120 million a year before any data centers, and you own half of that, so about 60. Then you have Jefferson at 70 to 80. And then Repauno is kind of in the 10 to 15 range if I remember correctly?\nJoseph Adams: Yeah, 15.\nGuiliano Bologna: That sounds good. I really appreciate the time. And I'll jump back into queue.\nJoseph Adams: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. James on the Chris. I wanted to ask about the EBITDA walk you went through in kind of $50 million to $80 million, you called out from the JV, acknowledging that, but like looking a bit further out, what is that growth look like in 2022 and beyond frankly, like essentially, how - what can that grow to like, how do you think about market share, and that ability to sort of pick it up over time, essentially, year-on-year, I know, I think you might not have the most clarity to, but just kind of wanted to understand how you think about the growth of that business?\nScott Christopher: Sure. So I think if you take - if you look ahead to 2022 and your starting point and say roughly $1.8 billion  you\u2019ve invested in equipment that actually generate $450 million of EBITDA, and then on top of that, I think the last time we discussed the, sort of the opportunity from both the parts business, as well as managing third-party fleets, adding an incremental $100 million to that number. And so I would say $550 million to $600 million for 2022 is - it may sound a little aspirational, but I do think it's reasonable, it's a reasonable goal.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And within that - in the walk within that 50 to 80, what sort of puts you at the higher end of that range or is the lower end, just a faster recovery? Or is it some uncertainty about how much growth you can get initially, just kind of wanted to understand what like we should be watching for across the years to understand the number around that?\nScott Christopher: I'm sorry, I wasn't sure - what's the 50 to 80?\nUnidentified Analyst: I believe in your walk you had at the bottom there was essentially - the last item was essentially a range in the EBITDA walk, if I'm not mistaken. I think just  that might not have been the case, but just wanted to know what will be putting you at the low end versus the high end of it?\nScott Christopher: Yeah, so it wasn't actually a range, there was - it was a build up and starting with the existing portfolio, producing $320 million this year. And then adding 80 to that from new investments of approximately $300 million of new investments, generating $80 million this year. And that, obviously - that's only three quarters of the year, because most of those are closed or we should be closing soon. And then on top of that $50 million from the joint ventures and partnerships that we've had. So that's the 320 plus 80 plus 50, is a fourth \nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then one other question, you've done a great job of sort of like addressing, or making FTAI basically, a better investment over time, moving some of the like  building out a services business. As you like look forward, are there any specific maybe structural issues to FTAI as a unit that you think might make sense to address, that could unlock any value? Or is it like, how are you thinking about sort of the company structure longer term, if at all?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, we have talked about it. And we do realize that being a publicly traded partnership, and having Q - K-1is a negative, and some investors just want to look at - well, look at - take you out of the universe. And in particular, some of the index funds do that. So the solution to that is for us to separate, you have to create two companies potentially spin-off infrastructure. And in addition to getting rid of K-1s, you\u2019d create more of a pure-play for two stocks, as opposed to, you know, combining them. So we think that, that's an objective that we have that and sort of moving up the priority list we don't have a specific timeline on that. But it's something we believe will add value, create value and make the story simpler.\nChris Wetherbee: Yeah, Joe. Its Chris Wetherbee. I just jumped on. I apologize for hopping on here. But I was able to join that here. As a follow up to that, do you think that the businesses are at size or is there a size, fees, or scale on the infrastructure that you would need to get you to be able to do that?\nJoseph Adams: We think it's very close. We'd always sort of said arbitrarily, we'd like each company to have at least a $1 billion market cap, we don't want to be too small. And today, we can achieve that. And we think that there's some interesting things on the horizon that we'll add on the infrastructure side, that will add to that. So yeah, I think we're very close, if not there.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. That's super helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: Thanks. And good morning. I wanted to start with a question on the power plant at Long Ridge, just wanted to clarify in August, when it's up and running, will it be generating $120 million of EBITDA kind of day one when we start? And then secondly, I know you've talked about potentially divesting your 50% ownership in that - in the power plant. Where are you in terms of that thought process? And what are the big swing factors that you have in mind, as you contemplate what to do?\nScott Christopher: Yes. So part of the income from the power plan is a payment for capacity, which PJM has a capacity payment, and I believe it's about $20 to $25 million a year. And I don't think that we would be booking that right away. Very likely that comes in the auction, first auction, which I think will be in this 2022 period. So there will be a little bit of a lag on the - getting to a $120 million right away. In terms of selling it. You know, I would say not much has transpired since the last time we spoke. I think we're still thinking about it. We do - it does feel like we have more upside with that that, and then we would have said previously, this hydrogen initiative, and, you know, the data center opportunities are both very real and would provide, I think, substantial upside. And so we wouldn't do anything until we felt like we've, you know, at least, you know, gotten those to a point where we can, you know, we can - the value is obvious.\nJustin Long: Okay, that's helpful. And secondly, the breakdown on your expectations for aviation EBITDA was helpful. Going back to one of your answers to the 2022 question a moment ago, I think you said, you expect around $100 million from the parts and service and partnership pieces. Anyway, you could kind of break that down a little bit more for us and provide some more color around the components of that $100 million as we get into 2022?\nScott Christopher: Yes, I would say it's probably equally divided between the part of business with AAR, the Chromalloy joint venture and Lockheed Martin, if you took a third, a third, a third of that you would be pretty close.\nJustin Long: Okay, perfect. That's helpful. I appreciate the time.\nScott Christopher: Yes. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Hey, great. Good morning, Joe. Most questions have been asked. I want to follow up just on kind of the last conversation on aviation and the outlook and love to maybe just dig in a little bit around kind of expectations for maybe some additional large scale asset purchases, and then kind of what the market conditions are right now, obviously, you had a big benefit in 2020, given the backdrop. To the extent, you know, the backdrop is improving in the coming quarters, how is that shaping kind of the airline level kind of appetite to do deals? And what are you guys seeing in the market are expecting over the next few quarters in terms of just larger kind of maybe idiosyncratic opportunities?\nJoseph Adams: Yeah, so great question. And you know, I think the deals are there, I think there are some larger transactions that we've been working on and that we see coming that I think are, you know, write down the sweet spot for us. And we\u2019re really focused, laser-focused on buying CFM56 engines, and doing that by buying either A320s or 727s and then having the ability to either keep the airframe or scrap the airframe. And so I think that's our - that's our sweet spot. And I think the difficulty, you know, we've talked about this before, and the deals are taking longer, for two reasons. One is, a lot of airlines have been getting money from governments. And so you get financial assistance from the government, but that comes with a cost, which is now you have a government partner. So the velocity of transacting, you know, slows down dramatically when you get a government in the mix. So that's been a bit of a delay. And then the second thing we've heard from people is, no one really wants to sell, right now, if you can avoid it, it's - everyone knows, this is probably the worst market timing. So people are kind of a little bit dragging their feet saying, well, it's going to get better. So I should slow down a little bit. And I won't look like, you know, the biggest fool. So I think that there's some of - there's some of both of those things there. But I do think the macro is the airlines need money, and they're going to need money, it be negative cash flow this year in 2021. And they're tapping every source of capital. And so one of the sources of capital is selling some of your fleet. So I do think the deals are there. But the reason I mentioned that just - it's a little frustrating and slow, but I think we're getting there.\nDevin Ryan: Appreciate that, Joe. And I guess, just follow up within that. I mean, as the event enter repair ramps, you know, can you kind of change your bid in the market, if you will, I mean, obviously, your return profile goes up quite a bit with kind of the new capabilities in the vertical integration. So is that something that you're looking to do or is it more that you just will now be assuming  prior returns with, you know, the additional capabilities?\nJoseph Adams: Well, we\u2019ll be competitive for deals that we want to win, so we're not fixed on a specific price because of the market moves, as you said, the market moves and market moves, and we have a lot of savings and other people can't generate. So we'll be competitive. And I haven't - we haven't felt like we've lost anything because we were rigid on our price. So I think it's really just more of the other factors that have caused deals to just, you know, languish a little.\nDevin Ryan: Yeah. Okay, terrific. If I can, just a quick follow up  up here. First off, congratulations on the completion of the cross channel pipeline, with Exxon, you know, just a lot of activity right now, at Jefferson. And so great to get the outlook there and hear about some of the additional developments. How are you guys thinking about financing at the asset level, I guess, there's a lot of additional projects coming on. And so just love to think about the capacity for those? And also just how you're structuring those with partners in terms I guess, just we\u2019re thinking about modeling and cost outlay, et cetera?\nJoseph Adams: Yeah, so it's a great question. And, I mean, we did a tax exempt financing at Jefferson, I guess it was two years ago. Now, time flies, but those bonds are trading in the mid twos in terms of interest rate, yield. So we're looking at doing another tax exempt bond offering at Jefferson. For two things, one would be to expand the storage capacity for about - if we do a $250 million deal, roughly half would be for expansion. And then the other half would be - come back up to FTAI. So we take some investment out of Jefferson, and have it as liquidity for FTAI. So very low cost financing availability, and two good uses of proceeds in my mind.\nDevin Ryan: Got it. Very interesting. Okay. Well, thank you. Appreciate it.\nJoseph Adams: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ari Rosa with Bank of America.\nAri Rosa: Great. Hey, good morning, Joe. And good morning, Alan. So, you know, I wanted to ask, just stepping back and looking at the aviation market, maybe you could talk about kind of where the supply demand picture looks like in terms of the amount of idle equipment that still sitting on the sidelines, you know, for the market as a whole. And thinking about, and I know, you kind of touched on this in one of the earlier questions, but just thinking about how the aviation leads to business, maybe changes, kind of a post-COVID world, obviously, a lot of people have been scarred. You know, do you think there are structural changes that have come down the pipeline, in terms of how airlines think about leasing assets? And maybe how FTAI is positioned to capitalize on that?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. Great question. I think two interesting statistics I heard, one is that there's now more airlines that are startups, more new airlines in the last 12 months than airlines that have gone out of business. So it's kind of interesting to think about that. Even in this market there's no shortage of people that are willing to invest in airlines, which is somewhat amazing, given the you know, what's happened. And you could argue that that's, you know, that's been horrible use of money. But I've never seen a period in my career when there weren't people that wanted to invest in airlines. So it's incredible. And maybe this is a great time to start an airline because you can get everything cheaper. So I think there's that and then quite a few airlines again recently, I've been hearing in saying that they expect third quarter flying activity to be equal to or higher than 2019. So there's another sort of - as a matter of a rebound that's a pretty stunning fact too. But there is tremendous pent-up demand. I think in Europe, when Boris Johnson announced the reopening plan in UK, the bookings went up, you know, 3% to 500%. And people were, you know, grabbing their flights to Spain and Greece from summer so. So I think there's - I think you'll see the airlines come back pretty quickly and there will be - I don't I don't know how long people have short memories, but this one feels like that could happen again. In terms of structural, you know, the airline business is incredibly risky. So capital is expensive, and I think everybody is expecting leasing to be more of a capital riders. I think some of the big leasing companies have said it's clearly north of 50% now and going up because if you try to, you know, start an airline, why buy equipment, just lease it, so - and you have a lower cost of capital by the leasing company. So I think that benefits. And then our pitch really is, you know, let us manage your engines, we don't need to manage an engine shop visit, when we can do it more efficiently, cheaper, and we could save airline capital. So you don't have to put $5 million into a shop visit or even worse you send your engine in for a shop visit. And you get a shock, though, where you thought it was going to cost $4 million and ends up costing $8 million. So we have a good pitch that I think will resonate as well in terms of capital efficiency and cost savings.\nAri Rosa: That that's a great answer, Joe. And thank you for the color on that. So I wanted to turn to Jefferson, quickly, obviously, there are a lot of balls in the air at Jefferson. And as we think about the different revenue sources, obviously, it looks like the narrative around crude by rail is maybe picking up some steam. Obviously, now pipeline connectivity is, you know, has a lot of potential. Obviously, storage has been always an interesting piece of the story. Maybe you can think about, the total revenue of Jefferson as a percent of revenue, how you think about each of those buckets end up materializing. And then additionally, if you could give maybe a little bit of color, to the extent possible, around what the economics look like, for that pipeline arrangement with Exxon, you know, how exactly is it that FTAI is getting paid and what are the economics around that look like in terms of EBITDA margins or something of that sort?\nJoseph Adams: So, on the first question, I wouldn't - I mean, I would envision that we would have probably about two thirds of our revenue at Jefferson from crude and about one third from refined products. And then another goal we have is to also add sustainable fuel to the mix at some point. So we had a number of projects looking at that. But figure that, you know, two thirds crude and one third refine products. In terms of the pipeline economics, it's good, because short pipelines don't cost a lot of money, and if you lose a lot of volume through it, its an incredibly high return. So that's why we put, you know, when we were deciding how many pipes to build, and the cost of building six is not much more than the cost of building one. I mean, realistically, it's like, if you built a house, you would definitely want to put more conduit in the wall because you don't want to reopen it. So we built six, and we're only using one right now. And it's enough, we're getting a good return off one. So you can imagine what the return would be if we had product flowing on all of them.\nAri Rosa: Got it. Okay, that's terrific color. And thanks for the time.\nJoseph Adams: There's just a tariff, you get paid, you know, a cents per barrel tariff for the move. That's all, it's very simple.\nAri Rosa: Got it. And can you give any color around what the EBITDA margin looks like for that move to FTAI?\nJoseph Adams: Well, you've got - I mean, on a pipe, you have almost no costs? I mean, it's once you've built it, the operating costs are de minimis.\nAri Rosa: Yeah. Okay. Make sense.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski': Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So Joe, just want to clarify the $450 million of EBITDA explication in aviation and 50 to 60 for infrastructure that's full year 2021? Or is that like, exit run rate expectation?\nJoseph Adams: No, that's 2021, full year.\nBrandon Oglenski': Okay, I appreciate that. And, you know, at the beginning of call, you did talk about utilization assumptions. Could we come back to that, the engine and the fleet portfolio?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, for the first half of this 2021 for engine utilization, I said 60% to 70%. We're probably beginning the year around 60%. And I expect that to trend up in the second quarter. And then for the second half of the year, we believe it will be 70% to 80% utilization. We sort of - I think the highest utilization we ever had was about 85%. And it's usually in the third quarter, that's when you know everyone's flat out. So that's what's underpinning that as the return assumption. And for the aircraft fleet, it should be in the low 90s utilization or even maybe higher market if that market picks up. But it's easier to lease an engine than an airframe today.\nBrandon Oglenski': Okay. I appreciate that. And then when you provided the $50 million, you know from the PMA and the Lockheed Martin and AAR partnerships, does that includes savings that you're expecting on the current lease book? Or is that incremental EBITDA from third-party sales and activities, you know, within these ventures?\nJoseph Adams: Incremental EBITDA, that's not - does not include any savings for our own fleet. As I mentioned, we've already started buying PMA this week.\nBrandon Oglenski': Okay, appreciate that. And then last one, for me, it does look like based on this potential aircraft deal for $300 million, that you'll need incremental funding this year of about $200 to $300 million. I think you talked a little bit about some potential bond offerings at Jefferson, but is that - what you're looking at this year?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. And I think we did. If we get Jefferson as a source of capital of $125 million, we have an undrawn revolver of 250 million. So we have adequate funds today to cover all of that. And we could also access, the preferred markets are open again, preferreds have come back to 25. So that's where they were issued. So that's another possibility. As we look at the balance sheet, so. So lots of - and that's without doing anything else that would be cash generative, or selling anything.\nBrandon Oglenski': Okay. Thank you, Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Salmon with Wolfe Research.\nRob Salmon: Hey, good morning, Joe. And thanks for taking the question. I guess to piggyback on the last line of questions. Clearly that the module factories is going to be very transformative for FTAI. Can you remind us just as I think about your engine portfolio, what percentage of engines are CFM56 represents today?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. I think I have that.\nRob Salmon: As you're, as you're digging that number. When we think about kind of the Lockheed Martin module factory, is this something you're just going to use with the CFM56 engine? Or can you use it with the entire FTAI portfolio?\nJoseph Adams: Yeah, so it's really, the Lockheed Martin is really focused on the CFM engine, CFM56. There's a number of maintenance shops, they tend to specialize by engine type. And so for the CF680 and the , we probably will use other shops, that's not a strength of Lockheed Martin. So I think it's really going to be focused on the CFM56 market. In terms of narrowbody engines, it's about half the fleet, there's 160 engines right now CFM. And it's roughly half of our, you know, portfolio value. As I mentioned, there\u2019s $300 million of new investments, almost all of that and substantial amount that is going to be CFM engines adding to that. So I expect to be over 200 engines by the end of this year for CFM56. And then 200 engines is 1% of the total world fleet of 22,000. So it's really still quite small. So we could see growth beyond that for many years in terms of adding to that if we decide to.\nRob Salmon: Absolutely. If I'm using the 160 that would imply assuming engines going in for a shop visit every five years, about 32 visits, as you get to 200, that would be 40. It's still well below the facilities throughput potential, which I believe is around 70 aircraft so or engines, can you give us a little more\u2026\nJoseph Adams: It's actually a lot bigger than that it's about 300 engines a year. And we're assuming, you know, our needs are going to be probably in the 50 to 60 range in the near term.\nRob Salmon: And how quickly do you think you'll - you can build up to getting to that that 300 engines and as you get to that max throughput, how should we think about the sensitivity for FTAI from an earnings perspective?\nJoseph Adams: Well, I think that we could be at 300 engines next year. So that feels doable. And that's 60 shop visits a year. And if we save $2 million per shop visit, that's $120 million in savings for our own fleet, just some shop visits. And that should show up, if you assume if that $120 million is amortized over three or four years, that's $30 million to $40 million a year there.\nRob Salmon: Yeah, and clearly, you wouldn't have to get much of it back to the customer, which just means you're also going to be able to buy additional engine and improve the returns.\nJoseph Adams: Right. I mean, that was one of the revelation when we talk about - you know, when we talk about PMA, the manufacturers always say, well, it's not going to be widely used, it's not a big factor, because the residual values, you know, affected. But if you're leasing engines, which is what we do, nobody who leases an engine cares if there's PMA in the engine, they care if it's, you know, reliable, and it's got hours and cycles on it. So there's no discount, given on lease rate. So we have the ability to effectively, you know, keep that savings for ourselves.\nRob Salmon: Got it. I guess, but before I turn it over to someone else, Joe, can you give us you know, clue, there's a lot of opportunities at Jefferson, you've announced six pipelines, one you've already using to move, there's another that's going to be - that you'd kind of put kind of some throughput around on a barrel per day, how should I think about the remaining four? And how quickly are you expecting those to be to be consumed to Exxon, as we're thinking about the Jefferson EBITDA that you had quoted for the year?\nJoseph Adams: Well, I think that opportunities are multiple. As I mentioned, we have a discussion ongoing about using a couple of those pipes for crude. So inbound crude into the Exxon refineries is an opportunity that we're talking about, and then refined products as well. So for the balance, I would hope that we would be utilizing probably two or three of those this year.\nRob Salmon: Got it. Appreciate the color.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Greg Lewis with BTIG.\nGreg Lewis: Yes, hi. Thank you, and good morning, everybody. I guess I just had a couple quick ones. One, as we think about the pipeline in aviation, as you talked about, as I think about those LOIs and I guess I can kind of back into it as I think about earnings guide ramp, but \u2013 like is there any way to kind of think about, is it kind of like parceling out that maybe in first half versus a second half versus longer, like, how we should think about the, you know, some of that turning into investment?\nJoseph Adams: Yeah, I expect very little in Q1. So it's really is going off a bit balance for the year and I would say Q3, and Q4 will be higher than Q2.\nGreg Lewis: Perfect. Okay. Thank you. And then just real quick, on the, you know, you touched a lot about potential opportunities on the infrastructure side, it seems like, you know, you're looking a lot at renewable gas and you mentioned bio diesel, as we think about that, are these projects something that are, you know, I'm realizing that they're in development stage, are these more like smaller scale pilot projects, where we're proving our concepts  that was concepts that, you know, hey, there's, you know, once we decide to FID  we can move forward with these things, maybe later this year or even next year?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, I would - I mean, there's one that's potentially larger than the rest, but I think most of them are relatively small scale initially, to develop the products and the economics are pretty attractive. So it's not really, you know, doing something that's below market in terms of returns. But I think initially the scale of most of these is pretty small with the goal that if you prove it out, then you can expand it.\nGreg Lewis: Okay. And I'm assuming that there's going to be partners in all of these?\nJoseph Adams: Yes.\nGreg Lewis: Okay. Thanks. Thank you very much for the time guys. Have a great day.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Frank Galanti with Stifel.\nFrank Galanti: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask about the managing other airline engines, first, does that $50 million EBITDA contribution from Chromalloy or Lockheed include managing other people's engines? And then I guess you'd mentioned when somebody leases an engine, right, they don't care if PMA parts are in there, but airlines will have to own those parts. So, I guess the question is around how does a transaction like that actually work? Do they - will they care of that PMA part in it if they own it? And then what are the economics around that from an FTAI perspective?\nJoseph Adams: So, no, I mean, airlines will be putting PMA and have been for years PMA into their own engines. It's a sort of a misnomer that you know, there's some residual value factors, the results  But airlines buy PMA directly today. They buy a lot of PMA from HEICO, they buy from Chromalloy, there's PMA, all the major airlines, particularly ones that operate their own shop use PMA. So it is already an airline, that's purchased the first product so. So there's no concern there with most airlines. If you stick with a OEM program, then you won't be using PMA. But that's a sort of a decision that each airline makes. But you don't need a lot of market share and PMA to make the math work. And so it can be peaceful coexistence. And that if your goal is to have 10% market share, the OEM by definition still has 90%. And it's not material. There is some assumption on, in the $50 million that we have an airline that we can manage their fleets and we have several proposals out right now. It's I would say for this year, it should be a small contributor to that number. But the goal is to make that a big contributor. And you know, when we have any particular, you know, win on that we will certainly communicate that, but I think that the - we have a framework and we have initiatives, and we have good dialogue going on that front. So I'm hopeful.\nFrank Galanti: Okay, that's super helpful. And then, I guess the second question I have, and this might be a little bit of an inside baseball. But you - around the engine utilization assumptions, you said you\u2019d start the year, hopefully at 60%, and then ramp gradually 60%, 70% in the first half, 70%, 80% in the second half. But I guess you mentioned in the prepared remarks that for maintenance revenue it was going to remain relatively flat, maybe a little up as airlines aren't flying as much as they had been. How does that utilization turn into maintenance revenue? Is that 70%, 80% assuming that people will actually use the engines when they lease?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, yes. So it's not an assumption that it's on-lease, but sitting in a warehouse, it's actually flying.\nFrank Galanti: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then I guess, a smaller question, on the Jefferson pipelines, you have the \u2013 can give us the capacity of those pipes, as I think in the press release, it said 168,000 for one for diesel, 150 for another for gasoline, and there should be four additional pipes going to Exxon, one to Motiva, one to Cushing, what are those capacities?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, so the one to Motiva is the largest that will be almost 300,000 barrels a day total capacity. So it's a big pipe. The inbound from payne line  initially is 40,000 barrels a day but it can be expanded up to 60. And then the six pipe stacks on varying capacities but if you assumed 150,000 barrels a day for each one of them that was - it's pretty close. So some are a little bit less and some are a little bit more, but 150,000 is a good number for each one of those.\nFrank Galanti: Okay, great. Super helpful. Thanks so much.\nJoseph Adams: Which is a lot of capacity.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Alan Andreini.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Cindy. And thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q1.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you so much for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joseph Adams",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan. To start, today I'm pleased to announce our 23rd dividend as a public company and our 38th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on March 23, based on the shareholder record date of March 12. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD, or funds available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2020 was $46.2 million compared to Q3 2020 of $58.6 million and Q4 2019 of $234 million. On a normalized basis, excluding the gains or losses from the sales, Q4 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $44.3 million compared to $59.7 million in Q3 2020 and $92.1 million in Q4 2019. FAD was $54.2 million in Q4 2020 versus $39.9 million in Q3 2020 and $288.6 in Q4 2019. On a normalized basis, excluding sale proceeds and nonrecurring items, Q4 2020 FAD was $35.7 million compared to $23.9 million in Q3 2020 and $58.1 million in Q4 2019. During the fourth quarter the $54.2 million FAD number was comprised of $89.9 million from our aviation leasing business, negative $1.8 million from our infrastructure business and negative $33.9 million from corporate and other. Now let's look at all of 2020 versus all of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 was $243.3 million versus $503.4 million in 2019. Normalized FAD in 2020 $147.9 million versus $192.4 million in 2019. And by far, the dramatic reductions in passenger air travel due to COVID-19 drove the negative financial impact to 2020. Yes, I think the response has been even better than we expected. We've known - you know, PMA has been in use for a long time by many airlines. But I think the combination of this being one of the largest engine markets, the largest engine market in the world. And also the emphasis that all the airlines have now on cost savings, maintenance expenses, the third largest P&L category for an airline after fuel and labor. So there's tremendous focus and the OEMs continue to raise parts prices every year, including this year, when you have a tremendous downturn. So you're either very, very focused on that. And PMA is a solution that we haven't - I don't think we've found anybody that wasn't interested in hearing about it. So - and there has been a lot of inbound inquiry. And then getting the approval is a big step just because it's now real products shipped this week, one to an airline and one to one set - sets to us. So they're out there now. And there'll be more to come. So I think that it's been a great reception and couldn't ask for, you know, sort of a better backdrop. I think it will, it should pave the way and I think it should get easier. The second part, we expect to have approval in the second quarter. So right behind it. And then there are three additional parts that, you know, we didn't start work on until 2019. So we're expecting 2022. But there's potential for that to move up a little bit, given you know, that there will be a sort of a pattern, sort of a more paved path to getting there. It's an original part. And it's been - it's actually been installed in some business jets and some commercial jets, but not very widely. And it has been proven to be extremely effective and save as much as 2% on fuel. So probably something that could, you know, have wide application. But it hasn't - I think that what has been missing is the commercial development around that, and so that's I think, where we can add value. And that's what we're hoping to do. One thing, about HEPA filters are effective, but HEPA filters effectively trap germs and viruses and then they have to be removed. And that's by - that sort of dangerous hazardous waste when it comes off the airplane. This product actually destroys them. So they're no longer viable. And there's a tremendous savings there as well in terms of the handling. Thanks. Yeah, there's a long list of projects. You know, I think, the goal was always once you get the pipeline connectivity, then you have many opportunities to add business. And, you know, that's evident with Exxon six pipelines, only one of which today is being used. And so there's five other ones that could - which could include crude, could include refined products, export, could include intermediates, vacuum, gas oils. We sold jet fuel for them at one point before the COVID crisis. So there's a range - there's a long list of, you know, opportunities that we're in discussions on and pursuing just with them. And then there's, I mentioned, the Canadian market is picking up and the Utah markets for crude by rail, there's a DRU that's going to come online this summer, which is - recovery in it, which means that crude will always move by rail. And so we've seen more DRU on the horizon, and that's very good for the Motiva crude movement opportunities. And then we have some Canadian producers that are also in the terminal and have looked at expansion. So those are probably the big three customer groups - groupings and there's an active list with all of them, and it keeps usually every time you meet it ends up - you end up adding to the list instead of subtracting. Yeah, 15. Thank you. Yes, we have talked about it. And we do realize that being a publicly traded partnership, and having Q - K-1is a negative, and some investors just want to look at - well, look at - take you out of the universe. And in particular, some of the index funds do that. So the solution to that is for us to separate, you have to create two companies potentially spin-off infrastructure. And in addition to getting rid of K-1s, you'd create more of a pure-play for two stocks, as opposed to, you know, combining them. So we think that, that's an objective that we have that and sort of moving up the priority list we don't have a specific timeline on that. But it's something we believe will add value, create value and make the story simpler. We think it's very close. We'd always sort of said arbitrarily, we'd like each company to have at least a $1 billion market cap, we don't want to be too small. And today, we can achieve that. And we think that there's some interesting things on the horizon that we'll add on the infrastructure side, that will add to that. So yeah, I think we're very close, if not there. Yeah, so great question. And you know, I think the deals are there, I think there are some larger transactions that we've been working on and that we see coming that I think are, you know, write down the sweet spot for us. And we're really focused, laser-focused on buying CFM56 engines, and doing that by buying either A320s or 727s and then having the ability to either keep the airframe or scrap the airframe. And so I think that's our - that's our sweet spot. And I think the difficulty, you know, we've talked about this before, and the deals are taking longer, for two reasons. One is, a lot of airlines have been getting money from governments. And so you get financial assistance from the government, but that comes with a cost, which is now you have a government partner. So the velocity of transacting, you know, slows down dramatically when you get a government in the mix. So that's been a bit of a delay. And then the second thing we've heard from people is, no one really wants to sell, right now, if you can avoid it, it's - everyone knows, this is probably the worst market timing. So people are kind of a little bit dragging their feet saying, well, it's going to get better. So I should slow down a little bit. And I won't look like, you know, the biggest fool. So I think that there's some of - there's some of both of those things there. But I do think the macro is the airlines need money, and they're going to need money, it be negative cash flow this year in 2021. And they're tapping every source of capital. And so one of the sources of capital is selling some of your fleet. So I do think the deals are there. But the reason I mentioned that just - it's a little frustrating and slow, but I think we're getting there. Well, we'll be competitive for deals that we want to win, so we're not fixed on a specific price because of the market moves, as you said, the market moves and market moves, and we have a lot of savings and other people can't generate. So we'll be competitive. And I haven't - we haven't felt like we've lost anything because we were rigid on our price. So I think it's really just more of the other factors that have caused deals to just, you know, languish a little. Yeah, so it's a great question. And, I mean, we did a tax exempt financing at Jefferson, I guess it was two years ago. Now, time flies, but those bonds are trading in the mid twos in terms of interest rate, yield. So we're looking at doing another tax exempt bond offering at Jefferson. For two things, one would be to expand the storage capacity for about - if we do a $250 million deal, roughly half would be for expansion. And then the other half would be - come back up to FTAI. So we take some investment out of Jefferson, and have it as liquidity for FTAI. So very low cost financing availability, and two good uses of proceeds in my mind. Yes. Yes. Great question. I think two interesting statistics I heard, one is that there's now more airlines that are startups, more new airlines in the last 12 months than airlines that have gone out of business. So it's kind of interesting to think about that. Even in this market there's no shortage of people that are willing to invest in airlines, which is somewhat amazing, given the you know, what's happened. And you could argue that that's, you know, that's been horrible use of money. But I've never seen a period in my career when there weren't people that wanted to invest in airlines. So it's incredible. And maybe this is a great time to start an airline because you can get everything cheaper. So I think there's that and then quite a few airlines again recently, I've been hearing in saying that they expect third quarter flying activity to be equal to or higher than 2019. So there's another sort of - as a matter of a rebound that's a pretty stunning fact too. But there is tremendous pent-up demand. I think in Europe, when Boris Johnson announced the reopening plan in UK, the bookings went up, you know, 3% to 500%. And people were, you know, grabbing their flights to Spain and Greece from summer so. So I think there's - I think you'll see the airlines come back pretty quickly and there will be - I don't I don't know how long people have short memories, but this one feels like that could happen again. In terms of structural, you know, the airline business is incredibly risky. So capital is expensive, and I think everybody is expecting leasing to be more of a capital riders. I think some of the big leasing companies have said it's clearly north of 50% now and going up because if you try to, you know, start an airline, why buy equipment, just lease it, so - and you have a lower cost of capital by the leasing company. So I think that benefits. And then our pitch really is, you know, let us manage your engines, we don't need to manage an engine shop visit, when we can do it more efficiently, cheaper, and we could save airline capital. So you don't have to put $5 million into a shop visit or even worse you send your engine in for a shop visit. And you get a shock, though, where you thought it was going to cost $4 million and ends up costing $8 million. So we have a good pitch that I think will resonate as well in terms of capital efficiency and cost savings. So, on the first question, I wouldn't - I mean, I would envision that we would have probably about two thirds of our revenue at Jefferson from crude and about one third from refined products. And then another goal we have is to also add sustainable fuel to the mix at some point. So we had a number of projects looking at that. But figure that, you know, two thirds crude and one third refine products. In terms of the pipeline economics, it's good, because short pipelines don't cost a lot of money, and if you lose a lot of volume through it, its an incredibly high return. So that's why we put, you know, when we were deciding how many pipes to build, and the cost of building six is not much more than the cost of building one. I mean, realistically, it's like, if you built a house, you would definitely want to put more conduit in the wall because you don't want to reopen it. So we built six, and we're only using one right now. And it's enough, we're getting a good return off one. So you can imagine what the return would be if we had product flowing on all of them. There's just a tariff, you get paid, you know, a cents per barrel tariff for the move. That's all, it's very simple. Well, you've got - I mean, on a pipe, you have almost no costs? I mean, it's once you've built it, the operating costs are de minimis. No, that's 2021, full year. Yes, for the first half of this 2021 for engine utilization, I said 60% to 70%. We're probably beginning the year around 60%. And I expect that to trend up in the second quarter. And then for the second half of the year, we believe it will be 70% to 80% utilization. We sort of - I think the highest utilization we ever had was about 85%. And it's usually in the third quarter, that's when you know everyone's flat out. So that's what's underpinning that as the return assumption. And for the aircraft fleet, it should be in the low 90s utilization or even maybe higher market if that market picks up. But it's easier to lease an engine than an airframe today. Incremental EBITDA, that's not - does not include any savings for our own fleet. As I mentioned, we've already started buying PMA this week. Yes. And I think we did. If we get Jefferson as a source of capital of $125 million, we have an undrawn revolver of 250 million. So we have adequate funds today to cover all of that. And we could also access, the preferred markets are open again, preferreds have come back to 25. So that's where they were issued. So that's another possibility. As we look at the balance sheet, so. So lots of - and that's without doing anything else that would be cash generative, or selling anything. Yeah. Yes. I think I have that. Yeah, so it's really, the Lockheed Martin is really focused on the CFM engine, CFM56. There's a number of maintenance shops, they tend to specialize by engine type. And so for the CF680 and the , we probably will use other shops, that's not a strength of Lockheed Martin. So I think it's really going to be focused on the CFM56 market. In terms of narrowbody engines, it's about half the fleet, there's 160 engines right now CFM. And it's roughly half of our, you know, portfolio value. As I mentioned, there's $300 million of new investments, almost all of that and substantial amount that is going to be CFM engines adding to that. So I expect to be over 200 engines by the end of this year for CFM56. And then 200 engines is 1% of the total world fleet of 22,000. So it's really still quite small. So we could see growth beyond that for many years in terms of adding to that if we decide to. It's actually a lot bigger than that it's about 300 engines a year. And we're assuming, you know, our needs are going to be probably in the 50 to 60 range in the near term. Well, I think that we could be at 300 engines next year. So that feels doable. And that's 60 shop visits a year. And if we save $2 million per shop visit, that's $120 million in savings for our own fleet, just some shop visits. And that should show up, if you assume if that $120 million is amortized over three or four years, that's $30 million to $40 million a year there. Right. I mean, that was one of the revelation when we talk about - you know, when we talk about PMA, the manufacturers always say, well, it's not going to be widely used, it's not a big factor, because the residual values, you know, affected. But if you're leasing engines, which is what we do, nobody who leases an engine cares if there's PMA in the engine, they care if it's, you know, reliable, and it's got hours and cycles on it. So there's no discount, given on lease rate. So we have the ability to effectively, you know, keep that savings for ourselves. Well, I think that opportunities are multiple. As I mentioned, we have a discussion ongoing about using a couple of those pipes for crude. So inbound crude into the Exxon refineries is an opportunity that we're talking about, and then refined products as well. So for the balance, I would hope that we would be utilizing probably two or three of those this year. Thanks. Yeah, I expect very little in Q1. So it's really is going off a bit balance for the year and I would say Q3, and Q4 will be higher than Q2. Yes, I would - I mean, there's one that's potentially larger than the rest, but I think most of them are relatively small scale initially, to develop the products and the economics are pretty attractive. So it's not really, you know, doing something that's below market in terms of returns. But I think initially the scale of most of these is pretty small with the goal that if you prove it out, then you can expand it. Yes. Thanks. So, no, I mean, airlines will be putting PMA and have been for years PMA into their own engines. It's a sort of a misnomer that you know, there's some residual value factors, the results  But airlines buy PMA directly today. They buy a lot of PMA from HEICO, they buy from Chromalloy, there's PMA, all the major airlines, particularly ones that operate their own shop use PMA.

It's I would say for this year, it should be a small contributor to that number. But the goal is to make that a big contributor. And you know, when we have any particular, you know, win on that we will certainly communicate that, but I think that the - we have a framework and we have initiatives, and we have good dialogue going on that front. So I'm hopeful. Yes, yes. So it's not an assumption that it's on-lease, but sitting in a warehouse, it's actually flying. Yes, so the one to Motiva is the largest that will be almost 300,000 barrels a day total capacity. So it's a big pipe. The inbound from payne line  initially is 40,000 barrels a day but it can be expanded up to 60. And then the six pipe stacks on varying capacities but if you assumed 150,000 barrels a day for each one of them that was - it's pretty close. So some are a little bit less and some are a little bit more, but 150,000 is a good number for each one of those. Which is a lot of capacity."

            "name": "Scott Christopher",
            "content": "Yes, I would say $50 million, $60 million of EBITDA this year from the three you mentioned, and the largest being Jefferson, followed by Repauno and then Long Ridge, just because Long Ridge, we will not have a lot of history - it's not a lot of time once it comes on, and we own 50% of that, so in that order. And obviously, it's more back end-loaded. So - but I think that's a reasonable goal. And obviously, then next year, they'll all be in service, you know, full year, which would be better. And then we've got expansion projects, numerous ones that could add substantial to that. Sure. So I think if you take - if you look ahead to 2022 and your starting point and say roughly $1.8 billion  you've invested in equipment that actually generate $450 million of EBITDA, and then on top of that, I think the last time we discussed the, sort of the opportunity from both the parts business, as well as managing third-party fleets, adding an incremental $100 million to that number. And so I would say $550 million to $600 million for 2022 is - it may sound a little aspirational, but I do think it's reasonable, it's a reasonable goal. I'm sorry, I wasn't sure - what's the 50 to 80? Yeah, so it wasn't actually a range, there was - it was a build up and starting with the existing portfolio, producing $320 million this year. And then adding 80 to that from new investments of approximately $300 million of new investments, generating $80 million this year. And that, obviously - that's only three quarters of the year, because most of those are closed or we should be closing soon. And then on top of that $50 million from the joint ventures and partnerships that we've had. So that's the 320 plus 80 plus 50, is a fourth Yes. So part of the income from the power plan is a payment for capacity, which PJM has a capacity payment, and I believe it's about $20 to $25 million a year. And I don't think that we would be booking that right away. Very likely that comes in the auction, first auction, which I think will be in this 2022 period. So there will be a little bit of a lag on the - getting to a $120 million right away. In terms of selling it. You know, I would say not much has transpired since the last time we spoke. I think we're still thinking about it. We do - it does feel like we have more upside with that that, and then we would have said previously, this hydrogen initiative, and, you know, the data center opportunities are both very real and would provide, I think, substantial upside. And so we wouldn't do anything until we felt like we've, you know, at least, you know, gotten those to a point where we can, you know, we can - the value is obvious. Yes, I would say it's probably equally divided between the part of business with AAR, the Chromalloy joint venture and Lockheed Martin, if you took a third, a third, a third of that you would be pretty close. Yes. Thanks."

At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  \nAlan Andreini: Thank you, operator. I would like to welcome you all to the Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Christopher, our Chief Financial Officer. We have posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you've not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only mode and is being webcast. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including FAD. The reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements, by their nature, are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our quarterly report filed with the SEC. Now I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Thank you, Alan. To start, I'm pleased to announce our 22nd dividend as a public company and our 37th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on November 30, based on the shareholder record date of November 16. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD, or funds available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2020 was $58.6 million compared to Q2 2020 of $66.5 million and Q3 2019 of $112 million. On a normalized basis, excluding the gains or losses from the sales, Q3 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $59.7 million compared to $65.7 million in Q2 2020 and $74.9 million in Q3 2019. FAD was $39.9 million in Q3 2020 versus $47.3 million in Q2 2020 and $120.7 in Q3 2019. On a normalized basis, excluding sale proceeds and nonrecurring items, Q3 2020 FAD was $23.9 million compared to $38.2 million in Q2 2020 and $48.7 million in Q3 2019. During the third quarter the $39.9 million FAD number was comprised of $74.5 million from our aviation leasing portfolio, negative $300,000 from our infrastructure business and negative $34.3 million from corporate and other.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Joe. Operator, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator:  Your first question comes from the line of Guiliano Bologna of Compass Point.\nGiuliano Bologna: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I think, I guess concerning on that two related topics here, when we think about the Lockheed transaction, and the roughly 500,000 per shop visit of savings, is that included in the $375 million EBITDA that you're discussing for fiscal 2021 for aviation?\nJoseph Adams: No, no, that was meant to be the incremental total of the three parts of the Lockheed totaled $100 million and that's incremental to the $375 million.\nGiuliano Bologna: That makes more sense, so I think when I think about the kind of accretion discussion and you brought up that will offer through the aviation segment and that will be accretive to the guidance of now $375 million, and then the $450 million if we included the additional engines that you're planning on purchasing?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, that is right.\nGiuliano Bologna: Then, taking it a little bit step further, just thinking about from a timing perspective for a few different initiatives and central catalysts out there, you mentioned hopefully the PMA approval is days away. If you could just give a quick update around where you are in the process, I think you have the application into the first part and you're awaiting approval on the first part, and I'd be curious around the second part if the application is in and if you have a sense of timing for the second part?\nJoseph Adams: That's correct. The first part, there's two parts that we started three years ago are essentially fully engineered, built and developed. The first part of the application is complete and as I mentioned, we're awaiting the FAA has been with us all the way along the way, so we don't anticipate significant delays from here, so that we're very hopeful will be days away. The second part will be finalized in the fourth quarter. The final application should be made by the end of this year. And same thing as the FAA has been involved all the way along the way, so we don't anticipate major delays beyond that. So those are the first two, and then as you remember, we started work on three additional parts in last year, so that would -- we would expect to be done in 2022.\nGiuliano Bologna: That makes sense. And then a little bit of different topic, when we think about  and the remaining 50.1% interest, obviously as you get closer to completing that, the incentive to potentially sell that stake probably increases dramatically. And so, I am sure on that side was, how you think about that asset from a monetization perspective and obviously, we can think about your completed projects and having much higher multiples obviously than the first early 49.9% percent stake that was sold. But just thinking about monetization opportunities and what you might potentially target there, and obviously Jefferson is a little bit of a different situation because you probably need to have a little bit more progress before that becomes sellable in part, but just thinking about monetization of assets on the infrastructure side?\nJoseph Adams: Yes that's -- you are right, I mean that definitely would be something we would look at and think about. It should be operational in Q3 of next year, a year from now or even earlier than a year from now. So, and at that point, that's when you have the maximum amount of contracted revenue. So there were a lot of people that we've talked to over the prior years that expressed interest, but they only wanted to invest when something was up and running and operating, not under construction. So the market widens out and I also think as I mentioned that if we have a carbon free path to power generation through hydrogen, that's also going to be significantly higher value than a carbon power plant of which there are many. So I think the combination of those two things would make it something that we will consider earlier than probably the other two that you mentioned.\nGiuliano Bologna: That makes lot of sense. I appreciate the time, and I will jump back in the queue. Thank you.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Sullivan of Benchmark.\nJosh Sullivan: Good morning.\nJoseph Adams: Good morning.\nJosh Sullivan: Just with regards to the tightness in the aerospace engine market, you're looking at over the next couple of quarters, what is your sense of the overall industry green time remaining? Now, are there any metrics that give you confidence that were, other than air traffic that were chewing into that, are shop visit schedules tightening or are the prices on parts in the secondary market? Just curious, what gives you confidence that you know this dynamic is playing out?\nJoseph Adams: Well, we look at all the data and we have the same information and we had previously indicated we, our numbers that indicate by Q2 of 2021 you'd be out of spare engine capacity and that's if engines are -- can be moved efficiently from one airline to another, but that they can't. And so, I think the most recent indicator that we have is, real customers with airlines or conversations with airlines that are happening now, where airlines are looking at their own planning and seeing that they're going to need engines maybe earlier than that, and that's why we're having conversations now, regarding programs that would start in 2021, because I think they're going to -- they're quickly going to see that they may not have as much available capacity as they would like. So I think they are looking at starting programs now, because there is a lead time to getting these things in position. So that's why I think our timing was, you know, the Lockheed Martin program is optimal because we've started moving modules and engines into that facility now, and can begin supplying engines to airlines pretty quickly in 2021. So we feel like the timing of that, as well as the using up of green time is really optimal and airlines are looking as you know to maximize cash and save cash. And so, going into that with a program to say that we can supply you with engines without you having to invest in older engines is really attractive. So we're hopeful, as I mentioned, that we can, our goal is to sign up 250 engines, which isn't really that much with a -- we'd have over 20,000 engines in the world, it's not that much to get and the contribution would be meaningful also, position us to be a service provider, as well as a leasing provider, which I think is quite valuable.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. I mean do you see other partnerships with other parts or other distribution coming into play here as you kind of expand the capabilities there, the Lockheed overall relationship?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, there is one more part I think that is the used serviceable material is an important component and that's something that we're working on, which would give us really a comprehensive solution across the whole engine. So that's something that given our -- we know all the players and we've had meaningful discussions. We have quite an -- we're an attractive partner because we have 200 engines, and we're going to be adding to that. So I think that that is something that we can -- we've done a lot of work on and I think is something that is sort of the last piece of the puzzle.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. And it just one on the sale leaseback market, has it remained active, do you think we'll see another wave of interest just as global airlines kind of settle into the new reality here?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, I think, it's going to be a very tough winter for airlines. So cash, they're doing everything they can to survive and sale leaseback is a source of cash that they're going to tap. I think that earlier this summer, there was a lot of activity, some of the deals got done and then some of the deals I think are just been pushed back because you've got a lot of government money coming into the airlines and when you get government money coming in the airlines, then everything takes longer because you have another party to negotiate and look at everything. So, but I think that those deals are not dead and they're actually, will be very, there's going to be an active sale leaseback market, I think for at least the next year.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. Thank you for the time.\nJoseph Adams: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citi.\nChristian Wetherbee: Hi, thanks so much guys. I wanted to touch on the aviation EBITDA outlook for next year. If you could unpack that a little bit and kind of walk through what exactly is included in terms of assumptions around that? I know you talked about 70 incremental engines kind of going into that as well, but can you talk a little bit about sort of, underlying market conditions that support that? And then obviously, the last question around sale leasebacks kind of if anything is included in that, I just want to kind of make sure I understand that what the walk up is from where we are today to what is that 450 and kind of what you need to see happen to make it at that number?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So what, so if you look at our current fleet, it's about $1.5 billion and we should do probably about, $290 million, $300 million of EBITDA this year, which is below our target and I had mentioned the impact of COVID on that is sort of right in that range of $50 million to $60 million impact this year. So we see that returning to more normal. We actually had an EBITDA, pre-COVID that was going up in the high 20%, 28%, 29%, 30%, but we're saying, okay, next year we think the airlines that we've backed are survivors, and we will see a return to a 25% of EBITDA margin based on analysis of our portfolio. And we do have a good chunk of assets in the freight market, which is doing really well and will continue to do well and we've added customers like Air France and a couple of other sovereign airlines. So we feel pretty good about 25% on $1.5 billion, so that's the $375 million. Then, turning to this, the incremental investment, we have $200 million of capital under LOI to invest in about 70 engines, all CFM 56 engines. So that's what we've been talking about and what we've been targeting. And the attractive, the pricing on it is very attractive, because there are few competitors with capital that are looking to buy assets right now. So we're able to get very good pricing. It's about $3 million per engine on average. We have some engines that we're buying is actually as cheap as $1 million dollars. So there's a bit of a range, but on $3 million of average for a CFM 56 we believe we will generate within our assumption on utilization for that is approximately 75% and I think that could end up and I think that's a reasonable assumption, it could be, there could be some upside there because I think as I mentioned, there's likely to be a tight market. But 75% utilization generates a 35% EBITDA margin on that $200 million. So that's an incremental 70 million. So if you take $375 million and add $70 million, the 450 number for approximately 450 per annum EBITDA for us for 2021, that's without adding any incremental benefits in the Lockheed Martin partnership, which I mentioned, which we believe will approximately $100 million.\nChristian Wetherbee: Okay. And there's nothing incremental from national carrier sale leaseback or anything like that involved as well?\nJoseph Adams: No, no, and I think we'll see other good investment opportunities. I really do. I think the market is stressed. It's, as you know, and it's likely to present other opportunities, but we're not factoring that in at this point.\nChristian Wetherbee: Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then, I guess I just wanted to touch base on Jefferson to try to understand maybe the trajectory of that business coming out obviously, I think, as you mentioned, crude by rail opportunities have kind of decelerated and slowed pretty meaningfully. Can you talk about sort of pipeline connections and maybe other potential opportunities in Jefferson as we roll into 2021?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So the three projects will provide meaningful connectivity and upside for us and it's, we'll have six pipes that should be completed in December that will connect us to the Exxon refinery. And initially, the plan is really we've only got one of those that's being utilized today. So that would be the refined products to Mexico. So we have obviously, lots of conversations going about utilizing those other pipes and that's what I mentioned. The opportunities and there's a definite effect you have when you actually are building something and are about to complete it, you get a much more serious focus and conversation and when you're in the early stages of planning things. So we're hopeful that they'll be a lot higher utilization on those. The timing of that is difficult to predict and definitely the slowdown in demand that the refiners are seeing the demand destruction  has been pretty significant. So, the timing is probably the challenge, but once the pipes are done, the leverage is significant. That's one part of it. The other parts are the crude part where we have an inbound crude pipeline connection from Cushing, so that will connect our refinery for crude, which is very important for us to be able to blend, because as you bring crude by rail and you need to blend it with another type of crude. So the crude connection to the pay line connection from Cushing will give us a very competitive and cheap blend stock for crude by rail. Then crude by rail, as I mentioned is showing signs of activity again. We've got trains booked from Utah into the terminal for Motiva and Motiva is the other part of the outbound -- is the other pipeline connection. So we're building the pipe from Jefferson to Motiva. So we can blend, bring in crude by rail blend and then ship by pipe. So it's very efficient supply chain. Then and then lastly, as I mentioned, I alluded to, we've got other pipeline connections that the more options you give these refineries, the more interested they become. And so we now will have multiple connections, but if we can add additional options, then we provide a really high value service because they can switch sources as prices move around. So we're expecting significant upside opportunity again on the crude side, as well as on the refined product side. It's just again the timing of predicting that is hard, but once the pipes are there, we're going to use them.\nChristian Wetherbee: Yes, okay. That's great detail. I appreciate the time. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Long of Stephens.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to circle back on aviation and some of the 2021 commentary. Joe, I think you said on the LOIs that you're expecting to close, the assumption is that utilization will be 75%. I wanted to clarify, is your assumption that utilization will be at a similar level for the existing assets when you gave that guidance for 2021 and is there anything you can share on the trend in utilization in October?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, the assumption is the same for the existing portfolio, approximately 75% and we're seeing very high utilization on the freighter fleet. And as I mentioned, we exited the quarter in September with 60% overall utilization on the existing engine portfolio. So it's been coming up every quarter. The average for the quarter is in the low 40s. So it started out lower and it's been building. And as I mentioned, part of the reason and that Q3 was challenging is it didn't -- July and August didn't pick up until later in the quarter and closer to September. And then, so we're expecting that trend in -- we have engines that we delivered, it also took longer to get engines delivered during Q3 given the travel restrictions and just getting things moved around. But in the fourth quarter, we're expecting that 60% to be trending, staying there or going up and then as I mentioned, we expect as we deploy the new engines and we see an increased tightening market, we expect that 2021 will be at 75%.\nJustin Long: Okay, and in October, have you seen that 60% exit rate hold steady or has there been any improvement?\nJoseph Adams: I would say steady.\nJustin Long: Okay. And then, this quarter you mentioned that you harvested some non-core assets in aviation. I was curious if that's something we should expect to continue going forward or if this was just something isolated in the third quarter? And maybe you could provide an update on how your assets in aviation break down by customer today?\nJoseph Adams: Sure. So the -- we did harvest some engines and mostly those were CF680 and Pratt4000s, which are engines that fly on 747 primarily or 767s in the freighter market. And the reason we sold some of those is, rather than invest as most of those were unserviceable engines. So you either have to invest in another shop visit or you can sell them into the part market. And then the part market is pretty strong given the demand for freight flying. So from an investment point of view, it made more sense for us to sell them into the partout market than it did to put them through a full restoration and invest for another four or five year cycle. So it was really just sort of a timing issue in terms of taking better bid from the parts market then making an investment and putting them in for another four or five year shop visit, which may or may not be the outlook for 12 to 24 months for those engines is pretty good. The outlook for 60 months is a little cloudy here. In terms of the portfolio, we have about 20% of the portfolio in the freighter market and that is doing pretty well. So obviously that's a bigger portion of our revenues. We have about 60% in the narrow-body market, which is A320s and 737s in CFM engines and about 20% in 757 and 76 market, which is underpinned most of those that we owned in that 75 and 76 are not cargo planes today, but there's a strong bid from cargo companies buying those planes to convert them to cargo. So total portfolio is similar to what it was in Q3. I'd say on the customer concentration now our largest customer is Air France, and we've added a couple state owned sovereign credits. So I'd say there has been a little bit of a shift towards that way on the narrow-body side. And, there's another deal that we're fairly far along on that's closed to where you can push that number even higher. So I think that's the trend line is you'll have more stayed on sovereign credits in the narrow-body side.\nJustin Long: Okay, very helpful. I appreciate the time.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Devin Ryan of JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Hey good morning, Joe. There is really one question from me and when I come back to aviation here, one element of the combination of the Lockheed program that it's at least very interesting to us is the vertical integration of the business. I think that gives the platform a number of competitive advantages over other lessors. I think it could also potentially change the valuation framework relative to others over time. So I'm curious whether you guys would consider separating aviation from the infrastructure business, especially if you're getting to the types of sad numbers next year that are projected, just given that that's a quite a level of scale in the industry. And so, just thinking about the potential to separate the platforms to clean up the corporate structure, and obviously simplify the story and whether you can actually do this based on current debt structure or if it's even something you're open to exploring?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, we've, talked about that before and we are open to looking at it. I think we expressed the goal that we would like, if we did separate them to have each aviation and infrastructure have $1 billion dollar market cap connected to them, so there's enough liquidity in both. And so that's one goal. And I think it is something that we could manage with the debt structure, and we've got ideas, but we don't have a specific timeline or action plan at this moment. I think it would -- it's something though that we believe longer term would make a lot of sense, and it's something that we're going to continue to think about and try to figure out the best timing.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Zazula of Barclays.\nDavid Zazula: Thanks for taking my question. Just on the aviation side, I guess my question is, given the harvesting of engines you did this quarter and the Air France deal you did last quarter, has that given you a shift in your geographic end markets? And what do you feel are kind of the benefits and risks of having your current shift in geographic end markets from here?\nJoseph Adams: Well, we haven't, I mean, we've shifted slightly to Europe with Air France and adding, but we still have a fairly diversified between Asia, Europe and U.S., U.S. being the smallest, North America being the smallest, but the assets are very, very fungible. So I think, that's the beauty of aviation is you can move them around and we don't see it right now the global market is moving pretty much in lockstep. There are times where certain regions do better than others, and assets move in that direction. But for right now, there's a relatively, it's not extremely significant in terms of being in one market versus another. So I think that we're happy with the mix we have and I think, as I said, I think we will see a bigger shift to state owned or sovereign airlines, just because those are the airlines that are getting the funding from governments, and that's where the assets are going to be the most stable and the most solid. So I think, we're trying, we're targeting those tiers specifically. So as I'm sure everybody would say, would make sense. So we'll see a shift to sovereign credits as opposed to any region in particular.\nDavid Zazula: Thanks. And then, on the maintenance side, as the FAA approval timeline appears to be stepping up, have you gotten orders in? And if so, how quickly, could you ramp up to start processing your orders? Thanks.\nJoseph Adams: Yes, the production is in the works, so there's pretty quick inventory availability and there are orders for parts already. So once the part is approved, it can be made very quickly, and we've indicated our interest in orders as well given our orders for our owned aircraft, our owned engines for next year. So there's not a big lag. This has been, it's been a long process of getting approval, so there's been plenty of time to plan production.\nDavid Zazula: Great, thanks Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ari Rosa of Bank of America.\nAri Rosa: Hey, good morning, Joe. So it sounds like you have a lot of confidence in that, in the $450 million EBITDA figure for next year. Similar to kind of Chris' question, to what extent is that kind of contingent on a recovery in passenger traffic or something of that sort? And kind of in line with that, do you see this quarter as kind of being a trough for what we should be able to expect in terms of EBITDA and FAD going forward, because obviously, you're still covering the dividend, which is great? But I think, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks, this was probably a little bit softer than what some of us were looking for. So, in terms of looking at 2021, just maybe if you could give some parameters around how much confidence you have in that 450 number and what that implies for kind of that across the business?\nJoseph Adams: Well, obviously, we feel pretty good about it. But, but obviously, COVID is still now out there and you see Europe and Germany and France, taking steps to shut down again. On the other hand, you have countries in Asia where they've had no infections in Taiwan, and China's back to pre-COVID flying levels. So it's quite varied around the world, but people are figuring out how to, manage it, and people are flying. The U.S. had a million passengers in September, so I think people are getting there without a vaccine. Obviously, many airlines are pushing, hoping for vaccine and therapeutics and the sounds around that from the people that know better than I know is that people are pretty optimistic that there will be something available pretty soon. Now how quickly that is effective or not, and then you also see airlines starting to do rapid testing. British Airways, if you are flying to London, you can get a rapid test now three days a week for everybody on the plane. So the airlines are working in countries to try to figure out people want to the back flying and traveling. So it's not without some risk that there is a snapback, but it feels like it's going to keep moving up and getting better. And what happened I think a little bit in the third quarter is that, it just took longer. People were not rushing to get there as quickly as it seemed like they were. So that the risk I think is more on the timing side, but we feel pretty good that something, people are getting better and people are improving how they manage. And, there's a lot of, you know, a lot of good signs out there, although this week doesn't feel hard to feel great about it, but it's, it does feel like we can, people will get a handle on it and 2021 should be much better we hope.\nAri Rosa: Got it, understood. And then just, in terms of the MRO deal, Lockheed is obviously very reputable in this space. Maybe you could talk a little bit about kind of the nature of the discussions that you had with them? And, if I could ask you to speculate, why do you think from their perspective, they chose FTAI as a partner?\nJoseph Adams: Well, we've been talking about this for two years. We've been looking at trying to find the right partner for us for our business, and what we were looking for is, someone who valued our flow of business. And we have, as I mentioned, 200 engines, which is 40 shop visits a year already, and they see and we see opportunities that's going to grow. And so that's, what's very attractive, that's what we brought to the table. And lots of people were interested. I mean, we had conversations with all over the world with many, many different parties. But Lockheed is very reputable, as you point out. They have a fantastic facility is probably the best facility we -- of any of them, that we saw with 300 shop visits a year, it's the order of Air Canada engine shop. And their timing is, they needed, they don't have a lot of flow there, and then post-COVID, the outlook just got even further pushed out. So I think that's what they liked. What we -- we wanted to get the ability to have to be an important customer and to create this module factory is something we've also been talking about before, because if you can have modules available, you can avoid a full restoration shop visit pre-COVID was taking in some cases nine months. So if you actually only need to work on the low pressure turbine and you need a module, you can pull that off, and you can have an engine out within 30 days. So you can dramatically reduce the time that engine needs to be idle. So that was not easy for us to be able to get from a lot of different MROs. They just wouldn't accommodate that or they didn't have the space or the availability. So that was a big part of the discussion and they did have the room. They have the capability and they're actually very excited about that capability and what it will do for their business and ability to attract other business. And we did that deal without having to invest in their shop. They weren't looking for us to buy an interest. Some of the other deals we were looking at, we would have had to invest capital. We would have had to buy tooling. We would have had to buy an equity interest and we were able to avoid all that. So I think that, what we got was everything we needed without having to really do something that we didn't want to do.\nAri Rosa: Got it. That's great color Joe, thanks for the time.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Galanti of Stifel.\nFrank Galanti: Yes, hi, Joe. Thanks for taking the question. One to follow-up actually on that last question on the Lockheed partnership, so I get that you guys are able to bring in volume to write the MRO business, which is in need of shop visits. But why isn't Lockheed doing this directly? You guys had said that you're targeting 250 engine, 50 visits a year and you're able to save a million dollars or I guess, more than a million dollars on the proprietary or I guess on the module part. But it feels like Lockheed is giving up too much and maybe I'm reading into that too much. Are they that desperate for shop visits or yes?\nJoseph Adams: Well, I think it is a difficult time for an MRO. So I don't think that, I mean, I don't, I wouldn't characterize them as desperate, but I do think it helps them at a critical time. But if you look at the maintenance MRO business, we've talked to a lot of these airlines that they very few of them are owners of engines and so in order to create a module factory, you need inventory and you need to own engines and you have to have a critical mass. And I'm not saying the MRO shops couldn't do it, but they don't do it. They very few go to their board and say I want to be in the engine leasing business and I want to go invest several $100 million and build a business when they have no history or capability or leasing team or whatever, it's a vertical integration. So we came at it and we do a fair amount of business with other MRO shops as a private label provider of engines. So an MRO will go out and pitch their shop visit services to an airline and says, can you get me an engine while my engine is in the shop? And a lot of the times the MROs will come to us and say do you have an engine for us? And so we're like a private label leasing providers of spares. So we've been and we serve the aftermarket. So we don't, we're not the OEM. So you also have to find an MRO who is aftermarket oriented as opposed to OEM oriented. And those further limits the number of people that have -- that are in that market. So it was a long hunt, but it worked out great for us timing wise. And I do think it's a good deal for Lockheed as well, because, there's going to be a lot of flow and this hopefully gets them started on bringing other customers and other businesses. And then if we start doing PMA, and we develop a program with an airline that could that end up flowing to them as well. So I think they see upside in addition this is not just a deal they had to do.\nFrank Galanti: Okay, that's actually really great color. I appreciate that. So effectively, you guys are bringing to bear CapEx in the form of engines and you're sort of leasing out space. What so how much is that going to cost you guys and then is how much are the minimum volumes? And is there any economic share with Lockheed in this deal?\nJoseph Adams: We don't rent space. So, but we do have some minimum volume commitments into the seven year. And I would characterize that as modest and very manageable from our point of view. But, that's something that was very important to them and we are committed to that, but we don't pay rent. So we're just going to be using the shop for shop visits, and also have the ability to store modules and keep modules there. So that's very attractive in terms of that. And we are -- if you think about the industry, airlines don't have capital. Maintenance shops don't have capital. And we are one of the few places that you actually are willing to invest in engines. So that gives us a huge kick a big boost to the business right now that we didn't anticipate or we didn't see a year ago. But the timing on that if we can go to airlines and partner and say we can provide all of your needs, and do it for a lower cost and save you capital, that's a pretty compelling proposition that I think is going to be very significant for us going forward.\nFrank Galanti: Yes, it sounds like a great deal. Just one last question from me. Just kind of following-up on the 75% utilization you guys expect for your engines in 2021. Most of the question is around pricing power, are you having to get, are you having to reduce pricing in that scenario, where utilization kind of bounces back next year?\nJoseph Adams: No, we've -- the engine leasing business has never been really a price sensitive business from that point of view that it is -- the prices tend to be set by the OEMs. And they set prices very high because they're always charging a lot for their parts and raising prices, so we fall under that umbrella. And usually when someone needs an engine, they don't go out with an RFT, they actually call a handful of people and they get engine and it's typically not the CFO who is negotiating with you. It's somebody that has to get an engine because they need to fly a plane on the maintenance side. So it's very difficult to move engines by cutting the price is what I'm saying. And it's much more of a demand driven need based decision and it's not really -- we haven't seen pressure on rents and maintenance reserves also keep going up every year because the OEMs keep raising prices.\nFrank Galanti: Okay, great. That's all I had. Thanks so much.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Randy Binner of B. Riley.\nRandy Binner: Hey, good morning. So shifting back away from aviation, I appreciate the comments on Jefferson terminal and the pipes coming to completion in December. Yes, I apologize if I missed it, but was there, did you give any kind of quantification of financial impacts for that? Looking longer term, I know, it's not as defined as everything we talked about in aviation, but some parameters there, and then possibly also on the Long Ridge data center saving opportunity, just kind of maybe digging into timing and the longer term financial impact, if you could?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, so we've said that Jefferson, when the pipelines are built and operating we will be at an approximately $80 million EBITDA run rate. What is a little harder, given the COVID delays for the refineries is predicting the timing exactly of that. But we will have the pipes done in the next two to three months and we're hopeful that we'll have commercial deals in place shortly thereafter to get us to those, to that number or even higher. In terms of Long Ridge, we have engaged a number of data centers and talked to them about providing them the site and the power and so we have multiple proposals out. And I think the hydrogen play is one that's actually very helpful, because it's not just any data site at that point, it's a data center with a hydrogen story on hydrogen play, which is very helpful. So we turn on the power plant in the third quarter of next year and so we're hopeful that before we turn it on, we'll have actually signed for a tenant and a construction project by then and then hopefully, early in 2021 is our goal.\nRandy Binner: Okay, but at this point there's no numbers, broad numbers you can give as you're still in negotiations?\nJoseph Adams: Right, we did say that if we're able to sign up, I mean, because if we sign up a tenant on our site, we will generate closer to sort of mid 40s in terms of dollars per megawatt hour versus high 20s today. So significantly higher power revenue, and if we're able to contract half of the power output, the EBITDA for the total power plant would increase from $120 million up to $140 million to $150 million. And obviously, if there's a hydrogen play or component to that, we think that the multiple devaluation multiple would also be much higher.\nRandy Binner: Perfect, thank you.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Salmon of Wolfe Research.\nRobert Salmon: Hi, good morning, Joe and thanks for taking the question. As we think about the utilization outlook for 2021 of 75, can you help us bridge kind of the improvement from roughly 60% from September up to that 75? Is it real kind of a better run rate exiting September than the overall average? Is this related to the timing of some recent deals or is there something related to a vaccine that\u2019s embedded in your forecast?\nJoseph Adams: Sure, so we exited the quarter at about a 60% average and so it's been steadily trending up. If you look at every month over the last since April, it's been trending up. And we also have a number of programs that have been taken up by some airlines over the next few months and we talked about early 2021 we're seeing demand for engines now that we have. So we've taken the numbers and prior to COVID we were -- our engine utilization was as high as 80%. So we basically mapped out and we continue to see high utilization on the freighter fleets. And it's really the recovery of the pasture markets that is taking the numbers up to back to levels where they historically were. And part of that, as I mentioned is the fact that shop visits are way down. So if you have excess available engines and you stop doing all shop visits, you quickly use up available engines and you'll see engine utilizations increase well before aircraft utilization, because aircraft lasts a very long time, engines have to go into shop every five years.\nRobert Salmon: Actually, Joe, that's a nice segue into my follow up question on the MRO deal with Lockheed. And, you guys have got capacity to kind of increase up to 300 units annually. Can you give us a sense of where that minimum is? I realized you probably can't speak to exactly the level, but clearly you're going to have a need for 40 shop visits a year, kind of how many visits above that amount are you guys kind of required to tap through put at the facilities for the module factory?\nJoseph Adams: The minimum would be well below that amount, not above it. So it's not something that I think is significant, you know, commitment or worry about us being able to meet that minimum.\nRobert Salmon: But I mean, the number of shops are find is like you're required, you're basically required 40 shop visits annually. I'm assuming it's above the 40, but obviously significantly below the 300.\nJoseph Adams: Oh you mean what our fleet would be?\nRobert Salmon: Correct? Yes, like what your required throughput is going to be anyway, on an annual basis - required minimum.\nJoseph Adams: When you say required, the minimum is going to be very low of what a minimum committed now we have to give as part of the deal, well below what our current requirements are. So you can approximate how many shop visits you'll have by just taking 20% of the total number of CFM engines we own, which is if -- I said if we had 200 engines, 20% is about 40 shop visits a year today and we expect that to grow, but the minimum that we've committed is well below that number.\nRobert Salmon: Okay, that's really helpful, so you can understand kind of the risk return parameter there. And my final question is with regard to that $200 million of LOIs, can you give us a sense of when you expect that capital to be deployed, just so, we're kind of incorporating the right level of EBITDA from the LOIs for kind of 2021? Is that significantly\u2026?\nJoseph Adams: I think it will be late Q4, and early Q1.\nRobert Salmon: Perfect. I appreciate the time, guys.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Robert Dodd of Raymond James.\nRobert Dodd: Hi, guys. Just a follow-up on that one first and then one other this should be quick. On the MROs Joe, on the minimums, does that minimum have an escalator over time or is the building in the assumption of growth or is the minimum now the minimum \u2013 color?\nJoseph Adams: And it is, it's like a, it has rollover points too. So, if you don't use it, you can roll it. So it's very flexible. I don't think that will be as significant. I have very little concern about that minimum that we ever get anywhere near it.\nRobert Dodd: Okay, perfect. On the other part, on the various elements you talked about, obviously the $450 million in EBITDA from the equipment, the Lockheed various components of that, that you spelled out that could add up to eventually like an incremental $100 million a year. You mentioned when you said that, based on existing contracts, approvals, et cetera, so did that include any benefit from the parts approval or not? And to put it in another perspective, if that, if your first part got approved by the FDA, FAA say tomorrow, what would the impact from that already be included in what you've discussed or would that be incremental on top of that, and could you give us a ballpark if it would be incremental?\nJoseph Adams: Well, I think when you go through the pieces to the element that I think that will be facilitated, but not necessarily required to get that is being able to manage shop visits for other airlines, and I mentioned the partnering of 250 engines or 50 shop visits a year. The approval of those parts will be helpful for us to make that million dollars and save the airline a million. So it's not entirely impossible. We couldn't do that without it, but it will be facilitated by that. So I would say a portion of the $100 million is really a function of us having these first two parts available next year.\nRobert Dodd: Got it. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nJoseph Adams: Yes.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Andreini for closing remarks.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q4. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Joseph Adams",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan. To start, I'm pleased to announce our 22nd dividend as a public company and our 37th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on November 30, based on the shareholder record date of November 16. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD, or funds available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2020 was $58.6 million compared to Q2 2020 of $66.5 million and Q3 2019 of $112 million. On a normalized basis, excluding the gains or losses from the sales, Q3 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $59.7 million compared to $65.7 million in Q2 2020 and $74.9 million in Q3 2019. FAD was $39.9 million in Q3 2020 versus $47.3 million in Q2 2020 and $120.7 in Q3 2019. On a normalized basis, excluding sale proceeds and nonrecurring items, Q3 2020 FAD was $23.9 million compared to $38.2 million in Q2 2020 and $48.7 million in Q3 2019. During the third quarter the $39.9 million FAD number was comprised of $74.5 million from our aviation leasing portfolio, negative $300,000 from our infrastructure business and negative $34.3 million from corporate and other. No, no, that was meant to be the incremental total of the three parts of the Lockheed totaled $100 million and that's incremental to the $375 million. Yes, that is right. That's correct. The first part, there's two parts that we started three years ago are essentially fully engineered, built and developed. The first part of the application is complete and as I mentioned, we're awaiting the FAA has been with us all the way along the way, so we don't anticipate significant delays from here, so that we're very hopeful will be days away. The second part will be finalized in the fourth quarter. The final application should be made by the end of this year. And same thing as the FAA has been involved all the way along the way, so we don't anticipate major delays beyond that. So those are the first two, and then as you remember, we started work on three additional parts in last year, so that would -- we would expect to be done in 2022. Yes that's -- you are right, I mean that definitely would be something we would look at and think about. It should be operational in Q3 of next year, a year from now or even earlier than a year from now. So, and at that point, that's when you have the maximum amount of contracted revenue. So there were a lot of people that we've talked to over the prior years that expressed interest, but they only wanted to invest when something was up and running and operating, not under construction. So the market widens out and I also think as I mentioned that if we have a carbon free path to power generation through hydrogen, that's also going to be significantly higher value than a carbon power plant of which there are many. So I think the combination of those two things would make it something that we will consider earlier than probably the other two that you mentioned. Thanks. Good morning. Well, we look at all the data and we have the same information and we had previously indicated we, our numbers that indicate by Q2 of 2021 you'd be out of spare engine capacity and that's if engines are -- can be moved efficiently from one airline to another, but that they can't. And so, I think the most recent indicator that we have is, real customers with airlines or conversations with airlines that are happening now, where airlines are looking at their own planning and seeing that they're going to need engines maybe earlier than that, and that's why we're having conversations now, regarding programs that would start in 2021, because I think they're going to -- they're quickly going to see that they may not have as much available capacity as they would like. So I think they are looking at starting programs now, because there is a lead time to getting these things in position. So that's why I think our timing was, you know, the Lockheed Martin program is optimal because we've started moving modules and engines into that facility now, and can begin supplying engines to airlines pretty quickly in 2021. So we feel like the timing of that, as well as the using up of green time is really optimal and airlines are looking as you know to maximize cash and save cash. And so, going into that with a program to say that we can supply you with engines without you having to invest in older engines is really attractive. So we're hopeful, as I mentioned, that we can, our goal is to sign up 250 engines, which isn't really that much with a -- we'd have over 20,000 engines in the world, it's not that much to get and the contribution would be meaningful also, position us to be a service provider, as well as a leasing provider, which I think is quite valuable. Yes, there is one more part I think that is the used serviceable material is an important component and that's something that we're working on, which would give us really a comprehensive solution across the whole engine. So that's something that given our -- we know all the players and we've had meaningful discussions. We have quite an -- we're an attractive partner because we have 200 engines, and we're going to be adding to that. So I think that that is something that we can -- we've done a lot of work on and I think is something that is sort of the last piece of the puzzle. Yes, I think, it's going to be a very tough winter for airlines. So cash, they're doing everything they can to survive and sale leaseback is a source of cash that they're going to tap. I think that earlier this summer, there was a lot of activity, some of the deals got done and then some of the deals I think are just been pushed back because you've got a lot of government money coming into the airlines and when you get government money coming in the airlines, then everything takes longer because you have another party to negotiate and look at everything. So, but I think that those deals are not dead and they're actually, will be very, there's going to be an active sale leaseback market, I think for at least the next year. Yes. Yes. So what, so if you look at our current fleet, it's about $1.5 billion and we should do probably about, $290 million, $300 million of EBITDA this year, which is below our target and I had mentioned the impact of COVID on that is sort of right in that range of $50 million to $60 million impact this year. So we see that returning to more normal. We actually had an EBITDA, pre-COVID that was going up in the high 20%, 28%, 29%, 30%, but we're saying, okay, next year we think the airlines that we've backed are survivors, and we will see a return to a 25% of EBITDA margin based on analysis of our portfolio. And we do have a good chunk of assets in the freight market, which is doing really well and will continue to do well and we've added customers like Air France and a couple of other sovereign airlines. So we feel pretty good about 25% on $1.5 billion, so that's the $375 million. Then, turning to this, the incremental investment, we have $200 million of capital under LOI to invest in about 70 engines, all CFM 56 engines. So that's what we've been talking about and what we've been targeting. And the attractive, the pricing on it is very attractive, because there are few competitors with capital that are looking to buy assets right now. So we're able to get very good pricing. It's about $3 million per engine on average. We have some engines that we're buying is actually as cheap as $1 million dollars. So there's a bit of a range, but on $3 million of average for a CFM 56 we believe we will generate within our assumption on utilization for that is approximately 75% and I think that could end up and I think that's a reasonable assumption, it could be, there could be some upside there because I think as I mentioned, there's likely to be a tight market. But 75% utilization generates a 35% EBITDA margin on that $200 million. So that's an incremental 70 million. So if you take $375 million and add $70 million, the 450 number for approximately 450 per annum EBITDA for us for 2021, that's without adding any incremental benefits in the Lockheed Martin partnership, which I mentioned, which we believe will approximately $100 million. No, no, and I think we'll see other good investment opportunities. I really do. I think the market is stressed. It's, as you know, and it's likely to present other opportunities, but we're not factoring that in at this point. Yes. So the three projects will provide meaningful connectivity and upside for us and it's, we'll have six pipes that should be completed in December that will connect us to the Exxon refinery. And initially, the plan is really we've only got one of those that's being utilized today. So that would be the refined products to Mexico. So we have obviously, lots of conversations going about utilizing those other pipes and that's what I mentioned. The opportunities and there's a definite effect you have when you actually are building something and are about to complete it, you get a much more serious focus and conversation and when you're in the early stages of planning things. So we're hopeful that they'll be a lot higher utilization on those. The timing of that is difficult to predict and definitely the slowdown in demand that the refiners are seeing the demand destruction  has been pretty significant. So, the timing is probably the challenge, but once the pipes are done, the leverage is significant. That's one part of it. The other parts are the crude part where we have an inbound crude pipeline connection from Cushing, so that will connect our refinery for crude, which is very important for us to be able to blend, because as you bring crude by rail and you need to blend it with another type of crude. So the crude connection to the pay line connection from Cushing will give us a very competitive and cheap blend stock for crude by rail. Then crude by rail, as I mentioned is showing signs of activity again. We've got trains booked from Utah into the terminal for Motiva and Motiva is the other part of the outbound -- is the other pipeline connection. So we're building the pipe from Jefferson to Motiva. So we can blend, bring in crude by rail blend and then ship by pipe. So it's very efficient supply chain. Then and then lastly, as I mentioned, I alluded to, we've got other pipeline connections that the more options you give these refineries, the more interested they become. And so we now will have multiple connections, but if we can add additional options, then we provide a really high value service because they can switch sources as prices move around. So we're expecting significant upside opportunity again on the crude side, as well as on the refined product side. It's just again the timing of predicting that is hard, but once the pipes are there, we're going to use them. Yes, the assumption is the same for the existing portfolio, approximately 75% and we're seeing very high utilization on the freighter fleet. And as I mentioned, we exited the quarter in September with 60% overall utilization on the existing engine portfolio. So it's been coming up every quarter. The average for the quarter is in the low 40s. So it started out lower and it's been building. And as I mentioned, part of the reason and that Q3 was challenging is it didn't -- July and August didn't pick up until later in the quarter and closer to September. And then, so we're expecting that trend in -- we have engines that we delivered, it also took longer to get engines delivered during Q3 given the travel restrictions and just getting things moved around. But in the fourth quarter, we're expecting that 60% to be trending, staying there or going up and then as I mentioned, we expect as we deploy the new engines and we see an increased tightening market, we expect that 2021 will be at 75%. I would say steady. Sure. So the -- we did harvest some engines and mostly those were CF680 and Pratt4000s, which are engines that fly on 747 primarily or 767s in the freighter market. And the reason we sold some of those is, rather than invest as most of those were unserviceable engines. So you either have to invest in another shop visit or you can sell them into the part market. And then the part market is pretty strong given the demand for freight flying. So from an investment point of view, it made more sense for us to sell them into the partout market than it did to put them through a full restoration and invest for another four or five year cycle. So it was really just sort of a timing issue in terms of taking better bid from the parts market then making an investment and putting them in for another four or five year shop visit, which may or may not be the outlook for 12 to 24 months for those engines is pretty good. The outlook for 60 months is a little cloudy here. In terms of the portfolio, we have about 20% of the portfolio in the freighter market and that is doing pretty well. So obviously that's a bigger portion of our revenues. We have about 60% in the narrow-body market, which is A320s and 737s in CFM engines and about 20% in 757 and 76 market, which is underpinned most of those that we owned in that 75 and 76 are not cargo planes today, but there's a strong bid from cargo companies buying those planes to convert them to cargo. So total portfolio is similar to what it was in Q3. I'd say on the customer concentration now our largest customer is Air France, and we've added a couple state owned sovereign credits. So I'd say there has been a little bit of a shift towards that way on the narrow-body side. And, there's another deal that we're fairly far along on that's closed to where you can push that number even higher. So I think that's the trend line is you'll have more stayed on sovereign credits in the narrow-body side. Thanks. Yes, we've, talked about that before and we are open to looking at it. I think we expressed the goal that we would like, if we did separate them to have each aviation and infrastructure have $1 billion dollar market cap connected to them, so there's enough liquidity in both. And so that's one goal. And I think it is something that we could manage with the debt structure, and we've got ideas, but we don't have a specific timeline or action plan at this moment. I think it would -- it's something though that we believe longer term would make a lot of sense, and it's something that we're going to continue to think about and try to figure out the best timing. Thanks. Well, we haven't, I mean, we've shifted slightly to Europe with Air France and adding, but we still have a fairly diversified between Asia, Europe and U.S., U.S. being the smallest, North America being the smallest, but the assets are very, very fungible. So I think, that's the beauty of aviation is you can move them around and we don't see it right now the global market is moving pretty much in lockstep. There are times where certain regions do better than others, and assets move in that direction. But for right now, there's a relatively, it's not extremely significant in terms of being in one market versus another. So I think that we're happy with the mix we have and I think, as I said, I think we will see a bigger shift to state owned or sovereign airlines, just because those are the airlines that are getting the funding from governments, and that's where the assets are going to be the most stable and the most solid. So I think, we're trying, we're targeting those tiers specifically. So as I'm sure everybody would say, would make sense. So we'll see a shift to sovereign credits as opposed to any region in particular. Yes, the production is in the works, so there's pretty quick inventory availability and there are orders for parts already. So once the part is approved, it can be made very quickly, and we've indicated our interest in orders as well given our orders for our owned aircraft, our owned engines for next year. So there's not a big lag. This has been, it's been a long process of getting approval, so there's been plenty of time to plan production. Thanks. Well, obviously, we feel pretty good about it. But, but obviously, COVID is still now out there and you see Europe and Germany and France, taking steps to shut down again. On the other hand, you have countries in Asia where they've had no infections in Taiwan, and China's back to pre-COVID flying levels. So it's quite varied around the world, but people are figuring out how to, manage it, and people are flying. The U.S. had a million passengers in September, so I think people are getting there without a vaccine. Obviously, many airlines are pushing, hoping for vaccine and therapeutics and the sounds around that from the people that know better than I know is that people are pretty optimistic that there will be something available pretty soon. Now how quickly that is effective or not, and then you also see airlines starting to do rapid testing. British Airways, if you are flying to London, you can get a rapid test now three days a week for everybody on the plane. So the airlines are working in countries to try to figure out people want to the back flying and traveling. So it's not without some risk that there is a snapback, but it feels like it's going to keep moving up and getting better. And what happened I think a little bit in the third quarter is that, it just took longer. People were not rushing to get there as quickly as it seemed like they were. So that the risk I think is more on the timing side, but we feel pretty good that something, people are getting better and people are improving how they manage. And, there's a lot of, you know, a lot of good signs out there, although this week doesn't feel hard to feel great about it, but it's, it does feel like we can, people will get a handle on it and 2021 should be much better we hope. Well, we've been talking about this for two years. We've been looking at trying to find the right partner for us for our business, and what we were looking for is, someone who valued our flow of business. And we have, as I mentioned, 200 engines, which is 40 shop visits a year already, and they see and we see opportunities that's going to grow. And so that's, what's very attractive, that's what we brought to the table. And lots of people were interested. I mean, we had conversations with all over the world with many, many different parties. But Lockheed is very reputable, as you point out. They have a fantastic facility is probably the best facility we -- of any of them, that we saw with 300 shop visits a year, it's the order of Air Canada engine shop. And their timing is, they needed, they don't have a lot of flow there, and then post-COVID, the outlook just got even further pushed out. So I think that's what they liked. What we -- we wanted to get the ability to have to be an important customer and to create this module factory is something we've also been talking about before, because if you can have modules available, you can avoid a full restoration shop visit pre-COVID was taking in some cases nine months. So if you actually only need to work on the low pressure turbine and you need a module, you can pull that off, and you can have an engine out within 30 days. So you can dramatically reduce the time that engine needs to be idle. So that was not easy for us to be able to get from a lot of different MROs. They just wouldn't accommodate that or they didn't have the space or the availability. So that was a big part of the discussion and they did have the room. They have the capability and they're actually very excited about that capability and what it will do for their business and ability to attract other business. And we did that deal without having to invest in their shop. They weren't looking for us to buy an interest. Some of the other deals we were looking at, we would have had to invest capital. We would have had to buy tooling. We would have had to buy an equity interest and we were able to avoid all that. So I think that, what we got was everything we needed without having to really do something that we didn't want to do. Thanks. Well, I think it is a difficult time for an MRO. So I don't think that, I mean, I don't, I wouldn't characterize them as desperate, but I do think it helps them at a critical time. But if you look at the maintenance MRO business, we've talked to a lot of these airlines that they very few of them are owners of engines and so in order to create a module factory, you need inventory and you need to own engines and you have to have a critical mass. And I'm not saying the MRO shops couldn't do it, but they don't do it. They very few go to their board and say I want to be in the engine leasing business and I want to go invest several $100 million and build a business when they have no history or capability or leasing team or whatever, it's a vertical integration. So we came at it and we do a fair amount of business with other MRO shops as a private label provider of engines. So an MRO will go out and pitch their shop visit services to an airline and says, can you get me an engine while my engine is in the shop? And a lot of the times the MROs will come to us and say do you have an engine for us? And so we're like a private label leasing providers of spares. So we've been and we serve the aftermarket. So we don't, we're not the OEM. So you also have to find an MRO who is aftermarket oriented as opposed to OEM oriented. And those further limits the number of people that have -- that are in that market. So it was a long hunt, but it worked out great for us timing wise. And I do think it's a good deal for Lockheed as well, because, there's going to be a lot of flow and this hopefully gets them started on bringing other customers and other businesses. And then if we start doing PMA, and we develop a program with an airline that could that end up flowing to them as well. So I think they see upside in addition this is not just a deal they had to do. We don't rent space. So, but we do have some minimum volume commitments into the seven year. And I would characterize that as modest and very manageable from our point of view. But, that's something that was very important to them and we are committed to that, but we don't pay rent. So we're just going to be using the shop for shop visits, and also have the ability to store modules and keep modules there. So that's very attractive in terms of that. And we are -- if you think about the industry, airlines don't have capital. Maintenance shops don't have capital. And we are one of the few places that you actually are willing to invest in engines. So that gives us a huge kick a big boost to the business right now that we didn't anticipate or we didn't see a year ago. But the timing on that if we can go to airlines and partner and say we can provide all of your needs, and do it for a lower cost and save you capital, that's a pretty compelling proposition that I think is going to be very significant for us going forward. No, we've -- the engine leasing business has never been really a price sensitive business from that point of view that it is -- the prices tend to be set by the OEMs. And they set prices very high because they're always charging a lot for their parts and raising prices, so we fall under that umbrella. And usually when someone needs an engine, they don't go out with an RFT, they actually call a handful of people and they get engine and it's typically not the CFO who is negotiating with you. It's somebody that has to get an engine because they need to fly a plane on the maintenance side. So it's very difficult to move engines by cutting the price is what I'm saying. And it's much more of a demand driven need based decision and it's not really -- we haven't seen pressure on rents and maintenance reserves also keep going up every year because the OEMs keep raising prices. Thanks. Yes, so we've said that Jefferson, when the pipelines are built and operating we will be at an approximately $80 million EBITDA run rate. What is a little harder, given the COVID delays for the refineries is predicting the timing exactly of that. But we will have the pipes done in the next two to three months and we're hopeful that we'll have commercial deals in place shortly thereafter to get us to those, to that number or even higher. In terms of Long Ridge, we have engaged a number of data centers and talked to them about providing them the site and the power and so we have multiple proposals out. And I think the hydrogen play is one that's actually very helpful, because it's not just any data site at that point, it's a data center with a hydrogen story on hydrogen play, which is very helpful. So we turn on the power plant in the third quarter of next year and so we're hopeful that before we turn it on, we'll have actually signed for a tenant and a construction project by then and then hopefully, early in 2021 is our goal. Right, we did say that if we're able to sign up, I mean, because if we sign up a tenant on our site, we will generate closer to sort of mid 40s in terms of dollars per megawatt hour versus high 20s today. So significantly higher power revenue, and if we're able to contract half of the power output, the EBITDA for the total power plant would increase from $120 million up to $140 million to $150 million. And obviously, if there's a hydrogen play or component to that, we think that the multiple devaluation multiple would also be much higher. Thanks. Sure, so we exited the quarter at about a 60% average and so it's been steadily trending up. If you look at every month over the last since April, it's been trending up. And we also have a number of programs that have been taken up by some airlines over the next few months and we talked about early 2021 we're seeing demand for engines now that we have. So we've taken the numbers and prior to COVID we were -- our engine utilization was as high as 80%. So we basically mapped out and we continue to see high utilization on the freighter fleets. And it's really the recovery of the pasture markets that is taking the numbers up to back to levels where they historically were. And part of that, as I mentioned is the fact that shop visits are way down. So if you have excess available engines and you stop doing all shop visits, you quickly use up available engines and you'll see engine utilizations increase well before aircraft utilization, because aircraft lasts a very long time, engines have to go into shop every five years. The minimum would be well below that amount, not above it. So it's not something that I think is significant, you know, commitment or worry about us being able to meet that minimum. Oh you mean what our fleet would be? When you say required, the minimum is going to be very low of what a minimum committed now we have to give as part of the deal, well below what our current requirements are. So you can approximate how many shop visits you'll have by just taking 20% of the total number of CFM engines we own, which is if -- I said if we had 200 engines, 20% is about 40 shop visits a year today and we expect that to grow, but the minimum that we've committed is well below that number. I think it will be late Q4, and early Q1. Thanks. And it is, it's like a, it has rollover points too. So, if you don't use it, you can roll it. So it's very flexible. I don't think that will be as significant. I have very little concern about that minimum that we ever get anywhere near it. Well, I think when you go through the pieces to the element that I think that will be facilitated, but not necessarily required to get that is being able to manage shop visits for other airlines, and I mentioned the partnering of 250 engines or 50 shop visits a year. The approval of those parts will be helpful for us to make that million dollars and save the airline a million. So it's not entirely impossible. We couldn't do that without it, but it will be facilitated by that. So I would say a portion of the $100 million is really a function of us having these first two parts available next year. Yes."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. It is now my pleasure to introduce your speaker, Mr. Alan Andreini. Your line is open.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Sidney. I would like to welcome you to the Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Christopher, our Chief Financial Officer. We've posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you've not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only mode and is being webcast. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including FAD. The reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement.\nJoe Adams: Thank you, Alan, and welcome, everybody, to today's call for the second quarter 2020 results. To start, I'm pleased to announce our 21st dividend as a public company and our 36th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on August 31, based on a shareholder record date of August 17. Now let's start with the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD, or funds available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 2020 was $66.5 million compared to Q1 2020 of $72 million and Q2 of 2019 of $92.7 million. On a normalized basis, excluding the gains or losses from the sales, Q2 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $65.7 million compared to $73.8 million in Q1 2020 and $70.1 million in Q2 of 2019. FAD was $47.3 million in Q2 2020 versus $96 million in Q1 of 2020 and $86.9 million in Q2 2019. On a normalized basis, excluding sale proceeds and nonrecurring items, Q2 2020 FAD was $38.2 million compared to $50.1 million in Q1 of 2020 and $42.7 million in Q2 of 2019. During the second quarter, the $47.3 million FAD number was comprised of $82.1 million from our aviation leasing portfolio, negative $6.7 million from our infrastructure businesses, and negative $28.1 million from corporate and other. Now let's turn to aviation. Aviation had a pretty decent quarter given the circumstances, $77.5 million in Q2 EBITDA after an estimated $20 million negative impact in Q2 from COVID-19. And further, more than half of the impact resulted from fewer hours and cycles flown, which means the hours and cycles are still available and have significant value. Somewhat offsetting the negative, we recognized $8 million in income from early lease terminations, where we proactively took back 7 aircraft and separated the engines as we believe engine demand is and will return faster than airframe demand. During Q2, we negotiated rent deferrals on approximately 20% of the portfolio, averaging 3 months of deferral and return for 3 months of lease term extension. Overall, we collected approximately $75 million in cash from customers, which is approximately 85% of a more normalized run rate without the effect of a pandemic.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Joe. Operator, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator:  And our first question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Joe, you mentioned that during the quarter, you had a 20% deferral rate on some of your leases. But it does sound like your prospects are much more, I guess, relatively bullish looking ahead. Can you just remind us again the utilization estimates that you're running in 3Q? And any deferral or default rates that you're expecting going forward?\nJoe Adams: As I mentioned, on the engine side, we expect Q3 utilization to be about 65% to 70%, which is sort of a -- we always have targeted 50% to 75%. So we think that will be strong and improving. And as I also mentioned earlier, with the lack of airlines doing shop visits, we expect over the balance of the year that the engine market is going to get even stronger. And sometime next year, we even think there'll be a shortage. So the outlook is very good there. On the airframe side, the utilization we actually -- as I mentioned in the remarks, we took back 7 aircraft early. And it was because we felt like either the credits were weak, and they weren't going to survive, or there was a lease term coming up shortly, and it was advantageous for us to get those assets back early. And we took those 7 narrow bodies, and we've scrapped the airframes and put the engines in the engine lease business. Because overall, I think the supply of airframes is going to take longer to use up than the supply of engines. So we think being in the engine market will be better, quicker to get those assets deployed than in the competitive airframe market. On the deferral side, we did say 20% of our portfolio, we gave deferrals. Most of those deferrals or the biggest portion of those were in the 757 and 76 market. Because, as I mentioned, a lot of those operators are just not flying. So that's where probably the highest stress, but it's only about 15% of our portfolio. And ultimately, we think the values of 75s and 76s will be fine because cargo is still very strong, and most of those planes, the excess of those planes will end up being converted to cargo.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Really appreciate that response, and then you did highlight, I think, at the end of your prepared remarks that you're getting close these engine products. I think one product is coming up sooner than one towards the end of the year. Can you just update us on the approval process? And then how does that fit into your commentary about potential -- I think you said a JV partner, MRO structure. Is that something just for your own fleet? Or is this something you want to sell externally too?\nJoe Adams: So I'll start with that. On the MRO side, it's mainly for our own fleet because we're going to have several products. We mentioned 2 that are in development, and we'll have another 3 that we will have in 2022, we'll have about 80% of the oil -- the airfoil portion of shop visit in this joint venture. And we'll have a substantial -- approximately $2 million cost advantage. And we wanted to have a shop that was really dedicated to us to manage our shop visits and make sure there's no interruption and that we have a priority place in the queue. It's not an ownership position. So it's simply a partnership. But with the dramatic change in the MRO business, we've been looking at this for over a year. Now the MRO shops are largely empty. We actually got a significantly better deal with a very large company. And I think it will address all of our needs for our own fleet for the CFM engine over the next 10 years. It'll also allow us -- facilitate us managing the parts. One of the things that we will have an opportunity to do is if we take our engines into shop and we put in these new joint venture parts, we could sell some of the used serviceable material that comes out of that engine, the OEM parts, and that's something also that we want to be able to manage and control as that could be a significant source of income and profits for us going forward, given the volume of business that we see being able to do. The -- and the approval process is, we have been working very collaboratively with the FAA and through this whole period. So there's been a lot of back and forth and a lot of sharing of information, a lot of adjusting, as I said, in terms of what was needed. So with the conclusion of this, the parts are actually made, they've been reviewed. They're being produced tests have been completed. So with the first part, as I mentioned, it's substantially complete. Now it's just up for the final review of the final package. But all of what has been submitted has been seen before. So there's nothing new. So we're very hopeful and confident that, that will all move smoothly as it has to date.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. I appreciate that. Then last one, can you just talk about your current liquidity position? And how that compares to, I think, the 30 aircraft you mentioned in the pipeline that you're looking to acquire. And any commitments on the infrastructure side?\nJoe Adams: Yes. So we just did a $400 million bond deal last week. So that paid down the revolver in full, and we have $150 million-ish, $170 million of cash. So the 2 deals that I mentioned, 30 aircraft, roughly if you ballparked the aircraft at $8 million to $10 million per aircraft, you -- we have plenty of liquidity to close on those deals. With respect to infrastructure, I think the remaining commitment we have is to Repauno was about $10 million for finishing of the ship -- rail-to-ship loading system. So that's -- that will happen in Q3. And Jefferson, the pipeline project, we're anticipating financing all of that in Q3 and Q4 with nonrecourse debt financing at Jefferson as we did in the Q1 of this year in the tax-exempt market. So no significant needs at infrastructure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: Maybe to follow-up on that last question. Joe, could you just talk about how the recent bond deal was received? And going forward, as you think about the different areas you could deploy capital, what's the update on where you would feel comfortable taking leverage going forward?\nJoe Adams: Yes. So the bond deal we did was higher cost, it was probably 300 basis points higher than what we had typically, traditionally done in the high-yield market as a result of the being in the aviation business is not great on a fixed income side and then also with energy exposure. So -- but having said that, the reception was very, very strong. We had over $900 million of orders for the $400 million deal that we did. We launched $300 million and then increased it to $400 million. So very, very good reception. Bonds have traded up. So we're very pleased really to be able to access capital at this point at that pricing. The way on the return side, though, the returns have gone up more than 300 basis points. I would estimate we're seeing higher returns on aviation in the order of 1,000 basis points. So 10 percentage points higher than historically, given that the industry has been tremendously -- never been more distressed, and we're only doing deals right now on CFM engines with government-owned airlines and that have substantial backing. So it's hard to imagine a better set of circumstances for that given that we're not even factoring. When I talk about yield return, I'm not even factoring in the upside from having the joint venture parts that we will have next year -- starting next year or the end of this year. So it's a dream in terms of being able to buy these assets at these prices from government-backed airlines. And I think the reason that it's happening is, a, there's very little competition for us. Nobody else is buying 17-, 18-year-old airplanes; and b, the governments, if you're an airline that's owned by a government, you only have 2 choices. You can go find people like us and that allows you to go back to the government and say, I don't need as much money. I can take less and -- or conversely, if you don't do the deal, you have to go ask the government for more money, which is not very popular. So that's why I think the deals -- the market is so attractive. In terms of leverage, we've always targeted 50%. We're on a nonrecourse debt basis, we're about 50.6%, I think, or something. So we're right at the level we've targeted. Obviously, this environment is one where you'd want to have lower leverage, not higher leverage. So I think we'll look again to potentially issue preferred stock as we've done before to bring some of the leverage down and then just take advantage potentially of monetizing asset sales as we did with Long Ridge and CMQR last year. We could potentially sell minority stakes in some of the infra or do other things to raise capital but not really looking to take leverage up much from here.\nJustin Long: Okay. That's really helpful. And going back to what you said on the COVID headwind. I guess, now you're expecting it to be $50 million or less. As we think about these aviation deals that are in the pipeline, if you just get 1 of these 2 deals done, do you think that's enough to kind of fill the COVID hole this year?\nJoe Adams: Yes. The first deal with Air France, I would -- it's approximately $20 million of additional EBITDA. And the second deal we're working on right now is probably $40 million, and the third deal is about $25 million. So if you add all that up, you get well above the $50 million.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ari Rosa with Bank of America.\nAri Rosa: So Joe, I was hoping you could address the variability in demand patterns for aviation assets across regions and just offer some thoughts on what you think the lingering effects of COVID could be in terms of the types of negotiations that you have and not necessarily specific to FTAI, but also just kind of across the industry. How the experience of COVID kind of changes those negotiations and the overall market for aviation leasing?\nJoe Adams: Yes. Sure. So several points. I think regionally, I mean, our view isn't dramatically different than anybody else's. And that it's -- Asia has recovered the fastest, and you can see it in China, Vietnam, Korea, other markets in Asia have done pretty well considering on the domestic side. So I mean, long-haul international is going to be challenged for many several years. And so I would not want to own a lot of 777s and A330s and we don't own any. So then Europe is now sort of coming on where a lot of countries have gotten the virus largely under control, and the flights are opening up. And domestic flights in Air France, Alitalia, THY, Lufthansa, they're all starting to add in the domestic markets, which is what I -- we care about the most. Long term, what I mentioned is I wouldn't necessarily want to be facing a lot of new deliveries of aircraft in the next few years. Because you can imagine that's not going to be very -- that's going to be hard, given that there's going to be surplus equipment. So putting a new asset on lease of almost any kind is going to be difficult. But when I look at our -- where we're positioned is we're the engine people. And what has happened previously in crisis, and this is one, but it's much bigger is that airlines stop putting engines through major overhauls. And we've seen -- we've had that discussion with every big airline. They all confirm it. You see articles confirming the same thing. You see maintenance and repair shops are emptying out. So it's happening. But at the same time, people are flying those airplanes and they're using up the green time. So that, for us, means that sometime in early 2021. There's going to be increased demand for leased engines once people use up their green time in their existing fleet, and there'll probably be a shortage. So that's perfect timing to have our products that we're developing, which we expect to get approved this year, our maintenance joint venture, which we hope to announce this quarter and finalize very close. And we're trying to add as many CFM engines at good prices as we can right now. That's what the Air France deal was and the other 2 deals. We're looking at are all the same, CFM 56 engines. So that's where we're focused and headed. And I think it's a great -- it's actually not that you want to benefit from this. But I think that being positioned there where you can see that's where the puck is going to be, and that's what we're trying to skate to.\nAri Rosa: Got it. Understood. So it sounds really exciting for FTAI, and congratulations on navigating, obviously, a very difficult market. So turning to the FAD. It continues to be well in excess of the dividend -- or maybe not well in excess, but comfortably in excess of the dividend in what's probably one of the most difficult quarters that anyone will face in the kind of businesses that you're in. Any thoughts on either increasing the dividend or thoughts around kind of uses of capital for that spread between where FAD is coming in and where the dividend is at?\nJoe Adams: Well, we have great aviation investment opportunities. So with these returns, that's where my -- our priority would be to invest in CFM engines just like we're doing. So I see those -- the airlines are not going to get out of distress quickly. It's going to go on. So I think there's going to be more deals. So we have good uses. In terms of the dividend, I mean, it's been always been an important part of our shareholder investments thesis and maintaining that. And this quarter was important for us, and we've done that. And so I think that, that feels like a great place to be to have gone through what is arguably one of the worst environments ever for both aviation and energy and not reduce the dividend and also have great investment opportunities. So I feel like we're in a good spot.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company.\nJosh Sullivan: Congrats on the quarter. Just a question on the PMA part opportunity in commercial production. Can you give us a flavor of how deep in discussions you are with airline customers at this point? Do you have any LOIs or orders from airlines or other customers? And then how do you see the go-to-market strategy unfolding with the joint venture?\nJoe Adams: Yes. There are several orders that were both orders or 2 orders that are sizable were in before COVID hit. So yes, there are customers, and there are people who have put in preproduction orders, which is a good sign. Once COVID hit, obviously, it was very hard to get airlines to focus on this. And so it's kind of -- I would say, went into a marketing lull preapproval, but every airline, we talk to is interested in 2 things: one is reducing costs, and this is a way to do that; and secondly, reducing any capital investment. And so the opportunity for us is to offer a total solution to an airline and say, we will manage the shop visit for you. We'll put in our proprietary products into the engine and lease them to you on a power, almost like a PBH, power by the hour, business. So that, I think, will get a very, very good reception once we're through a little bit more of this and people are, sort of, back to a more normal environment, which I think will be the end of this year, by the end of Q4.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. And then just turning over to the cargo market. What's the timing calculus between returning passenger value capacity, freighter conversions. We have seen some cargo rates come back to Earth. But if IAD and others are looking at, say, kind of a 2023 return of global passenger traffic. How should we think about the tightness in the cargo market between now and then?\nJoe Adams: I think it's going to be tight. I mean it's just hard to add a lot of supply of cargo airplanes. So to the extent you've got this excess demand, and which is coming really from -- the 2 things that are happening is, one is the passenger planes are not flying as much on those international routes, which is a lot of the capacity, but also e-commerce is growing very rapidly. So we see demand, particular, a number of 737-800 aircraft that we were looking at, where people are looking at converting them and putting them into China in the domestic market in China, which has barely scratched the surface. So I think the outlook for cargo is pretty good for the next 2 to 3 years. I think anybody that forecast longer than that in aviation is sort of kidding themselves. But it does feel like there's 2 -- those 2 fundamentals are pretty strong. And it's hard to create a lot of cargo aircraft capacity that quickly.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Giuliano Bologna with BTIG.\nGiuliano Anderes: Congrats on successfully navigating a pretty tough environment here. I guess jumping in on the aviation side. Obviously, as you built out the portfolio of CFM56s, you become an increasingly relevant player in that market. I'd be curious where you are in terms of the number of CFM56 engines that you have in the portfolio with Air France? And then where you could go with the other transactions?\nJoe Adams: Do you have that number, Scott?\nScott Christopher: I can -- Yes, I just don't have it right off the top of my head here. I can get it a second though.\nGiuliano Anderes: In the interim, I'll jump in on the -- kind of switching over to the Engine Repair JV topic. I'd be curious, since you have some orders, I believe, on for some of the parts, how fast could you ramp up and ship some of those products and start recognizing your 25% share of the economics on those?\nJoe Adams: So our partner has been preparing for production all along and is in very good shape to produce products quite quickly, and there's not a significant bottleneck in the production. The only thing when you do start up production, what typically happens is your yield starts out a little bit low and that increases as you make more of the parts. So in the beginning, there'll be more scrapping and then the production will ramp up very quickly. So the facilities, the capability, the castings, the machining and the coatings are all readied and available for a very quick ramp-up.\nGiuliano Anderes: That makes sense. And kind of switching gears a little bit here. I realize that asset values on the infrastructure side are probably not back yet, and will probably take some time to recover. But if you're able to get some deals done with Long Ridge and potentially start scaling Jefferson, would you consider selling the remaining 50% stake in Long Ridge or selling a partial stake in Jefferson in the near term, call it, a year or 2 years and redeploy some of that capital either into aviation assets or related investments like an MRO type of platform that would help scale the leasing business?\nJoe Adams: Yes. I think we're going to have a great MRO deal without having to buy an MRO, which is what I -- that would be my preference. But yes, we would be open to that. And I do think that probably the time to sell Long Ridge is when it's operating. And it should be -- they're targeting --  is now saying potentially September. It was originally promised for November of 2021, and they're saying September now and maybe August. So we should be -- could be operating in a little over a year, which would be great. And that's when I think -- that's where we have the longest contract coverage, and you take away the issue that some buyers have. They just don't buy things that are not operating. So you get access to potentially the lowest-cost capital in the infrastructure world, which is fully contracted and operating. And so I think that would be -- that's something that we would definitely think about. Jefferson as well, it's -- these pipeline projects are a huge step change for the capabilities of the terminal. And what it does is allows us to compete in much bigger projects. So it's not just crude by rail or refined products to Mexico, it's serving refineries and exporting refined products for the 2 largest refineries in North America. So that's what this will allow us to do. And I wouldn't want to sell without getting the benefit of all the work that we've done to get it to this point. So -- but that's definitely something that we would consider as well as we did last year. And the markets are coming back. I think there were a number of sale processes, which were -- as people were thinking of launching in April and May, and they stopped. Obviously, it is not a great M&A market, but we see them restarting now. So people are confident that values are back. And so I think that the M&A market will start to pick up. And in particular, there's a tremendous amount of infrastructure capital that's still being raised. There's a lot of it now being raised in Europe. European companies are looking to invest in North America. So I think the infrastructure, from an M&A standpoint, will be strong, particularly, with 0 interest rates for the next -- who knows how long.\nGiuliano Anderes: That's great and then just -- that makes a lot of sense. And then just pivoting over to the dividend kind of a payout. I realize that there are a lot of opportunities on the investment side, they're extremely attractive. So there's probably a balance in the -- at least in the near term in terms of talking about moving the distribution and also getting the recovery as you invest more into other aviation assets and get more accretion and also get the -- and as the impact of deferrals roll off, you should see a significant boost in kind of both EBITDA and FAD probably into the end of the year and into '21. I'd be curious what kind of levers you're looking at in terms of drive -- potentially driving an increase in the distribution?\nJoe Adams: Well, we've always said we wanted 2:1 coverage. So once we exceed that, that's when we would look at raising the dividend. And as -- you're right, there's a potential that it could ramp meaningfully late this year or early next year.\nScott Christopher: Yes. And just for the follow-up with respect to the CFM engines. Currently, we have 145 CFM engines and then pro forma for the 2 new deals, we'd have over 200 plus.\nJoe Adams: So 200, and I would say that there are 22,000 CFM56 engines out in the world. So just to give you a sense of the total market, is enormous. And we're still -- we are one of the bigger players, but we're not, by any means, close to being considered that big and a market mover yet.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Frank Galanti with Stifel.\nFrank Galanti: Congrats on the strong quarter. I wanted to follow-up on the engine business. I was actually pretty surprised that you guys expect to get back to utilization above 65% in 3Q. So to that end, good job on that. But those 40 new leases that you signed in the quarter, can you give us a sense for who those lessees were kind of geographically, end market? And then what those rates were comparable to a year ago or, I guess, the end of last year?\nJoe Adams: The biggest uptake is Europe. And the rates are comparable. I mean there's not a lot of rate pressure on engine leasing right now. And I don't foresee it happening. I just see it going the other way potentially.\nFrank Galanti: Okay. And so the -- I guess, to follow-up on the aviation market, the leasing market. Obviously, the largest toggle for anybody's investment case in FTAI and aviation assets specifically is based on expectations around effectively aircraft utilization and the implications that will have for the burn rate on green time that currently exists. To that end, would you be able to add any color on how much green time exists for the engines that you guys focus on?\nJoe Adams: Yes. We actually -- we did our own analysis, and then we hired an independent appraiser to do an independent analysis. And we looked at both, the CFM56-5B, which is on A320 and the 7B, which is on the 737NG. And both our numbers and the expert's numbers came out saying that sometime around the end of Q1, the available supply of engines will be less than the demand for those engines, so Q1 of 2021. So by the end of this year, people expect probably 75%, 80% of the A320 and 737 aircraft to be flying globally. And then assuming that happens, then you basically, with the limited number of shop visits, you basically are out of engines by the end of Q1. We can share that information with you. We have that available. I think it's in the slide deck, or one of our decks.\nFrank Galanti: That would be great. I'll follow up off-line.\nJoe Adams: Yes.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Most questions have been asked here. But I want to just come back to the sale-leaseback transactions and the opportunity. So Joe, you walked through what's driving them right now, which makes sense. There's not a lot of competition, which is a pretty good position to be in. Do you see the window of opportunities like these closing just as economies reopen and flying increases? Or is this kind of a several year opportunity? And then I'm assuming that you guys are probably getting a fair amount of attention in the market for these deals, especially if these other couple come together. So I suspect that could actually drive more to you to the extent, there's going to be more activity like this in the market?\nJoe Adams: Yes. I think there'll be more because as I mentioned, airlines are not going to be unstressed for quite a while. So their mode is going to be looking at anything they can do to generate cash, and selling and leasing back some of their older equipment, which they plan to phase out, is obviously attractive. Because several people are doing it, and I think more will do it. So I don't see it ending right away, but you can never be sure. Markets -- when markets get distressed, capital flows in and you don't want to wait around and assume that, that's going to be the case. So I think that these deals are here and now, and that's why we're acting. But I do think that it's not going to be the end of it. And the beauty about our strategy is that we have 2 ways to monetize those assets, you can actually keep them as an airplane and lease them to somebody else. And by the way, whenever an airline tells you they're going to phase out an airplane, they almost never get the timing right. They're almost always -- keep those assets longer than they think, I would say, 90% of the time. So that's an opportunity for extensions. But not that you count on that, but it usually happens. But we can -- we have the opportunity to keep it as an airplane or scrap the airframe, which is our base case and just lease the engines. And I see a number of airlines on the horizon where we could develop leasing programs for the CFM56 engine for their entire needs. So they don't have to do any shop so as they don't have to do any acquiring of engines. They can rely solely on us. And we have a cost advantage in the shop visit. We can manage that shop visit for $3 million versus a $6 million average industry cost. And so that delta is something that we're going to, obviously, point out and make sure that we can grow that business by taking advantage of that and still generate amazing returns.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. And then just a follow-up here. I know this is our job as analysts here. But at $15, it doesn't feel like, at least to us, the valuation is getting a lot of credit for the forward opportunity, which I'm assuming you agree with. But I appreciate there's a lot of moving parts to the story right now. So it can sometimes be complex from the outside to look at. As you evolve the firm to more of a vertically integrated aviation company, which it feels like is where we're headed here, given the opportunity set, need to deploy capital. As you potentially exit some of the infrastructure assets, how are you thinking about what that does for, call it, the firm-wide valuation? What -- I'm assuming there has to be some calculus around as you have to think about allocating capital for the different opportunities?\nJoe Adams: Yes. Well, it's a good question. We've acknowledged that sometimes, our story is too complicated, and we would benefit by simplifying it. And simplifying it as we grow the joint venture and the engine business, that could be a separate business, a separate company, which might be better as a stand-alone asset. So that's a goal. Obviously, we didn't expect this kind of disruption that hit us. We had the best quarter ever in Q1, and then starting in April, the world shut down. So I think everything is -- on that side, it's a goal. It's something we'd like to move towards. Obviously, the stock is better now than it was in May. But it is still not reflective of what we think it will be. But I'm not complaining. I'm just saying, we are going to work hard to get it there.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nJames Monigan: It's James Monigan on for Chris. Just wanted to follow up on that last question about the -- with respect -- the transactions. You described the sale leasebacks. I just wanted to understand you're still handling the maintenance on those engines and those assets. Or are these more, sort of, financially opportunistic transactions? Just wanted to understand how these might be -- these transactions coming up might be different than what you typically do? And or if that's even the case and sort of how it might fit into your long-term strategy? Just kind of wanted to get your viewer thoughts there.\nJoe Adams: The transactions are very similar to what we have been doing. It's just -- I'd say 2 differences. One is they're bigger. We're acquiring more assets at one time. So you do a 15-aircraft deal instead of 1 or 2 airplanes. And so larger transaction, they also involve government-owned airlines, which is something previously a lot of government-owned airlines would never have considered doing these transactions, but the financial reality today has changed enough that they are looking at everything. So that market opportunity is new to us. But the fundamental deal is the same in that we're going to own an airplane. At the end of the lease, when it comes back to us, we will have an airplane with engines on it. And what we've typically done is that gives us a choice if we're going to release it, we -- if there's people that want to release the whole airplane with the engines, we could do that. But alternatively, we've been able and very successful in selling off the airframes and then just leasing the engines. And in large part, we get almost the same cash flow from the 2 engines as you get from a whole airplane and you end up putting money in your pocket by selling the airframe. So there's been great financially. And from a flexibility point of view, it's our core strength.\nJames Monigan: Got it. And then also turning to infrastructure. I just wanted to get your updated take on crude by rail and sort of interest you're kind of seeing there, if any? And maybe so to get your view on if there will be and when there would be a rebound?\nJoe Adams: Yes. So I think ignoring the shutdown of the DAPL, which we don't know if that'll happen. But if it did happen, there'd be a lot of crude by rail, all of a sudden, moving. That's out of the Bakken. But that's in the courts. And so we don't know the answer to that. The other market opportunity is Canada, and that is coming back, and we see the spreads widening now back out to normal or showing in the forward market looking normal in Q4 of this year. And in talking with some of the producers and refiners, people are anticipating that crude by rail will still be in the mix. And people are making commitments and looking at investments. And one in particular people are working on still, is -- we talked about the last time or 2 quarters ago was a diluent recovery unit, a DRU. And that's where you build a processing plant in Canada, which strips out the diluent, so that what you're shipping is really undiluted bitumen, and that has to move in rail. So it's -- so if that happens, then we're looking at people making 10-year commitments to crude by rail, which we still believe that will happen. So we're still working on that. But it's obviously, with the spreads down where they are now, there's not a lot of -- not great optimism, but it's definitely coming back.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Rob Salmon with Wolfe Research.\nRob Salmon: A quick kind of -- and perhaps I missed it in the prepared remarks. The asset impairment charge that you guys took in the second quarter, was that related to the 7 aircraft that you proactively returned? Or was this related to something else?\nJoe Adams: Scott, do you want to answer that?\nScott Christopher: Yes. Yes, that related to the early return of some aircraft that we took. We took back 6 aircraft as part of early release -- return of a lease. And then there was 1 engine included in that overall impairment.\nRob Salmon: That's helpful. And another clarification question and then a longer-term one, the clarification question is, when you guys were talking about the percentage of your book that's off lease. I want to say you had mentioned it was 20%. Was that 20% of the 15% that is kind of exposed to the 757, 767 market? Or was that -- 20% is off-lease, and all of that market, basically, is kind of off-lease currently?\nJoe Adams: Well, the 20%, I think you're referring to was the amount of rent deferral we gave to lessees in the quarter. And that was what was in the prepared remarks, if that's what you're referring to. And that's for the entire portfolio.\nRob Salmon: Yes, that was, Joe. Yes. And then I think you'd mentioned that the majority of that was in 757, 67s.\nJoe Adams: The most of this -- yes. Yes, I think 2/3 of that was in the 75 and 767 markets, which is 15% of our portfolio. But the biggest chunk of that deferral was for those aircraft. Because those are the aircraft that are the hardest to fly and lease right now. So the narrow-body fleet is actually performing very well. The engines are doing well. Cargo is doing well. It's -- the 75 and 76 is the most challenged. But it will come back with the freighter market being strong and the leisure markets reopening. It's just slower to develop, but that's where the deferral -- most of the deferrals were there.\nRob Salmon: Got it. Helpful. And then Joe, bigger picture. Just in light of COVID, could you kind of provide us an updated -- your updated thoughts with regard to the engine repair market opportunity for FTAI? Like how should we be thinking about kind of your ultimate share opportunity, potentially things getting pushed out, but maybe you've got a bigger end market now. Just how should we think about those puts-and-takes?\nJoe Adams: Yes. So I actually think it is it is a bigger market because, for instance, Air France doing a deal with us and then talking about engine leasing opportunities with us, Delta telling us they would entertain engine leasing. These are carriers that typically wouldn't have thought about -- they would would've done everything in-house. But with the financial crisis and the cash crisis, they're much more open to outsourcing functions that consume capital, and engine shop visits consume a lot of capital. So with our products that we have coming, on the joint venture side, we can overhaul a CFM56 engine for under $3 million versus an industry cost average of $6 million. And so where I would love to see us get to is being able to go to a larger airline. Obviously, we're going to do our own fleet the way we're doing it. But you could go to a larger airline and you could say, we'll do all of your CFM56 engines for you, and here's your hourly rate. And you're done, you're out of it, and you don't have to invest capital. You don't have to manage that and you get a rate that saves you money and doesn't require you to invest capital in shop visits. So that opportunity, I think, is coming much, much faster than it would have otherwise because of the crisis. And as I mentioned, the CFM engine is 22,000 engines in the world. It's not going away for the next 15 and maybe 30 years. They're still making the aircraft and there -- a lot of the 737-800s are going to be converted into cargo airplanes to replace the 757. So that -- that's going to have demand for many, many years. So I think the opportunity is fantastic for us. And one of the things I mentioned also is we do want to have a maintenance MRO partner, and we're very close to finalizing that deal. So I think we'll have all the pieces in place to actually do this.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Dodd with Raymond James.\nRobert Dodd: Congrats on the quarter. One more about aviation. And you mentioned, Joe, in the prepared remarks that the deal with the MRO could give you a -- part of it would be to get a preferential place in the queue, the shop. And you've talked before about how those can take a while if capacity isn't there. And if we end up with a squeeze on availability for shop visits when green time runs out sometime next year, how much do you think that preferential -- if the deal gets done, that preferential price in the queue could add to kind of value or another way, if we put that plus your cost advantage on a shop visit plus potentially a preferential place in the queue, what could that do to kind of the yield on engine assets, either ROE, EBITDA yield, whichever way you want to look at it, say, a year from now?\nJoe Adams: Well, that's, I mean, terrific question. There's a couple of elements. One is that the preferential treatment, and we're also working on price -- advantageous pricing under the deal and on a fixed basis. So a no surprise basis. And also, one of the things we're focused on working together, and one of the reasons we want to do this as a partnership is we want to shorten the time an engine is in the shop. Because often, an engine will go in, and everything is done in sequence, and you might be waiting months for a single section of the engine before the whole engine can come out. And so part of our design is to create module inventory. And as I've mentioned before, the CFM56 engine has 4 modules. And so to the extent the work is needed primarily on 1 module, you could swap 1 module out of an engine and be out of the shop in 15 days instead of 6 months. So there's tremendous benefits. The other benefit, as I alluded to, was being able to monetize parts. And to the extent we have our own MRO shop partner, we'll be better -- we'll be able to better manage the parts that come out of that engine and be more effective at that. So when you put all that together, if you think about today, you can earn 25% or 30% unlevered on an engine. And if the average shop cost is $6 million, and our cost drops to $3 million, then we should earn 50% unlevered. And actually, those are not -- sounds high, but maybe somewhere between 25 and 50, but not -- it's definitely going to be going up, particularly if it's a tight market, and we can turn the inventory faster.\nRobert Dodd: I appreciate that. And then one more kind of structurally. Obviously, the aviation business, you've mentioned might make sense as a stand-alone entity. It probably would make more sense as a stand-alone C-corp entity rather than an LLC. And if you were to sell off stakes or spin the other parts that could make sense. So is that -- obviously, we've talked about a C-corp conversion before, is that still on the table? Any idea about the time frame for that? Would it make sense to do it while the infrastructure assets are still owned? Or can you give us any thoughts there?\nJoe Adams: Yes. The goal would be to get rid of K-1s because we know that's not helpful. So yes, to convert to C-corp is definitely on the table. And it's something -- I don't have a specific time line on it, but it's rising up in terms of the priority level. We're working on it. But -- and we do think it has value on multiple fronts, but I don't have a specific time line.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from Scott Buck with B. Riley.\nScott Buck: Assuming you're able to close in the 2 aviation asset transactions. Does that change the way you think about additional asset acquisitions for 2021? Or do you continue to be fairly active in the market next year?\nJoe Adams: I think we continue to be active. Because as I mentioned, the CFM56 market is enormous. And our advantage is huge. And so I think we would continue to capitalize on that to the extent it advances the business, and you can generate those types of returns.\nScott Buck: Great. And have you seen any material change in the asset pricing in -- here in July versus the Air France deal back in April and May?\nJoe Adams: No.\nOperator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the conference back to your speaker, Alan Andreini for any further remarks.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Sidney. And thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q3.\nJoe Adams: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Adams",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan, and welcome, everybody, to today's call for the second quarter 2020 results. To start, I'm pleased to announce our 21st dividend as a public company and our 36th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on August 31, based on a shareholder record date of August 17. Now let's start with the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD, or funds available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 2020 was $66.5 million compared to Q1 2020 of $72 million and Q2 of 2019 of $92.7 million. On a normalized basis, excluding the gains or losses from the sales, Q2 2020 adjusted EBITDA was $65.7 million compared to $73.8 million in Q1 2020 and $70.1 million in Q2 of 2019. FAD was $47.3 million in Q2 2020 versus $96 million in Q1 of 2020 and $86.9 million in Q2 2019. On a normalized basis, excluding sale proceeds and nonrecurring items, Q2 2020 FAD was $38.2 million compared to $50.1 million in Q1 of 2020 and $42.7 million in Q2 of 2019. During the second quarter, the $47.3 million FAD number was comprised of $82.1 million from our aviation leasing portfolio, negative $6.7 million from our infrastructure businesses, and negative $28.1 million from corporate and other. Now let's turn to aviation. Aviation had a pretty decent quarter given the circumstances, $77.5 million in Q2 EBITDA after an estimated $20 million negative impact in Q2 from COVID-19. And further, more than half of the impact resulted from fewer hours and cycles flown, which means the hours and cycles are still available and have significant value. Somewhat offsetting the negative, we recognized $8 million in income from early lease terminations, where we proactively took back 7 aircraft and separated the engines as we believe engine demand is and will return faster than airframe demand. During Q2, we negotiated rent deferrals on approximately 20% of the portfolio, averaging 3 months of deferral and return for 3 months of lease term extension. Overall, we collected approximately $75 million in cash from customers, which is approximately 85% of a more normalized run rate without the effect of a pandemic. As I mentioned, on the engine side, we expect Q3 utilization to be about 65% to 70%, which is sort of a -- we always have targeted 50% to 75%. So we think that will be strong and improving. And as I also mentioned earlier, with the lack of airlines doing shop visits, we expect over the balance of the year that the engine market is going to get even stronger. And sometime next year, we even think there'll be a shortage. So the outlook is very good there. On the airframe side, the utilization we actually -- as I mentioned in the remarks, we took back 7 aircraft early. And it was because we felt like either the credits were weak, and they weren't going to survive, or there was a lease term coming up shortly, and it was advantageous for us to get those assets back early. And we took those 7 narrow bodies, and we've scrapped the airframes and put the engines in the engine lease business. Because overall, I think the supply of airframes is going to take longer to use up than the supply of engines. So we think being in the engine market will be better, quicker to get those assets deployed than in the competitive airframe market. On the deferral side, we did say 20% of our portfolio, we gave deferrals. Most of those deferrals or the biggest portion of those were in the 757 and 76 market. Because, as I mentioned, a lot of those operators are just not flying. So that's where probably the highest stress, but it's only about 15% of our portfolio. And ultimately, we think the values of 75s and 76s will be fine because cargo is still very strong, and most of those planes, the excess of those planes will end up being converted to cargo. So I'll start with that. On the MRO side, it's mainly for our own fleet because we're going to have several products. We mentioned 2 that are in development, and we'll have another 3 that we will have in 2022, we'll have about 80% of the oil -- the airfoil portion of shop visit in this joint venture. And we'll have a substantial -- approximately $2 million cost advantage. And we wanted to have a shop that was really dedicated to us to manage our shop visits and make sure there's no interruption and that we have a priority place in the queue. It's not an ownership position. So it's simply a partnership. But with the dramatic change in the MRO business, we've been looking at this for over a year. Now the MRO shops are largely empty. We actually got a significantly better deal with a very large company. And I think it will address all of our needs for our own fleet for the CFM engine over the next 10 years. It'll also allow us -- facilitate us managing the parts. One of the things that we will have an opportunity to do is if we take our engines into shop and we put in these new joint venture parts, we could sell some of the used serviceable material that comes out of that engine, the OEM parts, and that's something also that we want to be able to manage and control as that could be a significant source of income and profits for us going forward, given the volume of business that we see being able to do. The -- and the approval process is, we have been working very collaboratively with the FAA and through this whole period. So there's been a lot of back and forth and a lot of sharing of information, a lot of adjusting, as I said, in terms of what was needed. So with the conclusion of this, the parts are actually made, they've been reviewed. They're being produced tests have been completed. So with the first part, as I mentioned, it's substantially complete. Now it's just up for the final review of the final package. But all of what has been submitted has been seen before. So there's nothing new. So we're very hopeful and confident that, that will all move smoothly as it has to date. Yes. So we just did a $400 million bond deal last week. So that paid down the revolver in full, and we have $150 million-ish, $170 million of cash. So the 2 deals that I mentioned, 30 aircraft, roughly if you ballparked the aircraft at $8 million to $10 million per aircraft, you -- we have plenty of liquidity to close on those deals. With respect to infrastructure, I think the remaining commitment we have is to Repauno was about $10 million for finishing of the ship -- rail-to-ship loading system. So that's -- that will happen in Q3. And Jefferson, the pipeline project, we're anticipating financing all of that in Q3 and Q4 with nonrecourse debt financing at Jefferson as we did in the Q1 of this year in the tax-exempt market. So no significant needs at infrastructure. Yes. So the bond deal we did was higher cost, it was probably 300 basis points higher than what we had typically, traditionally done in the high-yield market as a result of the being in the aviation business is not great on a fixed income side and then also with energy exposure. So -- but having said that, the reception was very, very strong. We had over $900 million of orders for the $400 million deal that we did. We launched $300 million and then increased it to $400 million. So very, very good reception. Bonds have traded up. So we're very pleased really to be able to access capital at this point at that pricing. The way on the return side, though, the returns have gone up more than 300 basis points. I would estimate we're seeing higher returns on aviation in the order of 1,000 basis points. So 10 percentage points higher than historically, given that the industry has been tremendously -- never been more distressed, and we're only doing deals right now on CFM engines with government-owned airlines and that have substantial backing. So it's hard to imagine a better set of circumstances for that given that we're not even factoring. When I talk about yield return, I'm not even factoring in the upside from having the joint venture parts that we will have next year -- starting next year or the end of this year. So it's a dream in terms of being able to buy these assets at these prices from government-backed airlines. And I think the reason that it's happening is, a, there's very little competition for us. Nobody else is buying 17-, 18-year-old airplanes; and b, the governments, if you're an airline that's owned by a government, you only have 2 choices. You can go find people like us and that allows you to go back to the government and say, I don't need as much money. I can take less and -- or conversely, if you don't do the deal, you have to go ask the government for more money, which is not very popular. So that's why I think the deals -- the market is so attractive. In terms of leverage, we've always targeted 50%. We're on a nonrecourse debt basis, we're about 50.6%, I think, or something. So we're right at the level we've targeted. Obviously, this environment is one where you'd want to have lower leverage, not higher leverage. So I think we'll look again to potentially issue preferred stock as we've done before to bring some of the leverage down and then just take advantage potentially of monetizing asset sales as we did with Long Ridge and CMQR last year. We could potentially sell minority stakes in some of the infra or do other things to raise capital but not really looking to take leverage up much from here. Yes. The first deal with Air France, I would -- it's approximately $20 million of additional EBITDA. And the second deal we're working on right now is probably $40 million, and the third deal is about $25 million. So if you add all that up, you get well above the $50 million. Yes. Sure. So several points. I think regionally, I mean, our view isn't dramatically different than anybody else's. And that it's -- Asia has recovered the fastest, and you can see it in China, Vietnam, Korea, other markets in Asia have done pretty well considering on the domestic side. So I mean, long-haul international is going to be challenged for many several years. And so I would not want to own a lot of 777s and A330s and we don't own any. So then Europe is now sort of coming on where a lot of countries have gotten the virus largely under control, and the flights are opening up. And domestic flights in Air France, Alitalia, THY, Lufthansa, they're all starting to add in the domestic markets, which is what I -- we care about the most. Long term, what I mentioned is I wouldn't necessarily want to be facing a lot of new deliveries of aircraft in the next few years. Because you can imagine that's not going to be very -- that's going to be hard, given that there's going to be surplus equipment. So putting a new asset on lease of almost any kind is going to be difficult. But when I look at our -- where we're positioned is we're the engine people. And what has happened previously in crisis, and this is one, but it's much bigger is that airlines stop putting engines through major overhauls. And we've seen -- we've had that discussion with every big airline. They all confirm it. You see articles confirming the same thing. You see maintenance and repair shops are emptying out. So it's happening. But at the same time, people are flying those airplanes and they're using up the green time. So that, for us, means that sometime in early 2021. There's going to be increased demand for leased engines once people use up their green time in their existing fleet, and there'll probably be a shortage. So that's perfect timing to have our products that we're developing, which we expect to get approved this year, our maintenance joint venture, which we hope to announce this quarter and finalize very close. And we're trying to add as many CFM engines at good prices as we can right now. That's what the Air France deal was and the other 2 deals. We're looking at are all the same, CFM 56 engines. So that's where we're focused and headed. And I think it's a great -- it's actually not that you want to benefit from this. But I think that being positioned there where you can see that's where the puck is going to be, and that's what we're trying to skate to. Well, we have great aviation investment opportunities. So with these returns, that's where my -- our priority would be to invest in CFM engines just like we're doing. So I see those -- the airlines are not going to get out of distress quickly. It's going to go on. So I think there's going to be more deals. So we have good uses. In terms of the dividend, I mean, it's been always been an important part of our shareholder investments thesis and maintaining that. And this quarter was important for us, and we've done that. And so I think that, that feels like a great place to be to have gone through what is arguably one of the worst environments ever for both aviation and energy and not reduce the dividend and also have great investment opportunities. So I feel like we're in a good spot. Yes. There are several orders that were both orders or 2 orders that are sizable were in before COVID hit. So yes, there are customers, and there are people who have put in preproduction orders, which is a good sign. Once COVID hit, obviously, it was very hard to get airlines to focus on this. And so it's kind of -- I would say, went into a marketing lull preapproval, but every airline, we talk to is interested in 2 things: one is reducing costs, and this is a way to do that; and secondly, reducing any capital investment. And so the opportunity for us is to offer a total solution to an airline and say, we will manage the shop visit for you. We'll put in our proprietary products into the engine and lease them to you on a power, almost like a PBH, power by the hour, business. So that, I think, will get a very, very good reception once we're through a little bit more of this and people are, sort of, back to a more normal environment, which I think will be the end of this year, by the end of Q4. I think it's going to be tight. I mean it's just hard to add a lot of supply of cargo airplanes. So to the extent you've got this excess demand, and which is coming really from -- the 2 things that are happening is, one is the passenger planes are not flying as much on those international routes, which is a lot of the capacity, but also e-commerce is growing very rapidly. So we see demand, particular, a number of 737-800 aircraft that we were looking at, where people are looking at converting them and putting them into China in the domestic market in China, which has barely scratched the surface. So I think the outlook for cargo is pretty good for the next 2 to 3 years. I think anybody that forecast longer than that in aviation is sort of kidding themselves. But it does feel like there's 2 -- those 2 fundamentals are pretty strong. And it's hard to create a lot of cargo aircraft capacity that quickly. Do you have that number, Scott? So our partner has been preparing for production all along and is in very good shape to produce products quite quickly, and there's not a significant bottleneck in the production. The only thing when you do start up production, what typically happens is your yield starts out a little bit low and that increases as you make more of the parts. So in the beginning, there'll be more scrapping and then the production will ramp up very quickly. So the facilities, the capability, the castings, the machining and the coatings are all readied and available for a very quick ramp-up. Yes. I think we're going to have a great MRO deal without having to buy an MRO, which is what I -- that would be my preference. But yes, we would be open to that. And I do think that probably the time to sell Long Ridge is when it's operating. And it should be -- they're targeting --  is now saying potentially September. It was originally promised for November of 2021, and they're saying September now and maybe August. So we should be -- could be operating in a little over a year, which would be great. And that's when I think -- that's where we have the longest contract coverage, and you take away the issue that some buyers have. They just don't buy things that are not operating. So you get access to potentially the lowest-cost capital in the infrastructure world, which is fully contracted and operating. And so I think that would be -- that's something that we would definitely think about. Jefferson as well, it's -- these pipeline projects are a huge step change for the capabilities of the terminal. And what it does is allows us to compete in much bigger projects. So it's not just crude by rail or refined products to Mexico, it's serving refineries and exporting refined products for the 2 largest refineries in North America. So that's what this will allow us to do. And I wouldn't want to sell without getting the benefit of all the work that we've done to get it to this point. So -- but that's definitely something that we would consider as well as we did last year. And the markets are coming back. I think there were a number of sale processes, which were -- as people were thinking of launching in April and May, and they stopped. Obviously, it is not a great M&A market, but we see them restarting now. So people are confident that values are back. And so I think that the M&A market will start to pick up. And in particular, there's a tremendous amount of infrastructure capital that's still being raised. There's a lot of it now being raised in Europe. European companies are looking to invest in North America. So I think the infrastructure, from an M&A standpoint, will be strong, particularly, with 0 interest rates for the next -- who knows how long. Well, we've always said we wanted 2:1 coverage. So once we exceed that, that's when we would look at raising the dividend. And as -- you're right, there's a potential that it could ramp meaningfully late this year or early next year. So 200, and I would say that there are 22,000 CFM56 engines out in the world. So just to give you a sense of the total market, is enormous. And we're still -- we are one of the bigger players, but we're not, by any means, close to being considered that big and a market mover yet. The biggest uptake is Europe. And the rates are comparable. I mean there's not a lot of rate pressure on engine leasing right now. And I don't foresee it happening. I just see it going the other way potentially. Yes. We actually -- we did our own analysis, and then we hired an independent appraiser to do an independent analysis. And we looked at both, the CFM56-5B, which is on A320 and the 7B, which is on the 737NG. And both our numbers and the expert's numbers came out saying that sometime around the end of Q1, the available supply of engines will be less than the demand for those engines, so Q1 of 2021. So by the end of this year, people expect probably 75%, 80% of the A320 and 737 aircraft to be flying globally. And then assuming that happens, then you basically, with the limited number of shop visits, you basically are out of engines by the end of Q1. We can share that information with you. We have that available. I think it's in the slide deck, or one of our decks. Yes. Yes. I think there'll be more because as I mentioned, airlines are not going to be unstressed for quite a while. So their mode is going to be looking at anything they can do to generate cash, and selling and leasing back some of their older equipment, which they plan to phase out, is obviously attractive. Because several people are doing it, and I think more will do it. So I don't see it ending right away, but you can never be sure. Markets -- when markets get distressed, capital flows in and you don't want to wait around and assume that, that's going to be the case. So I think that these deals are here and now, and that's why we're acting. But I do think that it's not going to be the end of it. And the beauty about our strategy is that we have 2 ways to monetize those assets, you can actually keep them as an airplane and lease them to somebody else. And by the way, whenever an airline tells you they're going to phase out an airplane, they almost never get the timing right. They're almost always -- keep those assets longer than they think, I would say, 90% of the time. So that's an opportunity for extensions. But not that you count on that, but it usually happens. But we can -- we have the opportunity to keep it as an airplane or scrap the airframe, which is our base case and just lease the engines. And I see a number of airlines on the horizon where we could develop leasing programs for the CFM56 engine for their entire needs. So they don't have to do any shop so as they don't have to do any acquiring of engines. They can rely solely on us. And we have a cost advantage in the shop visit. We can manage that shop visit for $3 million versus a $6 million average industry cost. And so that delta is something that we're going to, obviously, point out and make sure that we can grow that business by taking advantage of that and still generate amazing returns. Yes. Well, it's a good question. We've acknowledged that sometimes, our story is too complicated, and we would benefit by simplifying it. And simplifying it as we grow the joint venture and the engine business, that could be a separate business, a separate company, which might be better as a stand-alone asset. So that's a goal. Obviously, we didn't expect this kind of disruption that hit us. We had the best quarter ever in Q1, and then starting in April, the world shut down. So I think everything is -- on that side, it's a goal. It's something we'd like to move towards. Obviously, the stock is better now than it was in May. But it is still not reflective of what we think it will be. But I'm not complaining. I'm just saying, we are going to work hard to get it there. The transactions are very similar to what we have been doing. It's just -- I'd say 2 differences. One is they're bigger. We're acquiring more assets at one time. So you do a 15-aircraft deal instead of 1 or 2 airplanes. And so larger transaction, they also involve government-owned airlines, which is something previously a lot of government-owned airlines would never have considered doing these transactions, but the financial reality today has changed enough that they are looking at everything. So that market opportunity is new to us. But the fundamental deal is the same in that we're going to own an airplane. At the end of the lease, when it comes back to us, we will have an airplane with engines on it. And what we've typically done is that gives us a choice if we're going to release it, we -- if there's people that want to release the whole airplane with the engines, we could do that. But alternatively, we've been able and very successful in selling off the airframes and then just leasing the engines. And in large part, we get almost the same cash flow from the 2 engines as you get from a whole airplane and you end up putting money in your pocket by selling the airframe. So there's been great financially. And from a flexibility point of view, it's our core strength. Yes. So I think ignoring the shutdown of the DAPL, which we don't know if that'll happen. But if it did happen, there'd be a lot of crude by rail, all of a sudden, moving. That's out of the Bakken. But that's in the courts. And so we don't know the answer to that. The other market opportunity is Canada, and that is coming back, and we see the spreads widening now back out to normal or showing in the forward market looking normal in Q4 of this year. And in talking with some of the producers and refiners, people are anticipating that crude by rail will still be in the mix. And people are making commitments and looking at investments. And one in particular people are working on still, is -- we talked about the last time or 2 quarters ago was a diluent recovery unit, a DRU. And that's where you build a processing plant in Canada, which strips out the diluent, so that what you're shipping is really undiluted bitumen, and that has to move in rail. So it's -- so if that happens, then we're looking at people making 10-year commitments to crude by rail, which we still believe that will happen. So we're still working on that. But it's obviously, with the spreads down where they are now, there's not a lot of -- not great optimism, but it's definitely coming back. Scott, do you want to answer that? Well, the 20%, I think you're referring to was the amount of rent deferral we gave to lessees in the quarter. And that was what was in the prepared remarks, if that's what you're referring to. And that's for the entire portfolio. The most of this -- yes. Yes, I think 2/3 of that was in the 75 and 767 markets, which is 15% of our portfolio. But the biggest chunk of that deferral was for those aircraft. Because those are the aircraft that are the hardest to fly and lease right now. So the narrow-body fleet is actually performing very well. The engines are doing well. Cargo is doing well. It's -- the 75 and 76 is the most challenged. But it will come back with the freighter market being strong and the leisure markets reopening. It's just slower to develop, but that's where the deferral -- most of the deferrals were there. Yes. So I actually think it is it is a bigger market because, for instance, Air France doing a deal with us and then talking about engine leasing opportunities with us, Delta telling us they would entertain engine leasing. These are carriers that typically wouldn't have thought about -- they would would've done everything in-house. But with the financial crisis and the cash crisis, they're much more open to outsourcing functions that consume capital, and engine shop visits consume a lot of capital. So with our products that we have coming, on the joint venture side, we can overhaul a CFM56 engine for under $3 million versus an industry cost average of $6 million. And so where I would love to see us get to is being able to go to a larger airline. Obviously, we're going to do our own fleet the way we're doing it. But you could go to a larger airline and you could say, we'll do all of your CFM56 engines for you, and here's your hourly rate. And you're done, you're out of it, and you don't have to invest capital. You don't have to manage that and you get a rate that saves you money and doesn't require you to invest capital in shop visits. So that opportunity, I think, is coming much, much faster than it would have otherwise because of the crisis. And as I mentioned, the CFM engine is 22,000 engines in the world. It's not going away for the next 15 and maybe 30 years. They're still making the aircraft and there -- a lot of the 737-800s are going to be converted into cargo airplanes to replace the 757. So that -- that's going to have demand for many, many years. So I think the opportunity is fantastic for us. And one of the things I mentioned also is we do want to have a maintenance MRO partner, and we're very close to finalizing that deal. So I think we'll have all the pieces in place to actually do this. Well, that's, I mean, terrific question. There's a couple of elements. One is that the preferential treatment, and we're also working on price -- advantageous pricing under the deal and on a fixed basis. So a no surprise basis. And also, one of the things we're focused on working together, and one of the reasons we want to do this as a partnership is we want to shorten the time an engine is in the shop. Because often, an engine will go in, and everything is done in sequence, and you might be waiting months for a single section of the engine before the whole engine can come out. And so part of our design is to create module inventory. And as I've mentioned before, the CFM56 engine has 4 modules. And so to the extent the work is needed primarily on 1 module, you could swap 1 module out of an engine and be out of the shop in 15 days instead of 6 months. So there's tremendous benefits. The other benefit, as I alluded to, was being able to monetize parts. And to the extent we have our own MRO shop partner, we'll be better -- we'll be able to better manage the parts that come out of that engine and be more effective at that. So when you put all that together, if you think about today, you can earn 25% or 30% unlevered on an engine. And if the average shop cost is $6 million, and our cost drops to $3 million, then we should earn 50% unlevered. And actually, those are not -- sounds high, but maybe somewhere between 25 and 50, but not -- it's definitely going to be going up, particularly if it's a tight market, and we can turn the inventory faster. Yes. The goal would be to get rid of K-1s because we know that's not helpful. So yes, to convert to C-corp is definitely on the table. And it's something -- I don't have a specific time line on it, but it's rising up in terms of the priority level. We're working on it. But -- and we do think it has value on multiple fronts, but I don't have a specific time line. I think we continue to be active. Because as I mentioned, the CFM56 market is enormous. And our advantage is huge. And so I think we would continue to capitalize on that to the extent it advances the business, and you can generate those types of returns. No. Thanks, everyone."

Currently, we have 145 CFM engines and then pro forma for the 2 new deals, we'd have over 200 plus. Yes. Yes, that related to the early return of some aircraft that we took. We took back 6 aircraft as part of early release -- return of a lease. And then there was 1 engine included in that overall impairment."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.   I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Alan Andreini. Please go ahead, sir.\nAlan Andreini: Thanks Josh. I would like to welcome you to the Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure first quarter 2020 earnings call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer and Scott Christopher, our Chief Financial Officer. We have posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you have not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only mode and is being webcast. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including FAD. The reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements, by their nature, are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks, Alan. Before going into the details, I want to take a moment to thank two groups. First, I want to thank our employees for the tremendous effort they have put into keeping FTAI functioning smoothly over the last six weeks. Your safety was our primary concern and as we implemented procedures to protect you, we made your jobs much more difficult. The way you have responded to this challenge has been nothing short of remarkable. We haven't missed a beat and that's because of you. And for certain it's been extremely helpful that a lot of us who worked together in many cases for more than 10 years. That being said, the way you have taken it to the next level is inspirational. It seems as if the toughest times can bring out the best and talented workforce and you've all shown those qualities and I just want to say thank you on behalf of myself, our Board of Directors and our shareholders. The other group I want to acknowledge are the healthcare professionals, first responders and all essential employees and their families, who are working incredible hours and putting themselves at great risk to make our troubled world a safer place. Your courage and dedication have never been more appreciated or more apparent. Thank you.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Joe. Operator, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may proceed with your question.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. So Joe, circling back to the call last quarter it sounded like there were multiple league  deals in the works. The deal with Air France was announced this week, but are there other sizable deals that you think can materialize in the near-term? And just more generally, how are you thinking about the potential to take advantage of the stressed assets in this type of market?\nJoseph Adams: Thanks Justin. Yes, we do see. There are more deals out there. Virtually every airline is in a - as I refer to it in an extreme cash generation moderate and it\u2019s looking to raise cash every way they can. So sale lease backs and particularly you know like Air France its older equipment which for us is ideal because it's really the engine they were buying. And I think these are from our point of view these are extraordinary deals where you are buying at very, very attractive prices and you have cash flow attached to it. So that's kind of what we're looking at. There's at least one deal that is pretty far along they were working on, that's a little bit bigger than the one we just did and in some ways better, but it's also very \u2013 they are both very attractive. And then there's others that are probably in earlier stages discussion beginning, but I think at six months airlines are going to be looking at everything.\nJustin Long: Make sense. And secondly, obviously the energy environment has come under a lot of pressure. I was wondering if this causes you to make any strategic pivot at Jefferson. You talked about the flexibility there with the different modes of transportation, but can you just kind of level that things and give us your sense if oil prices don't improve meaningfully from here and crude by rail movements go to something close to zero, how should we be thinking about the potential EBITDA range for that asset?\nJoseph Adams: Yes I think the - just from a bigger picture point of view, a lot of midstream assets are going to come under pressure, particularly assets that are gathering related in production gathering related. And this is one of the reasons we really focused on having a terminal next to two big refineries is because when those refineries, they're operating 24/7 and they bring in - Motiva brings in 600,000 barrels of crude a day and 600,000 barrels of product a day. And Exxon is going from 360 to 625. So the beauty of that is that there's always product flowing. That's not always the case if you're next to a well and the well decides they're not going produce any more. So from a strategic point of view that was always our vision and I think the strength of that is very apparent right now and we're very pleased that we don't have sort of gathering infrastructure we have we have terminals that handle both crude and refined products. And really what we focus on is diversifying that because when we originally started the terminal as you recall, we were simply crude by rail and realized you know in 2016 that went away. And so, we had to plan for the possibility that it happened and that's when we have developed the refined products relationship with Exxon. We've added jet fuel to that for export and then we've diversified with Motiva by storing intermediate some fuel oil and also you know bringing in crude by water. So it really is about diversifying and serving the needs of those two customers. And with what's going on in the market, there's so much disruption and dislocation that I think that it gives us the opportunity to further strengthen our relationship with those two big players and potentially add another refinery as well. So I feel strangely that this \u2013 environment could actually help us become more important to those players. And when the market does rebound, be as profitable or more profitable than we ever been in our original plan. Now clearly crude by rail this year is a contributor. So, we're going \u2013 that's going to negatively affect Jefferson and so we had expected to be run rate of $80 million to $100 million by the end of the year of EBITDA. That's probably not going to happen. It's going to be maybe something like half of that. But as I said longer term we're diversifying and adding products and when the Exxon refinery expands in 2022, we're in a great position to pick up and do more business. So net-net I think it's near term negative a little bit, but as I said manageable and long-term I think it\u2019s positive.\nJustin Long: Very helpful, thanks for the time today.\nJoseph Adams: Yep.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. You may proceed with your question.\nChristian Wetherbee: Hey, thanks good morning guys. Maybe just picking up on the Jefferson comments for a moment, I guess specifically one of the opportunities that you guys were seeing was, Mexico exports, refined products going down there. Kind of curious to see sort of how that business plays out. I think it's hard to get a sense, from a fine products demand perspective obviously it\u2019s down quite a bit, but I think there's market share opportunities that you guys have talked about in the past. So can you give a bit of an update on how that's playing out?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, I think Exxon is pretty positive about where the market is now. I mean, there was a bit of a decline down, when they started and Mexico was seeing some demand disruption as well. So, there's a little uncertainty, but over the last couple of months, it's stabilized and I think they're now becoming increasingly positive and optimistic. As well, they've been able to pick up market share down there because Exxon is really the only one that's built their own distribution system and doesn't use PEMEX barrels. So they bring in their own molecule, which the market values more and it will pay a premium for it. So the Mobil brand is doing well. They're expanding again. And I think when people start opening up and driving, they and we expect volumes will grow, but they've - for the near term they've stabilized. I think is the way we see it.\nChristian Wetherbee: Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then just sort of pivoting back to aviation and just trying to understand maybe the big picture of all of this, so clearly there's the potential for some utilization rates to maybe take a hit, but they also sound like there's some interesting new opportunities in the business. So I don't know if you want to take it from sort of a net dollars invested in 2020 versus now versus maybe what it would have been a couple of months ago for your outlook for this year or if it's from a cash flow or EBITDA generation standpoint. But again, can you give us some of the sense \u2013 like some of the sensitivity around some of the good stuff that's happening with new deals that we saw yesterday and maybe some of the headwinds that you could face because it is just a challenging market?\nJoseph Adams: It is a challenging market. I mean there's no doubt that when airlines are not flying, they don't have revenue and you're going to suffer along with them. But we importantly, I think we've structured our leases to collect maintenance reserves, which I have always been a big fan of. So we hold security deposits in the form of cash, which is the best kind of security deposit you can get. And we have over $200 million of that to negotiate with. So I think that and the fact that we have cargo and that we have engines makes our position better. But net-net I mean, I think this year, this will cost probably $50 million to $100 million to us for the impact of COVID-19. And that's I think relatively less than what other leasing companies will see because of the reasons I just mentioned. But then on the flip side, these deals that we're negotiating are probably the best economics we have ever seen. And maybe we'll ever see again, because, this is without precedent that every airline in the world is effectively grounded and they're all scrambling for cash. So, the terms of these deals are really phenomenal if you believe that people will fly again, which as I said we do. And I think we also believe that the 737 and A320 markets will ultimately be the best markets to be in and I think they will recover first. And then because people are not doing short visits to save cash, they're actually in our mind very likely could be a shortage next year. And then if you couple that with the fact that airlines, historically they didn't lease engines very frequently. If you were one of the largest or \"one of the best airlines in the world\" you wouldn't have talked about leasing engines. Now, I think everybody will lease engines to avoid a short visit. So it's sort of a perfect confluence that it plays out that way that we could end up, our targeted EBITDA 25%, EBITDA to invest in capital and unlevered returns of 15. I think the deals we're doing now are above those numbers meaningfully. So if we can add, as I mentioned I think, we have one other deal that's pretty far along, in addition to what we just did and I think there will be other opportunities later in the year. So this ironically, it could be our biggest year for investment ever. And we've typically done - you know around $400 million to $500 million of new investments per year. So I believe that this could be bigger and better economics.\nChristian Wetherbee: Okay. Okay, that's very helpful color. I appreciate the time this morning. Thank you.\nJoseph Adams: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. You may proceed with your question.\nDevin Ryan: Good morning, Joe. So just maybe I want to pick up where that collection ended and some great color here. You know clearly historic moment and a tough moment for the aviation industry, but you guys put yourself in a position, really to take advantage with the steps taken over the past few quarters, especially around capital. And so, just trying to think about kind of where you left off there, the capacity to potentially take advantage of some of these deals that you've already executed on and some that are in the pipeline and I suspect others will come together as people see the firm involved here. And so the capacity and maybe other options to create more capacity, whether it be selling off other infirm assets or accessing capital through other means to try to think about how you can kind of maximize your position here to take advantage of this situation?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, good question. I mean, we're obviously looking hard and the markets last month were pretty choppy. So we were having moments of like pause and like how are we going to finance this or how do we manage it? But we did go into this with multiple options. We have now an undrawn revolver which we can use. We have a fleet. We opted to finance our aircraft in the unsecured market as opposed to the ABF secured market starting many, many years ago and I think that was a great decision. We now have $1.5 billion of unencumbered assets. So that's flexibility. And then we also can sell assets, and we have some aviation assets on the cargo side that we potentially could sell here. And then as you mentioned, infrastructure, it's obviously the next - this month is not really an ideal time to put anything on the market. But I could definitely see as you go that there's other monetization options and in the infrastructure space there's still billions of billions that have been raised by private funds for infrastructure. And then you have - potentially have Washington coming out with their $2 trillion infrastructure bill. They're going to be looking for projects that are shovel ready, and we have three sites that have opportunities to build lots of stuff on it. And I mentioned data centers and Long Ridge, we've had inquiries. One, it's big as one gigawatt, our power plant is 485 megawatts. And the data center build out is a huge opportunity. So the answer is we're looking at everything and we're not wedded to any one thing. And I think every week we have more visibility and more options than we had the week before. So I feel like - we feel like we've got many different ways to fund deals that we think are very attractive. So we'll figure it out.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, terrific color. Thank you. And then just a follow-up, just if you can remind us with the infrastructure the kind of development over the next year, capital needs relative to kind of capital position and just the ability to fund kind of all of that at the asset level, just trying to make sure that we are thinking about that correctly?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, so the - really the only - Long Ridge is a 100% funded. You know, it's under construction. This is all project finance debt, so that's easy Repauno, we have about $30 million of capital remaining for the build out of Phase 1 and we could opt not to do that if we decided, but I think we will go forward. There's really great opportunities in the NGL market and I think once we have an operating site, we're going to see some - just like you see in the crude markets, if you had storage available all of a sudden you can mint money off of it. So I think there's an opportunity to being in business is a benefit and that $30 million is not huge, it is very manageable. So I think that we will go ahead and do. And then at Jefferson, all the capital is basically going to be funded through either debt that we've already raised at Jefferson or debt that we will raise going forward, so doesn't require any FTAI capital.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, terrific. I appreciate the color, Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ariel Rosa with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nAriel Rosa: Hi, good morning guys and strong quarter, all things considered. So I want to stay on that line of questioning. Joe, maybe you to talk about what the appetite looks like in the marketplace for selling infrastructure assets and if that's something - you obviously said that that's something that you would consider, it would shift your away from that targeted 50/50 mix between engine leasing or between leasing and infrastructure that you guys have spoken about a couple of years back. So just - if you could give a little more color on what your thoughts are on the potential to do that and what the market looks like for those assets, if you were to actually look to monetize some of those?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. I mean, in general our philosophy has been to - as we've said, we'd like to build infrastructure at three to five times EBITDA. We'd like to see it develop and lease up, so that it would trade at 10 to 12 times. And in certain circumstances, we would sell it at 15 to 20 times, EBITDA, and then recycle that capital. So we will have other development opportunities at each one of the properties we could invest in. So we don't see the sale or liquidation or monetization of infrastructure as a divestment more as a just say, you know, going full circle from start to finish and then doing it all over again. So I think that that opportunity exists, and as I said with the U.S. potentially doing this big $2 trillion infrastructure, there might be many, many more opportunities to do that. So, and there aren't that many people that develop. There's a lot of people in the infrastructure world that buy mature cash flowing properties, but very few people build stuff. So I think we have a skill set and experience and the knowhow that is quite valuable. So really that's a philosophy. As I said today, you wouldn't start up an M&A process today in this market environment, but who knows in a month or two, it might be back to normal and you do have a tremendous imbalance of funds or there has been an enormous amount of money raised in the infrastructure for private infrastructure investments and very few investments available. And now, I think if you look at it, one of the areas that people had invested in was airports or container terminals and you wouldn't necessarily rush to do that right now. So the types of things that we do, I think could be very, very valuable and then there could be a lot of demand, but as I said, I wouldn't be in the process today, but I don't expect that to stay that way for very long.\nAriel Rosa: Sure. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for that detail there. And then I think it was to Chris, you mentioned that there could be an impact of about $50 million to $100 million from COVID. Just so that I understand, is that relative to traditionally you guys have provided an outlook on run rate FAD from aviation. Is that saying basically $50 million to $100 million hit to that run rate, and if so, do you have a view on where that might settle out, based on kind of that baseline assumption that you mentioned with six to nine months timeline to recovery for the domestic market. Just your latest thoughts on kind of what that market looks like with the understanding that obviously there's a lot of uncertainties out there?\nScott Christopher: Yes \u2013 no - that's $50 million to $100 million would be a onetime impact this year for the balance of the year. And I expect that, we expect that in 2021 run rate targeted run rate of 25% EBITDA to invested capital will be fully normalized back to normal. And it's quite possible if we do a number of deals, this year and we have what happens, what I was talking about where more airlines are leasing engines and there is a shortage, it could be better than that in 2021. So I expect a full recovery if not upside next year, but this year you're going to have lower maintenance revenues and some rent deferrals. In most cases what you're doing is deferring the revenues so you put it on the back end. So it's not totally lost, but it would have a onetime effect this year.\nAriel Rosa: Got it. I understood. And then just last question from me. You know, I think the presentation mentioned you guys have about $200 million in LOIs, and obviously there is still a couple of deals in negotiation or under development. Is it safe to assume that any deal that you guys would do at this point would have some sort of guarantee along the lines of the Air France deal that we saw hit yesterday?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, we could possibly, I mean, any sort of aircraft deal we're going to do with, we would only do with revenue attached. So to bridge and particularly like the Air France deal it\u2019s an average of three-year term we\u2019ll get us to the other side easily. And the other deal we're working on is actually a little bit longer than that. So, yes, any aircraft deal we will buy engines at various points in time that don't have revenue, but we can lease those out pretty quickly. So, and in particular, like for instance, the freight market, as I mentioned, is very strong. So we have CF6-80C2 engines and Pratt 4000 engines that fly on 767s and 747s and there's tremendous demand for those right now. So we actually bought a few of those this quarter. So, we will buy engines to put in our regular inventory and lease, but on an aircraft deal we would only do it with revenues attached.\nAriel Rosa: Got it, makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the time, Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Yep.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Giuliano Bologna with BTIG. You may proceed with your question.\nGiuliano Bologna: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I guess jumping in on the aviation side. Obviously, there's a lot of disruption. You\u2019ve mentioned to get your perspective on the timing of the JV. You mentioned the first initiative of product that's in the approval process. Is there an update on the timeline for the second part?\nJoseph Adams: There's no change. I mean, we're still expecting by the end of this year. We have not been impacted in any way by COVID yet that I'm aware of.\nGiuliano Bologna: That sounds pretty good. Then thinking about the opportunity set on the other side, if a lot of airlines are deferring maintenance and effectively deferring having or effectively sitting on a lot of run out engines and the market tightens towards the end of the year and you could get approval for the first two JV parts by the end of the year or somewhere in that timeframe, could there be some opportunities on the back end to effectively do sale leasebacks where you're going out and buying a lot of those engines and effectively putting them back in service that's the kind of lowest costs in the industry?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, absolutely, that's was a great softball question.\nGiuliano Bologna: That makes sense.\nJoseph Adams: We do see that absolutely and even the biggest airlines in the world who, we've had conversations with have said, prior to that they said, well we do our own shop visits as we manage our own fleets. We don't do engine leasing and we'll take care of ourselves. Totally different tone now. And I could see us providing programs to big airlines so that we manage the shop visits. We put in the joint venture low cost parts and then we lease engines to even the biggest airlines and then they don't have to manage the shop visit and we can both make money that way. So I think it's, as I said, ironically it could actually accelerate our business plan to develop that because the airlines are in a much weaker position.\nGiuliano Bologna: That makes sense. Then thinking a little more strategically on the leasing side, obviously, a lot of shops are under a lot of pressure at the moment as everyone's deferring maintenance events and overhauls. Do you think it would ever make sense to try and go out and buy a shop or do some sort of deal where you are going to acquire a shop with kind of an associated business to in-house a lot of the overhauls and kind of provide more of a full package to some of the airline counterparties?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, another great question. We have been having and I've mentioned over the last year we've been having conversations. And one of our concerns has been that the maintenance shops were so full, that we wouldn't have priority for our engines. And we were very, that was one of the things we are concerned about. Well no more. I mean the opposite has happened. The shops are emptying out. So we are in a totally different position now to drive. And one of the things I mentioned is that, this will also help us get a much better deal with an MRO shop. We've sort of hesitated about buying an MRO shop, because we don't really want to be in that business. But I think we can have our cake and eat it too. I think we can have a deal with an MRO and not own it, but get everything that we want from that arrangement. And I think the environment to do that just got a lot better. So we expect, we hope we'll have a deal in that area over the next few months. And we're pretty far along with one party. So it's quite favorable, and I think it would be the last piece of what we're trying to put together.\nGiuliano Bologna: That makes a lot of sense. I really appreciate the time for the questions and good luck guys.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Galanti with Stifel. You may proceed you\u2019re your question.\nFrank Galanti: Yes hi, Joe thanks. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet. Largest concern I hear from investors about FTAI is liquidity. Obviously, the investment opportunity has gotten a lot better in the last couple months. But a lot of investors I talked to were concerned about staying power. And I know you have revolver of $250 million, but looking at 1Q, cash balance went down pretty materially from 4Q down to $45 million. Looking at your net debt-to-cap is about 52%. What could you realistically get that up to? I know you'd mentioned $1.5 billion of unencumbered assets, but with $1.2 billion at the corporate level, is that going to limit your ability to draw that down?\nJoseph Adams: No we can - we have the ability to do secured debt for purchase money indebtedness. The deal we just announced we expect to fund that 100% with that. So and as I said, we can also look at some asset sales to manage that as well. So I think the - we feel pretty good as we've brought the non-recourse leverage down to 40s under 40 something percent, which is the lowest of any aircraft leasing company in the world I think. So, we've got ourselves in a good position where we can increase that. We got it as high as 60%. I think before we, and started the program we \u2013 began a year ago. So I would say that's probably maybe the upper bound, but we can also \u2013 we did preferred offerings last year and we did asset sale. So there is a number of levers, we can pull and it's obviously dynamic as this year unfolds with deals, but we feel like we're in a good spot to sort of manage that within those bounds. And we got upgraded by Moody's to BB and they didn't downgrade us. So, we feel good about the capital structure and the flexibility.\nFrank Galanti: Great, that's super helpful. Kind of following on to that, at what point do you look at that big juicy common dividend you're paying? And kind of maybe want to reprioritize that to the current investment opportunity set in the aviation space, is that something considering \u2013 worth considering?\nJoseph Adams: We\u2019ve always paid dividend, it was always in part of our investment thesis and story and we can pay the dividend. So we felt that that's important to our shareholders. And it's not to say that it couldn't the environment could get worse, but we don't want to cut the dividend. So I think that's the clearest way I can express it. And it's the scenario that I laid out, is sort of posted coming through. We won't have to cut the dividend. So that would be our first choice.\nFrank Galanti: Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Salmon with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question.\nRobert Salmon: Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for taking the question. Just a followup in terms of the aviation investments, obviously a lot has changed since kind of the end of the quarter. But can you give us a sense with the LOIs. Did that include the Air France deal? And if we looked at kind of what the LOIs would have looked like on May 1, what would that look like relative to the $220 million that you called out in the presentation?\nJoseph Adams: Scott, do you have the answer to that?\nScott Christopher: Yes, it does include the Air France portion of it, but some of the other deals that we still are kind of working on that Joe alluded to, doesn't necessarily include that.\nJoseph Adams: But Air France is included in that.\nRobert Salmon: That\u2019s helpful guys. And obviously, we're seeing you guys got the ability to monetize the aviation portfolio. Can you give us a sense of kind of the timing of the asset sales and what, were you selling kind of engines to the cargo market where you are scrapping some of the aviation aircraft and just so we get a better sense of kind of how that played out as the airline industry felt a lot of pain throughout the quarter?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, the biggest category for the asset sales in Q1 were the sale of the airframes from the Avianca deal. So if you remember we bought 14 aircraft from Avianca at the end of last year. And 10 of those were targeted for engines just to keep the engines. So we sold the airframes. And that was always part of the deal. So it was basically just monetizing the part of the asset that we didn't want to keep. That was the biggest portion of the asset sales in Q1. Going forward, as I mentioned, I think we have the potential to sell some aircraft into the freighter, some freighter aircraft. So we may look to do that, given that's a very strong market. And we have some that we can sell. We've signed an LOI to sell a couple of 76s that will be converted from passenger to freighters. We're not going to do the conversion, but we would sell the aircraft. So that kind of a deal is what I would expect for this year. You know, it's possible, if the market recovers and we have - we do the Air France deal and we do maybe one or two others we could sell a portion of some of those deals too, it might be a very attractive way to sort of change the basis and what we've got.\nRobert Salmon: Got it. And actually kind of my final question in terms of the aviation businesses, I was actually surprised that the number of engines off lease as well as aircraft off lease didn't tick up more sequentially kind of four quarter to first quarter. Can you give us a sense in terms of what the timing is of some of your - we've seen average duration of a little roughly a year in terms of the engines roughly three years in terms they aircraft. Can you give us a sense of what that - how much of your current book is going to be - is currently on a month-to-month lease and what the terminations look like over the duration of the year?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, we have \u2013 it was about 15% of the fleet comes up in a year for the aircraft. Is that right?\nScott Christopher: Yes, it's around 10, in between 10% and 15%.\nJoseph Adams: 10 to 15%. So that's what is available on the aircraft side. The engines obviously are - many of them are on short-term leases, but people don't return as people expect that they're going to fly again, they're not going to return all the engines because it's going to be hard for them to get them all back. So we don't see rush of people giving - returning engines, we haven't seen that. So and as I said, the engines, the CF6-80 engine and the Pratt 4000 engine are the engines for the 76 and 74 for the cargo. And those engines are in demand and they're flying a lot. And then if you have a CFM engine for and a V2500, for the 737 and the A320, those are the first aircraft that you're going to put back in passenger service. So they're not likely to give those engines back either. So it's a stickier market. In general, people don't just take everything and return it . But obviously, if it's prolonged and that's why if it goes on a long time, then more of those assets will come back because people will - they'll give up and they'll just say, I don't know when I'm going to fly and I'll return everything.\nRobert Salmon: Makes sense. Well I appreciate the perspective and stay well, guys.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Dodd with Raymond James.  Robert Dodd, you may proceed with your question.\nRobert Dodd: Hi, guys, just sticking with the aviation business, of the - that kind of $50 million to $100 million negative impact . I mean, what is the visibility on that in terms of that the passenger aircraft that are flying or the engines? How many of the ones you would expect could ask for relief deferral, etc, etc. How many of those requests have you already seen and kind of maybe already adjusted lease terms, or do you think there is a lot more still to come on that front? And you're making a kind of estimates or is that the incremental not factored into that yet, because visibility is simple?\nJoseph Adams: Now, pretty much everyone has asked for some deferrals and we've negotiated many of the deals already. And so, when we came up with that number, we did it asset-by-asset, lease-by-lease. And so we have basically gone through the whole portfolio. So it's not just an assumption of what will happen. It's actually what has - what we pretty much see has happened. But as I mentioned, what - it's an assumption that people will start flying again in Q3 and Q4. And so if that doesn't happen that would change that assumption. But right now, that's what most people are planning. And it seems that many countries are starting to do that. China has recovered and added flights on the domestic side. Vietnam has added flights. Italy has actually increased flying. So it's starting to happen, but there are many, many forecasts out there that says this could be a W or a U or an L or whatever, and no one is 100% sure if it comes back that people wouldn't stop. But right now, the plans that people are putting in place pretty much reflects what we're being told and what we're seeing and asset-by-asset negotiations.\nRobert Dodd: Got it. I appreciate that. I mean, you just mentioned in one of the other responses about cargo conversions, so obviously, you don't do them, but that does, there is increasing stories of where you're going to get a 737 and some others that have typically been cargo operators. But you've talked about that those and the A320s could be kind of the next generation of freighters. Do you think this environment is accelerating that, and what does that do to potential allocation or your willingness to lease out an engine to a passenger aircraft versus holding off maybe and hoping for a freighter where demand seems to be higher right now?\nJoseph Adams: Well, the beauty about engines is the engine doesn't care if it's on a passenger plane or a freighter, and it can go back and forth. So for instance, we have 767s, some fly passenger and some fly freighter, and you can lease an engine to either one and an engine could go from a passenger plane to a freighter plane and then back again. So that's one of the reasons I like the engine business because you can serve either market and you're not stuck with it. I think there will be accelerating conversions you're seeing already. People are taking passenger planes and putting in - taking the seats out and putting in freighter systems to allow those like a 777 or an A330 to fly in freighter. Only flights that are today are passenger airplanes. So there is going to be more freighter conversions for sure and that's good. I mean, it's a lot of weight and shift and soak up some of the supply.\nRobert Dodd: Okay. Got it. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nJoseph Adams: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hi, good morning, Joe now and thanks for getting me in here. So Joe, I just want to come back to this, what percentage of the lease, the expense will actually be paying revenue through the second and third quarter at this point?\nJoseph Adams: Well, I mean, I mentioned 30% of cargo, and then we have 20% that are flag carriers, and they will be paying partial rents. So you're not getting 100% of the rent. So I think in the second quarter, we're probably going to see 25% decrease in rent something like that.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, and with the \u2013 I mean, how much of the portfolio is actually reached out to restructure or renegotiate terms if you don't mind sharing?\nJoseph Adams: Well, as I said to Robert, pretty much every airline we've had negotiations with already. So it's been asset-by-asset, lease-by-lease. So nobody has not been spoken to and we've not assumed anybody is just going to keep paying and not talk about it.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. So I appreciate the visibility there. I guess along those lines, with your cash balance I think it's around what $50 million right now, what are some of the finite financing options that you're going to take in the market, especially with deals like Air France coming by automatic I think you do need some incremental liquidity, is that correct?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. And I think we're looking at a range of debt financing alternatives for that deal. We could do secured and that market is wide open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay.\nJoseph Adams: So there's a range of alternatives that we're considering including the easiest one would be secured debt.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. What about any form of equity financing, even if in preferred markets is that on the table as well?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, it\u2019s a volatile market, but yesterday was a good day. So, today may not be, but yes.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. And then I think, my last one on infrastructure, the CapEx projects on the pipeline build out to two of your large customers. I guess do you have committed contracts behind that spending such that, you feel pretty comfortable that that will ramp earnings of the Jefferson facility?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, yes, we do. So if you recall, for instance, the Motiva contract had a provision. It was a three-year deal on the storage before the pipeline was built, and then once the pipeline is built, it converts to a five-year deal. And then Exxon, we have a refined products deal to Mexico and we've also just added an additional storage deal of jet fuel as well. And we think when the pipeline, when those pipelines are completed, we expect to get additional business and ramp those volumes up.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay well, I appreciate you guys managing through a pretty difficult position, but thank you.\nJoseph Adams: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Alan Andreini for any further remarks.\nAlan Andreini: Thanks Josh. Thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q2.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joseph Adams",
            "content": "Thanks, Alan. Before going into the details, I want to take a moment to thank two groups. First, I want to thank our employees for the tremendous effort they have put into keeping FTAI functioning smoothly over the last six weeks. Your safety was our primary concern and as we implemented procedures to protect you, we made your jobs much more difficult. The way you have responded to this challenge has been nothing short of remarkable. We haven't missed a beat and that's because of you. And for certain it's been extremely helpful that a lot of us who worked together in many cases for more than 10 years. That being said, the way you have taken it to the next level is inspirational. It seems as if the toughest times can bring out the best and talented workforce and you've all shown those qualities and I just want to say thank you on behalf of myself, our Board of Directors and our shareholders. The other group I want to acknowledge are the healthcare professionals, first responders and all essential employees and their families, who are working incredible hours and putting themselves at great risk to make our troubled world a safer place. Your courage and dedication have never been more appreciated or more apparent. Thank you. Thanks Justin. Yes, we do see. There are more deals out there. Virtually every airline is in a - as I refer to it in an extreme cash generation moderate and it's looking to raise cash every way they can. So sale lease backs and particularly you know like Air France its older equipment which for us is ideal because it's really the engine they were buying. And I think these are from our point of view these are extraordinary deals where you are buying at very, very attractive prices and you have cash flow attached to it. So that's kind of what we're looking at. There's at least one deal that is pretty far along they were working on, that's a little bit bigger than the one we just did and in some ways better, but it's also very \u2013 they are both very attractive. And then there's others that are probably in earlier stages discussion beginning, but I think at six months airlines are going to be looking at everything. Yes I think the - just from a bigger picture point of view, a lot of midstream assets are going to come under pressure, particularly assets that are gathering related in production gathering related. And this is one of the reasons we really focused on having a terminal next to two big refineries is because when those refineries, they're operating 24/7 and they bring in - Motiva brings in 600,000 barrels of crude a day and 600,000 barrels of product a day. And Exxon is going from 360 to 625. So the beauty of that is that there's always product flowing. That's not always the case if you're next to a well and the well decides they're not going produce any more. So from a strategic point of view that was always our vision and I think the strength of that is very apparent right now and we're very pleased that we don't have sort of gathering infrastructure we have we have terminals that handle both crude and refined products. And really what we focus on is diversifying that because when we originally started the terminal as you recall, we were simply crude by rail and realized you know in 2016 that went away. And so, we had to plan for the possibility that it happened and that's when we have developed the refined products relationship with Exxon. We've added jet fuel to that for export and then we've diversified with Motiva by storing intermediate some fuel oil and also you know bringing in crude by water. So it really is about diversifying and serving the needs of those two customers. And with what's going on in the market, there's so much disruption and dislocation that I think that it gives us the opportunity to further strengthen our relationship with those two big players and potentially add another refinery as well. So I feel strangely that this \u2013 environment could actually help us become more important to those players. And when the market does rebound, be as profitable or more profitable than we ever been in our original plan. Now clearly crude by rail this year is a contributor. So, we're going \u2013 that's going to negatively affect Jefferson and so we had expected to be run rate of $80 million to $100 million by the end of the year of EBITDA. That's probably not going to happen. It's going to be maybe something like half of that. But as I said longer term we're diversifying and adding products and when the Exxon refinery expands in 2022, we're in a great position to pick up and do more business. So net-net I think it's near term negative a little bit, but as I said manageable and long-term I think it's positive. Yep. Yes, I think Exxon is pretty positive about where the market is now. I mean, there was a bit of a decline down, when they started and Mexico was seeing some demand disruption as well. So, there's a little uncertainty, but over the last couple of months, it's stabilized and I think they're now becoming increasingly positive and optimistic. As well, they've been able to pick up market share down there because Exxon is really the only one that's built their own distribution system and doesn't use PEMEX barrels. So they bring in their own molecule, which the market values more and it will pay a premium for it. So the Mobil brand is doing well. They're expanding again. And I think when people start opening up and driving, they and we expect volumes will grow, but they've - for the near term they've stabilized. I think is the way we see it. It is a challenging market. I mean there's no doubt that when airlines are not flying, they don't have revenue and you're going to suffer along with them. But we importantly, I think we've structured our leases to collect maintenance reserves, which I have always been a big fan of. So we hold security deposits in the form of cash, which is the best kind of security deposit you can get. And we have over $200 million of that to negotiate with. So I think that and the fact that we have cargo and that we have engines makes our position better. But net-net I mean, I think this year, this will cost probably $50 million to $100 million to us for the impact of COVID-19. And that's I think relatively less than what other leasing companies will see because of the reasons I just mentioned. But then on the flip side, these deals that we're negotiating are probably the best economics we have ever seen. And maybe we'll ever see again, because, this is without precedent that every airline in the world is effectively grounded and they're all scrambling for cash. So, the terms of these deals are really phenomenal if you believe that people will fly again, which as I said we do. And I think we also believe that the 737 and A320 markets will ultimately be the best markets to be in and I think they will recover first. And then because people are not doing short visits to save cash, they're actually in our mind very likely could be a shortage next year. And then if you couple that with the fact that airlines, historically they didn't lease engines very frequently. If you were one of the largest or \"one of the best airlines in the world\" you wouldn't have talked about leasing engines. Now, I think everybody will lease engines to avoid a short visit. So it's sort of a perfect confluence that it plays out that way that we could end up, our targeted EBITDA 25%, EBITDA to invest in capital and unlevered returns of 15. I think the deals we're doing now are above those numbers meaningfully. So if we can add, as I mentioned I think, we have one other deal that's pretty far along, in addition to what we just did and I think there will be other opportunities later in the year. So this ironically, it could be our biggest year for investment ever. And we've typically done - you know around $400 million to $500 million of new investments per year. So I believe that this could be bigger and better economics. Yes. Yes, good question. I mean, we're obviously looking hard and the markets last month were pretty choppy. So we were having moments of like pause and like how are we going to finance this or how do we manage it? But we did go into this with multiple options. We have now an undrawn revolver which we can use. We have a fleet. We opted to finance our aircraft in the unsecured market as opposed to the ABF secured market starting many, many years ago and I think that was a great decision. We now have $1.5 billion of unencumbered assets. So that's flexibility. And then we also can sell assets, and we have some aviation assets on the cargo side that we potentially could sell here. And then as you mentioned, infrastructure, it's obviously the next - this month is not really an ideal time to put anything on the market. But I could definitely see as you go that there's other monetization options and in the infrastructure space there's still billions of billions that have been raised by private funds for infrastructure. And then you have - potentially have Washington coming out with their $2 trillion infrastructure bill. They're going to be looking for projects that are shovel ready, and we have three sites that have opportunities to build lots of stuff on it. And I mentioned data centers and Long Ridge, we've had inquiries. One, it's big as one gigawatt, our power plant is 485 megawatts. And the data center build out is a huge opportunity. So the answer is we're looking at everything and we're not wedded to any one thing. And I think every week we have more visibility and more options than we had the week before. So I feel like - we feel like we've got many different ways to fund deals that we think are very attractive. So we'll figure it out. Yes, so the - really the only - Long Ridge is a 100% funded. You know, it's under construction. This is all project finance debt, so that's easy Repauno, we have about $30 million of capital remaining for the build out of Phase 1 and we could opt not to do that if we decided, but I think we will go forward. There's really great opportunities in the NGL market and I think once we have an operating site, we're going to see some - just like you see in the crude markets, if you had storage available all of a sudden you can mint money off of it. So I think there's an opportunity to being in business is a benefit and that $30 million is not huge, it is very manageable. So I think that we will go ahead and do. And then at Jefferson, all the capital is basically going to be funded through either debt that we've already raised at Jefferson or debt that we will raise going forward, so doesn't require any FTAI capital. Yes. Yes. I mean, in general our philosophy has been to - as we've said, we'd like to build infrastructure at three to five times EBITDA. We'd like to see it develop and lease up, so that it would trade at 10 to 12 times. And in certain circumstances, we would sell it at 15 to 20 times, EBITDA, and then recycle that capital. So we will have other development opportunities at each one of the properties we could invest in. So we don't see the sale or liquidation or monetization of infrastructure as a divestment more as a just say, you know, going full circle from start to finish and then doing it all over again. So I think that that opportunity exists, and as I said with the U.S. potentially doing this big $2 trillion infrastructure, there might be many, many more opportunities to do that. So, and there aren't that many people that develop. There's a lot of people in the infrastructure world that buy mature cash flowing properties, but very few people build stuff. So I think we have a skill set and experience and the knowhow that is quite valuable. So really that's a philosophy. As I said today, you wouldn't start up an M&A process today in this market environment, but who knows in a month or two, it might be back to normal and you do have a tremendous imbalance of funds or there has been an enormous amount of money raised in the infrastructure for private infrastructure investments and very few investments available. And now, I think if you look at it, one of the areas that people had invested in was airports or container terminals and you wouldn't necessarily rush to do that right now. So the types of things that we do, I think could be very, very valuable and then there could be a lot of demand, but as I said, I wouldn't be in the process today, but I don't expect that to stay that way for very long. Yes, we could possibly, I mean, any sort of aircraft deal we're going to do with, we would only do with revenue attached. So to bridge and particularly like the Air France deal it's an average of three-year term we'll get us to the other side easily. And the other deal we're working on is actually a little bit longer than that. So, yes, any aircraft deal we will buy engines at various points in time that don't have revenue, but we can lease those out pretty quickly. So, and in particular, like for instance, the freight market, as I mentioned, is very strong. So we have CF6-80C2 engines and Pratt 4000 engines that fly on 767s and 747s and there's tremendous demand for those right now. So we actually bought a few of those this quarter. So, we will buy engines to put in our regular inventory and lease, but on an aircraft deal we would only do it with revenues attached. Yep. There's no change. I mean, we're still expecting by the end of this year. We have not been impacted in any way by COVID yet that I'm aware of. Yes, absolutely, that's was a great softball question. We do see that absolutely and even the biggest airlines in the world who, we've had conversations with have said, prior to that they said, well we do our own shop visits as we manage our own fleets. We don't do engine leasing and we'll take care of ourselves. Totally different tone now. And I could see us providing programs to big airlines so that we manage the shop visits. We put in the joint venture low cost parts and then we lease engines to even the biggest airlines and then they don't have to manage the shop visit and we can both make money that way. So I think it's, as I said, ironically it could actually accelerate our business plan to develop that because the airlines are in a much weaker position. Yes, another great question. We have been having and I've mentioned over the last year we've been having conversations. And one of our concerns has been that the maintenance shops were so full, that we wouldn't have priority for our engines. And we were very, that was one of the things we are concerned about. Well no more. I mean the opposite has happened. The shops are emptying out. So we are in a totally different position now to drive. And one of the things I mentioned is that, this will also help us get a much better deal with an MRO shop. We've sort of hesitated about buying an MRO shop, because we don't really want to be in that business. But I think we can have our cake and eat it too. I think we can have a deal with an MRO and not own it, but get everything that we want from that arrangement. And I think the environment to do that just got a lot better. So we expect, we hope we'll have a deal in that area over the next few months. And we're pretty far along with one party. So it's quite favorable, and I think it would be the last piece of what we're trying to put together. Thanks No we can - we have the ability to do secured debt for purchase money indebtedness. The deal we just announced we expect to fund that 100% with that. So and as I said, we can also look at some asset sales to manage that as well. So I think the - we feel pretty good as we've brought the non-recourse leverage down to 40s under 40 something percent, which is the lowest of any aircraft leasing company in the world I think. So, we've got ourselves in a good position where we can increase that. We got it as high as 60%. I think before we, and started the program we \u2013 began a year ago. So I would say that's probably maybe the upper bound, but we can also \u2013 we did preferred offerings last year and we did asset sale. So there is a number of levers, we can pull and it's obviously dynamic as this year unfolds with deals, but we feel like we're in a good spot to sort of manage that within those bounds. And we got upgraded by Moody's to BB and they didn't downgrade us. So, we feel good about the capital structure and the flexibility. We've always paid dividend, it was always in part of our investment thesis and story and we can pay the dividend. So we felt that that's important to our shareholders. And it's not to say that it couldn't the environment could get worse, but we don't want to cut the dividend. So I think that's the clearest way I can express it. And it's the scenario that I laid out, is sort of posted coming through. We won't have to cut the dividend. So that would be our first choice. Scott, do you have the answer to that? But Air France is included in that. Yes, the biggest category for the asset sales in Q1 were the sale of the airframes from the Avianca deal. So if you remember we bought 14 aircraft from Avianca at the end of last year. And 10 of those were targeted for engines just to keep the engines. So we sold the airframes. And that was always part of the deal. So it was basically just monetizing the part of the asset that we didn't want to keep. That was the biggest portion of the asset sales in Q1. Going forward, as I mentioned, I think we have the potential to sell some aircraft into the freighter, some freighter aircraft. So we may look to do that, given that's a very strong market. And we have some that we can sell. We've signed an LOI to sell a couple of 76s that will be converted from passenger to freighters. We're not going to do the conversion, but we would sell the aircraft. So that kind of a deal is what I would expect for this year. You know, it's possible, if the market recovers and we have - we do the Air France deal and we do maybe one or two others we could sell a portion of some of those deals too, it might be a very attractive way to sort of change the basis and what we've got. Yes, we have \u2013 it was about 15% of the fleet comes up in a year for the aircraft. Is that right? 10 to 15%. So that's what is available on the aircraft side. The engines obviously are - many of them are on short-term leases, but people don't return as people expect that they're going to fly again, they're not going to return all the engines because it's going to be hard for them to get them all back. So we don't see rush of people giving - returning engines, we haven't seen that. So and as I said, the engines, the CF6-80 engine and the Pratt 4000 engine are the engines for the 76 and 74 for the cargo. And those engines are in demand and they're flying a lot. And then if you have a CFM engine for and a V2500, for the 737 and the A320, those are the first aircraft that you're going to put back in passenger service. So they're not likely to give those engines back either. So it's a stickier market. In general, people don't just take everything and return it . But obviously, if it's prolonged and that's why if it goes on a long time, then more of those assets will come back because people will - they'll give up and they'll just say, I don't know when I'm going to fly and I'll return everything. Thanks. Now, pretty much everyone has asked for some deferrals and we've negotiated many of the deals already. And so, when we came up with that number, we did it asset-by-asset, lease-by-lease. And so we have basically gone through the whole portfolio. So it's not just an assumption of what will happen. It's actually what has - what we pretty much see has happened. But as I mentioned, what - it's an assumption that people will start flying again in Q3 and Q4. And so if that doesn't happen that would change that assumption. But right now, that's what most people are planning. And it seems that many countries are starting to do that. China has recovered and added flights on the domestic side. Vietnam has added flights. Italy has actually increased flying. So it's starting to happen, but there are many, many forecasts out there that says this could be a W or a U or an L or whatever, and no one is 100% sure if it comes back that people wouldn't stop. But right now, the plans that people are putting in place pretty much reflects what we're being told and what we're seeing and asset-by-asset negotiations. Well, the beauty about engines is the engine doesn't care if it's on a passenger plane or a freighter, and it can go back and forth. So for instance, we have 767s, some fly passenger and some fly freighter, and you can lease an engine to either one and an engine could go from a passenger plane to a freighter plane and then back again. So that's one of the reasons I like the engine business because you can serve either market and you're not stuck with it. I think there will be accelerating conversions you're seeing already. People are taking passenger planes and putting in - taking the seats out and putting in freighter systems to allow those like a 777 or an A330 to fly in freighter. Only flights that are today are passenger airplanes. So there is going to be more freighter conversions for sure and that's good. I mean, it's a lot of weight and shift and soak up some of the supply. Yes. Well, I mean, I mentioned 30% of cargo, and then we have 20% that are flag carriers, and they will be paying partial rents. So you're not getting 100% of the rent. So I think in the second quarter, we're probably going to see 25% decrease in rent something like that. Well, as I said to Robert, pretty much every airline we've had negotiations with already. So it's been asset-by-asset, lease-by-lease. So nobody has not been spoken to and we've not assumed anybody is just going to keep paying and not talk about it. Yes. And I think we're looking at a range of debt financing alternatives for that deal. We could do secured and that market is wide open. So there's a range of alternatives that we're considering including the easiest one would be secured debt. Yes, it's a volatile market, but yesterday was a good day. So, today may not be, but yes. Yes, yes, we do. So if you recall, for instance, the Motiva contract had a provision. It was a three-year deal on the storage before the pipeline was built, and then once the pipeline is built, it converts to a five-year deal. And then Exxon, we have a refined products deal to Mexico and we've also just added an additional storage deal of jet fuel as well. And we think when the pipeline, when those pipelines are completed, we expect to get additional business and ramp those volumes up. Thank you."

            "content": "Yes \u2013 no - that's $50 million to $100 million would be a onetime impact this year for the balance of the year. And I expect that, we expect that in 2021 run rate targeted run rate of 25% EBITDA to invested capital will be fully normalized back to normal. And it's quite possible if we do a number of deals, this year and we have what happens, what I was talking about where more airlines are leasing engines and there is a shortage, it could be better than that in 2021. So I expect a full recovery if not upside next year, but this year you're going to have lower maintenance revenues and some rent deferrals. In most cases what you're doing is deferring the revenues so you put it on the back end. So it's not totally lost, but it would have a onetime effect this year. Yes, it does include the Air France portion of it, but some of the other deals that we still are kind of working on that Joe alluded to, doesn't necessarily include that. Yes, it's around 10, in between 10% and 15%."

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2021 Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. 00:25 I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Alan Andreini. Please go ahead.\nAlan Andreini: 00:32 Thank you, operator. I would like to welcome you all to the Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Christopher, our Chief Financial Officer. We have posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you have not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only mode and is being webcast. 01:01 In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including FAD. The reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement. 01:14 Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements, by their nature, are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our quarterly report filed with the SEC. 01:43 Now I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Adams: 01:45 Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 27th dividend as a public company and our 42nd consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on March 23, based on a shareholder record date of March 11. 02:04 Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD or funds available for distribution. We ended the year strongly with adjusted EBITDA of $124.8 million in Q4 2021, which is up 29% compared to $96.4 million in Q3 2021, and up 170% compared to $46.2 million in Q4 2020. In a similar fashion FAD was $120.1 million in Q4 2021, up 205% compared to $39.4 million in Q3 2021 and up 122% compared to $54.2 million in Q4 2020. During the fourth quarter, the $120.1 million FAD number was comprised of $161.2 million from our aviation leasing portfolio, $11.0 million from our infrastructure business and negative $52.1 million from corporate and other. 03:11 Now let's look at all of 2021 versus all of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was $336.3 million in 2021, up 38% versus $243.3 million in 2020. FAD was $242.2 million in 2021, up 2% versus $237.4 million in 2020. Both our aviation portfolio and infrastructure businesses contributed positive FAD for the year and overall 20% higher compared to 2020. Meanwhile, corporate expenses were higher compared to 2020, primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from higher average debt outstanding during the year. 03:56 Turning now to Aviation. Aviation had another up quarter with Q4 EBITDA of $103.7 million, while decreased flying due to Omicron dampened the recovery and leasing activity, we were able to grow our aerospace services EBITDA to $20.3 million for Q4, primarily due to an increasing number of sales and exchanges through our CFM56 module factory. We had approximately 10 active customers in the Module Factory and are seeing growing interest in the products from MROs or maintenance and repair organizations, airlines and lessors. And with our recently signed program with Lufthansa Technik covering the seven-year WestJet CFM56 engine maintenance program, we see growing validation and acceptance of the value proposition, which will expand the active customer base across the entire engine ecosystem. 04:57 Regarding aircraft and engine leasing, we see increased demand for additional equipment starting in Q2 driving higher lease rates and asset prices provided that strong forward travel bookings that we have today hold up. Overall, we see improving demand for assets and aftermarket maintenance services driving 2022 financial performance and strengthening our position in the commercial jet engine aftermarket. 05:26 Now let's turn to infrastructure. Jefferson, the big story with Jefferson in 2021 was major advancements on multiple product fronts with the two largest refineries in the United States and our largest customers, Motiva and Exxon. We started the year with refined products by rail and added a 10-year contract to operate a 2 million barrel multi-product and refined products export hub. And on the crude side, we've been receiving ship cargos, which we store, blend and move now by pipe. And we see a good pickup in crude by rail from Utah and Canada, which brings additional services and values to the terminal. 06:10 We're actively exploring multiple additional products for both refiners which we expect to add in 2022 and at least one new pipeline connection as well. While throughput volumes are up over 25% in early 2022 versus Q4 2021, we still are only about 33% utilized, but with additional activity from Exxon and Motiva, we have a path to high utilization coming into focus. 06:41 Repauno, Repauno had a terrific year in 2021 and is very well positioned for many years of significant growth. First let me list the 2021 accomplishments. One, in the first year of operation, we loaded 31 ships with butane for export. Second, we imported our first cargo of polymer-grade propylene so -- that has come to the East Coast in many years. Third, we began construction of the double unit train rail loop. Fourth, we expanded the truck rack which will allow direct rail to truck propane transloading. Since we operated a new cavern chiller (ph) which allows us for refrigerated LPG marine loading. And sixth, we completed a new bypass road providing direct highway truck access. 07:35 In terms of volumes, in 2020, we moved 4.3 million gallons through the terminal. In 2021, we moved a 130 million gallons. And in 2022, we expect to move 150 million to 175 million gallons. And then 2023 with an additional cryogenic tank, we plan to build that number could triple. Repauno is finding its niche with customers to offer unique capabilities for storing and transloading a wide variety of liquid petroleum products and intermediate specialty chemicals for both import and export in a critically important advantage location. As such, we see upside over time in this terminal fee per gallon potential. 08:31 Lastly, we've made significant progress on the Clean Planet joint venture and have begun the permitting process for the first plastics recycling plant at Repauno, which we expect to commence construction on in Q2 of 2022 and complete in Q2 of 2023. 08:52 Turning the Long Ridge. Long Ridge had a good quarter and year due to an earlier than planned start-up of the power plant, which allowed us to take advantage of elevated power prices in October, November before our long-term power sales agreements commenced. On a 100% basis, Long Ridge generated EBITDA of $37.4 million in Q4 and $58.8 million for all of 2021 well ahead of our budget. 09:19 Starting in January and up until last week, Long Ridge took an unscheduled maintenance outage fully covered by GE warranty for repairs to the steam turbine. The outage will reduce EBITDA in Q1 due to the loss of power revenue. We did however perform maintenance scheduled for later in the year, thus avoiding future outages and we completed the hydrogen blending project giving us the capability to become the first large frame power plant to be able to utilize zero carbon hydrogen as a fuel. 09:51 Under the recently enacted infrastructure bill, the U.S. government will be designated four locations as hydrogen hubs. Long Ridge is ideally qualified and we intend to apply for one of those. We also are in the final stages of negotiating to host a new biodegradable plastics manufacturer at Long Ridge. As part of that agreement, we would provide land, power and natural gas under long-term supply agreements. 10:21 Turning to Transtar. Transtar generated $16.7 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter from continuing operations and for the full year generated an annualized $68 million of adjusted EBITDA. In addition, Transtar generated $4.5 million of incremental cash flow from the sale of non-core equipment and excess land which was more than offset maintenance CapEx in the quarter. This is a collection of railroads that have very low maintenance CapEx and industry leading cash conversion, which we expect to continue in 2022. 10:57 In the fourth quarter, Transtar moved more than 55,000 carloads, slightly above fourth quarter of 2020 and steel production at Gary and Mon Valley remained stable despite supply chain downstream issues in the automotive and appliance sectors. Some loaded steel carloads in December were held at the origin until cars are offloaded downstream, but are expected to move in Q1 and Q2. This team is carrying forward early into the first quarter of 2022, but we expect to see increased steel movements in Q2 and beyond as pent-up demand is released and the supply chain rationalizes. 11:41 Looking forward to 2022, Transtar\u2019s goal is to grow its third-party businesses at the underutilized railroads. The team is executing on new transloading opportunities in Detroit and exploring large industrial customers for its thousand acre property in Northeast Texas. As non-core railcars are sold more than 1,500 storage spots are opening up across the network. And the team has a pipeline of opportunities to fill those vacant spots. 12:13 We're pleased to welcome Gary Long to the team as CEO of FTAI\u2019s Rail Investments. Gary brings more than 25 years of experience in the rail industry, including most recently as CEO of Genesee & Wyoming's European operations. Gary is very well suited to leverage the Transtar platform to execute on the growth initiatives we have set forth, both organically and through acquisitions. 12:37 In summary, we're very much looking forward to 2022 with aviation recovery gaining momentum, the company with our advances in aerospace service revenues and EBITDA. And in infrastructure, the maturation of multiple projects which now generate organic growth across all the platforms. And finally, the spin-off of infrastructure is moving ahead with expected completion in April, which will provide simplification of the business strategy combined with eliminating K-1s for investors. 13:13 So with that, I'll turn the call back to Alan.\nAlan Andreini: 13:17 Thank you, Joe. Operator, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: 13:22 Thank you.  Our first question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is open.\nJustin Long: 13:34 Thanks and good morning. Joe, maybe to start, I was just curious if anything has changed in terms of your EBITDA outlook by business for 2022. And then thinking about the longer term, I know you've spoken recently about the aviation business getting to a $1 billion of EBITDA by 2025, given the split is on the near-term horizon, is there anything you can share around some of your longer-term targets for the infrastructure business as well?\nJoe Adams: 14:07 Yeah. So, yeah, on the EBITDA for 2022 what we've been saying is, it's our best guesstimate or estimate is about $550 million for Aviation. And then with each one of the Infrastructure business go down there, the Jefferson, we're looking at between $50 million and $90 million of EBITDA, approximately for Long Ridge, our share roughly the total EBITDA is probably around $90 million, given the first quarter is going to be short, so our share is roughly about $45 million of EBITDA. Then Repauno is probably about $10 million, and Transtar approximately $75 million maybe $80 million, but $75 million is probably a good number. Does that answer your --\nJustin Long: 15:06 That's great. And then I guess longer term for the infrastructure businesses.\nJoe Adams: 15:11 Yeah. So, we still believe Jefferson, as I said was roughly a third utilized and if you count on the fact that Exxon is about to go next year to -- from $360 and 620,000 barrels a day and we'll achieve it is that today, it's a number one and two refiners and we have multiple discussions. We have a bigger list of new product offerings to each of them that we've ever had before, given the pipeline connectivity. So we very much believe will fill the terminal. And if you fill the terminal, you're looking at $150 million or more of EBITDA per annum. So that's something that we've always said, it's a question of when, not if, and we've had obviously a number of headwinds and things that -- the world seems it, throw obstacles regularly now but we seem to be able to jump higher each time. So we're managing them, but the terminal is very well positioned, it has a great product offering, great dialog and relationships to those two customers and now we have the benefit of a higher oil price, which should -- all of that should help so. So we're still, we still believe that will fill up. 16:26 In terms of Transtar, what I've sort of indicated the people is, if we got a business from U.S. Steel is generating roughly 80 million of EBITDA, which we can grow right-of-way and storage business and transload and add maybe 15 million to 20 million over a three to four years from that those types of activities. So you say, you get it $100 million, what we'd like to do is add 100 million from non-U.S. steel customers across a range of activities being -- could the industrial development at one of the four railroads that we -- we're basically given as part of the transaction. It could also be growing segments like repair and maintenance activities, terminal operations is another one that we've been looking at. So there is a list of things that we're going to explore to try to sort of figure out how to create that 100 million. But if we were able to do that, I think that $100 million from a long-term customer such as U.S. Steel, it's basically got great downside protection and it's very stable. And then have $100 million of third-party business from other non-U.S. steel customers in a really good economic industrial backdrop in the U.S. today that would be a great company and great much higher multiple than what we take paid going in. So that's kind of the business plan there. 17:59 The Repauno is another one, I think is amazing in that. Really there are -- there are only two terminals on the East Coast of United States that can handle these types of natural gas liquids and really the other one is type to ship primarily. So we have rail, we have truck and we have import and export capabilities, which really is, we're starting to find from the customer reactions, people then saying, god I\u2019ve been looking for this for years and I finally found it. We can bring in products like butadiene, which I didn't even know how to spell it a quarter ago. So there's things that we're learning about the location of the capabilities that are very exciting, but just the natural gas liquids business. As I mentioned, we probably will get a long-term commitment and build aboveground storage tank, which would be in service next year. And that would give us triple the capacity we have today and really allow us to load VLGCs, which puts you in the ratable business of supplying PDH plants in Europe of natural gas liquid products. So that's a big jump. 19:15 And then beyond that we have the ability to build probably 3 million to 4 million barrels of underground storage, which we could set up a multiple caverns to handle all these different products that I just mentioned. So, and it could be important in exports. So that's truly unique and it's also -- it's not on the Gulf Coast, which is a big advantage for many buyers. So -- and that doesn't count the 200 acres. We have above ground that has nothing built on it will probably use 10 acres for this Clean Planet joint venture. So there's other industrial development that we could do there. So just on the amazing property with lots of special attributes that I think it's in scarcity value that nobody can replicate. So I\u2019ve always felt that we was truly unique and extremely valuable. 20:08 Then our Long Ridge, we have the power plant contracted for the next 8.5 years. So really the main upside is two things, one is bringing a tenant to the properties, so that we can add additional services such as selling gas and we can sell power at a higher price. So that -- and I think we're going to, we have a good shot at one or two that I mentioned then one on the biodegradable plastics, which we're pretty far along on being ideal tenant, because they use natural gas, microbes and electricity, which we can -- we don't supply the microbes, but we supply the other twp. So it's an ESG positive tenant bringing under the site. So that I think is, would be a good development. And then the other one I mentioned is the hydrogen. We now are the first power plant they can blend hydrogen and use it as a fuel. Large frame power plant and when you look at the specs of the hydrogen hub that the government just published. One of them is -- one of the hubs has to be in a large gas producing region and have a proximity to a power plant. And so I can't, we can think of like, who else would that fit. We have a power plant on the property and there is gas underneath this, all in a radius if like 100 miles is Utica. So we're very excited about that. Don't know how to quantify what that means, but it sounds great to be a hydrogen hub and it doesn't cost anything. So why not? So that is kind of a tour of an effect that gives you, what you were looking for.\nJustin Long: 21:55 That's great, I appreciate all that detail. And I'll keep my follow-up to a quick one. Earlier you mentioned $550 million from aviation this year is -- does that include the 50 million to 100 million that you've talked about from aerospace services?\nJoe Adams: 22:11 Yes.\nJustin Long: 22:14 Okay. Great. I appreciate the time.\nJoe Adams: 22:16 Thanks.\nOperator: 22:20 Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nBrian McKenna: 22:26 Hi. Thanks. This is Brian McKenna for Devin. So just looking at Aviation EBITDA returns. I know there were some timing dynamics in the fourth quarter, but returns declined sequentially to 16% from 20% in the third quarter, so could you talk about the outlook for returns in the business, is 16% the floor in the near term? And then what do you see in some of the bigger drivers of getting returns back to the mid 20% level over time?\nJoe Adams: 22:53 We think that, as I mentioned Omicron slowed down a lot of expansion activity and we see it in particular like if an airline was flying in pre-COVID era of 350 to 400 hours a month on an airplane. In the fourth quarter, they might have flown 200, and so that affects our revenue from maintenance and maintenance reserves that we take in. So that's, that was an impact to the fourth quarter. So it was not -- to refer you is not a great quarter. I mean, given that we were hoping that people are going to, for the holidays add capacity and fly, unfortunately Omicron unchanged the trajectory of a lot of that. But as I mentioned, and then the first quarter is better we expect sequentially better, but it's not going to, it's never seasonally the greatest quarter because the winter months are not the busiest for air travel really starts to pick up scheduling in March and April. 23:41 So our expectation is that Q2 and Q3 will return to our targeted EBITDA margin of 25% or close to that. And we have a pretty good -- we have reasonable visibility on that, as I said, it's a function of the airlines are seeing right now, pretty strong forward bookings of flights and so we're getting request says our other people. I'm sure for additional assets and sort of that saying that you can have is when an airline calls off and say, I need more aircraft because they are the ones that have the best view on what's happening on the travel side and that's what's happening right now. So we see a -- and I have also monitored the other maintenance shops are talking that being sold out in Q2 and Q3. And one of the big engine manufacturers just said they're seeing return to pre-COVID levels by the end of this year. So there is a lot of other corroborating data that supports that. So that's our outlook, that's our expectation for to get to the levels that we just talked about.\nBrian McKenna: 25:09 Great. I appreciate that. And then you also sold a number of non-core aviation assets in the quarter. This can be lumpy, but how should we think about related asset sales moving forward at some level of sales necessary to fund the pipeline of LOI's or do you have ample liquidity and cash flow generation in the business to fund these investments throughout 2022?\nJoe Adams: 25:32 Yeah. We have been talking about and we actually did take a step towards shifting the mix of the portfolio somewhat and that we expect -- I think we had like 100, Pratt 4000 and CF680 engines and over time -- in somewhat over this year we will probably reduce that number down maybe by half. So we had about 10 million of gains from those types of sales in the fourth quarter. We will see more of that this year I think as well. And at the same time, we are looking to increase the percentage of the portfolio in the CFM56 engine. So that, which obviously makes sense that's what we've been talking about for five years. So we're going to shift the mix and I think that those assets the Pratt 4000, CF680s have been great returns for us and we have very low basis. So, and there is a lot of demand given the freight market. So I think we'll continue to see some gains from those during the year. 26:30 And then, in terms of managing capital going forward, I think we're going to try to turn the portfolio more and have asset sales replenish new investments since. So one of the things you can do is that we're focused on right now as we, if we buy off-lease assets and then put them on-lease, you create a, quite a bit of value and could take a gain. And as part of that, we're also looking at the potential to sell some of those assets that are on longer-term leases and retain the engine management of that, of those assets, which really has a great, is a win-win and it opens the lessor market up to the whole ecosystem, if we can sell and long-term six to eight-year lease book of gain and then keep what we think is the best part of the deal, which is the engines and maintenance contract that's another value for us that no one else can recognize and it allows us to use that capital again to sort of do it all over again. So that's sort of a long way of saying that we have liquidity. We don't think we're going to be expanding the invested capital dramatically and we're not trying to do that. We're trying to grow the service component, so that in the someday in the future, we hope that service -- aerospace services revenue, EBITDA was equal the leasing activity EBITDA.\nBrian McKenna: 28:06 Great. Thanks, Joe.\nJoe Adams: 28:07 Yeah.\nOperator: 28:11 Thank you.  Our next question comes from Guiliano Bologna with Compass Point. Your line is open.\nGuiliano Bologna: 28:26 Good morning. Okay. So switching topics a little bit, you guys reported that you generated $20.3 million of aerospace services EBITDA in the quarter and I want to make sure I was thinking about this correctly that the components of that is mostly selling new serviceable materials and proceeds from the Module Factory. And if I look at, if I think back to kind of prior statements that you've made Joe, you referenced selling about or generating about $20 million of EBITDA we used serviceable materials, which would imply roughly $65 (ph) million a quarter. And if I back into that number that implies that the Module Factory is probably running $50 million plus, higher than that or larger contribution of the 20, which already put you at $60 million or so annualized run rate. Is that a good way of thinking of it and does kind of have a ballpark of where the Module Factory is running?\nJoe Adams: 29:21 It's close, but it's a little bit different. In the fourth quarter, most of that $20 million was from the Module Factory, more than 80% of it was Module Factory. SO the USM was probably under $3 million, between $2 and $3 million of contribution in Q4. And we do expect $20 million from USM this year in 2022, but again USM, is driven primarily off of shop visits. So in the fourth quarter and first quarter there are still are a limited number of shop visits are occurring, but if you look at  the day they're sold out now for Q2 and Q3 in the shop. So it's happening that the shop -- the engines green time has been burned off and people are going to need to put our energy to shops. So that will drive USM sales is activity in the shop visits side which will be more back-end loaded than what the number -- it's not 5 million a quarter, it will ramp up to something. But we still believe $20 million is a good estimate for the year.\nGuiliano Bologna: 30:37 That's great. And then thinking about  little more accounting specific, but the Module Factory EBITDA and proceeds and also user material, is it -- am I correct in assuming that both of those flow through gain on sale, because obviously you had a large count on sale kind of profit quarter. So I just want to make sure that those are both going to gain on sale because it's pretty more recurring business from the Module Factory and potentially users of Ontario versus one-time?\nJoe Adams: 31:05 Well, right now we have a bit of it. The Module Factory is flowing through gain on sale but USM is probably being BOPIS revenues and costs -- minus cost of good sale. So we have a different treatment, which is probably not great from long-term, we need to spend some time and see if we can get that right, but it's -- because it's so new the accountants want to have a classified differently right now. But, so that's not something I can totally understand, but that is, that's what we did in the fourth quarter.\nGuiliano Bologna: 31:44 Got it. That's great. That's very helpful. The only one for you guys -- we are serious if there is any update on the second PMA part or potential approval timeline there?\nJoe Adams: 31:53 Yes. A lot of very good progress on the part that the they're very happy with it. It's performing well. There is a lot of back and forth on information and it's progressing and we're hopeful that that will be addressed soon, but it's, as you know, it's very hard to put a specific date on it. So, but good progress, that\u2019s it.\nGuiliano Bologna: 32:21 And the only other thing is on Jefferson as isn't been here, overall pricing is moving around as  most of us have seen, I'm curious if that has a potential dial-up crude by rail and how do you \u2013 anything about potential contribution there from crude by rail or how that contributes into your kind of 50 million or 90 million guide?\nJoe Adams: 32:42 Yeah. It's one of the proud that we hope we will come through this year, which is there is several proposals out now and it does help with crude prices high because there is more spread and more volatility creates, what the refiners are always looking at is optionality to trying to source the lowest cost crude from wherever that comes from and volatility and high prices help. So we do see the likelihood of that activity. We've already seen it coming from the Utah market, which is, it's not a spread business because in Uttar there is no, there is no other way to move it. So it has to go by rail. But in Canada, it is a spread and supply business and so that market will should open up.\nGuiliano Bologna: 33:31 That's great. Thank you for answering my questions, and I'll come back in the queue.\nJoe Adams: 33:36 Thanks.\nOperator: 33:38 Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nJosh Sullivan: 33:45 Hey. Good morning.\nJoe Adams: 33:46 Good morning.\nJosh Sullivan: 33:49 Just given that the new Lufthansa relationship, how do we frame your overall module capacity at this point. And then one of the advantages of the Module Factory deal was pitched as the faster turnarounds for airline maintenance. Can you give us any metrics there, customers are seeing in the field on terms at this point?\nJoe Adams: 34:08 Yes. So that's a great one. And so if you think about the lift side of the deal, we just -- we supply an overhauled LPG low pressure turbine to Lufthansa which gets installed in the WestJet engine when they're doing the shop visits. So Lufthansa doesn't have to do any of the maintenance on that and it's an immediate -- we are going to install that in 30 days rather than have to wait for any parts and have any delays. So there is a benefit to them on that and there is also a benefit, just purely for an airline. If you need LPT and it has to go into shop it could be anywhere from three to six months. And so we have a little chart that shows the total savings from using the Module Factory to be just time wise could be $0.5 million or more, and we don't charge for that. So that's just, that's added benefit that people get and I think that, those numbers are going to get bigger too as you see the shop start to build up to fill up and then you factor on top of that, what we haven't yet seen is supply chain issues in aviation components, but it's coming, it's happened in every other industry and the only reason it didn't happen in aviation is because there wasn't a lot of activity, but it's definitely coming. And so, as you see engine shop visits start to go back out to four to six to eight months, which is what happened pre-COVID then the Module Factory benefits become even greater, so we're very -- 35:43 And then on top of that I think you also have some inflation potential that hasn't, you see the OEMs raise prices last year 7%, which is amazing given the state of the financial condition their client faces in, but they are able to raise prices in. In that environment 7%, what will they do, if they have like 7% inflation? So that actually is also another benefit for us on the -- on us -- on our side, so those are both factored in. In terms of capacity, we use about -- at the Montreal facility at Lockheed Martin, it's about 300,000 square feet, we're using, about 40,000 to 50,000 of those today. And there is plenty of room to open that up. So we have plenty of capacity there and every engine that we inductance into facility we've break it into modules. So as soon as it comes in it separated as a fan of core and a low pressure turbine. So we always have inventory available is my point. And I think we can manage that very effectively to ramp that up. If we needed to expand the logical place for us to add additional capacity would be Europe, where we've looked at a couple of opportunities, but we don't underneath at the moment, but instead of having to fly engines across the Atlantic that would make sense for us for future expansion. So really the Module Factory has ability, as I mentioned to expand geometrically and this is a huge, huge engine market that if we get a small percentage of that, that was available business, it's an enormous amount to us in a small impact on the overall market.\nJosh Sullivan: 37:38 Got it. And then when the split is complete, as far as reporting metrics between the two entities, are you still going to be reporting that or reoccurring FAD under the aviation assets? And then how are you looking at the dividend and capital allocation between the two?\nJoe Adams: 37:54 Yeah. So FAD is probably on the list of things to think about and it\u2019s probably lost some of its relevance in meaningfulness. So we will address that. I think at the spend that it's one of the things that we may not be doing going forward. So, and then in terms of capital allocation, as I mentioned, the plan is to -- is not necessarily every quarter try to grow the $2 billion invested capital on aviation, but to turn it more frequently and to shift more towards CFM56 engines. So given that there should be -- with the EBITDA contribution that we are looking at there should be available cash flow to either pay down debt or increase the dividend and if that comes to happen as we expect and we could do both of those.\nJosh Sullivan: 38:50 Got it. And then just one last one on Jefferson. How does the EBITDA generation work relative to utilization 50% or 75% of utilization? How does that relate to the per annum EBITDA figure you provided?\nJoe Adams: 39:04 Well, it's highly levered because, the first 25%, you don't -- you cover your fixed costs and then after that, it's highly levered and so -- and incrementally, it has to do with certain products have a higher contribution like crude by rail is probably our highest contributing asset because not only do you get the highest fee for unloading the railcars, but then typically you're blending it 2 to 1 or, 3 or 1 (ph) which some blend stock that you also bring in pipe and store and then charge a blending fee and then it goes out by pipe. So that's like number one product in terms of contribution, but if you're able to utilize types, the obvious benefit there is you can ramp up volume and there is almost no incremental expense. It's purely, it's already there. So, each have their own differences but it's -- so it's not a linear, I can't just give you one number, it will partly depend on the mix, but they are all positive contributions.\nJosh Sullivan: 40:13 Got it. Thank you for the time.\nJoe Adams: 40:14 Thanks.\nOperator: 40:19 Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Your line is open.\nChris Wetherbee: 40:25 Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Joe, I was hoping maybe you could help us with the Jefferson bridge on sitting here looking at the last half of the year, running around $2 million of quarterly adjusted EBITDA. I know we have a target for 50 to 90, were couple of months into the year. So can you give us either some near-term visibility on sort of what you're seeing in terms of the ramp up or how do we bridge this pretty substantial step-up?\nJoe Adams: 40:54 Well, it's just -- it\u2019s exactly as you're saying that it's higher utilization and higher volumes. So we have multiple projects underway via crude, fuel oil coming in by ship going out by pipe, additional crude by rail activity from both Motiva and from Exxon now, it is additional refined products activity. So it's really, it's just what I was talking about, it's additional volume that we've seen some of that increase in Q1, but we expect to see more of it during the year.\nChris Wetherbee: 41:33 So can you give us some, maybe some near-term numbers, I mean what is Q1 sort of look like as it contributes to that full-year number.\nJoe Adams: 41:41 Well, I did indicate the volumes in Q1 were up 25% roughly over Q4.\nChris Wetherbee: 41:48 Okay. So we can use that as a benchmark. Okay. That's super helpful. Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nJoe Adams: 41:52 Thanks.\nOperator: 41:56 Thank you.  Our next question comes from Robert Dodd with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nRobert Dodd: 42:08 Hi, guys. A question on the dividend and the outlook, obviously, in the past you've said 2 times coverage you would review the dividend 2 time coverage by FAD. FAD sounds like it's becoming less useful. There is a lot of macro geopolitical uncertainty and obviously spin come in or separation come in April. So, is that how we should think about it still on a combined basis. So could you give us an outlook on what metrics or what expectation should be for potential combined all set for business dividend growth?\nJoe Adams: 42:44 Yes. So we expected with the spin roughly 75% of the current dividend will be paid by Aviation and 25% by infrastructure. So that's how the new combined two shares would be treated from or will be split relative to the dividend -- the current dividend. In terms of increasing the dividend, as I mentioned with aviation, we expect probably to grow the asset base, probably less and grow the EBITDA more which means you'll have more free cash flow, which would allow us to potentially increase the dividend as one of the alternatives for that excess capital. So that's, that's something that we can do. We don't want to do it pre-spin because, there's so many other things going on, obviously, there's a lot of different the world is we've got a big project to get done with that and then we'll look at it. 43:43 In terms of infrastructure, it\u2019s a little hard for me because it's going to be a capital allocation discussion around growing that dividend relative to the investment opportunities that we would see in front of us and so that would be something I would anticipate talking more about. After the spin once we get out and have visibility on the capital opportunities for new projects.\nRobert Dodd: 44:11 I appreciate that. Thank you. And if I, could one short, obviously, I mean, you said new serviceable material and all other things it driven more by shop visits may be more back-end loaded. Is that also true with the Module Factory or does that mean that its seasonal -- more seasonal this year, more back-end loaded and is that kind of a normal seasonality or is that just kind of a COVID recovery seasonality that produces that back end loading for certainly the USM puts up?\nJoe Adams: 44:43 Well, for USM, it\u2019s really COVID related because when COVID started, the number of shop visits dropped as we've talked about before. Airlines did not want to put engines through a major overhaul when they had excess engines in the fleet. So first thing they do is use of the excess hours and cycles, that's happened now and now that you have a recovery then people are going to, all sudden say, oh, my god I\u2019m out of engines and I got to put them through the shops. So that's, that's what you're seeing with people saying that the shops are selling out for Q2 and Q3. So it's really that USM function is much more COVID related and seasonally related and it actually historically a lot of maintenance is done in Q1, because that's the slowest flying season it\u2019s like the yellow flag in the car race and you go into the shop when you, when everybody else is slowing down. So it's not seasonal from that point of view. 45:44 And then Module Factory, I don't anticipate a lot of seasonality there, again it's, it's a year round activity. So I don't -- it's not specifically tied to flying and we did a strong Q4, we've got obviously we put the number out. We don't know exactly -- we don't have enough history and data to say exactly how it's going to roll out and it's a relatively new products. SO I can't guarantee that it's going to be like a steadily increasing number every quarter which everyone would want. And I would want, but I -- we don't have enough information yet to be able to say that, but obviously we put it out there. So we have some reasonable expectation in a number of customers that are, they're using it is going to is going to increase. So that's, that's good. And I don't think it's going to be highly seasonal.\nRobert Dodd: 46:35 Thank you.\nJoe Adams: 46:38 Thank you.\nOperator: 46:40 Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to Alan Andreini for closing comments.\nAlan Andreini: 46:49 Thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q1.\nOperator: 46:56 This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Adams",
            "content": "01:45 Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 27th dividend as a public company and our 42nd consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on March 23, based on a shareholder record date of March 11. 02:04 Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD or funds available for distribution. We ended the year strongly with adjusted EBITDA of $124.8 million in Q4 2021, which is up 29% compared to $96.4 million in Q3 2021, and up 170% compared to $46.2 million in Q4 2020. In a similar fashion FAD was $120.1 million in Q4 2021, up 205% compared to $39.4 million in Q3 2021 and up 122% compared to $54.2 million in Q4 2020. During the fourth quarter, the $120.1 million FAD number was comprised of $161.2 million from our aviation leasing portfolio, $11.0 million from our infrastructure business and negative $52.1 million from corporate and other. 03:11 Now let's look at all of 2021 versus all of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was $336.3 million in 2021, up 38% versus $243.3 million in 2020. FAD was $242.2 million in 2021, up 2% versus $237.4 million in 2020. Both our aviation portfolio and infrastructure businesses contributed positive FAD for the year and overall 20% higher compared to 2020. Meanwhile, corporate expenses were higher compared to 2020, primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from higher average debt outstanding during the year. 03:56 Turning now to Aviation. Aviation had another up quarter with Q4 EBITDA of $103.7 million, while decreased flying due to Omicron dampened the recovery and leasing activity, we were able to grow our aerospace services EBITDA to $20.3 million for Q4, primarily due to an increasing number of sales and exchanges through our CFM56 module factory. We had approximately 10 active customers in the Module Factory and are seeing growing interest in the products from MROs or maintenance and repair organizations, airlines and lessors. And with our recently signed program with Lufthansa Technik covering the seven-year WestJet CFM56 engine maintenance program, we see growing validation and acceptance of the value proposition, which will expand the active customer base across the entire engine ecosystem. 04:57 Regarding aircraft and engine leasing, we see increased demand for additional equipment starting in Q2 driving higher lease rates and asset prices provided that strong forward travel bookings that we have today hold up. Overall, we see improving demand for assets and aftermarket maintenance services driving 2022 financial performance and strengthening our position in the commercial jet engine aftermarket. 05:26 Now let's turn to infrastructure. Jefferson, the big story with Jefferson in 2021 was major advancements on multiple product fronts with the two largest refineries in the United States and our largest customers, Motiva and Exxon. We started the year with refined products by rail and added a 10-year contract to operate a 2 million barrel multi-product and refined products export hub. And on the crude side, we've been receiving ship cargos, which we store, blend and move now by pipe. And we see a good pickup in crude by rail from Utah and Canada, which brings additional services and values to the terminal. 06:10 We're actively exploring multiple additional products for both refiners which we expect to add in 2022 and at least one new pipeline connection as well. While throughput volumes are up over 25% in early 2022 versus Q4 2021, we still are only about 33% utilized, but with additional activity from Exxon and Motiva, we have a path to high utilization coming into focus. 06:41 Repauno, Repauno had a terrific year in 2021 and is very well positioned for many years of significant growth. First let me list the 2021 accomplishments. One, in the first year of operation, we loaded 31 ships with butane for export. Second, we imported our first cargo of polymer-grade propylene so -- that has come to the East Coast in many years. Third, we began construction of the double unit train rail loop. Fourth, we expanded the truck rack which will allow direct rail to truck propane transloading. Since we operated a new cavern chiller (ph) which allows us for refrigerated LPG marine loading. And sixth, we completed a new bypass road providing direct highway truck access. 07:35 In terms of volumes, in 2020, we moved 4.3 million gallons through the terminal. In 2021, we moved a 130 million gallons. And in 2022, we expect to move 150 million to 175 million gallons. And then 2023 with an additional cryogenic tank, we plan to build that number could triple. Repauno is finding its niche with customers to offer unique capabilities for storing and transloading a wide variety of liquid petroleum products and intermediate specialty chemicals for both import and export in a critically important advantage location. As such, we see upside over time in this terminal fee per gallon potential. 08:31 Lastly, we've made significant progress on the Clean Planet joint venture and have begun the permitting process for the first plastics recycling plant at Repauno, which we expect to commence construction on in Q2 of 2022 and complete in Q2 of 2023. 08:52 Turning the Long Ridge. Long Ridge had a good quarter and year due to an earlier than planned start-up of the power plant, which allowed us to take advantage of elevated power prices in October, November before our long-term power sales agreements commenced. On a 100% basis, Long Ridge generated EBITDA of $37.4 million in Q4 and $58.8 million for all of 2021 well ahead of our budget. 09:19 Starting in January and up until last week, Long Ridge took an unscheduled maintenance outage fully covered by GE warranty for repairs to the steam turbine. The outage will reduce EBITDA in Q1 due to the loss of power revenue. We did however perform maintenance scheduled for later in the year, thus avoiding future outages and we completed the hydrogen blending project giving us the capability to become the first large frame power plant to be able to utilize zero carbon hydrogen as a fuel. 09:51 Under the recently enacted infrastructure bill, the U.S. government will be designated four locations as hydrogen hubs. Long Ridge is ideally qualified and we intend to apply for one of those. We also are in the final stages of negotiating to host a new biodegradable plastics manufacturer at Long Ridge. As part of that agreement, we would provide land, power and natural gas under long-term supply agreements. 10:21 Turning to Transtar. Transtar generated $16.7 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter from continuing operations and for the full year generated an annualized $68 million of adjusted EBITDA. In addition, Transtar generated $4.5 million of incremental cash flow from the sale of non-core equipment and excess land which was more than offset maintenance CapEx in the quarter. This is a collection of railroads that have very low maintenance CapEx and industry leading cash conversion, which we expect to continue in 2022. 10:57 In the fourth quarter, Transtar moved more than 55,000 carloads, slightly above fourth quarter of 2020 and steel production at Gary and Mon Valley remained stable despite supply chain downstream issues in the automotive and appliance sectors. Some loaded steel carloads in December were held at the origin until cars are offloaded downstream, but are expected to move in Q1 and Q2. This team is carrying forward early into the first quarter of 2022, but we expect to see increased steel movements in Q2 and beyond as pent-up demand is released and the supply chain rationalizes. 11:41 Looking forward to 2022, Transtar's goal is to grow its third-party businesses at the underutilized railroads. The team is executing on new transloading opportunities in Detroit and exploring large industrial customers for its thousand acre property in Northeast Texas. As non-core railcars are sold more than 1,500 storage spots are opening up across the network. And the team has a pipeline of opportunities to fill those vacant spots. 12:13 We're pleased to welcome Gary Long to the team as CEO of FTAI's Rail Investments. Gary brings more than 25 years of experience in the rail industry, including most recently as CEO of Genesee & Wyoming's European operations. Gary is very well suited to leverage the Transtar platform to execute on the growth initiatives we have set forth, both organically and through acquisitions. 12:37 In summary, we're very much looking forward to 2022 with aviation recovery gaining momentum, the company with our advances in aerospace service revenues and EBITDA. And in infrastructure, the maturation of multiple projects which now generate organic growth across all the platforms. And finally, the spin-off of infrastructure is moving ahead with expected completion in April, which will provide simplification of the business strategy combined with eliminating K-1s for investors. 13:13 So with that, I'll turn the call back to Alan. 14:07 Yeah. So, yeah, on the EBITDA for 2022 what we've been saying is, it's our best guesstimate or estimate is about $550 million for Aviation. And then with each one of the Infrastructure business go down there, the Jefferson, we're looking at between $50 million and $90 million of EBITDA, approximately for Long Ridge, our share roughly the total EBITDA is probably around $90 million, given the first quarter is going to be short, so our share is roughly about $45 million of EBITDA. Then Repauno is probably about $10 million, and Transtar approximately $75 million maybe $80 million, but $75 million is probably a good number. Does that answer your -- 15:11 Yeah. So, we still believe Jefferson, as I said was roughly a third utilized and if you count on the fact that Exxon is about to go next year to -- from $360 and 620,000 barrels a day and we'll achieve it is that today, it's a number one and two refiners and we have multiple discussions. We have a bigger list of new product offerings to each of them that we've ever had before, given the pipeline connectivity. So we very much believe will fill the terminal. And if you fill the terminal, you're looking at $150 million or more of EBITDA per annum. So that's something that we've always said, it's a question of when, not if, and we've had obviously a number of headwinds and things that -- the world seems it, throw obstacles regularly now but we seem to be able to jump higher each time. So we're managing them, but the terminal is very well positioned, it has a great product offering, great dialog and relationships to those two customers and now we have the benefit of a higher oil price, which should -- all of that should help so. So we're still, we still believe that will fill up. 16:26 In terms of Transtar, what I've sort of indicated the people is, if we got a business from U.S. Steel is generating roughly 80 million of EBITDA, which we can grow right-of-way and storage business and transload and add maybe 15 million to 20 million over a three to four years from that those types of activities. So you say, you get it $100 million, what we'd like to do is add 100 million from non-U.S. steel customers across a range of activities being -- could the industrial development at one of the four railroads that we -- we're basically given as part of the transaction. It could also be growing segments like repair and maintenance activities, terminal operations is another one that we've been looking at. So there is a list of things that we're going to explore to try to sort of figure out how to create that 100 million. But if we were able to do that, I think that $100 million from a long-term customer such as U.S. Steel, it's basically got great downside protection and it's very stable. And then have $100 million of third-party business from other non-U.S. steel customers in a really good economic industrial backdrop in the U.S. today that would be a great company and great much higher multiple than what we take paid going in. So that's kind of the business plan there. 17:59 The Repauno is another one, I think is amazing in that. Really there are -- there are only two terminals on the East Coast of United States that can handle these types of natural gas liquids and really the other one is type to ship primarily. So we have rail, we have truck and we have import and export capabilities, which really is, we're starting to find from the customer reactions, people then saying, god I've been looking for this for years and I finally found it. We can bring in products like butadiene, which I didn't even know how to spell it a quarter ago. So there's things that we're learning about the location of the capabilities that are very exciting, but just the natural gas liquids business. As I mentioned, we probably will get a long-term commitment and build aboveground storage tank, which would be in service next year. And that would give us triple the capacity we have today and really allow us to load VLGCs, which puts you in the ratable business of supplying PDH plants in Europe of natural gas liquid products. So that's a big jump. 19:15 And then beyond that we have the ability to build probably 3 million to 4 million barrels of underground storage, which we could set up a multiple caverns to handle all these different products that I just mentioned. So, and it could be important in exports. So that's truly unique and it's also -- it's not on the Gulf Coast, which is a big advantage for many buyers. So -- and that doesn't count the 200 acres. We have above ground that has nothing built on it will probably use 10 acres for this Clean Planet joint venture. So there's other industrial development that we could do there. So just on the amazing property with lots of special attributes that I think it's in scarcity value that nobody can replicate. So I've always felt that we was truly unique and extremely valuable. 20:08 Then our Long Ridge, we have the power plant contracted for the next 8.5 years. So really the main upside is two things, one is bringing a tenant to the properties, so that we can add additional services such as selling gas and we can sell power at a higher price. So that -- and I think we're going to, we have a good shot at one or two that I mentioned then one on the biodegradable plastics, which we're pretty far along on being ideal tenant, because they use natural gas, microbes and electricity, which we can -- we don't supply the microbes, but we supply the other twp. So it's an ESG positive tenant bringing under the site. So that I think is, would be a good development. And then the other one I mentioned is the hydrogen. We now are the first power plant they can blend hydrogen and use it as a fuel. Large frame power plant and when you look at the specs of the hydrogen hub that the government just published. One of them is -- one of the hubs has to be in a large gas producing region and have a proximity to a power plant. And so I can't, we can think of like, who else would that fit. We have a power plant on the property and there is gas underneath this, all in a radius if like 100 miles is Utica. So we're very excited about that. Don't know how to quantify what that means, but it sounds great to be a hydrogen hub and it doesn't cost anything. So why not? So that is kind of a tour of an effect that gives you, what you were looking for. 22:11 Yes. 22:16 Thanks. 22:53 We think that, as I mentioned Omicron slowed down a lot of expansion activity and we see it in particular like if an airline was flying in pre-COVID era of 350 to 400 hours a month on an airplane. In the fourth quarter, they might have flown 200, and so that affects our revenue from maintenance and maintenance reserves that we take in. So that's, that was an impact to the fourth quarter. So it was not -- to refer you is not a great quarter. I mean, given that we were hoping that people are going to, for the holidays add capacity and fly, unfortunately Omicron unchanged the trajectory of a lot of that. But as I mentioned, and then the first quarter is better we expect sequentially better, but it's not going to, it's never seasonally the greatest quarter because the winter months are not the busiest for air travel really starts to pick up scheduling in March and April. 23:41 So our expectation is that Q2 and Q3 will return to our targeted EBITDA margin of 25% or close to that. And we have a pretty good -- we have reasonable visibility on that, as I said, it's a function of the airlines are seeing right now, pretty strong forward bookings of flights and so we're getting request says our other people. I'm sure for additional assets and sort of that saying that you can have is when an airline calls off and say, I need more aircraft because they are the ones that have the best view on what's happening on the travel side and that's what's happening right now. So we see a -- and I have also monitored the other maintenance shops are talking that being sold out in Q2 and Q3. And one of the big engine manufacturers just said they're seeing return to pre-COVID levels by the end of this year. So there is a lot of other corroborating data that supports that. So that's our outlook, that's our expectation for to get to the levels that we just talked about. 25:32 Yeah. We have been talking about and we actually did take a step towards shifting the mix of the portfolio somewhat and that we expect -- I think we had like 100, Pratt 4000 and CF680 engines and over time -- in somewhat over this year we will probably reduce that number down maybe by half. So we had about 10 million of gains from those types of sales in the fourth quarter. We will see more of that this year I think as well. And at the same time, we are looking to increase the percentage of the portfolio in the CFM56 engine. So that, which obviously makes sense that's what we've been talking about for five years. So we're going to shift the mix and I think that those assets the Pratt 4000, CF680s have been great returns for us and we have very low basis. So, and there is a lot of demand given the freight market. So I think we'll continue to see some gains from those during the year. 26:30 And then, in terms of managing capital going forward, I think we're going to try to turn the portfolio more and have asset sales replenish new investments since. So one of the things you can do is that we're focused on right now as we, if we buy off-lease assets and then put them on-lease, you create a, quite a bit of value and could take a gain. And as part of that, we're also looking at the potential to sell some of those assets that are on longer-term leases and retain the engine management of that, of those assets, which really has a great, is a win-win and it opens the lessor market up to the whole ecosystem, if we can sell and long-term six to eight-year lease book of gain and then keep what we think is the best part of the deal, which is the engines and maintenance contract that's another value for us that no one else can recognize and it allows us to use that capital again to sort of do it all over again. So that's sort of a long way of saying that we have liquidity. We don't think we're going to be expanding the invested capital dramatically and we're not trying to do that. We're trying to grow the service component, so that in the someday in the future, we hope that service -- aerospace services revenue, EBITDA was equal the leasing activity EBITDA. 28:07 Yeah. 29:21 It's close, but it's a little bit different. In the fourth quarter, most of that $20 million was from the Module Factory, more than 80% of it was Module Factory. SO the USM was probably under $3 million, between $2 and $3 million of contribution in Q4. And we do expect $20 million from USM this year in 2022, but again USM, is driven primarily off of shop visits. So in the fourth quarter and first quarter there are still are a limited number of shop visits are occurring, but if you look at  the day they're sold out now for Q2 and Q3 in the shop. So it's happening that the shop -- the engines green time has been burned off and people are going to need to put our energy to shops. So that will drive USM sales is activity in the shop visits side which will be more back-end loaded than what the number -- it's not 5 million a quarter, it will ramp up to something. But we still believe $20 million is a good estimate for the year. 31:05 Well, right now we have a bit of it. The Module Factory is flowing through gain on sale but USM is probably being BOPIS revenues and costs -- minus cost of good sale. So we have a different treatment, which is probably not great from long-term, we need to spend some time and see if we can get that right, but it's -- because it's so new the accountants want to have a classified differently right now. But, so that's not something I can totally understand, but that is, that's what we did in the fourth quarter. 31:53 Yes. A lot of very good progress on the part that the they're very happy with it. It's performing well. There is a lot of back and forth on information and it's progressing and we're hopeful that that will be addressed soon, but it's, as you know, it's very hard to put a specific date on it. So, but good progress, that's it. 32:42 Yeah. It's one of the proud that we hope we will come through this year, which is there is several proposals out now and it does help with crude prices high because there is more spread and more volatility creates, what the refiners are always looking at is optionality to trying to source the lowest cost crude from wherever that comes from and volatility and high prices help. So we do see the likelihood of that activity. We've already seen it coming from the Utah market, which is, it's not a spread business because in Uttar there is no, there is no other way to move it. So it has to go by rail. But in Canada, it is a spread and supply business and so that market will should open up. 33:36 Thanks. 33:46 Good morning. 34:08 Yes. So that's a great one. And so if you think about the lift side of the deal, we just -- we supply an overhauled LPG low pressure turbine to Lufthansa which gets installed in the WestJet engine when they're doing the shop visits. So Lufthansa doesn't have to do any of the maintenance on that and it's an immediate -- we are going to install that in 30 days rather than have to wait for any parts and have any delays. So there is a benefit to them on that and there is also a benefit, just purely for an airline. If you need LPT and it has to go into shop it could be anywhere from three to six months. And so we have a little chart that shows the total savings from using the Module Factory to be just time wise could be $0.5 million or more, and we don't charge for that. So that's just, that's added benefit that people get and I think that, those numbers are going to get bigger too as you see the shop start to build up to fill up and then you factor on top of that, what we haven't yet seen is supply chain issues in aviation components, but it's coming, it's happened in every other industry and the only reason it didn't happen in aviation is because there wasn't a lot of activity, but it's definitely coming. And so, as you see engine shop visits start to go back out to four to six to eight months, which is what happened pre-COVID then the Module Factory benefits become even greater, so we're very -- 35:43 And then on top of that I think you also have some inflation potential that hasn't, you see the OEMs raise prices last year 7%, which is amazing given the state of the financial condition their client faces in, but they are able to raise prices in. In that environment 7%, what will they do, if they have like 7% inflation? So that actually is also another benefit for us on the -- on us -- on our side, so those are both factored in. In terms of capacity, we use about -- at the Montreal facility at Lockheed Martin, it's about 300,000 square feet, we're using, about 40,000 to 50,000 of those today. And there is plenty of room to open that up. So we have plenty of capacity there and every engine that we inductance into facility we've break it into modules. So as soon as it comes in it separated as a fan of core and a low pressure turbine. So we always have inventory available is my point. And I think we can manage that very effectively to ramp that up. If we needed to expand the logical place for us to add additional capacity would be Europe, where we've looked at a couple of opportunities, but we don't underneath at the moment, but instead of having to fly engines across the Atlantic that would make sense for us for future expansion. So really the Module Factory has ability, as I mentioned to expand geometrically and this is a huge, huge engine market that if we get a small percentage of that, that was available business, it's an enormous amount to us in a small impact on the overall market. 37:54 Yeah. So FAD is probably on the list of things to think about and it's probably lost some of its relevance in meaningfulness. So we will address that. I think at the spend that it's one of the things that we may not be doing going forward. So, and then in terms of capital allocation, as I mentioned, the plan is to -- is not necessarily every quarter try to grow the $2 billion invested capital on aviation, but to turn it more frequently and to shift more towards CFM56 engines. So given that there should be -- with the EBITDA contribution that we are looking at there should be available cash flow to either pay down debt or increase the dividend and if that comes to happen as we expect and we could do both of those. 39:04 Well, it's highly levered because, the first 25%, you don't -- you cover your fixed costs and then after that, it's highly levered and so -- and incrementally, it has to do with certain products have a higher contribution like crude by rail is probably our highest contributing asset because not only do you get the highest fee for unloading the railcars, but then typically you're blending it 2 to 1 or, 3 or 1 (ph) which some blend stock that you also bring in pipe and store and then charge a blending fee and then it goes out by pipe. So that's like number one product in terms of contribution, but if you're able to utilize types, the obvious benefit there is you can ramp up volume and there is almost no incremental expense. It's purely, it's already there. So, each have their own differences but it's -- so it's not a linear, I can't just give you one number, it will partly depend on the mix, but they are all positive contributions. 40:14 Thanks. 40:54 Well, it's just -- it's exactly as you're saying that it's higher utilization and higher volumes. So we have multiple projects underway via crude, fuel oil coming in by ship going out by pipe, additional crude by rail activity from both Motiva and from Exxon now, it is additional refined products activity. So it's really, it's just what I was talking about, it's additional volume that we've seen some of that increase in Q1, but we expect to see more of it during the year. 41:41 Well, I did indicate the volumes in Q1 were up 25% roughly over Q4. 41:52 Thanks. 42:44 Yes. So we expected with the spin roughly 75% of the current dividend will be paid by Aviation and 25% by infrastructure. So that's how the new combined two shares would be treated from or will be split relative to the dividend -- the current dividend. In terms of increasing the dividend, as I mentioned with aviation, we expect probably to grow the asset base, probably less and grow the EBITDA more which means you'll have more free cash flow, which would allow us to potentially increase the dividend as one of the alternatives for that excess capital. So that's, that's something that we can do. We don't want to do it pre-spin because, there's so many other things going on, obviously, there's a lot of different the world is we've got a big project to get done with that and then we'll look at it. 43:43 In terms of infrastructure, it's a little hard for me because it's going to be a capital allocation discussion around growing that dividend relative to the investment opportunities that we would see in front of us and so that would be something I would anticipate talking more about. After the spin once we get out and have visibility on the capital opportunities for new projects. 44:43 Well, for USM, it's really COVID related because when COVID started, the number of shop visits dropped as we've talked about before. Airlines did not want to put engines through a major overhaul when they had excess engines in the fleet. So first thing they do is use of the excess hours and cycles, that's happened now and now that you have a recovery then people are going to, all sudden say, oh, my god I'm out of engines and I got to put them through the shops. So that's, that's what you're seeing with people saying that the shops are selling out for Q2 and Q3. So it's really that USM function is much more COVID related and seasonally related and it actually historically a lot of maintenance is done in Q1, because that's the slowest flying season it's like the yellow flag in the car race and you go into the shop when you, when everybody else is slowing down. So it's not seasonal from that point of view. 45:44 And then Module Factory, I don't anticipate a lot of seasonality there, again it's, it's a year round activity. So I don't -- it's not specifically tied to flying and we did a strong Q4, we've got obviously we put the number out. We don't know exactly -- we don't have enough history and data to say exactly how it's going to roll out and it's a relatively new products. SO I can't guarantee that it's going to be like a steadily increasing number every quarter which everyone would want. And I would want, but I -- we don't have enough information yet to be able to say that, but obviously we put it out there. So we have some reasonable expectation in a number of customers that are, they're using it is going to is going to increase. So that's, that's good. And I don't think it's going to be highly seasonal. 46:38 Thank you."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks there will be a question-and-answer session.   And now I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alan Andreini. You may begin sir.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Operator. I would like to welcome you to the Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure third quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Christopher, our Chief Financial Officer. We have posted an investor presentation in our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you have not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only mode and is being webcast. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including FAD. The reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements, by their nature, are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our quarterly report filed with the SEC. Now I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Adams: Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 26th dividend as a public company and our 41st consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on November 29 based on a shareholder record date of November 15. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD or funds available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2021 was $96.4 million compared to Q2 2021 of $68 million and Q3 of 2020 of $58.6 million. FAD was $39.4 million in Q3 2021 versus $68.3 million in Q2 2021 and $39.9 million in Q3 2020. During the third quarter, the $39.4 million FAD number was comprised of $90.5 million from our aviation leasing portfolio, negative $0.2 million from our infrastructure business and negative $50.9 million from corporate and other. Turning now to Aviation. The aviation recovery continues as our EBITDA for Q3 was approximately $100 million, up from $80 million in Q2, and $60 million in Q1. We see broad improvement in demand across narrowbody markets, with some delays resulting from the Delta variant. As an example, we signed leases for approximately 30 engines in the quarter that airlines took actual delivery of approximately 15 as several regions had continuing travel restrictions, but for the most part now have been reopened in Q4. We have a strong backlog of engine demand and expect to start new leases on over 40 engines in Q4, of which 30 are signed today and 10 have already been delivered. We're also closing new sale leaseback transactions on 16 aircraft with Alitalia and ITA and 19 aircraft with Avianca and funding those in November for an aggregate new investment of $340 million. The term of the lease backs range from six months to 10 years, with an average of 15 months, and three fourths of these 319s and 320 aircraft are CFM56 powered aircraft, which is an excellent addition when brings our total CFM56 engine count to approximately 300 engines. Our three CFM56 Aerospace activities all made great strides forward. On PMA the next part has completed production and documentation is being assembled to make the final FAA application complete in the next few weeks. As such, we expect to be able to use both parts for our own engines in Q1 2022 and are seeing strong third party interest for multiple airlines and MROS or maintenance repair organizations for shock visits beginning in 2022. On the module factory we have completed a number of module sales and swaps and are progressing with a few airlines in negotiating long term programmatic supply agreements. Elsewhere our used serviceable material business or USM Business with AAR we are targeting approximately $10 million in sales in Q4 with momentum growing into 2022. All combined 2022 is shaping up really well with leasing EBITDA expected to be $500 million for the year and the three CFM 56 Aerospace activity is expected to contribute between $50 million and $100 million of total EBITDA for the year total EBITDA for aviation for 2022 is expected to be $550 million to $600 million. Let\u2019s now turn to infrastructure, starting with Jefferson, on the heels of the previously announced 10-year deal with Exxon in mid-July, the Jefferson Terminal continues to reshape and transform logistics options in the U.S. Gulf Coast, and in the Beaumont Port Arthur Texas refinery region. This region remains one of the largest refinery footprints in North America, and the Jefferson terminal has become an essential extension of the two largest refineries in North America. Looking specifically at Q3, near term headwinds continue to impact the economics of crude by rail from Western Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. However, due to the improved logistics associated with the Exxon Mobil cross channel pipeline system, Jefferson has seen an increase of 44% in 2021, compared to 2020 in the refined products by rail to Mexico business, resulting in Jefferson posting another positive quarter with EBITDA of $1.9 million. Enhanced terminal infrastructure and the in-service pipeline projects connecting Jefferson to Exxon and to Motiva have been completed, and baseline business continues to steadily increase as these business partners ramp up refinery activity. As we look towards 2022, high oil prices and demand for refined products is good for Jefferson. Local refiners are lining up new sources of discounted crude from markets in Western Canada and New interbasin  and looking for terminals like Jefferson to optimize blends and lower logistics costs. Additionally, international oil flows are increasing and Jefferson will be receiving its first ever inbound Aframax marine cargo from the North Sea this month. We have high expectations for additional inbound marine volumes from overseas and have line of sight on several other significant opportunities in the near future. Specifically, are we making progress on DRU, delivery recovery unit discussions as well as discussions relating to the movement of heavy wax barrels, which cannot move by pipeline. These two projects are important because they would lead to a radical flow of trains, which are not dependent upon crude spreads. Finally, we're moving forward with several interesting opportunities regarding the movement of natural gas liquids and other products which would involve the integration of Repauno, Long Ridge and Jefferson into a seamless flexible and unique supply chain. Turning the Repauno , Repauno continued its strong phase in the third quarter, loading 14 marine vessels with over 900,000 barrels of butane down for international markets. This activity was complemented by increased truck movements to local premium markets to signal the beginning of the fall of gasoline blending season. Rounding out the first export seas in the highly flexible multimodal port and rail terminal firmly established itself as a premier distribution hub on the east coast of the United States. And we're excited to enter the local propane distribution market this winter. By increasing the suite of products handled simultaneously at the terminal and providing security of supply for local markets in the Northeast, we're meeting the customer's needs not only in New Jersey, but also in the entire Northeast Region. Pushing towards further development outlined in FTAIs long term vision, the newest port on the Delaware River plans to see expanded capacity, with three plus million barrels of highly efficient underground storage capable of handling a wide variety of LPG and refined products to be ready for export via all size ships, including VLGCs. Repauno is also looking at import opportunities as they rise in various markets and under various market conditions. Product movements will be available by rail, inbound and outbound by water across multiple new high capacity deep water docks, and eventually buy type from all major North American producing regions. And with 250 plus acres available for development we also continue to move forward with several renewable opportunities. Repauno is prime for staging and manufacturing of wind farm components and for waste plastic recycling projects. These discussions are at advanced stages and we hope to have one or more concluded by the year end. Together with a Jefferson facility in Beaumont Texas, FTAI is well positioned with multimode of distribution and export terminals on both the Gulf Coast and the Mid-Atlantic seaboard, providing unparalleled levels of service flexibility and optionality for our customers. Turning now to Long Ridge, Long Ridge has successfully transitioned from a development project into a cash flowing operating business, as evidenced by the 15.5 million of EBITDA on 100% basis generated in Q3. Most of the Q3 EBITDA was attributable to our natural gas production, which was sold into the market. And now that the power plant is operating, our natural gas is being utilized to generate electricity. While natural gas prices have rallied recently, and we benefited from that in Q3, the economics of generating electricity are even better. We anticipate Long Ridge to generate EBITDA of approximately $15 million in Q4 and $37 million in Q1 2022, which taken together is more than $40 million higher than we expected when we initially underwrote the project. This incremental cash flow is a result of completing construction nearly a month ahead of schedule and higher power natural gas prices in the market today. Our fixed price power sales agreement commenced in February, locking in an attractive margin for the next seven years to 10 years, and generating approximately $120 million per year of EBITDA. We\u2019ve also recently seen lots of interests from power intensive industries that want to locate and build new facilities at properties like Long Ridge. Importantly, we remain on track to be the first large frame power plant in the U.S. to blend hydrogen into our natural gas stream. We will start with a 5% Hydrogen blend in December and hope to increase this percentage over time. Turning now to Transtar, our newest addition Transtar is off to a great start. John Karns and his team are already meeting or exceeding expectations. But I'll start with an important metric in the short line rail business which is safety and that Transtar continues to lead the short line railroad industry and safety and is well positioned to win another President's Award for safety from the American short line and Regional Railroad Association. All of the Transtar railroads are FRA and Ocean recordable injury free in 2021. Since July 28 to date, the Transtar acquisition closed, the company is tracking to the $80 million annual EBITDA number that we have projected. Transition expenses are tapering off and expected to be deminimis in 2022. As to the core, there the strong steel markets continue to support shipment of both finished steel and raw material. And we believe that improving ship availability will drive robust steel shipments for auto, which is a high profit margin business for us. And we could see increased shipments to that sector in Q4 of this year in Q1 of next year. Other steel segments are holding steady and strong. Mon Valley is running full while Gary Indiana has a plan maintenance outage at the number six furnace which is expected to be completed in November. As we look to 2022, we expect multiple and new third party opportunities to grow the $80 million EBITDA number. We are in discussions with third parties regarding car storage opportunities, and railcar repair opportunities just to name two. In short, everything we had hoped to see happen post the acquisition is happening. Turning down corporate items on the spin out of infrastructure, we have made considerable progress on the spin-off of infrastructure and conversion to sea corps. In Q3, we completed the refinancing of the Transtar acquisition financing, and are now focused on completing the documentation and agreements which we hope to be finalized in December of this year for an SEC filing before year-end, which would set us up for having two separate trading entities in Q1 of 2022. The existing FTAI entity will retain aviation business and assets and all existing corporate debt totaling approximately $2.3 billion pre-acquisition of the Alitalia and Avianca fleets. Infrastructure to be spun out as a new C Corp entity comprised of Jefferson, Repauno, Long Ridge and Transtar will retain all related project level debt of those entities and intends to remit approximately $800 million in cash or obligations as part of the separation. While we intend to monetize this obligation to the maximum amount, the spin will not be subject to raising additional financing at completion. So in conclusion, the ramp back up in aviation to 2019 levels is progressing. Our revenue pass the kilometers continue to rise. And as a result, we're seeing engine lease rates and demand for sale leasebacks rise as well. And with the industry still straining from the shock of COVID-19, we're seeing demand for our Chromalloy, Lockheed Martin AAR suite of products growing as well. As the infrastructure projects have restarted three to five years ago are now in full ramp up mode, these projects along with Transtar now give us the ability to spin infrastructure into a robust standalone company. That vision which we've been planning for years is about to become reality. So we're at an exciting time in FTAI\u2019s history, we're at that point because of the hard work of a lot of outstanding employees, and directors and the cooperation and partnership with some great customers. And I want to thank everyone for helping bring us to this exciting inflection point. With that, I will turn the call back to Alan.\nAlan Andreini: Thanks, Joe. Operator, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, Alan.  Our first question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is open.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good morning. Joe, I wanted to start with a question around the pricing on the bridge financing for the two aviation deals that you announced and the plans for repayment there, and maybe you could just talk about the expectation for the balance sheet and leverage more broadly going forward as well.\nJoe Adams: Yes, so. So that's financing, we wanted to keep it short, cheap and flexible. So we have structured a one year facility, which I believe the rate will be less LIBOR less than 300 LIBOR plus 300, a little less than that, like LIBOR plus 275. And, and pre payable at any time. And our goal over that is to prepay that from the 800 million of infrastructure funding, that's going to come back to aviation. So essentially be reducing debt net on a on a net basis when the spin happens at Aviation. And so that's what we wanted to have that immediately or pre payable immediately. In terms of the leverage for the companies and then we stated as part of the spin, we wanted to maintain BB rating for the aviation aerospace business. And we've been given very good feedback on that. I think we're in good shape, given the outline of what I just said. And, and both companies would then have access to capital going forward. So, I think it all sort of fits together with the parameters and the requirements that we set out to do as part of the spin.\nJustin Long: Great. And on aviation. Could you also talk about the level of utilization that you're assuming into the fourth quarter and into 2022, as well as you think about the guidance you provided? And would also love to get a little bit more color on the quarterly cadence of the non-leasing aviation EBITDA. I know you said that it's still expected to be 50 million to 100 million next year, but just wanted to understand how that's going to ramp over the next couple of quarters or so.\nJoe Adams: Yes, so the utilization. I think our engine utilization is a little over 60% in Q3, which was less than what we had hoped it would be. And I think it's really primarily or almost exclusively driven by the Delta variant and the COVID. And we saw a lot of airlines who are gearing up to take additional equipment and, and we as I mentioned, we had a lot of engine lease deals signed, but then when the restrictions started being re-imposed and airlines started, they started to slow down the ramp up and activity. And that sort of impacted the third quarter. We're seeing a lot of activity though, now in the market in October, November, and they said we've got -- we expect to put 40 engines on lease. I think that would bring our engine utilization up to about 70% or a little bit higher and we expect next year to operate in the 75% to 80% utilization range throughout the year and really, every airline we're talking to today and is looking for additional equipment and a lot of engines. And I think importantly the deals with Avianca, Alitalia, American Airlines, we did all come with our ability to expand those relationships and provide engines and engine management services. So it's an integrated package. And we see the market for 2022 developing very nicely. And all signs are that people are now going to be adding and growing their businesses again next year. In terms of the crude products, we also expect a very strong year. We've had good momentum and all of our businesses with the exception of TMA because the second part is not yet approved. But USM has developed nicely. We have 20 year engines and tear down. And we are one of the largest providers of USM. I think the ramp up and shop visit activity has not picked up yet. But that's not surprising; we expect to see that in 2022. And when that does, we expect strong levels of sales for USM. So I think that there'll be growth throughout the quarter, but I think throughout the year, each quarter, but I think it's going to start 2022 fairly strong. So it's not it's not a it's not a steep ramp. In terms of the PMA, our indications from Airlines is that they're very interested in those products, once they're available, and we ourselves are will be putting the PMA into our own engine. So we have a number of shop is scheduled. But we also expect a number of airlines to step up and start using the PMA, probably beginning in Q2 of next year. And then that could ramp significantly and Chromalloy has said they're going to begin production of parts as soon as the application has filed, so they will have inventory available. And then the big upside, as I've said before, I think is really on the module factory because that's our storefront, that's our cash register. That's where we all three products can be combined, and providing real value and real savings to airlines by their selling individual modules or engines that we've overhauled and we see a number of airlines today as airlines are coming out of distress or restructuring that have postponed shop visits or we're in are now looking at returning engines to lessors and others in a run out condition. They are preferring to buy engines or exchange them with us as opposed to putting it through the shop. So we see a lot of upside on the module factory as we bring all those products together integrated. And I think that will be the biggest revenue contributor of the three next year by a good margin.\nJustin Long: Very helpful. Thanks, Joe. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Sullivan with Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey good morning.\nJoe Adams: Good morning.\nJosh Sullivan: Just on the on the current PMA submission, how's that tracking relative to the first part and what the FAA has requested just as kind of a guide path? And then just curious how these the following pretty parts are moving forward as well?\nJoe Adams: Yes, it's tracking very similarly, in that the FAA is being provided information along the way. So there's a lot of back and forth and review of test data and engineering information. So it's been very similar way, the first part of that and that's, that's the way Chromalloy has been approaching these products and it's worked well because then there's no, there should be no surprises at the end. The second part is technically more complex than the first part. So there's probably a little bit more engineering and manufacturing data that's needed. But it's all, it's all been reviewed and signed off as we go. So I think that the final submission should and the approval should track, similar to what happened with the first part and Chromalloy is very confident, they've never had never had a part that didn't get approved. So, so it's, I would say very similar in terms of process to the first part. And then this, the, the third, fourth and fifth are in design and engineering and are on track to be submitted in late 2022 or early 2023. So those, those are less complex parts. Obviously, we started with the more expensive ones and the higher difficulty ones first.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. And then maybe one on the infrastructure side. With Transtar, the $80 million in EBITDA you're looking at those multiple opportunities that you mentioned in the remarks, I think auto and elsewhere, what do you think the timing on those projects are? And then does the global supply crunch here allow those opportunities maybe to speed up?\nJoe Adams: Some of them are sort of, grind it out by adding storage and repair services and right away income that occurred just gradually and over every quarter. And then some of them can be really project driven if you get a new customer or you have a new service that you can provide it could be, a step function up. And the rail market obviously, is, is strong, the core industries that rail serves are all doing pretty well. We see development opportunities, many in many different spots and locations. We had a good dialogue with U.S. Steel about additional opportunities we can provide them. So that, the playbook is really to try to, come up with 10 ideas that you can pursue, and hopefully three or four of them head. And that's, that's exactly what happened at rail America when we did that, and those tend to be sizable, and they tend to be sticky. So it feels like, it feels like deja vu and but we're in a very good macro environment with U.S. industry being strong and an infrastructure bill coming which, who knows what that's going to provide, but it's going to be good in some in different areas. And we also see it in Long Ridge. We see a lot of companies have announced they're going to expand and build factories in the Midwest, and that's good for railroads, because that means a lot of stuff is going to be moving around. So I think the environment is good. And we're, we've got the playbook and we're, I think we're going to hit on a few of them.\nJosh Sullivan: Thank you for the time.\nJoe Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Next, from Guiliano Bologna with Compass Point. Your line is open.\nGuiliano Bologna: Good morning, I guess jumping in on, I had a quick question on the PMA side, then I have a kind of a follow up question on a different topic. But one thing I was curious about was, you have to have the first part approved. Second part is coming in, hopefully the relatively near term. And I think one of the discussion point that\u2019s come up in the past is that a lot of airlines order, the first and second part that you're going after in sets. And that's probably create a little bit of slow rollout at first, I'm curious if you have a lot of orders for sets or you have a lot of orders that are contingent on have both parts being approved to sell to third parties. And then from there just to get a general sense of contribution of those two parts from a savings perspective and what you can do with those savings in the near term?\nJoe Adams: Yes, so there are orders for sets. And I think you correctly point out if an engine, if an airline's going to put an engine through the shop, they want to put enough PMA in it to make it worthwhile. And so having two parts, particularly, the high value parts that were the second part that we're making, is pretty important to the program. So, so I think that they are sort of joined together for many airlines that particularly because they know what's coming. And so if they had a decision to make, and rather than putting the first part without knowing the second part is coming in, it's easier to say, well I'm not doing a lot of shopping today so why don't I just wait for the second one, and then I'll decide. So I think that's the dynamic. But every airline knows it's coming. It's a big, it's a big deal in the industry and, and they're very eager to, to get it. So I think that backdrop is quite positive. And we expect as do most of the industry is third party shop as it are starting to grow and we think will increase significantly in 2022. So that will also drive because if you can't get parts or your shop is delayed, that'll also facilitate looking at PMA as an alternative. And the other thing we have is you have some significant potential inflation and metals out there. So you could see bigger price increases from OEMs when people have experienced previously. So that's another dynamic that I think could help the effort. So I think it's, that's all, that's all shaping up pretty nicely. And then in terms of the percentage, I think the first two parts are 60% of the savings that we can provide. So if the, if the five parts in total are 80% of this aircraft cost then this is 60% of the 80%, or half of it. So 50% of the total aircraft cost is represented in these first two parts.\nGuiliano Bologna: Got it. That's great. That's great. And surging to a different topic. I'm invested , so I was curious about one thing about the split of the company to judges is where if the preferred shares, if you intend to move to purchase one way or the other, I'm assuming they stay with aviation, but we get to confirm that.\nJoe Adams: Yes, that's correct. It\u2019s Data Aviation.\nGuiliano Bologna: And then the only other question was, I think you referred to the infrastructure business being -- off as a C Corp. I'm assuming using some sort of offer limited structure that would not have a long  \nJoe Adams: I didn't quite understand the question.\nGuiliano Bologna: And on the aviation side, you mentioned what kind of legal structure you're planning on using? I'm assuming any legal structure you're planning is going to remove the K-ones?\nJoe Adams: Yes, it'll be a it'll be a corporation, a corporate structure. That would be a non-U.S. Corporation.\nGuiliano Bologna: That's great. That's perfect. Thank you very much. And I'll jump back in the queue.\nJoe Adams: So it does, it eliminates K-ones. Just to draw a line under that.\nGuiliano Bologna: Perfect. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you so much.\nJoe Adams: Yes. Thanks.\nOperator: Next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Your line is open.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe want to touch on Jefferson for a moment. So Joe, you mentioned the DRU opportunity. I also wanted to kind of get a sense of how we think about the pipelines. And when we might see opportunities ramped up there. I'm sure there's probably some WCS, WTI spread dynamics that we need to consider here. But as you think about 4Q, and then maybe the first half of next year, kind of give us some sense of what the outlook is, in terms of EBITDA or FAD in that business?\nJoe Adams: Yes, we so that, I mean, the pipelines are operating, which is great. And that was a big part of getting them into service getting operating and function. And now obviously, we're, we're all over, everybody to try to use them. So that's, that's the game and we have multiple pathways to sort of getting to our numbers and increasing the utilization. We just need one or two of them to hit. And obviously with the markets improving from an oral price point of view, refined product demand point of view, from refineries looking to bring in crudes from discount groups from all over the world. That helps because we're positioned to try to provide all those options and optionality and the services that they need, whether it's by water from the North Sea, as we mentioned, or it's blended with Permian, or it comes from Utah, and heavy wax train, and we blend. So we have all of that in front of everybody. And it's this question of, of getting a couple or two of those to hit. And that's, that's really what all of our focus and attention is on that. And we have multiple pathways to get there. So I'm confident we'll, we'll get there and the environment is going to help when we need to do we just need to execute on it?\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Alright, that's helpful. And then maybe a bigger picture question. When we think about aviation post-split can you give us a sense of maybe what you think this sort of, I guess the question is the capital that has the potential to be deployed on an annual basis, given the size that you guys will be at the split, I just want to get a rough sense of kind of what you think the opportunity set is ahead of aviation as a standalone, maybe what kind of capital you'd be deploying on an annual basis?\nJoe Adams: Yes, so we've historically, if you look back, we've we've tended to invest between 300 and 500 million a year, pretty consistently, although I always say we don't budget CapEx, we don't tell anybody that that's what we want to do the beginning of the year, because that's not the right way to think about investing. But it's been $300 million to $500 million and now what we're doing is really I think focused on, we're focused on the CFM 56, obviously. And we're focused on some of these transactions that we think we can add engine business as part of the as part of the transaction. So, as I mentioned Avianca, Alitalia, American, we believe we're going to have follow on opportunities above and beyond the sale leaseback that will be enhanced design relationship enhance our profitability and not requiring additional capital. So the goal is to try to leverage the capital to the maximum degree possible not to invest the most capital. So we'd rather keep the number and be strategic and invest, $300 million $400 million a year and get additional service and fee business to bring that to grow that business is it doesn't require capital. I'd rather do that than invest a billion dollars of capital, I'm not getting any other business. So that's that's the way we were thinking about. And so I think that the, the goal is to grow the non-asset based service businesses as to the maximum degree possible and use the capital in the most efficient way to do that.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for the call. Appreciate it, guys.\nOperator: Next question is from Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nDevin Ryan: Hey, good morning, Joe. Thanks for taking the question. I guess the first one is coming back to some of the earlier comments on Long Ridge. Great to hear about kind of the increased contribution there was intermediate term here. If I missed it, the $40 million where is that or you can reinvest that back in the business that get dividend to the parent, how should we think about kind of increased profitability there? And then with electricity costs, their prices where they are now? Is there a way to kind of lock that in for longer, just obviously, there's been volatility but to kind of sustain kind of a higher level of contribution from that segment?\nJoe Adams: Yes. So the $40 million is incremental cash that will come into Long Ridge above and beyond what we projected. And initially, the view would be to pay down debt. I think we're going to look at a refinance. And we always expected that once the plant went live and was operational, we would look to refinance the debt. At that level, we'll get better rates and we may get more debt. So there might be a recap opportunity. That is that is helped and facilitated by having additional income and profitability. So it's, it's good and it's played out. We always expected that right around the time we went live, and we would, we would look seriously at refinancing the debt at Long Ridge. And rates are lower and profitability is higher. So it's, that's those are good things. In terms of locking in, we are looking at everything we could do to first of all, we only we contracted I think 94% of capacity of plants, so we have 6% of that's available. We also could potentially increase the capacity from 485 megawatts up to 505 and we believe it'll run at that level. So there's another 20 megawatts. And then we're looking at how to increase gas production as well from what we have, so that we can also monetize some of that. So we're looking at everything to try to take advantage of what's an amazing, incredible market opportunity there -- we kind of we got lucky with the timing, because we didn't, our hedges don't start until February, and we completed the project a little bit early. So we got lucky with the market environment. And clearly it's the power forward markets are strong through the winter. And there are a lot of people that are pretty positive beyond that because the switchover to renewables is not as easy as maybe people were thinking initially so. So it's a good dynamic. I think we'll look to refinance, take advantage of that opportunity and then look to add either from power and gas in any way we can to squeeze out more.\nDevin Ryan: Okay, terrific. Obviously good to see. And then, just another follow up here on the split of the businesses and you just procedurally I know you guys are working closely with the with the audience auditors. I know it's also kind of a complicated process here. So from the outside, it seems like gave a lot more detail and things seem to be moving smoothly. Are there any potential sticking points as we're kind of following from the outside that, that could can push the timeline out? Or that the auditors or others are having issues with or is it more just kind of rolling up your sleeves and just getting it done? I guess that's the first one. And then connected to that, just or is it going to be the same management team? Joe, are you going to run both businesses, or have you has that been decided yet? And just kind of think about some of the infrastructure related to both of the businesses?\nJoe Adams: Yes, so the certainly the first question, we are more confident we the, probably the biggest issue that we had to address first was refinance the Transtar acquisition debt which we did in Q3. So, so that removes any, transactional impediment to getting the spin done. And so now, as you mentioned, it's just it's process, and I'm looking at Scott because he's doing the audits. And, and the lawyers during the documents that we've done. Fortress has done a number of scans, and nobody has raised an issue yet, or otherwise I wouldn't be getting a lot more detail on. So I think it's, it feels like it's on a pretty good path to getting to getting execution. And there's no, there's no third party or any outside process that would get in the way of it. So that's good. In terms of management I mean, the what I\u2019ve indicated is that I will be Chairman. I was Chairman and CEO of FTAI and chairman of Infrastructure and likely will that define around the spin have a CEO that is not me, which is somebody that we know, we haven't disclosed in discussion in much more detail yet. But that would be the management otherwise. There's a few spots that will look for some outside hires, but it's primarily just dividing up the team.\nDevin Ryan: Yes. Okay. Terrific. Thanks so much for the update.\nJoe Adams: Yes.\nOperator: We have a question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is David on for Brandon. You talked a little bit about the acceleration you expected to see a non-service for material. Just wondering if you could provide some more color onto any earlier orders you're seeing or what do you think that acceleration could look like beyond the early 2022? And do you think this would ultimately be untethered to the capital required to put into that business?\nJoe Adams: Yes, our ability to generate new services material is purely a function of how many engines we want to tear down. And I think our initial goal was 20. And I think we have 20 better positions that are either in teardown or in the process. So that side of that we totally control. On the sales side, we have, I would say, two to three large airlines that have been buying USM and have done so for quite a while. And then we have probably three or four programs that we are working on bidding. So where airlines go out and they work with a maintenance shop and they say will you provide my shop is for the next five to 10 years and give me a price. And then we team up with the MRO and say, we'll provide you with used serviceable material and we'll provide you with modules. So we have three, that's what I was referring to and sort of the programmatic nature of what we're shooting for. And those are progressing nicely. I would say that the ramp up and shop visits is it's starting, but you are probably not going to see too much activity until Q1 of 2022. And then we expect Q2 and Q3 of next year to be to be pretty, pretty busy, which I think is consistent with what the big, independent MROS and even OEMs have been saying about shop visit activity. So it's starting and we think the flywheel is moving and it will pick up momentum next, Q2 and Q3 of next year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome. Thanks for that one. And then on the funding on the split, I know you talked about it. Could you talk specifically about where you think the 800 million in funding is coming from and how the puts and takes are going there?\nJoe Adams: Yes and that would all be financing from infrastructure, the infrastructure company, the vast majority of that will be corporate debt. We have Transtar, which we acquired, which is unleveraged. So that's $80 million of EBITDA and then the rest of the infrastructure businesses as well. So most of it will be debt, we also look at potentially asset sales, to provide some of that, which is obviously a very good market for infrastructure, and infrastructure funds that are looking to invest capital in the space, there's a lot of capital raise so. So we'll run a process and look at preferreds and other things to coincide in sometime in Q1 of next year. But it's, we don't have to do all of it, had to spend either so we can we can stage it. But we'll run a full process and be delivered and look to sort of optimize that over the next six months.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks, Joe. I appreciate the answers.\nOperator: Next question is from Greg Lewis with BTIG. Your line is open.\nGregory Lewis: Yes, thank you. And good morning. Joe, I was hoping you could you could touch a little bit more on infrastructure. As we think about what's going on at Jefferson. Clearly, you guys have invested a lot of money there, built out the infrastructure there. It seems like the markets finally, starting to go the right way with a little bit inflection in oil demand. Is there any way to kind of think about and I don't know if the right word is utilization or efficiency, like as we think about the facility right now. Like, like, is there any way to kind of quantify how much spare capacity is there in terms of driving incremental volumes and revenues out of Jefferson without actually spending any more money?\nJoe Adams: Yes, I think that storage utilization is about 75%, right? There\u2019s 45% availability there. Rail, it\u2019s also, I would say probably rail utilization is probably like 25%  right now. So there's, there's an additional 75% availability. And pipeline utilization is probably 10% of what it is. So there's 90% availability. And that's, that's really exactly what we're focused on, is getting near term volumes, to fill that infrastructure that's already that exists, that's been built. And so that is the goal is to is to fill that up without any additional capital.\nGregory Lewis: And really, I mean, just based on what you kind of kicked around throughout the call is, that's really just going to be a driver of what various crude spreads are whether it's in the North sea. So you mentioned the Aframax, incoming tanker and WCS? Is that kind of the right way to just feel that at that potential growth or that you mentioned, thanks?\nJoe Adams: So that, so that's part of it. And the other part is you mentioned would be, for instance, a DRU or diluent recovery unit in volumes is coming from Canada on a steady basis. So if you can, if you could bring one train today, from DRU in the terminal, that's 50,000 barrels of rail in and you blend that with additional pipelines, probably two or three to one. So that's potentially like 200,000 barrels a day from just that one, one move, and that's the leverage. And that those, those are the deals that we're trying to hammer out, particularly to get a ratable flow to cover a lot of the existing capacity. And then you can, be opportunistic with the Aframax volumes and the spread business.\nGregory Lewis: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nJoe Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Our last question is from Robert Dodd with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nRobert Dodd: Hi, guys, and congratulations on getting this aviation deals. On I'm going to ask about the development. When we look at funds available for distribution when we put on Transtar put on these new deal, the new aviation deals, etcetera. You're going to be by my math, you know about the two to one coverage of the dividend. At the same time, we're obviously heading into to a spin off and then changing corporate structure next year. So could you give us an outline if you you've gotten that on what the plan would be for the dividends from one or both different pieces and what given where that is you'd expect the relative scale of those dividends to be maybe compared to what it is for the pure play the single appetite right?\nJoe Adams: Yes so the -- so the best guidance we can give right now is, we believe that roughly of the existing dividend of $1.32, roughly 75% of that will come from FTAI Aviation and then the balance 25% will be from infrastructure that's kind of a, it's not precise, but I think order of magnitude that's, that's our thinking. And then each entity is going to look at the extent to which FAD and funds available for distributions or exceed the two to one and as you point out our goal has always been to maintain that so we would increase the dividend each entity to the extent we have more than two to one coverage. So it's a continuation of the existing policy, split the dividend roughly 75:25 between Aviation and Infrastructure and then each entity will obviously then grow differently instead of being attached they'll have different trajectories at that point.\nRobert Dodd: Got it. I really appreciate that. Thanks a lot.\nJoe Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: And now I would like to turn the call back to Alan Andreini.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q4.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joe Adams",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 26th dividend as a public company and our 41st consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on November 29 based on a shareholder record date of November 15. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD or funds available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2021 was $96.4 million compared to Q2 2021 of $68 million and Q3 of 2020 of $58.6 million. FAD was $39.4 million in Q3 2021 versus $68.3 million in Q2 2021 and $39.9 million in Q3 2020. During the third quarter, the $39.4 million FAD number was comprised of $90.5 million from our aviation leasing portfolio, negative $0.2 million from our infrastructure business and negative $50.9 million from corporate and other. Turning now to Aviation. The aviation recovery continues as our EBITDA for Q3 was approximately $100 million, up from $80 million in Q2, and $60 million in Q1. We see broad improvement in demand across narrowbody markets, with some delays resulting from the Delta variant. As an example, we signed leases for approximately 30 engines in the quarter that airlines took actual delivery of approximately 15 as several regions had continuing travel restrictions, but for the most part now have been reopened in Q4. We have a strong backlog of engine demand and expect to start new leases on over 40 engines in Q4, of which 30 are signed today and 10 have already been delivered. We're also closing new sale leaseback transactions on 16 aircraft with Alitalia and ITA and 19 aircraft with Avianca and funding those in November for an aggregate new investment of $340 million. The term of the lease backs range from six months to 10 years, with an average of 15 months, and three fourths of these 319s and 320 aircraft are CFM56 powered aircraft, which is an excellent addition when brings our total CFM56 engine count to approximately 300 engines. Our three CFM56 Aerospace activities all made great strides forward. On PMA the next part has completed production and documentation is being assembled to make the final FAA application complete in the next few weeks. As such, we expect to be able to use both parts for our own engines in Q1 2022 and are seeing strong third party interest for multiple airlines and MROS or maintenance repair organizations for shock visits beginning in 2022. On the module factory we have completed a number of module sales and swaps and are progressing with a few airlines in negotiating long term programmatic supply agreements. Elsewhere our used serviceable material business or USM Business with AAR we are targeting approximately $10 million in sales in Q4 with momentum growing into 2022. All combined 2022 is shaping up really well with leasing EBITDA expected to be $500 million for the year and the three CFM 56 Aerospace activity is expected to contribute between $50 million and $100 million of total EBITDA for the year total EBITDA for aviation for 2022 is expected to be $550 million to $600 million. Let's now turn to infrastructure, starting with Jefferson, on the heels of the previously announced 10-year deal with Exxon in mid-July, the Jefferson Terminal continues to reshape and transform logistics options in the U.S. Gulf Coast, and in the Beaumont Port Arthur Texas refinery region. This region remains one of the largest refinery footprints in North America, and the Jefferson terminal has become an essential extension of the two largest refineries in North America. Looking specifically at Q3, near term headwinds continue to impact the economics of crude by rail from Western Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. However, due to the improved logistics associated with the Exxon Mobil cross channel pipeline system, Jefferson has seen an increase of 44% in 2021, compared to 2020 in the refined products by rail to Mexico business, resulting in Jefferson posting another positive quarter with EBITDA of $1.9 million. Enhanced terminal infrastructure and the in-service pipeline projects connecting Jefferson to Exxon and to Motiva have been completed, and baseline business continues to steadily increase as these business partners ramp up refinery activity. As we look towards 2022, high oil prices and demand for refined products is good for Jefferson. Local refiners are lining up new sources of discounted crude from markets in Western Canada and New interbasin  and looking for terminals like Jefferson to optimize blends and lower logistics costs. Additionally, international oil flows are increasing and Jefferson will be receiving its first ever inbound Aframax marine cargo from the North Sea this month. We have high expectations for additional inbound marine volumes from overseas and have line of sight on several other significant opportunities in the near future. Specifically, are we making progress on DRU, delivery recovery unit discussions as well as discussions relating to the movement of heavy wax barrels, which cannot move by pipeline. These two projects are important because they would lead to a radical flow of trains, which are not dependent upon crude spreads. Finally, we're moving forward with several interesting opportunities regarding the movement of natural gas liquids and other products which would involve the integration of Repauno, Long Ridge and Jefferson into a seamless flexible and unique supply chain. Turning the Repauno , Repauno continued its strong phase in the third quarter, loading 14 marine vessels with over 900,000 barrels of butane down for international markets. This activity was complemented by increased truck movements to local premium markets to signal the beginning of the fall of gasoline blending season. Rounding out the first export seas in the highly flexible multimodal port and rail terminal firmly established itself as a premier distribution hub on the east coast of the United States. And we're excited to enter the local propane distribution market this winter. By increasing the suite of products handled simultaneously at the terminal and providing security of supply for local markets in the Northeast, we're meeting the customer's needs not only in New Jersey, but also in the entire Northeast Region. Pushing towards further development outlined in FTAIs long term vision, the newest port on the Delaware River plans to see expanded capacity, with three plus million barrels of highly efficient underground storage capable of handling a wide variety of LPG and refined products to be ready for export via all size ships, including VLGCs. Repauno is also looking at import opportunities as they rise in various markets and under various market conditions. Product movements will be available by rail, inbound and outbound by water across multiple new high capacity deep water docks, and eventually buy type from all major North American producing regions. And with 250 plus acres available for development we also continue to move forward with several renewable opportunities. Repauno is prime for staging and manufacturing of wind farm components and for waste plastic recycling projects. These discussions are at advanced stages and we hope to have one or more concluded by the year end. Together with a Jefferson facility in Beaumont Texas, FTAI is well positioned with multimode of distribution and export terminals on both the Gulf Coast and the Mid-Atlantic seaboard, providing unparalleled levels of service flexibility and optionality for our customers. Turning now to Long Ridge, Long Ridge has successfully transitioned from a development project into a cash flowing operating business, as evidenced by the 15.5 million of EBITDA on 100% basis generated in Q3. Most of the Q3 EBITDA was attributable to our natural gas production, which was sold into the market. And now that the power plant is operating, our natural gas is being utilized to generate electricity. While natural gas prices have rallied recently, and we benefited from that in Q3, the economics of generating electricity are even better. We anticipate Long Ridge to generate EBITDA of approximately $15 million in Q4 and $37 million in Q1 2022, which taken together is more than $40 million higher than we expected when we initially underwrote the project. This incremental cash flow is a result of completing construction nearly a month ahead of schedule and higher power natural gas prices in the market today. Our fixed price power sales agreement commenced in February, locking in an attractive margin for the next seven years to 10 years, and generating approximately $120 million per year of EBITDA. We've also recently seen lots of interests from power intensive industries that want to locate and build new facilities at properties like Long Ridge. Importantly, we remain on track to be the first large frame power plant in the U.S. to blend hydrogen into our natural gas stream. We will start with a 5% Hydrogen blend in December and hope to increase this percentage over time. Turning now to Transtar, our newest addition Transtar is off to a great start. John Karns and his team are already meeting or exceeding expectations. But I'll start with an important metric in the short line rail business which is safety and that Transtar continues to lead the short line railroad industry and safety and is well positioned to win another President's Award for safety from the American short line and Regional Railroad Association. All of the Transtar railroads are FRA and Ocean recordable injury free in 2021. Since July 28 to date, the Transtar acquisition closed, the company is tracking to the $80 million annual EBITDA number that we have projected. Transition expenses are tapering off and expected to be deminimis in 2022. As to the core, there the strong steel markets continue to support shipment of both finished steel and raw material. And we believe that improving ship availability will drive robust steel shipments for auto, which is a high profit margin business for us. And we could see increased shipments to that sector in Q4 of this year in Q1 of next year. Other steel segments are holding steady and strong. Mon Valley is running full while Gary Indiana has a plan maintenance outage at the number six furnace which is expected to be completed in November. As we look to 2022, we expect multiple and new third party opportunities to grow the $80 million EBITDA number. We are in discussions with third parties regarding car storage opportunities, and railcar repair opportunities just to name two. In short, everything we had hoped to see happen post the acquisition is happening. Turning down corporate items on the spin out of infrastructure, we have made considerable progress on the spin-off of infrastructure and conversion to sea corps. In Q3, we completed the refinancing of the Transtar acquisition financing, and are now focused on completing the documentation and agreements which we hope to be finalized in December of this year for an SEC filing before year-end, which would set us up for having two separate trading entities in Q1 of 2022. The existing FTAI entity will retain aviation business and assets and all existing corporate debt totaling approximately $2.3 billion pre-acquisition of the Alitalia and Avianca fleets. Infrastructure to be spun out as a new C Corp entity comprised of Jefferson, Repauno, Long Ridge and Transtar will retain all related project level debt of those entities and intends to remit approximately $800 million in cash or obligations as part of the separation. While we intend to monetize this obligation to the maximum amount, the spin will not be subject to raising additional financing at completion. So in conclusion, the ramp back up in aviation to 2019 levels is progressing. Our revenue pass the kilometers continue to rise. And as a result, we're seeing engine lease rates and demand for sale leasebacks rise as well. And with the industry still straining from the shock of COVID-19, we're seeing demand for our Chromalloy, Lockheed Martin AAR suite of products growing as well. As the infrastructure projects have restarted three to five years ago are now in full ramp up mode, these projects along with Transtar now give us the ability to spin infrastructure into a robust standalone company. That vision which we've been planning for years is about to become reality. So we're at an exciting time in FTAI's history, we're at that point because of the hard work of a lot of outstanding employees, and directors and the cooperation and partnership with some great customers. And I want to thank everyone for helping bring us to this exciting inflection point. With that, I will turn the call back to Alan. Yes, so. So that's financing, we wanted to keep it short, cheap and flexible. So we have structured a one year facility, which I believe the rate will be less LIBOR less than 300 LIBOR plus 300, a little less than that, like LIBOR plus 275. And, and pre payable at any time. And our goal over that is to prepay that from the 800 million of infrastructure funding, that's going to come back to aviation. So essentially be reducing debt net on a on a net basis when the spin happens at Aviation. And so that's what we wanted to have that immediately or pre payable immediately. In terms of the leverage for the companies and then we stated as part of the spin, we wanted to maintain BB rating for the aviation aerospace business. And we've been given very good feedback on that. I think we're in good shape, given the outline of what I just said. And, and both companies would then have access to capital going forward. So, I think it all sort of fits together with the parameters and the requirements that we set out to do as part of the spin. Yes, so the utilization. I think our engine utilization is a little over 60% in Q3, which was less than what we had hoped it would be. And I think it's really primarily or almost exclusively driven by the Delta variant and the COVID. And we saw a lot of airlines who are gearing up to take additional equipment and, and we as I mentioned, we had a lot of engine lease deals signed, but then when the restrictions started being re-imposed and airlines started, they started to slow down the ramp up and activity. And that sort of impacted the third quarter. We're seeing a lot of activity though, now in the market in October, November, and they said we've got -- we expect to put 40 engines on lease. I think that would bring our engine utilization up to about 70% or a little bit higher and we expect next year to operate in the 75% to 80% utilization range throughout the year and really, every airline we're talking to today and is looking for additional equipment and a lot of engines. And I think importantly the deals with Avianca, Alitalia, American Airlines, we did all come with our ability to expand those relationships and provide engines and engine management services. So it's an integrated package. And we see the market for 2022 developing very nicely. And all signs are that people are now going to be adding and growing their businesses again next year. In terms of the crude products, we also expect a very strong year. We've had good momentum and all of our businesses with the exception of TMA because the second part is not yet approved. But USM has developed nicely. We have 20 year engines and tear down. And we are one of the largest providers of USM. I think the ramp up and shop visit activity has not picked up yet. But that's not surprising; we expect to see that in 2022. And when that does, we expect strong levels of sales for USM. So I think that there'll be growth throughout the quarter, but I think throughout the year, each quarter, but I think it's going to start 2022 fairly strong. So it's not it's not a it's not a steep ramp. In terms of the PMA, our indications from Airlines is that they're very interested in those products, once they're available, and we ourselves are will be putting the PMA into our own engine. So we have a number of shop is scheduled. But we also expect a number of airlines to step up and start using the PMA, probably beginning in Q2 of next year. And then that could ramp significantly and Chromalloy has said they're going to begin production of parts as soon as the application has filed, so they will have inventory available. And then the big upside, as I've said before, I think is really on the module factory because that's our storefront, that's our cash register. That's where we all three products can be combined, and providing real value and real savings to airlines by their selling individual modules or engines that we've overhauled and we see a number of airlines today as airlines are coming out of distress or restructuring that have postponed shop visits or we're in are now looking at returning engines to lessors and others in a run out condition. They are preferring to buy engines or exchange them with us as opposed to putting it through the shop. So we see a lot of upside on the module factory as we bring all those products together integrated. And I think that will be the biggest revenue contributor of the three next year by a good margin. Good morning. Yes, it's tracking very similarly, in that the FAA is being provided information along the way. So there's a lot of back and forth and review of test data and engineering information. So it's been very similar way, the first part of that and that's, that's the way Chromalloy has been approaching these products and it's worked well because then there's no, there should be no surprises at the end. The second part is technically more complex than the first part. So there's probably a little bit more engineering and manufacturing data that's needed. But it's all, it's all been reviewed and signed off as we go. So I think that the final submission should and the approval should track, similar to what happened with the first part and Chromalloy is very confident, they've never had never had a part that didn't get approved. So, so it's, I would say very similar in terms of process to the first part. And then this, the, the third, fourth and fifth are in design and engineering and are on track to be submitted in late 2022 or early 2023. So those, those are less complex parts. Obviously, we started with the more expensive ones and the higher difficulty ones first. Some of them are sort of, grind it out by adding storage and repair services and right away income that occurred just gradually and over every quarter. And then some of them can be really project driven if you get a new customer or you have a new service that you can provide it could be, a step function up. And the rail market obviously, is, is strong, the core industries that rail serves are all doing pretty well. We see development opportunities, many in many different spots and locations. We had a good dialogue with U.S. Steel about additional opportunities we can provide them. So that, the playbook is really to try to, come up with 10 ideas that you can pursue, and hopefully three or four of them head. And that's, that's exactly what happened at rail America when we did that, and those tend to be sizable, and they tend to be sticky. So it feels like, it feels like deja vu and but we're in a very good macro environment with U.S. industry being strong and an infrastructure bill coming which, who knows what that's going to provide, but it's going to be good in some in different areas. And we also see it in Long Ridge. We see a lot of companies have announced they're going to expand and build factories in the Midwest, and that's good for railroads, because that means a lot of stuff is going to be moving around. So I think the environment is good. And we're, we've got the playbook and we're, I think we're going to hit on a few of them. Thanks. Yes, so there are orders for sets. And I think you correctly point out if an engine, if an airline's going to put an engine through the shop, they want to put enough PMA in it to make it worthwhile. And so having two parts, particularly, the high value parts that were the second part that we're making, is pretty important to the program. So, so I think that they are sort of joined together for many airlines that particularly because they know what's coming. And so if they had a decision to make, and rather than putting the first part without knowing the second part is coming in, it's easier to say, well I'm not doing a lot of shopping today so why don't I just wait for the second one, and then I'll decide. So I think that's the dynamic. But every airline knows it's coming. It's a big, it's a big deal in the industry and, and they're very eager to, to get it. So I think that backdrop is quite positive. And we expect as do most of the industry is third party shop as it are starting to grow and we think will increase significantly in 2022. So that will also drive because if you can't get parts or your shop is delayed, that'll also facilitate looking at PMA as an alternative. And the other thing we have is you have some significant potential inflation and metals out there. So you could see bigger price increases from OEMs when people have experienced previously. So that's another dynamic that I think could help the effort. So I think it's, that's all, that's all shaping up pretty nicely. And then in terms of the percentage, I think the first two parts are 60% of the savings that we can provide. So if the, if the five parts in total are 80% of this aircraft cost then this is 60% of the 80%, or half of it. So 50% of the total aircraft cost is represented in these first two parts. Yes, that's correct. It's Data Aviation. I didn't quite understand the question. Yes, it'll be a it'll be a corporation, a corporate structure. That would be a non-U.S. Corporation. So it does, it eliminates K-ones. Just to draw a line under that. Yes. Thanks. Yes, we so that, I mean, the pipelines are operating, which is great. And that was a big part of getting them into service getting operating and function. And now obviously, we're, we're all over, everybody to try to use them. So that's, that's the game and we have multiple pathways to sort of getting to our numbers and increasing the utilization. We just need one or two of them to hit. And obviously with the markets improving from an oral price point of view, refined product demand point of view, from refineries looking to bring in crudes from discount groups from all over the world. That helps because we're positioned to try to provide all those options and optionality and the services that they need, whether it's by water from the North Sea, as we mentioned, or it's blended with Permian, or it comes from Utah, and heavy wax train, and we blend. So we have all of that in front of everybody. And it's this question of, of getting a couple or two of those to hit. And that's, that's really what all of our focus and attention is on that. And we have multiple pathways to get there. So I'm confident we'll, we'll get there and the environment is going to help when we need to do we just need to execute on it? Yes, so we've historically, if you look back, we've we've tended to invest between 300 and 500 million a year, pretty consistently, although I always say we don't budget CapEx, we don't tell anybody that that's what we want to do the beginning of the year, because that's not the right way to think about investing. But it's been $300 million to $500 million and now what we're doing is really I think focused on, we're focused on the CFM 56, obviously. And we're focused on some of these transactions that we think we can add engine business as part of the as part of the transaction. So, as I mentioned Avianca, Alitalia, American, we believe we're going to have follow on opportunities above and beyond the sale leaseback that will be enhanced design relationship enhance our profitability and not requiring additional capital. So the goal is to try to leverage the capital to the maximum degree possible not to invest the most capital. So we'd rather keep the number and be strategic and invest, $300 million $400 million a year and get additional service and fee business to bring that to grow that business is it doesn't require capital. I'd rather do that than invest a billion dollars of capital, I'm not getting any other business. So that's that's the way we were thinking about. And so I think that the, the goal is to grow the non-asset based service businesses as to the maximum degree possible and use the capital in the most efficient way to do that. Yes. So the $40 million is incremental cash that will come into Long Ridge above and beyond what we projected. And initially, the view would be to pay down debt. I think we're going to look at a refinance. And we always expected that once the plant went live and was operational, we would look to refinance the debt. At that level, we'll get better rates and we may get more debt. So there might be a recap opportunity. That is that is helped and facilitated by having additional income and profitability. So it's, it's good and it's played out. We always expected that right around the time we went live, and we would, we would look seriously at refinancing the debt at Long Ridge. And rates are lower and profitability is higher. So it's, that's those are good things. In terms of locking in, we are looking at everything we could do to first of all, we only we contracted I think 94% of capacity of plants, so we have 6% of that's available. We also could potentially increase the capacity from 485 megawatts up to 505 and we believe it'll run at that level. So there's another 20 megawatts. And then we're looking at how to increase gas production as well from what we have, so that we can also monetize some of that. So we're looking at everything to try to take advantage of what's an amazing, incredible market opportunity there -- we kind of we got lucky with the timing, because we didn't, our hedges don't start until February, and we completed the project a little bit early. So we got lucky with the market environment. And clearly it's the power forward markets are strong through the winter. And there are a lot of people that are pretty positive beyond that because the switchover to renewables is not as easy as maybe people were thinking initially so. So it's a good dynamic. I think we'll look to refinance, take advantage of that opportunity and then look to add either from power and gas in any way we can to squeeze out more. Yes, so the certainly the first question, we are more confident we the, probably the biggest issue that we had to address first was refinance the Transtar acquisition debt which we did in Q3. So, so that removes any, transactional impediment to getting the spin done. And so now, as you mentioned, it's just it's process, and I'm looking at Scott because he's doing the audits. And, and the lawyers during the documents that we've done. Fortress has done a number of scans, and nobody has raised an issue yet, or otherwise I wouldn't be getting a lot more detail on. So I think it's, it feels like it's on a pretty good path to getting to getting execution. And there's no, there's no third party or any outside process that would get in the way of it. So that's good. In terms of management I mean, the what I've indicated is that I will be Chairman. I was Chairman and CEO of FTAI and chairman of Infrastructure and likely will that define around the spin have a CEO that is not me, which is somebody that we know, we haven't disclosed in discussion in much more detail yet. But that would be the management otherwise. There's a few spots that will look for some outside hires, but it's primarily just dividing up the team. Yes. Yes, our ability to generate new services material is purely a function of how many engines we want to tear down. And I think our initial goal was 20. And I think we have 20 better positions that are either in teardown or in the process. So that side of that we totally control. On the sales side, we have, I would say, two to three large airlines that have been buying USM and have done so for quite a while. And then we have probably three or four programs that we are working on bidding. So where airlines go out and they work with a maintenance shop and they say will you provide my shop is for the next five to 10 years and give me a price. And then we team up with the MRO and say, we'll provide you with used serviceable material and we'll provide you with modules. So we have three, that's what I was referring to and sort of the programmatic nature of what we're shooting for. And those are progressing nicely. I would say that the ramp up and shop visits is it's starting, but you are probably not going to see too much activity until Q1 of 2022. And then we expect Q2 and Q3 of next year to be to be pretty, pretty busy, which I think is consistent with what the big, independent MROS and even OEMs have been saying about shop visit activity. So it's starting and we think the flywheel is moving and it will pick up momentum next, Q2 and Q3 of next year. Yes and that would all be financing from infrastructure, the infrastructure company, the vast majority of that will be corporate debt. We have Transtar, which we acquired, which is unleveraged. So that's $80 million of EBITDA and then the rest of the infrastructure businesses as well. So most of it will be debt, we also look at potentially asset sales, to provide some of that, which is obviously a very good market for infrastructure, and infrastructure funds that are looking to invest capital in the space, there's a lot of capital raise so. So we'll run a process and look at preferreds and other things to coincide in sometime in Q1 of next year. But it's, we don't have to do all of it, had to spend either so we can we can stage it. But we'll run a full process and be delivered and look to sort of optimize that over the next six months. Yes, I think that storage utilization is about 75%, right? There's 45% availability there. Rail, it's also, I would say probably rail utilization is probably like 25%  right now. So there's, there's an additional 75% availability. And pipeline utilization is probably 10% of what it is. So there's 90% availability. And that's, that's really exactly what we're focused on, is getting near term volumes, to fill that infrastructure that's already that exists, that's been built. And so that is the goal is to is to fill that up without any additional capital. So that, so that's part of it. And the other part is you mentioned would be, for instance, a DRU or diluent recovery unit in volumes is coming from Canada on a steady basis. So if you can, if you could bring one train today, from DRU in the terminal, that's 50,000 barrels of rail in and you blend that with additional pipelines, probably two or three to one. So that's potentially like 200,000 barrels a day from just that one, one move, and that's the leverage. And that those, those are the deals that we're trying to hammer out, particularly to get a ratable flow to cover a lot of the existing capacity. And then you can, be opportunistic with the Aframax volumes and the spread business. Thanks. Yes so the -- so the best guidance we can give right now is, we believe that roughly of the existing dividend of $1.32, roughly 75% of that will come from FTAI Aviation and then the balance 25% will be from infrastructure that's kind of a, it's not precise, but I think order of magnitude that's, that's our thinking. And then each entity is going to look at the extent to which FAD and funds available for distributions or exceed the two to one and as you point out our goal has always been to maintain that so we would increase the dividend each entity to the extent we have more than two to one coverage. So it's a continuation of the existing policy, split the dividend roughly 75:25 between Aviation and Infrastructure and then each entity will obviously then grow differently instead of being attached they'll have different trajectories at that point. Thanks."

I would like to welcome you to the Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure second quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Christopher, our Chief Financial Officer.\nJoe Adams: Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 25th dividend as a public company and our 40th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on August 30 based on a shareholder record date of August 16. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD or funds available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 2021 was $68 million compared to Q1 2021 of $47.2 million and Q2 of 2020 of $66.5 million. FAD was $68.3 million in Q2 2021 versus $14.4 million in Q1 2021 and $47.3 million in Q2 2020. On a normalized basis, excluding sale proceeds and nonrecurring items, Q2 2021 FAD was $15.7 million compared to $9.8 million in Q1 2021 and $38.2 million in Q2 2020. During the second quarter, the $68.3 million FAD number was comprised of $116.2 million from our aviation leasing portfolio, negative $2.5 million from our infrastructure business and negative $45.4 million from corporate and other. Now starting with aviation. Aviation experienced a meaningful increase in activity in passenger markets in Q2, and our portfolio of engine products and services is picking up momentum. While we achieved our goal of $80 million of EBITDA in Q2, up from $60 million in Q1, we are seeing a slightly slower ramp due to continuing COVID travel restrictions related to the Delta variant, particularly in Europe. As a result, we're now projecting 2021 EBITDA of $400 million as compared to our previous projection of $450 million for the full year. The engine leasing market is particularly strong as airlines look to ramp up flying while continuing to minimize maintenance capital spending.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you. Operator, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator:  And your first question is from Josh Sullivan with Benchmark.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey, good morning.\nJoe Adams: Good morning.\nJosh Sullivan: Just a question on the new 12-plane lease order you have with the major U.S. airline there. Can you give us some color around that contract? There is a new relationship, what's the total opportunity there? Do you think this is going to attract other U.S. major airlines of similar caliber going forward?\nJoe Adams: Yes. We're very excited about it. It's a \u2013 as I mentioned previously, we've \u2013 I think given the pandemic, we've been able to access airlines that previously would probably \u2013 we would not have had as much access to. And part of it is just the need they have for capital, but also part of it is to focus on the engine side of the business. So we see that as a door opener for more business, but also the ability to integrate our products offering into the mix in terms of the equation. So when we go \u2013 when there is shop visits are \u2013 we can be talking about module swaps PMA, used serviceable material, and we're already doing it that to some level with this existing airline. So it gives us the opportunity to increase the volume. One of the prohibition is obviously, people has always had \u2013 if you have an asset that's owned by a leasing company and you want to put PMA in it, usually the leasing companies have been prohibited that. We actually, if we own the asset, we have the ability to give ourselves permission. So \u2013 and that we can resell at a very, very low cost. So I think it is a door opener for us to \u2013 as I said, vertically integrate provide a broader range of services than anybody has ever done before and actually save us money. So \u2013 and we see very \u2013 I think the level of interest in both USM and PMA is very, very high. So I think as this picks up, it's going to give us additional ways to do business with big carriers.\nJosh Sullivan: And then maybe just more broadly, if you could just give us color generally on the leasing market or durations extending on leases, how is the lease up marking responding to the uptick here in the double variant?\nJoe Adams: Yes. I think the engine leasing market is heading up very nicely. I mean, we're not doing any \u2013 I think the era when people were doing power by the hour deals is over, lease rates are turning up, terms are extending out. So I think it's \u2013 the recent deals we've done in the engine side are virtually as good as what we were doing in 2019. And I think it's going to go higher. It's basically laws of supply and demand, as we know that everybody is deferring maintenance as much as they can. And so they're starting to line up assets and they're lining up engines in particular for longer-terms. So we're getting \u2013 and our portfolio is now extended out 18 months and we're signing up. We just signed up deals with a large airline that have a three year term. So I think rates and terms are going up. And maintenance reserve rates, which is also another sort of very important economic part of the lease are \u2013 has never really went down. And the manufacturers, \u2013 the maintenance reserve rates are set by taking the estimated cost of the shop and dividing it by the number of hours and the OEMs keep raising the parts prices even in this pandemic period. So maintenance reserve rates are still very strong. So all in all, I think the engine lease market is trending up very nicely.\nJosh Sullivan: And then if I could just sneak one last one in here. Can you just talk a little bit about the market for GE56 assets on the secondary market, just what you're seeing at this point?\nJoe Adams: Yes. So most of what we've been trying to do is buy older A318, A319s, 737, 700s, and then get rid of the airframe. So we're buying engines, buying a whole plane and then scrapping the airframe. And the acquisition \u2013 that way makes the most sense, we've been acquiring assets at probably the lowest prices we've ever bought them at, sometimes lower than $1 million for an engine. So that's been very fruitful, we added 27 new engines in the second quarter, which is one of the reasons our utilization looks a little bit lower, because we found some really good investments to put on the books. And that reflected about 10 points of utilization, so really it's more like 65, but that's the best way to create an engine today, because there is very \u2013 there very few buyers for off least older assets. If you have not \u2013 if you don't have revenue stream attached and it's an older asset, we might be the only bid. So we like that dynamics.\nJosh Sullivan: Okay. Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nJoe Adams: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question is from Guiliano Bologna with Compass Point.\nGuiliano Bologna: Good morning. I guess, following on a similar topic. You were talking about some lease rates moving higher and there is been some industry discussion around that point. I'd be curious, not necessarily specific dollar wise, but I'd be curious from a magnitude perspective kind of how much lease rates have moved at least on a percentage basis, we kind of where they were and kind of are they out 5%, 10%, 20%? I'm just curious from a magnitude perspective, how much of these rates have been moving for specifically CFM56 engines?\nJoe Adams: Yes. I would say that probably from the pre-pandemic to the bottom of the pandemic, we\u2019ve probably declined 25%, 30% to the worst. And I think most of that 25% to 30% now has gone. It's in fact very close to pre-pandemic.\nGuiliano Bologna: That's great. And then thinking about the aviation business, kind of a little bit more holistically. You obviously have the module factory, which seems to be kicking off and cheers things in early success. I'd be curious if there is a sense of kind of the magnitude of the \u2013 or how big you could grow the module factory from a kind of a throughput perspective, because you obviously have to have some engines and inventory and kind of what that opportunity could look like over time?\nJoe Adams: Yes. I mean, you have to have some engines in inventory and we currently owned 200 CFM56 engines. So a lot of the airlines we're talking to right now are looking at \u2013 starting with programs that could be 10 or 20 year to talk about 10 or 20 modules. But they have fleets that could be 100s of engines. So they're looking at that as really a starter kit. So we think that basically we can grow, if we get people started doing it, then it has a flywheel effect and you can just grow with them. So our 200 engine fleet might grow to 300, 400, just remember there is 22,000 engines in the world of this type. So going from 200 to 400 to 600 doesn't really move the needle. And so, I think we can scale our inventory along with the needs of the customer, but the upside of, how many could people do is really very significant. Once they integrate this into the way they operate on the maintenance side, it's quite significant. And then, if you put on top of that, you add PMA into it, which will start to happen next year, it could become even much bigger.\nGuiliano Bologna: That's great. And then just thinking about the kind of the split of the business, you obviously have a few different components that should be a decent contributors starting next Transtar into numbers, you guys have put out so far about $80 million, you have about \u2013 $70 million to $80 million is kind of the discussed run rate for Jefferson, which I'm assuming should be scaling up now that all the pipelines are complete there. And you have another call it $60 million from the power plant kind of $15 million from Repauno, that puts you into $200 million, obviously this pricing overhead that would get allocated to that segment, so is it a decent business. Kind of looking beyond that you the Exxon deal, but then, you're making some comments about Repauno and expanding critical $3 million of storage, which kind of sounds like the old Phase 2 that had been discussed. I\u2019m curious if there is anything changed to kind of the Phase 2 project or outlook, because it used to be called at $500 million of CapEx ballpark, and then the expectation was $150 million of EBITDA. Are you still pursuing that similar strategy and is that what you're referring to in 24?\nJoe Adams: Yes. That was very intensive of the completed Phase 2. And it hasn't changed, we've zeroed in on more, I think we're specifically on exactly what we need to build and when we need to build it. And the capital expectation, I think is less than $500 million at this point, partially because we've invested already some of the infrastructure that's going to be used. So it's \u2013 I would think of it's more of a $400 million. And the other thing is changed, as I've listed about eight different products. When we first started this, we were thinking propane, butane, but we've had lots of different ideas from people coming to us and actually suggesting propylene as an example, or some of the natural gas liquids, condensate some refined products. And then we've had further discussions that fairly recent about pipeline connectivity, which would also expand both the capabilities, as well as the product offerings. So I think it's only gotten better in terms of the upside and the capitals is probably a little bit less than what we had forecasted. So it's \u2013 if I didn't sound enthusiastic saying it, I am extremely enthusiastic because it's all happening and the conversations are live and real.\nGuiliano Bologna: That's great. I appreciate all the insights and I'll turn back in the queue. Thank you.\nJoe Adams: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nChris Wetherbee: Thanks, good morning guys. Maybe just touching on Jefferson here, obviously getting the Exxon deal done was a great step in the right direction. It seems like there is probably a decent amount of storage opportunity or space to fill up the facility. And I guess it's probably building interest in coming to you guys. I don't know, Joe, if you can maybe deal with a little bit of color in terms of what sort of the deal prospect pipeline looks like at Jefferson right now? I'm guessing there is probably a couple of deals in the hopper that maybe could be coming through fruition. And then maybe if you could talk about what the timing of that might look like? I don't want you to trump around what you have here, but I'm just kind of trying to get a sense of what the ramp up might look like.\nJoe Adams: Yes. I think we've \u2013 we continually, every time we do a deal or we have a meeting, we end up with a longer list than when we started, so that's the fun part. And so we've got multiple projects, sort of a handful of projects with each of Exxon and Motiva that are real. I would say that they always were these large entity sales take longer than we would like. But we do get there, that's one of our sort of \u2013 we seem to have staying power in these negotiations. So we \u2013 but the number of opportunities there are significant and it's on both refined products and crude. And if you think about from a macro point of view, these are the two \u2013 in 2023, Exxon will be the largest refinery in North America. So it's 600,000 barrels a day in and 600,000 barrels a day out and the same for Motiva. So you're trucking over 1 million barrels a day right in our backyard. So we have lots of things that happen in and things that we don't even anticipate, like importing fuel oil, for example, we would never have guessed that that's something on the radar, but that becomes a topic or storing an intermediate. So a lot of these things come about, because you just have regular conversations. But there are many, many different projects once you get connected and once you're in a regular dialogue. Timing wise, the building of this storage takes about a year, so it's \u2013 we have probably the lead time on a lot of these projects to do that. Now that we have the pipes though, it's a lot easier, because you can go and say, we have a connection already, so we don't have to worry about that part of it. And so \u2013 it's mostly these discussions I would say that the typical lead time would be nine months to a year.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then just making sure I understand here, I'm going to go back to the aviation guide, the 50 million there. Can you \u2013 what are sort of the variables that sort of \u2013 could drive that to 400 that maybe leave that a little bit higher than 400 or maybe create some risk to it? I guess, I just want to make sure I understand for the most important dynamics of that guide or as we think about hitting that for the rest of the year.\nJoe Adams: Yes. The two biggest movers would be the number of flying hours. So as airlines ramp up flying, our revenues increase on the maintenance reserve side. And so, if you look back to the \u2013 I think it was third quarter of 2019, was our best quarter, because it was 85% utilization and every airline was flying 300 to 400 hours a month, so \u2013 or every aircraft. So that's probably the biggest one, and that's where the ramp up of services, particularly U.S., we've seen a lot, South America, we've seen a lot, Europe has just lagged, it's just been slower with the cross-border. I mean, United States is great because 50 States you can always travel more, not always, I should say. But historically, you could travel between one State and another without showing a passport, but in Europe, it's different, so \u2013 and I think that is slower. But Europe, Europe will follow and I indicated it, I think that'll happen later this year where you'll start to see more flying, but the activity \u2013 flying activity is number one, and then the second is acquisitions. And so we've got the one deal I mentioned is closing this week or next week. And then we have one other large deal with European carrier that should close by the fourth quarter. So those I think are the two utilization of flying hours and acquisitions.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay, got it. That's super helpful. I appreciate the time this morning, guys. Thank you.\nJoe Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from Justin Long with Stephens Inc.\nGeorge Sellers: Hey, good morning. This is George Sellers on for Justin. I guess to start, could you talk about the EBITDA you expect to be generated from the maintenance and parts pieces within aviation. And any update you can provide around the ramp of that number into the second half of this year and into 2022, it'd be great.\nJoe Adams: I assume you're talking about the three JV, the USM and \u2013 what's the third, the Lockheed Martin, the Module Factory. So those three\u2026\nGeorge Sellers: Exactly.\nJoe Adams: We believe that 50 million for the year is still a good number for those three. The decrease from 450 to 400 was largely on leasing revenues. So those three will produce about 50 this year, we haven't forecast yet for next year, what we think those will be, but safe to assume that it's going to be higher.\nGeorge Sellers: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then turning to Jefferson, could you walk through your latest thoughts on how you expect EBITDA to ramp at Jefferson through this year and then into 2022 as well. And as you think about that expectation, maybe you could also speak to the level of visibility you have around that based on contracts that you already have in hand.\nJoe Adams: We believe that the run rates for the fourth quarter, that the end of 2021 for Jefferson will be 70 million to 80 million, so that next year again, we haven't really put an official forecast out there, but I would assume 100 million or north.\nGeorge Sellers: Okay, great. Thank you so much. I'll leave it there.\nJoe Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from Rob Salmon with Wolfe Research.\nRob Salmon: Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess, Joe, to start off with just a bigger picture question. Could you discuss how you expect the two companies to look following the split from a capital structure perspective as we look forward?\nJoe Adams: Sure. I mean, we're targeting to maintain, the level of debt on each company maintain a DD rating for each one. So part of the next few months, the process of going through that with our own financial modeling and then also rating agencies to work through the details, but that's our objective. But it will be \u2013 the infrastructure business would be in U.S. domestic seaport and we'll have most of the projects financed, like the Jefferson bonds we've talked about, our Long Ridge are all financed at the entity level. And then the corporate debt would be an aviation, which will be a non-U.S. corporation. And we would be targeting that to maintain the BB rating.\nRob Salmon: That's helpful. I mean, historically, the FTAI Company more broadly has kind of targeted both growth as well as kind of a return of capital to shareholders. How do you see kind of the dividend playing out across the two companies, have you guys kind of thought through those dynamics at this point or is that that's still a work in progress?\nScott Christopher: We don't anticipate a change in that. I think it's still going to be the investment objective is going to be income plus growth. So I don't expect that to change. \nRob Salmon: Got it. And that would be true for both of the companies looking for?\nScott Christopher: Yes.\nRob Salmon: Perfect. And then a couple of quick \u2013 sorry, go ahead.\nJoe Adams: Historically, I think you would see higher dividends on aviation than you would see on infrastructure.\nRob Salmon: Yes. That makes sense, given the investments. And then just a couple of quick follow-ups with the aviation segment. Can you give us a sense of the capital investments that you guys are planning in the back half of the year that's underpinned in the 400 million of EBITDA you're expecting that company to generate?\nJoe Adams: Right now, we're looking at about $300 million additional investments that are all under LOI and we haven't added anything beyond that.\nRob Salmon: Perfect. And is that pretty evenly weighted between the two quarters or is it more fourth quarter? I know you had mentioned there was a big deal you're expecting to close in the fourth quarter. And obviously, you just closed a large one with an American airline.\nJoe Adams: We weren't supposed to say that, but yes, I would say evenly weighted.\nRob Salmon: Yes. Got it. Helpful. And then that's really \u2013 and if we look at the June \u2013 just June in terms of the utilization rate, can you give us a sense how that exited the quarter relative to the 65% utilization ex the adjustments that you had noted within the transaction that \u2013 new transactions you guys completed during the quarter?\nScott Christopher: It was \u2013 I think the exit rate was up from the beginning of the quarter about 10 percentage points.\nRob Salmon: Okay. Helpful. Appreciate the time, guys.\nScott Christopher: I think we put 23 engines on leases, I think were added during the quarter, it\u2019s a pretty big quarter. And we expect probably \u2013 potentially put 30 on and 53.\nRob Salmon: Appreciate it. Thanks for the color.\nScott Christopher: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from Frank Galanti with Stifel.\nFrank Galanti: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on, I guess, the three horsemen or whatever you want to call it, the JV, the Module Factory, the USM, you said 50 million was your expectations for this year. Can you kind of talk about how \u2013 I guess, what does that assume has been done already specifically in the second quarter?\nJoe Adams: Probably about five of the 50.\nFrank Galanti: Okay. That's helpful. And kind of staying on the aviation side, can you talk about the second PMA part, I guess the PMA parts generally how is the first one been kind of give us an update on how the penetration has been from an interest level from third-parties. And then how the \u2013 if there's an update on the timeline for the second and three, four or five parts?\nJoe Adams: Yes. So on the first part, the interest level is very high. We have a couple of airlines that have ordered it, mainly lot of feedback on the phone, frankly feedback on the phone. We have a lot of interest in, a couple of big airlines have ordered it and one airline is actually flying it and installed it. And I think the further penetration is a bit delayed because there's not a lot of shoppers it's going on. So it is most airlines, as I mentioned, are burning off green time. So they're not doing a lot of major overhauls. So a lot of airlines are waiting until that builds up. And they're also waiting to be able to pair it with the second part which we expect. As I said to have that final submission with the FAA in September which would hopefully imply year-end approval and that's the first. The second batch of parts is expected for late 2022 or early 2023, those additional three parts.\nFrank Galanti: Okay. That is helpful. And then I think the last question I wanted to walk through kind of CapEx needs. So in your prepared remarks, you'd mentioned part of that financing at Jefferson 175 million is going to be upstream to the parent. You've got 150 million left in the undrawn revolver. But you'd mentioned about 300 million CapEx needed for the aviation. And it could be off on this, but the Transtar purchase was closed. But I guess just want to walk through what level of equity contribution is needed from FTAI, kind of across the various businesses. And then add onto that 100 plus million at Jefferson needed for the expansion where \u2013 what are the CapEx needs in the next few quarters?\nJoe Adams: So the Jefferson and CapEx needs will all be financed by this bond offering. So there's zero need for Jefferson. Zero needed for Long Ridge, zero needed for Repauno. So those are easy. Transtar is fully financed, which closed yesterday. And then as you mentioned, we do 300 million of acquisitions, we've got 175 million plus the undrawn revolver to fund that. So there are no additional capital \u2013 unfunded capital requirements for this year, everything's funded.\nFrank Galanti: Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thanks very much.\nJoe Adams: Thanks.\nOperator:  And your next question is from Robert Dodd with Raymond James.\nRobert Dodd: Hi guys. A question on the dividend, this feels like a flashback. Previously Joe, you said, when FAD covers the dividend by a factor of two, you consider taking up the dividend, obviously by my math, certainly by the fourth quarter, maybe the third, you'd be in excess of that, obviously that also be right before the spin or its separation. So can you give us any thoughts on \u2013 is that still a good rule of thumb and does that apply to maybe the separated businesses as well? \nJoe Adams: Yes, it is a good rule of thumb and yes, your math is pretty good and we will factor that in, if and when it's sort of coincident with a spin, we'll build that in.\nRobert Dodd: Okay. Got it. Thank you. One more if I can unrelated to that. You talked about that leasing nature basically back to pre-pandemic levels, but at the same time, the airlines are burning down all that green time. Which \u2013 lack of a better term, do you think there's meaningful upside to lease rates? I mean, we can see what happened in the rental car market. If you run \u2013 your portfolio down eventually pricing moves significantly, do you think there's a risk in your favor of a material uptick in lease pricing? If airlines continue to run green time down while you've got available engines.\nJoe Adams: Yes, we have been saying that all along. And so we think by the fourth quarter of this year, first quarter of next year, that there's demand will outstrip supply. Now unlike rental car companies, we can't go from charging $80 a day. So we will most likely, what we've done historically is just get better, longer terms and higher maintenance reserves and just better all around deals. The rent \u2013 airlines get very, very sensitive to rent. So you try to find other ways to make more money because that becomes a relationship, and you don't want to, if you're going to do continuing business, and you're doing parts on the maintenance side and a building program, you don't want to take full advantage of your position or you'll pay for it later. So it's rented a little bit, but there is \u2013 you're not going to be flexible on it, if everyone else is paying $60,000 a month, you're not going to go and give them a deal at 30. So you'll get \u2013 you might get 50, but instead of a 12 month deal, you get a three-year deal and you may be tweak to maintenance reserves and make them higher.\nRobert Dodd: Got it. I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn it back to Alan Andreini for closing remarks.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, April. And thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q3.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joe Adams",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 25th dividend as a public company and our 40th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on August 30 based on a shareholder record date of August 16. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD or funds available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 2021 was $68 million compared to Q1 2021 of $47.2 million and Q2 of 2020 of $66.5 million. FAD was $68.3 million in Q2 2021 versus $14.4 million in Q1 2021 and $47.3 million in Q2 2020. On a normalized basis, excluding sale proceeds and nonrecurring items, Q2 2021 FAD was $15.7 million compared to $9.8 million in Q1 2021 and $38.2 million in Q2 2020. During the second quarter, the $68.3 million FAD number was comprised of $116.2 million from our aviation leasing portfolio, negative $2.5 million from our infrastructure business and negative $45.4 million from corporate and other. Now starting with aviation. Aviation experienced a meaningful increase in activity in passenger markets in Q2, and our portfolio of engine products and services is picking up momentum. While we achieved our goal of $80 million of EBITDA in Q2, up from $60 million in Q1, we are seeing a slightly slower ramp due to continuing COVID travel restrictions related to the Delta variant, particularly in Europe. As a result, we're now projecting 2021 EBITDA of $400 million as compared to our previous projection of $450 million for the full year. The engine leasing market is particularly strong as airlines look to ramp up flying while continuing to minimize maintenance capital spending. Good morning. Yes. We're very excited about it. It's a \u2013 as I mentioned previously, we've \u2013 I think given the pandemic, we've been able to access airlines that previously would probably \u2013 we would not have had as much access to. And part of it is just the need they have for capital, but also part of it is to focus on the engine side of the business. So we see that as a door opener for more business, but also the ability to integrate our products offering into the mix in terms of the equation. So when we go \u2013 when there is shop visits are \u2013 we can be talking about module swaps PMA, used serviceable material, and we're already doing it that to some level with this existing airline. So it gives us the opportunity to increase the volume. One of the prohibition is obviously, people has always had \u2013 if you have an asset that's owned by a leasing company and you want to put PMA in it, usually the leasing companies have been prohibited that. We actually, if we own the asset, we have the ability to give ourselves permission. So \u2013 and that we can resell at a very, very low cost. So I think it is a door opener for us to \u2013 as I said, vertically integrate provide a broader range of services than anybody has ever done before and actually save us money. So \u2013 and we see very \u2013 I think the level of interest in both USM and PMA is very, very high. So I think as this picks up, it's going to give us additional ways to do business with big carriers. Yes. I think the engine leasing market is heading up very nicely. I mean, we're not doing any \u2013 I think the era when people were doing power by the hour deals is over, lease rates are turning up, terms are extending out. So I think it's \u2013 the recent deals we've done in the engine side are virtually as good as what we were doing in 2019. And I think it's going to go higher. It's basically laws of supply and demand, as we know that everybody is deferring maintenance as much as they can. And so they're starting to line up assets and they're lining up engines in particular for longer-terms. So we're getting \u2013 and our portfolio is now extended out 18 months and we're signing up. We just signed up deals with a large airline that have a three year term. So I think rates and terms are going up. And maintenance reserve rates, which is also another sort of very important economic part of the lease are \u2013 has never really went down. And the manufacturers, \u2013 the maintenance reserve rates are set by taking the estimated cost of the shop and dividing it by the number of hours and the OEMs keep raising the parts prices even in this pandemic period. So maintenance reserve rates are still very strong. So all in all, I think the engine lease market is trending up very nicely. Yes. So most of what we've been trying to do is buy older A318, A319s, 737, 700s, and then get rid of the airframe. So we're buying engines, buying a whole plane and then scrapping the airframe. And the acquisition \u2013 that way makes the most sense, we've been acquiring assets at probably the lowest prices we've ever bought them at, sometimes lower than $1 million for an engine. So that's been very fruitful, we added 27 new engines in the second quarter, which is one of the reasons our utilization looks a little bit lower, because we found some really good investments to put on the books. And that reflected about 10 points of utilization, so really it's more like 65, but that's the best way to create an engine today, because there is very \u2013 there very few buyers for off least older assets. If you have not \u2013 if you don't have revenue stream attached and it's an older asset, we might be the only bid. So we like that dynamics. Yes. Yes. I would say that probably from the pre-pandemic to the bottom of the pandemic, we've probably declined 25%, 30% to the worst. And I think most of that 25% to 30% now has gone. It's in fact very close to pre-pandemic. Yes. I mean, you have to have some engines in inventory and we currently owned 200 CFM56 engines. So a lot of the airlines we're talking to right now are looking at \u2013 starting with programs that could be 10 or 20 year to talk about 10 or 20 modules. But they have fleets that could be 100s of engines. So they're looking at that as really a starter kit. So we think that basically we can grow, if we get people started doing it, then it has a flywheel effect and you can just grow with them. So our 200 engine fleet might grow to 300, 400, just remember there is 22,000 engines in the world of this type. So going from 200 to 400 to 600 doesn't really move the needle. And so, I think we can scale our inventory along with the needs of the customer, but the upside of, how many could people do is really very significant. Once they integrate this into the way they operate on the maintenance side, it's quite significant. And then, if you put on top of that, you add PMA into it, which will start to happen next year, it could become even much bigger. Yes. That was very intensive of the completed Phase 2. And it hasn't changed, we've zeroed in on more, I think we're specifically on exactly what we need to build and when we need to build it. And the capital expectation, I think is less than $500 million at this point, partially because we've invested already some of the infrastructure that's going to be used. So it's \u2013 I would think of it's more of a $400 million. And the other thing is changed, as I've listed about eight different products. When we first started this, we were thinking propane, butane, but we've had lots of different ideas from people coming to us and actually suggesting propylene as an example, or some of the natural gas liquids, condensate some refined products. And then we've had further discussions that fairly recent about pipeline connectivity, which would also expand both the capabilities, as well as the product offerings. So I think it's only gotten better in terms of the upside and the capitals is probably a little bit less than what we had forecasted. So it's \u2013 if I didn't sound enthusiastic saying it, I am extremely enthusiastic because it's all happening and the conversations are live and real. Yes. Yes. I think we've \u2013 we continually, every time we do a deal or we have a meeting, we end up with a longer list than when we started, so that's the fun part. And so we've got multiple projects, sort of a handful of projects with each of Exxon and Motiva that are real. I would say that they always were these large entity sales take longer than we would like. But we do get there, that's one of our sort of \u2013 we seem to have staying power in these negotiations. So we \u2013 but the number of opportunities there are significant and it's on both refined products and crude. And if you think about from a macro point of view, these are the two \u2013 in 2023, Exxon will be the largest refinery in North America. So it's 600,000 barrels a day in and 600,000 barrels a day out and the same for Motiva. So you're trucking over 1 million barrels a day right in our backyard. So we have lots of things that happen in and things that we don't even anticipate, like importing fuel oil, for example, we would never have guessed that that's something on the radar, but that becomes a topic or storing an intermediate. So a lot of these things come about, because you just have regular conversations. But there are many, many different projects once you get connected and once you're in a regular dialogue. Timing wise, the building of this storage takes about a year, so it's \u2013 we have probably the lead time on a lot of these projects to do that. Now that we have the pipes though, it's a lot easier, because you can go and say, we have a connection already, so we don't have to worry about that part of it. And so \u2013 it's mostly these discussions I would say that the typical lead time would be nine months to a year. Yes. The two biggest movers would be the number of flying hours. So as airlines ramp up flying, our revenues increase on the maintenance reserve side. And so, if you look back to the \u2013 I think it was third quarter of 2019, was our best quarter, because it was 85% utilization and every airline was flying 300 to 400 hours a month, so \u2013 or every aircraft. So that's probably the biggest one, and that's where the ramp up of services, particularly U.S., we've seen a lot, South America, we've seen a lot, Europe has just lagged, it's just been slower with the cross-border. I mean, United States is great because 50 States you can always travel more, not always, I should say. But historically, you could travel between one State and another without showing a passport, but in Europe, it's different, so \u2013 and I think that is slower. But Europe, Europe will follow and I indicated it, I think that'll happen later this year where you'll start to see more flying, but the activity \u2013 flying activity is number one, and then the second is acquisitions. And so we've got the one deal I mentioned is closing this week or next week. And then we have one other large deal with European carrier that should close by the fourth quarter. So those I think are the two utilization of flying hours and acquisitions. Thanks. I assume you're talking about the three JV, the USM and \u2013 what's the third, the Lockheed Martin, the Module Factory. So those three... We believe that 50 million for the year is still a good number for those three. The decrease from 450 to 400 was largely on leasing revenues. So those three will produce about 50 this year, we haven't forecast yet for next year, what we think those will be, but safe to assume that it's going to be higher. We believe that the run rates for the fourth quarter, that the end of 2021 for Jefferson will be 70 million to 80 million, so that next year again, we haven't really put an official forecast out there, but I would assume 100 million or north. Thanks. Sure. I mean, we're targeting to maintain, the level of debt on each company maintain a DD rating for each one. So part of the next few months, the process of going through that with our own financial modeling and then also rating agencies to work through the details, but that's our objective. But it will be \u2013 the infrastructure business would be in U.S. domestic seaport and we'll have most of the projects financed, like the Jefferson bonds we've talked about, our Long Ridge are all financed at the entity level. And then the corporate debt would be an aviation, which will be a non-U.S. corporation. And we would be targeting that to maintain the BB rating. Historically, I think you would see higher dividends on aviation than you would see on infrastructure. Right now, we're looking at about $300 million additional investments that are all under LOI and we haven't added anything beyond that. We weren't supposed to say that, but yes, I would say evenly weighted. Probably about five of the 50. Yes. So on the first part, the interest level is very high. We have a couple of airlines that have ordered it, mainly lot of feedback on the phone, frankly feedback on the phone. We have a lot of interest in, a couple of big airlines have ordered it and one airline is actually flying it and installed it. And I think the further penetration is a bit delayed because there's not a lot of shoppers it's going on. So it is most airlines, as I mentioned, are burning off green time. So they're not doing a lot of major overhauls. So a lot of airlines are waiting until that builds up. And they're also waiting to be able to pair it with the second part which we expect. As I said to have that final submission with the FAA in September which would hopefully imply year-end approval and that's the first. The second batch of parts is expected for late 2022 or early 2023, those additional three parts. So the Jefferson and CapEx needs will all be financed by this bond offering. So there's zero need for Jefferson. Zero needed for Long Ridge, zero needed for Repauno. So those are easy. Transtar is fully financed, which closed yesterday. And then as you mentioned, we do 300 million of acquisitions, we've got 175 million plus the undrawn revolver to fund that. So there are no additional capital \u2013 unfunded capital requirements for this year, everything's funded. Thanks. Yes, it is a good rule of thumb and yes, your math is pretty good and we will factor that in, if and when it's sort of coincident with a spin, we'll build that in. Yes, we have been saying that all along. And so we think by the fourth quarter of this year, first quarter of next year, that there's demand will outstrip supply. Now unlike rental car companies, we can't go from charging $80 a day. So we will most likely, what we've done historically is just get better, longer terms and higher maintenance reserves and just better all around deals. The rent \u2013 airlines get very, very sensitive to rent. So you try to find other ways to make more money because that becomes a relationship, and you don't want to, if you're going to do continuing business, and you're doing parts on the maintenance side and a building program, you don't want to take full advantage of your position or you'll pay for it later. So it's rented a little bit, but there is \u2013 you're not going to be flexible on it, if everyone else is paying $60,000 a month, you're not going to go and give them a deal at 30. So you'll get \u2013 you might get 50, but instead of a 12 month deal, you get a three-year deal and you may be tweak to maintenance reserves and make them higher."

I think we put 23 engines on leases, I think were added during the quarter, it's a pretty big quarter. And we expect probably \u2013 potentially put 30 on and 53. Thanks."

As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Alan Andreini. Please go ahead, sir.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Patricia. I would like to welcome you to the Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure First Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer; Scott Christopher, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bo Wholey, the CEO of our Long Ridge Energy Terminal. We have posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you have not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only mode and is being webcast.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks, Alan. To start, I'm pleased to announce our 24th dividend as a public company and our 39th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on May 25 based on a shareholder record date of May 14. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD, or funds available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2021 was $47.2 million compared to Q4 2020 of $46.2 million and Q1 2020 of $72 million. FAD was $14.4 million in Q1 2021 versus $54.2 million in Q4 2020 and $96 million in Q1 2020. On a normalized basis, excluding sales proceeds and nonrecurring items, Q1 2021 FAD was $9.8 million compared to $35.7 million in Q4 2020 and $67.4 million in Q1 2020. During the first quarter, the $14.1 million FAD number was comprised of $60.6 million from our aviation leasing portfolio, negative $3.8 million from our infrastructure businesses and negative $42.4 million from corporate and other. Now turning first to Aviation. Q1 EBITDA for Aviation of $61 million was a slight improvement from Q4, as we expected. But also as we expected, we are seeing a meaningful uptick in activity in April and expect Q2 Aviation EBITDA to exceed $80 million. As an example, we have signed 20 new leases for CFM56 engines, of which 8 have already been delivered in the last few weeks. 75% of our fleet is 737NG and A320 CO aircraft and engines, which are flown mostly in domestic shorter-haul markets, which are poised for strong rebound by Q3 of this year with many airlines planning flight schedules that are equal to or greater than Q3 of 2019. And 20% of our fleet is operating in the cargo markets, which continue to experience record high demand. Thus, our fleet is extremely well positioned for the recovery.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Joe. Operator, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: . Your first question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from Benchmark Company.\nJoshua Sullivan: Nice quarter here. Sounds like you guys have a lot of irons in the fire here. But maybe if we could start with the Lockheed joint venture on the new module store, you mentioned strong initial demand in the remarks. Can you just elaborate or maybe quantify what that initial response looks like? Any common thread among early adopters as far as customer profile or assets they're registering here?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. We have a lot of information. We timed the launch on Monday to sort of which the big Orlando maintenance and repair conference started on Tuesday. So that was intentional. And so as part of a marketing -- initial marketing effort, we were with all of -- a lot of the right people to be in front of and a very good response from the target group. And the target group is primarily going to be 3 different categories. It will be aviation maintenance procurement folks who buy and manage the parts supply and the engine things that are bought from outside for their maintenance businesses. And the modules simplifies their life in a lot of ways. So a very positive response from some very big airlines. So big airlines who, in some cases, have their own maintenance shops. So it illustrates the degree they're looking at cost savings as well as capital efficiency. So that was positive. \nJoshua Sullivan: No, got it. That's all very helpful. And then maybe just a second question. The demand you're seeing on the aviation side, the step-up you're pointing to here in 2Q, it implies some strong sequential activity. What are you seeing that gives you that confidence? And then maybe what is your domestic versus international travel profile breakdown?\nJoseph Adams: So we -- when you talk about domestic, are you talking about U.S.? Or are you talking about domestic markets around the world?\nJoshua Sullivan: Domestic markets around the world.\nJoseph Adams: So we're about, as I mentioned, at 70% -- 75% of our fleet is A320 COs and 737 NGs, which are really domestic airplanes. So 75%. And we've been consciously targeting that market, and we're going to -- that's likely to keep growing. The rest of our fleet is in the cargo market. So it's really between -- those are our primary focus, and those are 2 of the best markets in aviation right now. So we're heavily concentrated on domestic, which we like. And what we're seeing is what we thought is there's still a fair amount of inventory and green time available out there that airlines can continue to use before they do shop visits. So shop visits are being deferred. But airlines are looking ahead and saying, \"Look, if I'm going to fly my fleet all out in Q3 of this year and maybe Q4 and Q1 next year because there's a lot of pent-up demand. They're going to run out of capacity fairly soon in terms of engines available. And airlines are notoriously not good at planning.  So they're starting to -- so as I mentioned, we've put out a number of engines on lease, and I think some of those are to carriers that were coming out of restructuring and were coming out of bankruptcy in some cases who need lift and don't have a lot of options. And then the next group is going to be airlines that realize that pretty soon they're going to run out of engines. And what they're doing now is lining up, we're negotiating lease agreements, WE'RE negotiating -- they're going through inventory, they want availability, they would like engines on their facility available. So they're starting to get ready for the one they're going to need to lease engines. And there are some RFPs coming out with some airlines looking to specify they want 10 or 15 engines. These are bigger airlines available. So they're seeing it, and we're starting to plan. And so that's kind of the second wave. And then the third wave is really when you use up all the green time. And that, I think, will be Q4, Q1 of, call it, Q1 of 2022, where people have to start doing shop visits again in good number.  And that is -- there's a fair amount of lead time because if you want to get into a shop, you have to order parts, you have to get a slot. And so that takes advanced planning. And that's, I think, where our module factory really fits in extremely well because if you only need to shop -- if an engine only needs work on the LPT, you don't want to put the entire engine in the shop and wait for the LPT to be fixed. So doing a swap is really very, very efficient. And as I say, it's disruptive to the way it's done now because people don't do it that way. They think if everything is that's my engine, so don't give me a different module, but it's changed. Airlines themselves do it. And I think the rest of the industry is going to get there very quickly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Giuliano Anderes Bologna from Compass Point.\nGiuliano Anderes Bologna: I guess a quick question, kind of going back to what you were mentioning last quarter on the aviation segment. You said roughly kind of there are 3 different components from -- contribution from existing engines, then there is contribution from new investments and then from the kind of parts and maintenance JV initiatives. Then we got to a $450 million of aviation EBITDA for '21, and there was roughly, call it $50 million or $60 million for infrastructure in '21 is what you're kind of calling for and leaving out the corporate segment. Kind of curious how those pieces still come together and how you're thinking about that for '21 given kind of the early results in the year.\nJoseph Adams: Yes. Well, we didn't really expect much out of Q1, as I mentioned in the last call, and that has proved to be true because it just restrictions were heavily in place in Q1, as you know, but they're now opening up and everybody's planning for refining. So we're still of the view that the $450 million for 2021 is achievable. And the components were roughly, I think, it was $320 million from the existing portfolio, $80 million from new investments and $50 million from the 3 JV, the partnerships with Chromalloy, Lockheed Martin and AAR. And so it's obviously going to be heavily back-end loaded. So a big jump in Q3 and Q4, which makes sense given what I was just talking about. So we believe that that is -- that still our view is for the year. And then on infrastructure, also I think the $50 million is very achievable.  We've got -- as I mentioned, we've got good initiatives now at Repauno with lots of activity around natural gas liquids, and we're sold out for the summer. And I think that's just going to build, the momentum is going to build there, and we'll come up with new ways to make money on the fact that we're now doing business with lots of different counterparties. Long Ridge starts firing, first fire this month or May and turns on in August. So that will start contributing. And Jefferson, very helpful about the volumes picking up as well as landing one or more big contracts here in the next couple of months.\nGiuliano Anderes Bologna: That's great. And then moving a little bit kind of to the comments you're making about potentially starting kind of bitcoin mining venture initiative at Long Ridge. One of the most important components of bitcoin mining is usually power cost. And I guess I have a couple of questions there. I'm kind of curious what your cost per megawatt hour is at the power plant. And then from there, there are kind of 2 follow-ons. One was that you have 2 existing contracts or supply agreements. And I think those -- you have the ability to cancel those because you've been talking about some of the data centers that may have involved canceling those. I'm kind of curious if it's possible to cancel or partially cancel any of those if it were, the venture were to be successful, I think kind of a . I'm kind of curious if you selected any specific type of bitcoin mining equipment because there are a few different providers out there. I'm kind of curious if you've made the decision where you have like a specific mining equipment in mind.\nJoseph Adams: Yes. Well, I'll take the first, and then I'll let Bo talk about the equipment. But the -- in terms of the cost of power, I mean, we've looked at a lot of these companies that are starting up and converting coal power plants and other older assets that are being repositioned, and we think we have, by far, we the lowest cost. And it's several different categories, but the -- and we are already vertically integrated. So years ago, we decided to go develop our own gas. So we're actually vertically integrated back to the gas in the ground and no one has that capability, which means we think our cost of power on the first 20 megawatts is about $12 a megawatt hour.  So that is far lower than we may have seen, and I think far lower in reality than most people because a lot of people are ignoring costs that they just -- are convenient to ignore. So I think we've got 12. And one of the reasons why the first 20 megawatts is interesting to us and sort of got us thinking is that our power plant is going to be rated 485 megawatts by the manufacturer. So initially, that's the most amount of power you can sell under the capacity auction. So you can get paid for capacity without ever using it. And it's only the rated amount we can get paid for. Until there's a couple of years of operating data, you can't really upsize that 485, but we can actually produce 505 megawatts. So the first 20 megawatts is the cheapest electricity. Now it's just marginally only -- the only thing we pay for is the cost of fuel. So that's what got us thinking and gives us sort of the lowest cost of power. But beyond that, we had another -- was it 40 megawatts that we never contracted.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. We have about 457 contracted today.\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So 457 is under these long-term contracts, which is like 94% of production. And so we have another 40 megawatts or 30 megawatts that we could use without terminating any of our existing contracts. That -- the plan was just to sell that into the merchant market. And then thirdly, if we wanted to go beyond that, we have the right under our long-term offtake agreements to terminate those contracts under make-whole provisions. So think of it like an interest rate swap that if the market moves, you just have to be able to replace. The counterparty has to go out in the market and replace what they had with us with someone else. And right now, because of the way the power markets have moved, they actually would -- if we elected to terminate those contracts and under the  provisions, the counterparty would owe us money. So quite an interesting dynamic. And it's a one-way op.  So we have the right to terminate, but the counterparty does not have right to terminate. So -- and we structured it that way deliberately so we could find other off-takers and then immediately replace those with higher behind-the-meter users. So really lots of -- I mean, we have tremendous amount of flexibility to grow at very, very attractive prices. We have the most efficient turbine in the world, the highest heat rate is the 7HA.02, which is what we're using. So I don't think anybody in the world has got that sort of firepower against what we can. So as obviously, the markets become more competitive and people are putting more resources towards it, it's going to be the lowest cost provider is going to win. So that's where I think we have a -- and we're more vertically integrated than anybody in the business that we know of. Bo, do you want to talk about the machines?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes. So the machines that will start running Monday are the S19 PROs. And then for the next batch that we're looking at most likely the S19 J Pro, which is the newest model and one of the most efficient in terms of energy usage.\nJoseph Adams: And there are 100 terahash per second or 110 for the , right.\nGiuliano Anderes Bologna: That's great. That's very helpful. I just had one very quick one and then I'll jump right back in the queue after that. I really appreciate all the help. I'd be curious kind of what the other -- the power cost is kind of -- you kind of identified the roughly, call it, $12 per megawatt hour for the kind of access component. I'd be curious how as you go further down the structure kind of what the average is if you -- with kind of the core production capacity and kind of where that cost might shake out.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Probably $16, $17.\nJoseph Adams: Yes.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Yes.\nUnidentified Company Representative: I think order of magnitude of $16, $17, and that would be represented for the entire remaining capacity.\nGiuliano Anderes Bologna: Congrats on all the new initiatives.\nOperator: We have the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citi.\nChristian Wetherbee: Joe, maybe if we could start on the aviation side. I mean, you mentioned obviously the ramp-up that you're expecting in the second quarter from what you did in the first quarter. If I look back over the last couple of years, and obviously last year was a significant under-earning year. But I wanted to kind of get a better sense of what the portfolio looks like today and what the potential initiatives that you're working on look like in terms of a walk from where we were last year. Could you sort of help sort of build the pieces back up so we can get maybe more of a clean run rate of what aviation is capable of on an adjusted EBITDA basis when some of these new initiatives are in place?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So I think what we've done is we've moved more towards the CFM56 engine, which I think now is about 50% of our total investment. So that's probably up from maybe 30% prior to this period. And we have a couple of other deals that we're still working on that we think will add to that and grow that. And then we've also increased our cargo business. So I think that where you've seen the decrease has been in 767 passenger business we had, and some 757 passenger. And so I would say those 2 have gone down in the CFM56 and cargo have gone up. And so that's strategically, I think, where we've been -- we decided really 2 years ago to start doing that and then accelerate it with the pandemic. And then on top of that, what we've expressed is that we want -- not only do we want to earn 25% EBITDA on invested aviation capital, but we want to develop revenue and EBITDA from other services that are not tied to owning assets.  Think of the Chromalloy, Lockheed Martin and AAR, which we say we think we can earn $50 million this year. And that number on the upper bound is somewhat unlimited in that. And I think the -- we talked the last time about how do you accelerate that and you get airlines to basically let us outsource the maintenance of their CFM56 fleet. And I think that the module factory is one of those moments where you say, that's how we do it. That's exactly, that's the mechanism. And it isn't that complicated. And it allows airlines to sort of use that service on an ad hoc basis as they want without going through some major RFP process that involves the OEM and 10 other people. So you can deal with solutions that save the maintenance department a lot of money. And it's very accessible, easy to use, allows them to be flexible in how they use PMA, for example, that's not sort of in the face of anybody. So it's the solution to what we were looking for. So I think that number is unbounded. I really do.\nChristian Wetherbee: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess maybe a question on Jefferson. So I'm kind of curious your take here. So obviously, some rail M&A news has been sort of building over the course of the last couple of weeks, in particular the last 2 weeks. And so I was curious what your perspective is if you have one. There's 2 potential competing carriers for the KCS assets. You guys obviously get served by KCS at the facility. And as that business continues to sort of develop as you've gotten access to incremental refinery production, do you have any take there? Is there any sort of view on where you'd like to see that transaction go? Or do you think there is any impact at all on Jefferson as a result of the transaction? Any thoughts you have there would be helpful. I'm curious sort of how this plays out for a critical rail shipper.\nJoseph Adams: Yes. We have a point of view, and we've been engaged with both the Canadians who are looking for support. So I think it is an interesting dynamic. And never some -- it changes too. So as you think about the different permutations and options. But I think that it's going to work out better for us. I think we've gotten a very good dialogue. I mean it's amazing how quickly how they return your calls and things like that. So it is -- we are focused on sort of developing a long-term flow of products from the Canadian market by rail. And that probably involves the DRU. There's one that's being built, that's about to be finished. And then there's a couple more that are being planned. And so we're having good dialogue with both of them.  And I ultimately think if they have a -- if there's a Canadian carrier that has a through rate all the way to Beaumont, that that's good for us and good for the customers. And also, it might enable us to make sure that there is no -- there's no way that we get cut out either. And so you get most favored nations no matter what happens. So I think we have our thoughts together. I think it's going to be good for us. I think the dialogue around the plans are much accelerated and much more open maybe than they were before. And it's a multiparty dialogue too, because not only are we talking to the K and railroads, where we're talking to the Exxons and Motiva who are impacted and also thinking about it. So it's fun, I think.\nChristian Wetherbee: Yes, I can imagine that they're being fairly responsive. Seems like an interesting opportunity for you guys potentially to maybe benefit from all this, but that's ample perspective.\nJoseph Adams: And we also -- Exxon has a big move. We do a lot of -- we're doing like 30,000, 35,000 barrels a day to Mexico for Exxon, and that KCS is the carrier. So that's going to be impacted. So there's a lot of things going on, but I do think it's -- ultimately, it's usually good for the shippers.\nOperator: Next we have the line of Robert Salmon from Wolfe Research.\nRobert Salmon: I guess kind of another topical, IM has been the President's kind of infrastructure plans. Could you discuss some thoughts about potential government grants to help reduce FTAI capital  for both in terms of the magnitude and timing just given how many project-ready investments you have across the entire portfolio?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So it's -- that's another area of a lot of focus and interest because, for instance, last week, we were talking about Repauno in New Jersey. And I think there's 4 government grant programs that we're looking at right now that potentially we could apply for and could involve grant money. So that's a good example. There is one at Long Ridge, which we already have, and I think we can supplement that as well. And yes, there's going to be a lot of -- I mean, as the plan starts to take shape, there's obviously some key elements to. A lot of it is green-focused. So that's going to be something we're thinking about. We've got a number of initiatives on new projects around that, around ammonia, around hydrogen, around plastics recycling. So yes, I think it's great because you do have to have projects that are semi-ready. They're not all going to be shovel ready. But if you have something with semi-ready, it's so much easier to get money than if you're in the permitting phase and you have to do an . That's like 4 years. So I think it's -- I think we're going to figure out. There's going to be some good things we're going to be able to tap into.\nRobert Salmon: Got it. But probably a little bit too early in terms of figuring out what that can mean from a capital investment avoidance or the time line?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. But I'm pretty sure we're going to get some -- I mean, I remember at Rail America, we got, I think like $300 million of government grant money over a 7-year period. So it was huge. And there are projects that come up that you never expect. So it's going to have an impact. There's, I mean, trillions of dollars invested, and I think we're going to -- it's going to be beneficial.\nRobert Salmon: That's helpful. And then I think -- if I think bigger picture about some of the proposed changes in taxes, including kind of capitalized -- capital gains and carried interest, will that have any impact in terms of your bigger picture plans to kind of unlock some value by spinning off kind of aviation and infrastructure or how the manager is compensated or even how you guys monetize assets more broadly across the portfolio?\nJoseph Adams: I don't think so. I mean we've started thinking about that. Obviously there's very little to look at yet in terms of specifics. It's mostly concepts. But so far, setting up the U.S. C-Corp is not anything that -- it might be that instead of a 21% rate, you pay 28%, but everybody is going to be in the same boat. And if there's a minimum tax, maybe you don't get to shelter as much income. So -- but it still makes it -- it's still a better structure for us to get rid of K-1s, and that's something that we are looking at, and it's on the target list of things to do. And hopefully, we'll be able to do something at the end of -- by the end of this year, but that's -- we're working on it. And I don't see any impediments.\nOperator: Next we have the line of Justin Long from Stephens.\nJustin Long: So Joe, you gave the guidance for the aviation business to do over $80 million of EBITDA in the second quarter. But could you talk a little bit more about what you're expecting for aviation EBITDA in the third and fourth quarter just as we think about the exit rate this year and how that sets the stage for 2022?\nJoseph Adams: Sure. Well, if you do the math, it's going to be over $100 million for each of the Q3 and Q4. So that's -- it's pretty simple. How much, we're thinking, obviously Q3 historically has been one of the biggest quarters and that's where you can high utilization, and we can get -- everything is moving. But I also think that this year I expect to be somewhat different in that you can't -- I mean, people have a lot of trips that they haven't taken for the last 15 months, and you can't take 10 trips in a week.  So I think there's going to be a rollover. And the seasonality I think in this year will probably be less than it has been historically and that people will be traveling in Q4 and Q1 to see their relatives or their customers, their friends or just to get out of wherever they have been. So I think that the flying levels are going to -- should be sustained, I think more so than they have been in the past. So that's kind of the rough guidance. So we're expecting a good fourth quarter as well.\nJustin Long: Okay. Got it. So 3Q and 4Q, it sounds like maybe pretty similar. I know the other element that I was thinking about was just the parts and service business and some of the partnerships you've announced and how that could ramp. But it sounds like a pretty even split in the back half between the 2 quarters.\nJoseph Adams: Yes. I think that some of the initiatives could -- there's a little bit of a flywheel effect that you get bigger as you go. And you might do more part out and more trading in the fourth quarter than we have in the third quarter. Because in Q3, you want to use everything you've got. People will be hoarding. And Q4 will probably be more trading opportunities. But I think it will be better than any other year, but it's -- they're comparable, I think.\nJustin Long: Okay. Great. And then just a bigger picture strategic question. I know there have been discussions on prior calls about splitting up the company at some point. Any updated thoughts around the probability of that materializing and the potential timing of that decision?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. We have -- it is on the list of priorities, things to do. And I think we have a couple of other items we need ahead of that. But then, I believe it will be a fairly top of the list, and hopefully we get something done by the end of this year. That would be my personal goal. Not a stake in the ground yet, but it's a goal that I think is something we all agree we want to do it.\nOperator: Next we have the line of Robert Dodd from Raymond James.\nRobert Dodd: And congratulations on the outlook. If I can go to . You said -- I mean, basically, you sold out through the third quarter. Can you give us any color on, there's congestion in other areas of shipping, et cetera, et cetera. How is the competition to get slots at La Pano and our basic -- are the customers, potential customers starting to try and talk to you about longer-term deals to kind of lock up either dock slots or storage shots or anything like that longer term rather than an as-needed basis?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, they are. Quite a good commercial response. And I think it gets to the -- what we always felt was that before you are in operation, people are inherently skeptical and not willing to commit because they've seen too many projects that didn't complete. So the big step for us was in January, loading that first vessel, being in service. And now we're basically, we've got 30 ships. We're going to be very, very busy for Q2 and Q3, which is seasonally the very, the strong market for propane and butane. But the number of PDH plants being built around the world and the volume of export of natural gas liquids continues to grow. And we are really the only other terminal, the Marcus Hook, on the East Coast of the United States.  So I think the commercial response has been great. So now it's about how do we grow -- how do we expand our capacity because as you point out, we will be -- our slots, our dock will be occupied pretty much fully in second and third quarter. So then the next expansion is going to be a dock 2 and additional underground storage. And we're in the process of getting both of those permitted. So that's the sequence. I think once we have -- this summer's over, I think our plan is to go to offtakers and try to get multiyear commitments from them by the end of this year for that additional capacity. And also the other thing we're looking at, right now we're primarily going to be rail served. And so we're also looking at other options for connectivity, meaning pipes. So that would be another big jump up in terms of capacity and efficiency.\nRobert Dodd: I appreciate it. But one quick one on the aviation side. Can you give us -- a full shop visit obviously it takes a month, I mean not just the booking time but the actual time in the shop. What's the time differential between a full shop visit, a module swap because obviously we can save people $50 million on the cost plus 3 months, right, that's it. It's not just the cost, it's the time versus, say, and then an on-wing module swap, how fast, is that a fly in, fly out like 2 days later kind of thing?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. But you can't -- you couldn't do a module swap on wing, but you can do certain repairs on wing. I mean we're looking at -- and doing more of them is sort of very efficient. So there are partnerships we're talking about now to do -- to provide that on-wing service. That would give us really a more -- it just expands our portfolio of things we can do to save everyone's money. In terms of a module swap in a full shop is that you're talking about the difference in time is probably between 6 months for a full shop visit versus under 30 days for a module swap. So you can go -- you can show an airline, and we've done this in million dollars of cost savings just from that, the time savings. So there's a huge amount of money involved in savings through people figuring out how to use this service. And we today have 43 modules in inventory. So it's not like you're going to a store that's about to open and say, do you have anything or can I preorder. It's like we have it. So the savings are going to be -- people are going to learn and then they experiment and they say, \"Well, I could do that.\" And it's -- we think it's going to be quite a big thing.\nOperator: Next we have a question from the line of Ariel Rosa from Bank of America.\nAriel Rosa: So I want to start on the aviation side. Obviously, last year, thinking about acquiring aviation assets was kind of toxic in some spaces. And increasingly, as the market improves, it seems like basically consensus that demand for air travel is going to continue. I'm wondering, has that changed the availability of assets as you look to build the portfolio? And do you think the pace of asset acquisitions potentially slows because of that? Or how do you see that kind of playing out? And how has the market evolved for aviation assets over the last couple of months?\nJoseph Adams: It's a good question. The -- I mean, typically, when you have these severe downturns, I mean, the answer is we think there will be a very good market for investing in additional assets and particularly assets that are off-lease because that is something that's very tough for -- anybody with a portfolio doesn't want to have more assets off lease. That's really where I think our primary opportunity will -- has arisen and will arise. And typically, when you get a severe downturn at the bottom and everybody knows here in the worst times, no one wants to sell. And so there are some great deals, and we've picked up a few, and we've bought some. But generally, the volume is not very significant because nobody's -- people are not that stupid.  They know it's -- this is not a good time to sell. But as markets start to recover and prices have moved up, and they already have, I think, a little bit. So if they were down 40%, now they're down 30%, then I think you start to see a lot more volume. And so I think we'll see a number of cleanup trades where people are saying I've got 10 aircraft off lease, I just want to get rid of them. And that is starting. So I think we're going to -- and you also still have airlines looking at fund going to phase out of my older assets and buy newer assets, then I'll do a sale leaseback. So I think the market opportunity is going to be good because of that. It's not the rock-bottom steals that we might have seen in 2020, but it will be good prices that have a lot of upside, and I think it will be more volume.\nAriel Rosa: So within that, Joe, any expectation on kind of what the portfolio looks like in terms of assets by the end of the year?\nJoseph Adams: Well, we've -- historically, we've invested between $300 million and $500 million in assets a year. I would suspect we'll be in that range, potentially higher, but that's more episodic. It's harder to project. And maybe by the end of this year people will be doing more of these cleanup trades, as I said. So I think that that's still a good number to plan with.\nAriel Rosa: Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then just turning to Jefferson. Congratulations on completing pipeline construction with Motiva. Just obviously, building a pipeline implies a long-term commitment. I just wanted to get a better understanding of how you're thinking about structuring those contracts with Exxon and Motiva and how you guys are thinking about that long-term commitment and maybe how you're kind of anticipating the short-term benefits balanced against kind of those -- the longer-term outlook for the pipeline?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. The goal is to get 5- to 10-year contracts. And the first few deals we did were shorter because we wanted to get -- the first deal we did with Exxon was a 3-year deal on refined products. Then we built 6 pipelines, and we didn't really have much of a commitment. Now we're talking about extending those terms, as I said, between 5 and 10 years and adding a lot of volume to it for contracts between 5 and 10 years. Motiva, we did -- the first deal we did on the storage thing. They contracted for 1 million barrels of storage. And the deal is structured so that if we never built the pipeline, the term on the storage was 3 years, but when we complete the pipeline, those storage contracts changed from 3 years to 5 years. So that's exactly what they wanted.  They wanted the pipe be built because that's more efficient for them to save them money. So I think that's the goal, is 5- to 10-year contracts. There's obviously -- sometimes you'll do a shorter deal to get to get in and get started and then look for growth, which usually happens. I mean that's -- the beauty of this business is usually people go -- they add things. They don't take things away once you're wired in and once you're set up. The other market that we're still -- Canadian market has been an on and off market, and it's sort of not ideal because you don't want to just be moving barrels when the ARB is open. So the key to that I think is the DRU.  The DRU makes it a ratable flow. And if people invest in hundreds of millions of dollars in the DRU, it can only move by rail. So there I think you can get 10-year contracts. And there is one that's been built that had a 10-year contract, and we think more will be built. So ideally, I'd like to transform that Canadian move into a 10-year fixed contract which I think is doable. And I think we're closer to that than ever before.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Joe, I just want to come back to the quarter's $50 million guidance for aviation EBITDA this year. Because I think in the back half of the year, it would actually imply something closer to like $150 million run rate for 3Q and 4Q. Do we have our math off there? And maybe what are we missing?\nJoseph Adams: No. It's obviously -- yes, if we have -- we had $60 million in Q1, let's call it, more than $80 million in Q2 as you're close to $150 million, you get to $450 million, that's $300 million. So you've got to come up to $300 million in the back half of the year. That is correct.\nBrandon Oglenski: I guess, is it utilization in the fleet? Or can you speak more to how you're going to get paid on this module idea with Lockheed because we do understand it's a partnership. So where do you generate the revenue and the EBITDA opportunity from that? So every module swap or exchange or sale, we're estimating $0.5 million or more in EBITDA. So we think that there's potential for that. We have 43 modules in inventory right now, and we expect that we would hope to turn those frequently. So it is -- some of the income obviously comes from that, but we also have the Chromalloy joint venture, and we have the AAR part-out business as well. So that -- the USM, the AAR deal on the part-out has been very well received and is actually fully operational now, and we have torn down, I believe, like 7 engines. So it is -- and AAR is very happy with it, and there's large -- there's a lot of demand for USM. So really it's all of those things. It will be increased flying, which generates a lot more maintenance reserves from the portfolio, it will be Chromalloy, it will be AAR, it will be the module factory, and it will be the part-out business all combined.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. So still confident that the full year will be $450 million? It's not like an exit rate of $450 million?\nJoseph Adams: No, no. Yes.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Understood. And then I guess just last one for me, Joe. Strategically, infrastructure has obviously been the one that we've been waiting to get pretty solid contribution from over the years. Just wondering if the cryptocurrency opportunity, obviously, it could be very lucrative for you, but I think that would involve another capital outlay and introduce volatility. So is that the right step forward, especially as you think about potentially separating the company in the future? Well, I do think when you think about that business, the integration with low-cot energy is, it's very compelling. And so that's kind of what drove us to think about that is when you think about the highest and best use for electricity, it's $150 a megawatt hour today versus $30 million for industrial activities.  So really it's -- I don't know exactly where that will go, but it felt like worth exploring and figuring it out so that we can -- because we do have an asset. We have so many people coming to us saying they want to use our asset and they wanted to make all the money. So I think well, it's not that hard to buy the machines we did in the business, so why don't we make the money and then see where that leads us. Whether that's a separate activity or where it evolves or how it turns into, it just felt like a good -- we have one of the best assets in the world for that activity right now.  And it happened to be, we got lucky that it's actually coming online in August with bitcoin at $50,000. So it was really -- it's a little opportunistic in that sense and how it evolves into infrastructure and how people think about it as TBD. It's not that much of a capital outlay. And paybacks are under 2 years. So I think the breakeven on getting your money back on bitcoin is like $20,000, so. And you can stop the activity, you don't have to keep doing it. And some people say, it's really volatile, volatility is a negative, and it's like, well, I don't know, if bitcoin goes to $100,000, we'll have all of our money back in a couple of months, so why is that bad?\nOperator: . Your next question comes from Devin Ryan from JMP Securities.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Great. Most questions have been asked, but I want to ask one just about the dividend. I think before the pandemic there was a lot of talk about progressing the dividend or at least moving towards an increase. And obviously the past year I think was a good reminder around capital and potentially over-capitalization and the ability to be opportunistic as that you guys clearly have been. And so, just maybe to talk briefly about how you guys are thinking about the trajectory of the dividend, just kind of taking that in consideration, also just the fact that there's so many compelling opportunities to deploy capital back into the business for growth right now. So just if kind of thoughts have changed or evolved around that.\nJoseph Adams: Yes, it hasn't really changed. Obviously, we're looking to maintain a 2:1 coverage. And towards the back half of this year with the numbers we're looking at, we would be greater than that. So we would potentially -- that would put us in a position where we'd be looking for a dividend increase. So we haven't changed our philosophy on the dividend.\nDevin Ryan: Okay. Great. And then just one last follow-up here on Long Ridge. Really interesting conversation on crypto, especially kind of given your clean energy angle. So I think it makes a lot of sense. Do you have -- I guess it's early, but is the intention to hold kind of bitcoin beyond kind of operating costs? Or have you guys kind of thought that through if you're comfortable? You're holding it on the balance sheet or you just want to sell it as you mine, if there's kind of a consideration there. And then I'm assuming that with this kind of increased opportunity, this probably pushes off the thoughts around selling the remaining stake in Long Ridge or potentially, maybe doesn't make sense to do it all to the extent there's this terrific kind of newer opportunity. So just maybe a little bit more flavor for that as well.\nDevin Ryan: Well, there's a lot there. As you can imagine, we've -- I mean our base case right now is to sell the coins that we mine as we mine them. But it obviously is something that we should think about in terms of buy, sell, hold. And we have -- but our base case plan is to sell as we mine them, that's the way we looked at the model to date. But obviously there's flexibility there. In terms of whether it accelerates or not, the disposition, it's really a valuation issue. I mean when you look at some of the other public comps that don't stack up, I think, as well as we do, the valuations are astounding. So I don't know whether it -- what it does to our timeline on holding. It really is -- it's hard to know.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Galanti from Stifel.\nFrank Galanti: I wanted to dig into the P&A business a little bit. And kind of ask about the -- if there's been any progress on acceptance of the part from the broader community. I guess specifically, how many parts have been sold and how many have been put into your engines so far? And then, how many engines have you repaired in the Montreal facility and what percentage of that has been yours?\nJoseph Adams: So I don't have actual specifics on every one of those questions. But we have -- in the Montreal facility, everything that we've inducted is ours. So it's not for third parties. So we're using that for our own. Our own assets are in there. And I believe there have been like 30 engines inducted, something like that. I can get -- we can get you an exact number on that. But those are all our engines. The PMA, we have ordered sets, I think we ordered 10 sets of the vein. So -- and those -- I don't know if any of those have yet been installed. I mean we have the -- we received them, say, a month ago, and we're planning the installation of those as we have outlook for the rest of the year in terms of shop visits. So I don't know, there are a couple of other airlines that have also ordered those parts from Chromalloy. And I don't have the exact status as to where -- I know one of them has been installed, but I don't know the status of all of the deliveries so far. And what was the other?\nFrank Galanti: No, I think you got most of it. I guess just following up on that, the Montreal facility, you said roughly 30, directionally is fine. But the intention for that is over time to have third-party engines in there, correct? In addition to your own?\nJoseph Adams: Well, when you say third party, I mean we would be -- so the inventory at modules that we have are all in Montreal, they're all 43 our engines. So those are -- so we're not managing shop visits for other people at that facility. Those are our engines that we own.\nFrank Galanti: Okay. That's helpful. And then kind of switching gears a little bit to the Jefferson facility. With the pipeline completed and a little bit of progress potentially up north and with the DRU, do you have like a base case long-term profitability outlook for that asset, right, with several hundred million dollars invested, I guess, what do you look at as like a base and upside case for what those assets could realistically earn?\nJoseph Adams: Well, I think we've indicated in the past, we believe based on the assets we have today, we could generate $150 million of EBITDA out in the future. And this year obviously we projected a ramp such that we would be exiting the year at 80. So then it's a question of how you layer in that incremental business and when does it kick in, in 2022 or 2023. How do you -- what's the ramp on that? We don't -- we haven't given a specific quarter-by-quarter estimate on that.\nFrank Galanti: Okay. No, those general numbers are fine. And one last question, if I could. Can you give us an update on CapEx needs for the company outside of additional engine purchases, right, that $170 million LOI, what CapEx is needed to kind of keep the aviation business operating? And how does that compare? So like how does this year, kind of a weird year, compared to a more normalized environment? And then what additional CapEx is needed at the other 3 infrastructure projects?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So one way we've talked about maintenance CapEx is if you were to do the shop visits for every engine that we own, when it's due to be done, which is not something you necessarily have to do. We estimate that to keep that fleet running permanently would be about $50 million per annum of investment per year. So think of maintenance CapEx on the existing aviation assets as roughly $50 million. The second part of it is the capital expenditure programs we had for Long Ridge, La Pano and Jefferson are really behind us. So other than new contracts that we would get, we don't really have significant CapEx at those investments today. But we're hoping we will have CapEx. That's not a bad thing. It's just we would only do it to expand and grow at this point. And obviously, the biggest one would be if we expand Repauno with additional, say, for instance, 3 million barrels of storage, which is what we're sort of our target number of underground granite storage caverns, that would be another $300 million of capital. But we believe that we could generate $150 million of EBITDA from that. So that's the biggest one that is out there remaining, but it's not committed at this point.\nFrank Galanti: And I guess just on Long Ridge, on the bitcoin investment, what's the CapEx requirements for the various projects, like the 20 million -- sorry, 20 megawatt power. How much do you need to put in mining equipment to\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nJoseph Adams: About $70 million, I think. So the first 2 million -- first 2 megawatts represents about, I think, 630 machines, and they're about 11,000, 12,000 today, they're a elevated price. So if it's roughly about $7 million for this investment that we're making in August. And it would be 10x that if we wanted to go to $20 million. And we also have a -- we have a 50-50 partner at Long Ridge, so we'd expect that to be halved.\nOperator: We have a question coming from the line of Robert Salmon from Wolfe Research.\nRobert Salmon: So just to piggyback on the discussion in terms of Bitcoin. Can you give us a sense of what the sensitivity is to changing in bitcoin prices to what kind of FTAI's annualized EBITDA would be if you're thinking whether you want to talk about the two or talk about the 20, just so we can get a sense of how that would impact our models if we see prices gyrate either upwards or downwards.\nScott Christopher: Yes. So I could speak to that. Yes. So just if we want to take a sensitivity of, let's call it, 10% a year price -- whether this is an increase or decrease, it's about call it $12 million of impact, EBITDA impact in either direction on the 20 megawatts. So I think Joe touched on the -- at today's bitcoin prices, it's about a $45 million per year EBITDA increase of 20 megawatts. And so if you move bitcon price up or down, let's call it $12 million a year of EBITDA impact.\nRobert Salmon: That's really helpful. And I guess the other kind of real quick follow-up that I had is with regard to the aviation expectations for the second quarter, can you give us a sense of what you have built into the model from a maintenance revenue perspective? That's obviously been really depressed the past couple of -- the past two quarters. As well as kind of the other revenue contributions from the JV just so we -- if we're seeing a better underlying demand environment just so we can kind of better sensitize our models for either upside or downside there.\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So the maintenance activity, we're seeing a big uptick in maintenance in flying hours in April. So call it, what, probably 30%, 40% increase in maintenance revenue from Q1 to Q2. And that's just April, which we don't know obviously the rest of the quarter yet. And then what was the second question? The JV contribution.\nRobert Salmon: I was just curious how much, the contribution from maintenance versus other revenue. But that kind of gives me enough of a sensitivity there. I really appreciate the time and follow-up, guys.\nJoseph Adams: Yes. It's probably order of magnitude $10 million or so from that in Q2. Up from negligible in Q1.\nOperator: I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn it back to Mr. Alan Andreini for any further comments. EQAA\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Patricia. And thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q2.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Alan. To start, I'm pleased to announce our 24th dividend as a public company and our 39th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on May 25 based on a shareholder record date of May 14. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD, or funds available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2021 was $47.2 million compared to Q4 2020 of $46.2 million and Q1 2020 of $72 million. FAD was $14.4 million in Q1 2021 versus $54.2 million in Q4 2020 and $96 million in Q1 2020. On a normalized basis, excluding sales proceeds and nonrecurring items, Q1 2021 FAD was $9.8 million compared to $35.7 million in Q4 2020 and $67.4 million in Q1 2020. During the first quarter, the $14.1 million FAD number was comprised of $60.6 million from our aviation leasing portfolio, negative $3.8 million from our infrastructure businesses and negative $42.4 million from corporate and other. Now turning first to Aviation. Q1 EBITDA for Aviation of $61 million was a slight improvement from Q4, as we expected. But also as we expected, we are seeing a meaningful uptick in activity in April and expect Q2 Aviation EBITDA to exceed $80 million. As an example, we have signed 20 new leases for CFM56 engines, of which 8 have already been delivered in the last few weeks. 75% of our fleet is 737NG and A320 CO aircraft and engines, which are flown mostly in domestic shorter-haul markets, which are poised for strong rebound by Q3 of this year with many airlines planning flight schedules that are equal to or greater than Q3 of 2019. And 20% of our fleet is operating in the cargo markets, which continue to experience record high demand. Thus, our fleet is extremely well positioned for the recovery. Yes. We have a lot of information. We timed the launch on Monday to sort of which the big Orlando maintenance and repair conference started on Tuesday. So that was intentional. And so as part of a marketing -- initial marketing effort, we were with all of -- a lot of the right people to be in front of and a very good response from the target group. And the target group is primarily going to be 3 different categories. It will be aviation maintenance procurement folks who buy and manage the parts supply and the engine things that are bought from outside for their maintenance businesses. And the modules simplifies their life in a lot of ways. So a very positive response from some very big airlines. So big airlines who, in some cases, have their own maintenance shops. So it illustrates the degree they're looking at cost savings as well as capital efficiency. So that was positive. So we -- when you talk about domestic, are you talking about U.S.? Or are you talking about domestic markets around the world? So we're about, as I mentioned, at 70% -- 75% of our fleet is A320 COs and 737 NGs, which are really domestic airplanes. So 75%. And we've been consciously targeting that market, and we're going to -- that's likely to keep growing. The rest of our fleet is in the cargo market. So it's really between -- those are our primary focus, and those are 2 of the best markets in aviation right now. So we're heavily concentrated on domestic, which we like. And what we're seeing is what we thought is there's still a fair amount of inventory and green time available out there that airlines can continue to use before they do shop visits. So shop visits are being deferred. But airlines are looking ahead and saying, \"Look, if I'm going to fly my fleet all out in Q3 of this year and maybe Q4 and Q1 next year because there's a lot of pent-up demand. They're going to run out of capacity fairly soon in terms of engines available. And airlines are notoriously not good at planning.  So they're starting to -- so as I mentioned, we've put out a number of engines on lease, and I think some of those are to carriers that were coming out of restructuring and were coming out of bankruptcy in some cases who need lift and don't have a lot of options. And then the next group is going to be airlines that realize that pretty soon they're going to run out of engines. And what they're doing now is lining up, we're negotiating lease agreements, WE'RE negotiating -- they're going through inventory, they want availability, they would like engines on their facility available. So they're starting to get ready for the one they're going to need to lease engines. And there are some RFPs coming out with some airlines looking to specify they want 10 or 15 engines. These are bigger airlines available. So they're seeing it, and we're starting to plan. And so that's kind of the second wave. And then the third wave is really when you use up all the green time. And that, I think, will be Q4, Q1 of, call it, Q1 of 2022, where people have to start doing shop visits again in good number.  And that is -- there's a fair amount of lead time because if you want to get into a shop, you have to order parts, you have to get a slot. And so that takes advanced planning. And that's, I think, where our module factory really fits in extremely well because if you only need to shop -- if an engine only needs work on the LPT, you don't want to put the entire engine in the shop and wait for the LPT to be fixed. So doing a swap is really very, very efficient. And as I say, it's disruptive to the way it's done now because people don't do it that way. They think if everything is that's my engine, so don't give me a different module, but it's changed. Airlines themselves do it. And I think the rest of the industry is going to get there very quickly. Yes. Well, we didn't really expect much out of Q1, as I mentioned in the last call, and that has proved to be true because it just restrictions were heavily in place in Q1, as you know, but they're now opening up and everybody's planning for refining. So we're still of the view that the $450 million for 2021 is achievable. And the components were roughly, I think, it was $320 million from the existing portfolio, $80 million from new investments and $50 million from the 3 JV, the partnerships with Chromalloy, Lockheed Martin and AAR. And so it's obviously going to be heavily back-end loaded. So a big jump in Q3 and Q4, which makes sense given what I was just talking about. So we believe that that is -- that still our view is for the year. And then on infrastructure, also I think the $50 million is very achievable.  We've got -- as I mentioned, we've got good initiatives now at Repauno with lots of activity around natural gas liquids, and we're sold out for the summer. And I think that's just going to build, the momentum is going to build there, and we'll come up with new ways to make money on the fact that we're now doing business with lots of different counterparties. Long Ridge starts firing, first fire this month or May and turns on in August. So that will start contributing. And Jefferson, very helpful about the volumes picking up as well as landing one or more big contracts here in the next couple of months. Yes. Well, I'll take the first, and then I'll let Bo talk about the equipment. But the -- in terms of the cost of power, I mean, we've looked at a lot of these companies that are starting up and converting coal power plants and other older assets that are being repositioned, and we think we have, by far, we the lowest cost. And it's several different categories, but the -- and we are already vertically integrated. So years ago, we decided to go develop our own gas. So we're actually vertically integrated back to the gas in the ground and no one has that capability, which means we think our cost of power on the first 20 megawatts is about $12 a megawatt hour.  So that is far lower than we may have seen, and I think far lower in reality than most people because a lot of people are ignoring costs that they just -- are convenient to ignore. So I think we've got 12. And one of the reasons why the first 20 megawatts is interesting to us and sort of got us thinking is that our power plant is going to be rated 485 megawatts by the manufacturer. So initially, that's the most amount of power you can sell under the capacity auction. So you can get paid for capacity without ever using it. And it's only the rated amount we can get paid for. Until there's a couple of years of operating data, you can't really upsize that 485, but we can actually produce 505 megawatts. So the first 20 megawatts is the cheapest electricity. Now it's just marginally only -- the only thing we pay for is the cost of fuel. So that's what got us thinking and gives us sort of the lowest cost of power. But beyond that, we had another -- was it 40 megawatts that we never contracted. Yes. So 457 is under these long-term contracts, which is like 94% of production. And so we have another 40 megawatts or 30 megawatts that we could use without terminating any of our existing contracts. That -- the plan was just to sell that into the merchant market. And then thirdly, if we wanted to go beyond that, we have the right under our long-term offtake agreements to terminate those contracts under make-whole provisions. So think of it like an interest rate swap that if the market moves, you just have to be able to replace. The counterparty has to go out in the market and replace what they had with us with someone else. And right now, because of the way the power markets have moved, they actually would -- if we elected to terminate those contracts and under the  provisions, the counterparty would owe us money. So quite an interesting dynamic. And it's a one-way op.  So we have the right to terminate, but the counterparty does not have right to terminate. So -- and we structured it that way deliberately so we could find other off-takers and then immediately replace those with higher behind-the-meter users. So really lots of -- I mean, we have tremendous amount of flexibility to grow at very, very attractive prices. We have the most efficient turbine in the world, the highest heat rate is the 7HA.02, which is what we're using. So I don't think anybody in the world has got that sort of firepower against what we can. So as obviously, the markets become more competitive and people are putting more resources towards it, it's going to be the lowest cost provider is going to win. So that's where I think we have a -- and we're more vertically integrated than anybody in the business that we know of. Bo, do you want to talk about the machines? And there are 100 terahash per second or 110 for the , right. Yes. Yes. So I think what we've done is we've moved more towards the CFM56 engine, which I think now is about 50% of our total investment. So that's probably up from maybe 30% prior to this period. And we have a couple of other deals that we're still working on that we think will add to that and grow that. And then we've also increased our cargo business. So I think that where you've seen the decrease has been in 767 passenger business we had, and some 757 passenger. And so I would say those 2 have gone down in the CFM56 and cargo have gone up. And so that's strategically, I think, where we've been -- we decided really 2 years ago to start doing that and then accelerate it with the pandemic. And then on top of that, what we've expressed is that we want -- not only do we want to earn 25% EBITDA on invested aviation capital, but we want to develop revenue and EBITDA from other services that are not tied to owning assets.  Think of the Chromalloy, Lockheed Martin and AAR, which we say we think we can earn $50 million this year. And that number on the upper bound is somewhat unlimited in that. And I think the -- we talked the last time about how do you accelerate that and you get airlines to basically let us outsource the maintenance of their CFM56 fleet. And I think that the module factory is one of those moments where you say, that's how we do it. That's exactly, that's the mechanism. And it isn't that complicated. And it allows airlines to sort of use that service on an ad hoc basis as they want without going through some major RFP process that involves the OEM and 10 other people. So you can deal with solutions that save the maintenance department a lot of money. And it's very accessible, easy to use, allows them to be flexible in how they use PMA, for example, that's not sort of in the face of anybody. So it's the solution to what we were looking for. So I think that number is unbounded. I really do. Yes. We have a point of view, and we've been engaged with both the Canadians who are looking for support. So I think it is an interesting dynamic. And never some -- it changes too. So as you think about the different permutations and options. But I think that it's going to work out better for us. I think we've gotten a very good dialogue. I mean it's amazing how quickly how they return your calls and things like that. So it is -- we are focused on sort of developing a long-term flow of products from the Canadian market by rail. And that probably involves the DRU. There's one that's being built, that's about to be finished. And then there's a couple more that are being planned. And so we're having good dialogue with both of them.  And I ultimately think if they have a -- if there's a Canadian carrier that has a through rate all the way to Beaumont, that that's good for us and good for the customers. And also, it might enable us to make sure that there is no -- there's no way that we get cut out either. And so you get most favored nations no matter what happens. So I think we have our thoughts together. I think it's going to be good for us. I think the dialogue around the plans are much accelerated and much more open maybe than they were before. And it's a multiparty dialogue too, because not only are we talking to the K and railroads, where we're talking to the Exxons and Motiva who are impacted and also thinking about it. So it's fun, I think. And we also -- Exxon has a big move. We do a lot of -- we're doing like 30,000, 35,000 barrels a day to Mexico for Exxon, and that KCS is the carrier. So that's going to be impacted. So there's a lot of things going on, but I do think it's -- ultimately, it's usually good for the shippers. Yes. So it's -- that's another area of a lot of focus and interest because, for instance, last week, we were talking about Repauno in New Jersey. And I think there's 4 government grant programs that we're looking at right now that potentially we could apply for and could involve grant money. So that's a good example. There is one at Long Ridge, which we already have, and I think we can supplement that as well. And yes, there's going to be a lot of -- I mean, as the plan starts to take shape, there's obviously some key elements to. A lot of it is green-focused. So that's going to be something we're thinking about. We've got a number of initiatives on new projects around that, around ammonia, around hydrogen, around plastics recycling. So yes, I think it's great because you do have to have projects that are semi-ready. They're not all going to be shovel ready. But if you have something with semi-ready, it's so much easier to get money than if you're in the permitting phase and you have to do an . That's like 4 years. So I think it's -- I think we're going to figure out. There's going to be some good things we're going to be able to tap into. Yes. But I'm pretty sure we're going to get some -- I mean, I remember at Rail America, we got, I think like $300 million of government grant money over a 7-year period. So it was huge. And there are projects that come up that you never expect. So it's going to have an impact. There's, I mean, trillions of dollars invested, and I think we're going to -- it's going to be beneficial. I don't think so. I mean we've started thinking about that. Obviously there's very little to look at yet in terms of specifics. It's mostly concepts. But so far, setting up the U.S. C-Corp is not anything that -- it might be that instead of a 21% rate, you pay 28%, but everybody is going to be in the same boat. And if there's a minimum tax, maybe you don't get to shelter as much income. So -- but it still makes it -- it's still a better structure for us to get rid of K-1s, and that's something that we are looking at, and it's on the target list of things to do. And hopefully, we'll be able to do something at the end of -- by the end of this year, but that's -- we're working on it. And I don't see any impediments. Sure. Well, if you do the math, it's going to be over $100 million for each of the Q3 and Q4. So that's -- it's pretty simple. How much, we're thinking, obviously Q3 historically has been one of the biggest quarters and that's where you can high utilization, and we can get -- everything is moving. But I also think that this year I expect to be somewhat different in that you can't -- I mean, people have a lot of trips that they haven't taken for the last 15 months, and you can't take 10 trips in a week.  So I think there's going to be a rollover. And the seasonality I think in this year will probably be less than it has been historically and that people will be traveling in Q4 and Q1 to see their relatives or their customers, their friends or just to get out of wherever they have been. So I think that the flying levels are going to -- should be sustained, I think more so than they have been in the past. So that's kind of the rough guidance. So we're expecting a good fourth quarter as well. Yes. I think that some of the initiatives could -- there's a little bit of a flywheel effect that you get bigger as you go. And you might do more part out and more trading in the fourth quarter than we have in the third quarter. Because in Q3, you want to use everything you've got. People will be hoarding. And Q4 will probably be more trading opportunities. But I think it will be better than any other year, but it's -- they're comparable, I think. Yes. We have -- it is on the list of priorities, things to do. And I think we have a couple of other items we need ahead of that. But then, I believe it will be a fairly top of the list, and hopefully we get something done by the end of this year. That would be my personal goal. Not a stake in the ground yet, but it's a goal that I think is something we all agree we want to do it. Yes, they are. Quite a good commercial response. And I think it gets to the -- what we always felt was that before you are in operation, people are inherently skeptical and not willing to commit because they've seen too many projects that didn't complete. So the big step for us was in January, loading that first vessel, being in service. And now we're basically, we've got 30 ships. We're going to be very, very busy for Q2 and Q3, which is seasonally the very, the strong market for propane and butane. But the number of PDH plants being built around the world and the volume of export of natural gas liquids continues to grow. And we are really the only other terminal, the Marcus Hook, on the East Coast of the United States.  So I think the commercial response has been great. So now it's about how do we grow -- how do we expand our capacity because as you point out, we will be -- our slots, our dock will be occupied pretty much fully in second and third quarter. So then the next expansion is going to be a dock 2 and additional underground storage. And we're in the process of getting both of those permitted. So that's the sequence. I think once we have -- this summer's over, I think our plan is to go to offtakers and try to get multiyear commitments from them by the end of this year for that additional capacity. And also the other thing we're looking at, right now we're primarily going to be rail served. And so we're also looking at other options for connectivity, meaning pipes. So that would be another big jump up in terms of capacity and efficiency. Yes. But you can't -- you couldn't do a module swap on wing, but you can do certain repairs on wing. I mean we're looking at -- and doing more of them is sort of very efficient. So there are partnerships we're talking about now to do -- to provide that on-wing service. That would give us really a more -- it just expands our portfolio of things we can do to save everyone's money. In terms of a module swap in a full shop is that you're talking about the difference in time is probably between 6 months for a full shop visit versus under 30 days for a module swap. So you can go -- you can show an airline, and we've done this in million dollars of cost savings just from that, the time savings. So there's a huge amount of money involved in savings through people figuring out how to use this service. And we today have 43 modules in inventory. So it's not like you're going to a store that's about to open and say, do you have anything or can I preorder. It's like we have it. So the savings are going to be -- people are going to learn and then they experiment and they say, \"Well, I could do that.\" And it's -- we think it's going to be quite a big thing. It's a good question. The -- I mean, typically, when you have these severe downturns, I mean, the answer is we think there will be a very good market for investing in additional assets and particularly assets that are off-lease because that is something that's very tough for -- anybody with a portfolio doesn't want to have more assets off lease. That's really where I think our primary opportunity will -- has arisen and will arise. And typically, when you get a severe downturn at the bottom and everybody knows here in the worst times, no one wants to sell. And so there are some great deals, and we've picked up a few, and we've bought some. But generally, the volume is not very significant because nobody's -- people are not that stupid.  They know it's -- this is not a good time to sell. But as markets start to recover and prices have moved up, and they already have, I think, a little bit. So if they were down 40%, now they're down 30%, then I think you start to see a lot more volume. And so I think we'll see a number of cleanup trades where people are saying I've got 10 aircraft off lease, I just want to get rid of them. And that is starting. So I think we're going to -- and you also still have airlines looking at fund going to phase out of my older assets and buy newer assets, then I'll do a sale leaseback. So I think the market opportunity is going to be good because of that. It's not the rock-bottom steals that we might have seen in 2020, but it will be good prices that have a lot of upside, and I think it will be more volume. Well, we've -- historically, we've invested between $300 million and $500 million in assets a year. I would suspect we'll be in that range, potentially higher, but that's more episodic. It's harder to project. And maybe by the end of this year people will be doing more of these cleanup trades, as I said. So I think that that's still a good number to plan with. Yes. The goal is to get 5- to 10-year contracts. And the first few deals we did were shorter because we wanted to get -- the first deal we did with Exxon was a 3-year deal on refined products. Then we built 6 pipelines, and we didn't really have much of a commitment. Now we're talking about extending those terms, as I said, between 5 and 10 years and adding a lot of volume to it for contracts between 5 and 10 years. Motiva, we did -- the first deal we did on the storage thing. They contracted for 1 million barrels of storage. And the deal is structured so that if we never built the pipeline, the term on the storage was 3 years, but when we complete the pipeline, those storage contracts changed from 3 years to 5 years. So that's exactly what they wanted.  They wanted the pipe be built because that's more efficient for them to save them money. So I think that's the goal, is 5- to 10-year contracts. There's obviously -- sometimes you'll do a shorter deal to get to get in and get started and then look for growth, which usually happens. I mean that's -- the beauty of this business is usually people go -- they add things. They don't take things away once you're wired in and once you're set up. The other market that we're still -- Canadian market has been an on and off market, and it's sort of not ideal because you don't want to just be moving barrels when the ARB is open. So the key to that I think is the DRU.  The DRU makes it a ratable flow. And if people invest in hundreds of millions of dollars in the DRU, it can only move by rail. So there I think you can get 10-year contracts. And there is one that's been built that had a 10-year contract, and we think more will be built. So ideally, I'd like to transform that Canadian move into a 10-year fixed contract which I think is doable. And I think we're closer to that than ever before. No. It's obviously -- yes, if we have -- we had $60 million in Q1, let's call it, more than $80 million in Q2 as you're close to $150 million, you get to $450 million, that's $300 million. So you've got to come up to $300 million in the back half of the year. That is correct. No, no. Yes. Yes, it hasn't really changed. Obviously, we're looking to maintain a 2:1 coverage. And towards the back half of this year with the numbers we're looking at, we would be greater than that. So we would potentially -- that would put us in a position where we'd be looking for a dividend increase. So we haven't changed our philosophy on the dividend. So I don't have actual specifics on every one of those questions. But we have -- in the Montreal facility, everything that we've inducted is ours. So it's not for third parties. So we're using that for our own. Our own assets are in there. And I believe there have been like 30 engines inducted, something like that. I can get -- we can get you an exact number on that. But those are all our engines. The PMA, we have ordered sets, I think we ordered 10 sets of the vein. So -- and those -- I don't know if any of those have yet been installed. I mean we have the -- we received them, say, a month ago, and we're planning the installation of those as we have outlook for the rest of the year in terms of shop visits. So I don't know, there are a couple of other airlines that have also ordered those parts from Chromalloy. And I don't have the exact status as to where -- I know one of them has been installed, but I don't know the status of all of the deliveries so far. And what was the other? Well, when you say third party, I mean we would be -- so the inventory at modules that we have are all in Montreal, they're all 43 our engines. So those are -- so we're not managing shop visits for other people at that facility. Those are our engines that we own. Well, I think we've indicated in the past, we believe based on the assets we have today, we could generate $150 million of EBITDA out in the future. And this year obviously we projected a ramp such that we would be exiting the year at 80. So then it's a question of how you layer in that incremental business and when does it kick in, in 2022 or 2023. How do you -- what's the ramp on that? We don't -- we haven't given a specific quarter-by-quarter estimate on that. Yes. So one way we've talked about maintenance CapEx is if you were to do the shop visits for every engine that we own, when it's due to be done, which is not something you necessarily have to do. We estimate that to keep that fleet running permanently would be about $50 million per annum of investment per year. So think of maintenance CapEx on the existing aviation assets as roughly $50 million. The second part of it is the capital expenditure programs we had for Long Ridge, La Pano and Jefferson are really behind us. So other than new contracts that we would get, we don't really have significant CapEx at those investments today. But we're hoping we will have CapEx. That's not a bad thing. It's just we would only do it to expand and grow at this point. And obviously, the biggest one would be if we expand Repauno with additional, say, for instance, 3 million barrels of storage, which is what we're sort of our target number of underground granite storage caverns, that would be another $300 million of capital. But we believe that we could generate $150 million of EBITDA from that. So that's the biggest one that is out there remaining, but it's not committed at this point. About $70 million, I think. So the first 2 million -- first 2 megawatts represents about, I think, 630 machines, and they're about 11,000, 12,000 today, they're a elevated price. So if it's roughly about $7 million for this investment that we're making in August. And it would be 10x that if we wanted to go to $20 million. And we also have a -- we have a 50-50 partner at Long Ridge, so we'd expect that to be halved. Yes. So the maintenance activity, we're seeing a big uptick in maintenance in flying hours in April. So call it, what, probably 30%, 40% increase in maintenance revenue from Q1 to Q2. And that's just April, which we don't know obviously the rest of the quarter yet. And then what was the second question? The JV contribution. Yes. It's probably order of magnitude $10 million or so from that in Q2. Up from negligible in Q1. Thanks."

So just if we want to take a sensitivity of, let's call it, 10% a year price -- whether this is an increase or decrease, it's about call it $12 million of impact, EBITDA impact in either direction on the 20 megawatts. So I think Joe touched on the -- at today's bitcoin prices, it's about a $45 million per year EBITDA increase of 20 megawatts. And so if you move bitcon price up or down, let's call it $12 million a year of EBITDA impact."

In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including EBITDA. The reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements by their nature are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our quarterly report filed with the SEC. Now I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 31st dividend as a public company and our 46th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on March 22 based on a shareholder record date of March 10. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metric for us is adjusted EBITDA. We ended the year strongly with adjusted EBITDA of $123.5 million in Q4 2022, which is up 13% compared to $108.9 million in Q3 2022 and up 22% compared to $101.4 million in Q4 of 2021. During the fourth quarter, the $123.5 million EBITDA number was comprised of $110 million from our leasing segment, $21.7 million from our aerospace products segment and negative $8.5 million from corporate and other. Now let's look at all of 2022 versus all of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $428.1 million in 2022, up 33% versus $322.8 million in 2021. Now turning to leasing. Leasing had a good quarter posting approximately $110 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of $110 million of EBITDA came in at $85 million for Q4, up from $75 million in Q3. With strong demand for assets and the addition of new acquisitions in late 2022, we expect Q1 2023 will continue to grow. We're very confident in leasing EBITDA of $350 million to $400 million for the year excluding gains on asset sales. Part of the $110 million EBITDA for leasing came from gains on asset sales, which also performed well. We sold $102.6 million book value of assets for a gain of $25.7 million. And we remain comfortable assuming gains on asset sales continuing at approximately $25 million per quarter or $100 million for all of 2023. Aerospace products had another good quarter with $22 million of EBITDA. We started these activities a little over a year ago and in the last five quarters have booked approximately $91 million of EBITDA without any contribution from PMA. We see tremendous potential and continue to feel good about generating $20 million to $30 million in quarterly EBITDA and think $100 million plus in 2023 EBITDA remains very doable. We feel confident about this number because we're seeing a rapidly expanding backlog of aerospace products business with other leasing companies, MROs or maintenance and repair organizations and airlines. With that, let me turn the call back over to Alan.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Joe. Michelle, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Sullivan with Benchmark. Your line is now open.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nJoseph Adams: Good morning/\nJosh Sullivan: Just a question on engine availability particularly on the GE56, I think you sold 19 engines in the quarter, purchased 19. What was the mix there? And then what does the GE56 market look like and the constraints for new engine supply?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. It looks very good. The mix we buy is - mostly what we're buying is CFM56 and a lot of what we're selling is Pratt 4000s, CF6-80s and RB211. So we've really been consciously shifting the mix towards CFM56 engines over the last couple of years. And we have a little chart in the supplement, which I think shows how much we've grown that to over - we now have about 330 CFM56 engines between stand-alone engines and aircraft engines. So - and we continue I think going forward to see very good activity on being able to buy engines even in a pretty strong and hot market for aircraft engines. So look, we now have a portfolio or we have negotiations ongoing for various acquisitions that total over 50 engines. Some of them are coming from aircraft that were parked or had been with an airline that went bankrupt. Some are coming out of an airline that just had surplus spare engines. So it's a wide mix. And as I've always said you have the largest fleet of engines in the world, you have over 20,000 of these engines. We continue to believe we'll see numerous good opportunities to grow that number. Certainly I think we'll definitely grow that number this year pretty materially.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nKristine Liwag: Hey, good morning. Joe, I just want to follow up on PMA parts. Can you give us an update regarding certification progress and any feedback from the FAA you've received so far?\nJoseph Adams: Sure. So nothing really new since the last time we spoke. But the first part that was approved, we've installed it in over 10 engines now and there's another airline that's put it in their fleet and operating. So it's performing extremely well. So we'll continue to do that and grow that. The next 4 parts made substantial progress in terms of finalization of manufacturing design, production and testing. And so we expect all 4 of those parts will be submitted for final approval this year around the middle of the year. So they've all sort of are progressing on individual timelines, but they're all targeting that same goal. And so if history is a guide, we should have a full portfolio of products available for 2024, which is very exciting.\nKristine Liwag: Yes, that is. And then, Joe, can you just remind us once you get all these 5 PMA parts fully certified, how much in dollar savings do you think you could extract from doing that versus buying from the OEM catalogs in the aftermarket?\nJoseph Adams: It's over $2 million per shop visit, our cost for those parts versus OEM list. And OEM list prices, as you're probably aware, went up significantly last year on November 1. And that's today without further increases. If you look forward over the next few years, you could very well - if OEM list prices continue to go up high single digits, our inflation - our escalator is capped at 3% so the gap will get bigger and bigger. If you look out 4 or 5 years, it's over $3 million per shop visit.\nKristine Liwag: Great. Thanks for the update, Joe. And looking forward to see the announcements when you get them certified.\nJoseph Adams: We are too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Giuliano Bologna with Compass Point. Your line is now open.\nGiuliano Bologna: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. It's great to see some great performance on the operating side. One thing I was curious about moving to the Module Factory, I was curious if there's a rough sense of how many modules you're able to sell in 2022 and then to get a rough sense of how much that could grow in 2023?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. That's a great question. So last year all of 2022 we sold 100 modules approximately and it was divided amongst 25 different customers, unique customers. It was a mix of asset owners and airlines and MROs. So it's a nice balance and sort of it touches the entire ecosystem of users of that engine, which is what we've always liked. So if you think about it, 4 modules per customer is not a big number and it really represents a lot of these users were basically testing the product and trying it out to see if they like it. And so everyone that's been a customer of the Module Factory is becoming a repeat customer. So we haven't lost any customers and we're picking up new ones all the time. So if you think we can grow 25 - just rough math if we could grow 25 customers to 50 and we can increase the number of modules per customer, the growth opportunity is right in line with what we've been talking about in that you could see upwards of 200 to 400 modules in a year coming in the next few years. For 2023 I would expect to see meaningful percentage growth. What that exactly is I would speculate somewhere in the probably 150-plus range of modules this year and it could go higher than that. We're seeing very strong volumes and activity right now.\nGiuliano Bologna: That's great. Then I guess looking at some of the numbers, it's not broken out perfectly. But based on the aerospace products segment kind of implies you guys will generate somewhere in the range of say $500,000 per module in EBITDA and it seems like that could probably double to close to $1 million with PMA. I'd be curious obviously thinking about 150-plus, that can imply that you guys seriously get to $75 million on the current run rate and PMA could help you double that number definitely the following year without any volume improvements from the number of modules. Is that a good way of thinking about the economics and how that could contribute in '23 and beyond?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. It's a good way of thinking about it. Even without meaningful growth in volume, we'll see big growth in income and EBITDA.\nGiuliano Bologna: That's great. And then one last question around just kind of the core leasing EBITDA and the run rate. You guys obviously closed on a lot of acquisitions during the quarter and I'm assuming you didn't get a lot of contribution from those assets. And even in the past your target was trying to get to a run rate of $90 million to $100 million per quarter for the kind of core leasing EBITDA. I'm curious kind of where you were actually in the quarter with the new acquisitions or where the run rate was, including the new acquisitions?\nJoseph Adams: Well, we're continuing and some of the assets we bought were off-lease so they don't necessarily contribute immediately and we'll continue to do that because we see the best value in terms of purchase prices in off leased assets. So you have to build in a little bit of time to get those up and running. And I would say the market in general is really good for leasing. So airlines are announcing every day they're looking for additional old generation or not new generation assets, the 737NGs and the A320 CO fleets are in tremendous demand because of delays with new manufacturing. So we're seeing very strong demand that is really targeting second and third quarters of this year. I think that's when you'll see the biggest growth as people will be - are lining up assets now to be able to put in their fleet in the second quarter and run very significant schedules in the third quarter. So I think it's shaping up very nicely.\nGiuliano Bologna: That's great. Thank you for answer my question. I appreciate it. And I'll jump back in the queue.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hillary Cacanando with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nHillary Cacanando: Hi. Thanks, Joe. Thank you for the call. Your acquisition of iAero Thrust seems really well timed just given the current environment of tight supply and MRO supply constraints. Could you just go over how the integration process is going and some of the longer-term strategic benefits of the acquisition that you're expecting? Thank you.\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So it's going great. It was very timely. We were fortunate to find the facility in Miami that had maintenance capability for hospital and shop visits and a test cell. And the test cell, as I mentioned, there's only 4 of them that are independent test cells in North American market and one of them is at Lockheed Martin, which we also have a little bit of knowledge out as well. So the test cell is a tremendous asset for us and the business is -there's probably one major customer in that facility that has over 30 engines there. So that's a big opportunity for the business to ramp that up and grow that and also for us to do additional module swaps, which we are fully engaged on as we speak. We've also made some management changes and hires that are terrific. We got some great people. And I think having a physical location for us that we can showcase our ability to store, do quick repairs and module swaps is a terrific marketing tool. So we couldn't be any more excited about it.\nHillary Cacanando: Great. Thank you. And then I guess just regarding the supply chain issues. When you listen to conference calls from Boeing, Airbus, they're all talking about it. Just wanted to get like a high level view, like your view as well of what is the problem and how long is this going to last? I mean do you see the supply chain issues lasting like well into next year or is this something that could be resolved this year? I know there's labor shortages, there's a whole bunch of issues that are contributing to it. But kind of your take on when do you think this could end and if that does - when it does end, what's FTAI's strategy kind of? I mean just obviously this is a fantastic environment, but once things start to be better for the other guys, will there be kind of a strategic change for FTAI?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. It's a great question and it's something we think about and talk about all the time and it has some tremendous benefits for us. But it's a complex problem and I don't think it's going to be solved very quickly and every week we seem to hear about a new problem that no one thought about the prior week. So it's not slowing down, it's actually increasing. And the potential, many people are looking out to the summer when you have a lot of activity that there could be some significant challenges with people to get airplanes in the air because they're waiting on one or two parts and that's a real issue. So I think it's \u2013 and you hear about it from every participant in the spaces. And we've seen it also in our used serviceable material business where we sell used parts and there is particular parts that people just can't get or the lead time is eight weeks. And so that 1 single part could keep an engine in the shop for eight weeks or could keep it from flying. So in that event, part prices have doubled and in some cases are tripled just in a matter of weeks because it doesn't matter the price. If you have an engine tied up for two months, the price of a part is irrelevant, you have to pay whatever it takes. So I think it's getting potentially worse and it could be a critical - it could be a meaningful challenge for people this summer. But with us, I mean that's our whole pitch really is we can get engines up quickly repaired. The QuickTurn concept is instead of sending a whole engine in and waiting for repairs and parts, we could actually swap out a module and have that engine back in service in two weeks. And so having repaired inventory on the shelf is part of our whole strategy and I think it's perfect timing for that. I think the longer-term consequence of this is that we hear a lot of airlines realizing that they cannot rely on a single supplier and be dependent upon a single supplier for anything. So again our business model is like you don't have to, we'll back you up. We're actually offering in some cases where we have perpetual power deals where we lease aircraft and engines, we'll put a spare on the ground in the airlines hangar so they could have access to a spare in case anything goes wrong and have it immediately. So all these challenges and all these things that are popping up, we have solutions and really we've gone from an environment where it felt like everything was working against us to where it feels now like everything is working for us.\nHillary Cacanando: Great. Thanks, Joe. That was pretty insightful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Frank Galanti with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nFrank Galanti: Yeah, great. Hi, Joe. I wanted to start on the leasing side. So when I look just sort of on a macro level based on IATA data, domestic available seat kilometers are down still 16% from 2019 levels. And so to that point, there's still a large area under the curve of engines or cycles that just weren't used due to the pandemic. Doesn't that imply that there is a significant number of engines sitting on the sidelines that can sort of be used as incremental planes start flying again and shouldn't that ultimately push utilization down and yields down at least in the near term?\nJoseph Adams: No. I mean first of all, I think that domestic narrowbody flying is globally at or above 2019 levels right now. So I think that with China reopening, that has -- China was a big negative on that number globally. But now that they've reopened, they're back to 2019 levels and actually I saw something that said February schedules in China were like up 10% from 2019. So that market has snapped back and globally the U.S. is above, I think United just said this week that they're planning to be above. The domestic business is up 30% and corporate - leisure business is up 30% and corporate is 100% of what it was pre-COVID. So that's the first thing. There is still surplus aircraft that have been out of service and I think the number of - I always look at the number of parked airplanes by type. So if you look at the 737 and A320, it's still a little bit above 10% and that's always been a key level. When you go below 10% and I think the lowest it's ever been is probably 3% or 4%, it starts to get very tight. So we're still working through some of that and most of that has been A320s, which was caused by Europe I think being a little bit slower to recover in the travel market and being a heavy A320 fleet user. On the engine side, it's a very different dynamic because when COVID started, people stopped putting engines through shop visits. And so when you have engines that have green time, airline grabs those, puts them on an airplane and flies them until they need a shop visit and then they park it. So you don't have - in particular if you look at the CFM56-7B market, which is the engine that flies on the 737 fleet, there's virtually no availability right now for that engine. So all the green time was used up so even though there's engines parked or the aircraft parked, those parked aircraft might have had their engines removed months ago and flown. So it's a very - that's one of the things I like about the engine market is it's self-correcting on supply very quickly and that once you stop doing shop visits, you use up a lot of capacity and the supply drops roughly 15%, 20% a year.\nFrank Galanti: Okay. That's really helpful. Shifting over to aerospace. You've been out there talking about a 2- to 4-year plan on the aerospace business reaching $500 million of EBITDA. I think first, can you sort of lay that out what that plan is? But sort to my question, let's say we get to the end of that 4 year plan we get to 2027, why wouldn't you hit that $500 million target? Why wouldn't you get there?\nJoseph Adams: I think it's just execution. We have to execute otherwise the market is there and the market environment is very helpful for, as I mentioned, what our products are and what we can do for airlines to save them money. We basically provide airlines with cost savings and flexibility and so that to me, is a good product. It's a differentiated product, no one else can offer it. So really it's just can we execute. In terms of the composition of the $500 million of EBITDA, what we talked about recently with you is that if we had 25 Module Factory users last year each doing 4 modules per customer and we're able to double the number of customers to 50 and double the number of modules per customer to 8, that's 400 modules per year and we're currently at 100 and we expect substantial growth this year. So we're on a path that would sort of get there if we continue that. And then profitability, currently we're at about $0.5 million per module and we expect that to double with PMA availability next year so that gets you $400 million of EBITDA from the Module Factory. We expect 50 or so teardowns a year through the AR and we generate about $1 million of profit per aircraft so that's $50 million and then we expect the JV with Chromalloy to generate 50. So that would be the - that's an aspiration. It's not a forecast, but it's something we think about a lot and we keep refining and we feel good about the ability to get there.\nFrank Galanti: Great. Thanks very much.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian McKenna with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.\nBrian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So it's great to see the strong quarter of asset purchases within leasing. But can you give us an update on where LOIs stand today? And then related, how should we think about the baseline level of gross asset purchases annually within the segment moving forward?\nJoseph Adams : Yes. So on the second, I think we acquired over $600 million last year of new assets. Is that right, Angela? And we sold $250 million, $300 million?\nAngela Nam: About 250.\nJoseph Adams : So that's in line with what we've been doing. The asset sales are a little bit higher and as we've talked, we intend to recycle capital more than we probably did years ago. But I think $500 million to $600 million of new acquisitions and $200 million to call it $300 million of asset sales is a reasonable expectation and we're starting off the year pretty strong. We don't - we have a number of deals right now that we have verbal awards and handshakes and that are not fully documented, but that number totals a couple of hundred million and it's very much CFM56 focused. As a matter of fact, I think in total that's over 50 CFM56 engines. So we could see a meaningful growth in the CFM56 engine count in the first half of this year, which is great.\nBrian McKenna: Got it, helpful. And then congrats on the QuickTurn acquisition. I know it's small in the absolute, but there seems to be some pretty meaningful strategic benefits there. I'm curious though how are you thinking about incremental strategic M&A from here? Is there any white space across your business that you would look to fill via acquisitions or any M&A from here would really just be to expand into other adjacent businesses?\nJoseph Adams: We look at the whole ecosystem of the engine and I think that the 1 area where we are currently focused is repairs. So when we teardown an engine, a lot of the parts before they can be put on a new airplane have to be repaired and our spend last year was roughly $50 million so it's a pretty good amount of money. And so we're looking at the repair space and what repairs we do, what repairs other people do and what opportunities there might be for either M&A or organic development or just using our buying power to get better deals. So I'd say that's the current focus. But we are trying to be vertically integrated in every way we can on this engine and there's I think the size of the engine, the fact that it's a modular engine, the fact that the OEMs keep raising prices so nicely gives us - it's just a huge opportunity.\nBrian McKenna: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Zazula with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDavid Zazula: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. To start off real quick, I was hoping you could provide an update on where you are with insurance recovery, what you've recovered so far and what planes are still outstanding?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So a couple of things. The assets we had in Ukraine are 4 aircraft and an engine, we're starting to move the engines out by truck. So we've begun the recovery on those assets and I expect that roughly we'll get about $30 million of assets out this year and we haven't decided fully whether we're going to lease those or sell those. So I think that's a partial solution. I think our book value on those was about $30 million. Our insured value is $70 million. And on that front the insurers have, as you probably are aware of, continued to be very uncooperative. So virtually every asset owner has filed lawsuits and we are not going to be different in that way, we're filing. We have filed one suit already and we're preparing the papers on the second. So we'll see what the judges say. Just it's been a bit frustrating that there is a lack of engagement by the insurers. But we believe that the assets were wrongfully taken and if that's what insurance is meant to cover, then we'll ultimately collect a meaningful amount of that. I think the total claim we filed is $270 million.\nDavid Zazula: That's helpful. And then, Joe, I mean earlier you talked I think about increased velocity of capital through there. Hoping post the QuickTurn facility, you could unpack that a little bit and talk about how that acquisition might impact in a little more detail your capital velocity and intensity?\nJoseph Adams: Well, there's two areas for that. One is in the leasing segment, we've talked about selling more assets and recycling the capital and in particular we've got two deals, one of which is fully closed, another which is in the process of closing; where we're selling the leased asset at a gain and retaining the engine management services contract where we'll make about $1 million per aircraft per year for the maintenance of those engines. And so that's something we want to do more of and we have some other deals in the pipeline. So in terms of the leasing portfolio, as I said, we've typically bought $500 million to $600 million of new assets a year and we expect to sell $200 million to $300 million of those each year. So that generates gains and it also allows us in some cases to keep the maintenance contract, which is a great outcome is to keep the best part of the deal and make a gain. So that's on the leasing side and that will continue. And I think we've got a good sense of how to create value, how to buy things off-lease, put them on lease and then sell them. On the Module Factory, I think we currently operate with about $150 million of inventory and as we grow that business that was doing 100 modules last year, we expect that that will turn significantly faster. So as we grow from 100 to 400, it's not going to go up four times. It should go up very modestly because we expect we can turn inventory. As we get larger and create more options, we'll turn that inventory a lot faster. So I expect that if we were to do 400 modules a year, our expectation is that we would need $200 million to $250 million of inventory to do that to support that and it is facilitated by QuickTurn having the ability to deliver. Swap a low pressure turbine or swap a fan in under two weeks is a product that no one has in the market today. No one can do that.\nDavid Zazula: Great. Thanks. Very helpful, color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sharib Magrabi [ph] with BTIG. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit about the different nature of shop visits at QuickTurn compared to the Montreal facility? And more broadly, could you talk about why are hospital visits becoming more popular?\nJoseph Adams: Sure. Good question. So what we do in Montreal at Lockheed Martin is performance restoration. And so if you think about an engine, that engine is taken to rebuild that engine -- if it has say only a 1,000 cycles left to fly or 100 cycles left or hour supply, you need to rebuild that to north of 10,000 cycles. In order to do that, you literally have to take the entire engine apart and every piece is inspected either visually or by machine and some are replaced, some are repaired and then the whole engine gets reassembled and it takes months and it costs millions of dollars. The current OEM estimate on the CFM56 is $6 million for that engine. This in many cases more than we paid for it in the first place. And that goes up every year because they raise the parts prices 10% or in the last year they raised all the life limited part prices 13%. So that's what you do in Montreal and it has to be done every so often because you have regulations and limits on how long an engine can go before it needs that to be done to it. The second shop visit is - and I recommend you go to our website quickturnengines.com and it lays out the hospital shop visit some of the things we do. And that's often case just something needs to be repaired. A fan blade needs to be repaired, bearings need to be replaced, a low pressure turbine gearbox has to be replaced and those repairs can be done very quickly and you could also do it with a module swap. If you had to replace just the fan, you could swap a new fan on and take the old fan off and do that in 5 to 10 days. So that's - and a lot of airlines have - if they have a large fleet of CFM56 engines, they are expressly trying to avoid that first shop visit that I described that takes months and cost millions of dollars. And in many cases you can do that with hospital shop visits only repairing one section of the engine or bringing one section of the engine up to a higher number of hours and cycles available and keep that engine flying longer. And so the hospital shop visit market today is about 40% of all shop visits and it's projected over the next 6 years to become about 60% of all shop visits. It partially happens as the fleet ages, people are more cannibalizing what they have and less doing full restorations in any event. So that's really the difference and that's what QuickTurn is focused on is that hospital shop visit market. The other reason why it's helpful to have it in a separate facility is that if you run a big MRO shop and an engine comes in, your motivation or your inclination is to find lots of things to fix. So if you have an engine that goes into an MRO, oftentimes you'll end up with a bill that's multiples of what you thought it was going to be because people find things. It's like if you took your car in and you didn't tell the mechanic to inspect the brakes, but they did anyway and they probably say you need a new pair of brakes and who could say no. So it's better to have a hospital shop in a separate facility where the orientation and motivation is to do what the customer wanted to have done and get it back in service quickly obviously safely, but quickly.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's helpful. And great analysis. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Dodd with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nRobert Dodd: Morning, everyone. On leverage if I can, obviously in the presentation I mean you point out that net debt to adjusted EBITDA is about 4.3 [ph] You want to get it to 3, 4. It might be into that range by maybe Q1 or could be at the lower end of that range towards the end of the year even. As you said, you don't need a lot of extra capacity for modules and you've got a lot of cash flow even after the dividend and after maintenance CapEx, et cetera. So what are the other options for you? I mean are you explicitly going to pay down debt, invest even more in assets? But you already gave us some guidance on what you plan to do on that front. So what's the thoughts on utilization of the cash flow that you're going to be generating this year given leverage is coming down on that?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So we've talked we do want to get the leverage to the point where we're a strong DD and I think if we achieve those numbers this year, we will achieve that goal. So that would accomplish that, which I think is great. We are always looking for good assets to buy and CFM56s are, as you can tell, our passion. So that could present opportunities for additional capital. Beyond that, I think we would look to dividends, share repurchases and they're all in the mix.\nRobert Dodd: Thanks on that. I mean on the prospect for say dividend versus buyback, how would you allocate? What would your thoughts be on the relative value of each of those to normalize the allocation priority if it gets to having that much excess capital?\nJoseph Adams: Well, obviously it will be a function of the share price and what we think the prospects are for the business going forward. I think that that will drive. The dividend, you know what you get. The share buyback is a function of the price.\nRobert Dodd: Got it. Thank you.\nJoseph Adams: Yeah.\nOperator: At this time, I show no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Alan Andreini for closing remarks.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Michelle, and thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q1.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 31st dividend as a public company and our 46th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on March 22 based on a shareholder record date of March 10. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metric for us is adjusted EBITDA. We ended the year strongly with adjusted EBITDA of $123.5 million in Q4 2022, which is up 13% compared to $108.9 million in Q3 2022 and up 22% compared to $101.4 million in Q4 of 2021. During the fourth quarter, the $123.5 million EBITDA number was comprised of $110 million from our leasing segment, $21.7 million from our aerospace products segment and negative $8.5 million from corporate and other. Now let's look at all of 2022 versus all of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $428.1 million in 2022, up 33% versus $322.8 million in 2021. Now turning to leasing. Leasing had a good quarter posting approximately $110 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of $110 million of EBITDA came in at $85 million for Q4, up from $75 million in Q3. With strong demand for assets and the addition of new acquisitions in late 2022, we expect Q1 2023 will continue to grow. We're very confident in leasing EBITDA of $350 million to $400 million for the year excluding gains on asset sales. Part of the $110 million EBITDA for leasing came from gains on asset sales, which also performed well. We sold $102.6 million book value of assets for a gain of $25.7 million. And we remain comfortable assuming gains on asset sales continuing at approximately $25 million per quarter or $100 million for all of 2023. Aerospace products had another good quarter with $22 million of EBITDA. We started these activities a little over a year ago and in the last five quarters have booked approximately $91 million of EBITDA without any contribution from PMA. We see tremendous potential and continue to feel good about generating $20 million to $30 million in quarterly EBITDA and think $100 million plus in 2023 EBITDA remains very doable. We feel confident about this number because we're seeing a rapidly expanding backlog of aerospace products business with other leasing companies, MROs or maintenance and repair organizations and airlines. With that, let me turn the call back over to Alan. Good morning/ Yes. It looks very good. The mix we buy is - mostly what we're buying is CFM56 and a lot of what we're selling is Pratt 4000s, CF6-80s and RB211. So we've really been consciously shifting the mix towards CFM56 engines over the last couple of years. And we have a little chart in the supplement, which I think shows how much we've grown that to over - we now have about 330 CFM56 engines between stand-alone engines and aircraft engines. So - and we continue I think going forward to see very good activity on being able to buy engines even in a pretty strong and hot market for aircraft engines. So look, we now have a portfolio or we have negotiations ongoing for various acquisitions that total over 50 engines. Some of them are coming from aircraft that were parked or had been with an airline that went bankrupt. Some are coming out of an airline that just had surplus spare engines. So it's a wide mix. And as I've always said you have the largest fleet of engines in the world, you have over 20,000 of these engines. We continue to believe we'll see numerous good opportunities to grow that number. Certainly I think we'll definitely grow that number this year pretty materially. Sure. So nothing really new since the last time we spoke. But the first part that was approved, we've installed it in over 10 engines now and there's another airline that's put it in their fleet and operating. So it's performing extremely well. So we'll continue to do that and grow that. The next 4 parts made substantial progress in terms of finalization of manufacturing design, production and testing. And so we expect all 4 of those parts will be submitted for final approval this year around the middle of the year. So they've all sort of are progressing on individual timelines, but they're all targeting that same goal. And so if history is a guide, we should have a full portfolio of products available for 2024, which is very exciting. It's over $2 million per shop visit, our cost for those parts versus OEM list. And OEM list prices, as you're probably aware, went up significantly last year on November 1. And that's today without further increases. If you look forward over the next few years, you could very well - if OEM list prices continue to go up high single digits, our inflation - our escalator is capped at 3% so the gap will get bigger and bigger. If you look out 4 or 5 years, it's over $3 million per shop visit. We are too. Yes. That's a great question. So last year all of 2022 we sold 100 modules approximately and it was divided amongst 25 different customers, unique customers. It was a mix of asset owners and airlines and MROs. So it's a nice balance and sort of it touches the entire ecosystem of users of that engine, which is what we've always liked. So if you think about it, 4 modules per customer is not a big number and it really represents a lot of these users were basically testing the product and trying it out to see if they like it. And so everyone that's been a customer of the Module Factory is becoming a repeat customer. So we haven't lost any customers and we're picking up new ones all the time. So if you think we can grow 25 - just rough math if we could grow 25 customers to 50 and we can increase the number of modules per customer, the growth opportunity is right in line with what we've been talking about in that you could see upwards of 200 to 400 modules in a year coming in the next few years. For 2023 I would expect to see meaningful percentage growth. What that exactly is I would speculate somewhere in the probably 150-plus range of modules this year and it could go higher than that. We're seeing very strong volumes and activity right now. Yes. It's a good way of thinking about it. Even without meaningful growth in volume, we'll see big growth in income and EBITDA. Well, we're continuing and some of the assets we bought were off-lease so they don't necessarily contribute immediately and we'll continue to do that because we see the best value in terms of purchase prices in off leased assets. So you have to build in a little bit of time to get those up and running. And I would say the market in general is really good for leasing. So airlines are announcing every day they're looking for additional old generation or not new generation assets, the 737NGs and the A320 CO fleets are in tremendous demand because of delays with new manufacturing. So we're seeing very strong demand that is really targeting second and third quarters of this year. I think that's when you'll see the biggest growth as people will be - are lining up assets now to be able to put in their fleet in the second quarter and run very significant schedules in the third quarter. So I think it's shaping up very nicely. Thanks. Yes. So it's going great. It was very timely. We were fortunate to find the facility in Miami that had maintenance capability for hospital and shop visits and a test cell. And the test cell, as I mentioned, there's only 4 of them that are independent test cells in North American market and one of them is at Lockheed Martin, which we also have a little bit of knowledge out as well. So the test cell is a tremendous asset for us and the business is -there's probably one major customer in that facility that has over 30 engines there. So that's a big opportunity for the business to ramp that up and grow that and also for us to do additional module swaps, which we are fully engaged on as we speak. We've also made some management changes and hires that are terrific. We got some great people. And I think having a physical location for us that we can showcase our ability to store, do quick repairs and module swaps is a terrific marketing tool. So we couldn't be any more excited about it. Yes. It's a great question and it's something we think about and talk about all the time and it has some tremendous benefits for us. But it's a complex problem and I don't think it's going to be solved very quickly and every week we seem to hear about a new problem that no one thought about the prior week. So it's not slowing down, it's actually increasing. And the potential, many people are looking out to the summer when you have a lot of activity that there could be some significant challenges with people to get airplanes in the air because they're waiting on one or two parts and that's a real issue. So I think it's \u2013 and you hear about it from every participant in the spaces. And we've seen it also in our used serviceable material business where we sell used parts and there is particular parts that people just can't get or the lead time is eight weeks. And so that 1 single part could keep an engine in the shop for eight weeks or could keep it from flying. So in that event, part prices have doubled and in some cases are tripled just in a matter of weeks because it doesn't matter the price. If you have an engine tied up for two months, the price of a part is irrelevant, you have to pay whatever it takes. So I think it's getting potentially worse and it could be a critical - it could be a meaningful challenge for people this summer. But with us, I mean that's our whole pitch really is we can get engines up quickly repaired. The QuickTurn concept is instead of sending a whole engine in and waiting for repairs and parts, we could actually swap out a module and have that engine back in service in two weeks. And so having repaired inventory on the shelf is part of our whole strategy and I think it's perfect timing for that. I think the longer-term consequence of this is that we hear a lot of airlines realizing that they cannot rely on a single supplier and be dependent upon a single supplier for anything. So again our business model is like you don't have to, we'll back you up. We're actually offering in some cases where we have perpetual power deals where we lease aircraft and engines, we'll put a spare on the ground in the airlines hangar so they could have access to a spare in case anything goes wrong and have it immediately. So all these challenges and all these things that are popping up, we have solutions and really we've gone from an environment where it felt like everything was working against us to where it feels now like everything is working for us. No. I mean first of all, I think that domestic narrowbody flying is globally at or above 2019 levels right now. So I think that with China reopening, that has -- China was a big negative on that number globally. But now that they've reopened, they're back to 2019 levels and actually I saw something that said February schedules in China were like up 10% from 2019. So that market has snapped back and globally the U.S. is above, I think United just said this week that they're planning to be above. The domestic business is up 30% and corporate - leisure business is up 30% and corporate is 100% of what it was pre-COVID. So that's the first thing. There is still surplus aircraft that have been out of service and I think the number of - I always look at the number of parked airplanes by type. So if you look at the 737 and A320, it's still a little bit above 10% and that's always been a key level. When you go below 10% and I think the lowest it's ever been is probably 3% or 4%, it starts to get very tight. So we're still working through some of that and most of that has been A320s, which was caused by Europe I think being a little bit slower to recover in the travel market and being a heavy A320 fleet user. On the engine side, it's a very different dynamic because when COVID started, people stopped putting engines through shop visits. And so when you have engines that have green time, airline grabs those, puts them on an airplane and flies them until they need a shop visit and then they park it. So you don't have - in particular if you look at the CFM56-7B market, which is the engine that flies on the 737 fleet, there's virtually no availability right now for that engine. So all the green time was used up so even though there's engines parked or the aircraft parked, those parked aircraft might have had their engines removed months ago and flown. So it's a very - that's one of the things I like about the engine market is it's self-correcting on supply very quickly and that once you stop doing shop visits, you use up a lot of capacity and the supply drops roughly 15%, 20% a year. I think it's just execution. We have to execute otherwise the market is there and the market environment is very helpful for, as I mentioned, what our products are and what we can do for airlines to save them money. We basically provide airlines with cost savings and flexibility and so that to me, is a good product. It's a differentiated product, no one else can offer it. So really it's just can we execute. In terms of the composition of the $500 million of EBITDA, what we talked about recently with you is that if we had 25 Module Factory users last year each doing 4 modules per customer and we're able to double the number of customers to 50 and double the number of modules per customer to 8, that's 400 modules per year and we're currently at 100 and we expect substantial growth this year. So we're on a path that would sort of get there if we continue that. And then profitability, currently we're at about $0.5 million per module and we expect that to double with PMA availability next year so that gets you $400 million of EBITDA from the Module Factory. We expect 50 or so teardowns a year through the AR and we generate about $1 million of profit per aircraft so that's $50 million and then we expect the JV with Chromalloy to generate 50. So that would be the - that's an aspiration. It's not a forecast, but it's something we think about a lot and we keep refining and we feel good about the ability to get there. Thanks. Yes. So on the second, I think we acquired over $600 million last year of new assets. Is that right, Angela? And we sold $250 million, $300 million? So that's in line with what we've been doing. The asset sales are a little bit higher and as we've talked, we intend to recycle capital more than we probably did years ago. But I think $500 million to $600 million of new acquisitions and $200 million to call it $300 million of asset sales is a reasonable expectation and we're starting off the year pretty strong. We don't - we have a number of deals right now that we have verbal awards and handshakes and that are not fully documented, but that number totals a couple of hundred million and it's very much CFM56 focused. As a matter of fact, I think in total that's over 50 CFM56 engines. So we could see a meaningful growth in the CFM56 engine count in the first half of this year, which is great. We look at the whole ecosystem of the engine and I think that the 1 area where we are currently focused is repairs. So when we teardown an engine, a lot of the parts before they can be put on a new airplane have to be repaired and our spend last year was roughly $50 million so it's a pretty good amount of money. And so we're looking at the repair space and what repairs we do, what repairs other people do and what opportunities there might be for either M&A or organic development or just using our buying power to get better deals. So I'd say that's the current focus. But we are trying to be vertically integrated in every way we can on this engine and there's I think the size of the engine, the fact that it's a modular engine, the fact that the OEMs keep raising prices so nicely gives us - it's just a huge opportunity. Yes. So a couple of things. The assets we had in Ukraine are 4 aircraft and an engine, we're starting to move the engines out by truck. So we've begun the recovery on those assets and I expect that roughly we'll get about $30 million of assets out this year and we haven't decided fully whether we're going to lease those or sell those. So I think that's a partial solution. I think our book value on those was about $30 million. Our insured value is $70 million. And on that front the insurers have, as you probably are aware of, continued to be very uncooperative. So virtually every asset owner has filed lawsuits and we are not going to be different in that way, we're filing. We have filed one suit already and we're preparing the papers on the second. So we'll see what the judges say. Just it's been a bit frustrating that there is a lack of engagement by the insurers. But we believe that the assets were wrongfully taken and if that's what insurance is meant to cover, then we'll ultimately collect a meaningful amount of that. I think the total claim we filed is $270 million. Well, there's two areas for that. One is in the leasing segment, we've talked about selling more assets and recycling the capital and in particular we've got two deals, one of which is fully closed, another which is in the process of closing; where we're selling the leased asset at a gain and retaining the engine management services contract where we'll make about $1 million per aircraft per year for the maintenance of those engines. And so that's something we want to do more of and we have some other deals in the pipeline. So in terms of the leasing portfolio, as I said, we've typically bought $500 million to $600 million of new assets a year and we expect to sell $200 million to $300 million of those each year. So that generates gains and it also allows us in some cases to keep the maintenance contract, which is a great outcome is to keep the best part of the deal and make a gain. So that's on the leasing side and that will continue. And I think we've got a good sense of how to create value, how to buy things off-lease, put them on lease and then sell them. On the Module Factory, I think we currently operate with about $150 million of inventory and as we grow that business that was doing 100 modules last year, we expect that that will turn significantly faster. So as we grow from 100 to 400, it's not going to go up four times. It should go up very modestly because we expect we can turn inventory. As we get larger and create more options, we'll turn that inventory a lot faster. So I expect that if we were to do 400 modules a year, our expectation is that we would need $200 million to $250 million of inventory to do that to support that and it is facilitated by QuickTurn having the ability to deliver. Swap a low pressure turbine or swap a fan in under two weeks is a product that no one has in the market today. No one can do that. Sure. Good question. So what we do in Montreal at Lockheed Martin is performance restoration. And so if you think about an engine, that engine is taken to rebuild that engine -- if it has say only a 1,000 cycles left to fly or 100 cycles left or hour supply, you need to rebuild that to north of 10,000 cycles. In order to do that, you literally have to take the entire engine apart and every piece is inspected either visually or by machine and some are replaced, some are repaired and then the whole engine gets reassembled and it takes months and it costs millions of dollars. The current OEM estimate on the CFM56 is $6 million for that engine. This in many cases more than we paid for it in the first place. And that goes up every year because they raise the parts prices 10% or in the last year they raised all the life limited part prices 13%. So that's what you do in Montreal and it has to be done every so often because you have regulations and limits on how long an engine can go before it needs that to be done to it. The second shop visit is - and I recommend you go to our website quickturnengines.com and it lays out the hospital shop visit some of the things we do. And that's often case just something needs to be repaired. A fan blade needs to be repaired, bearings need to be replaced, a low pressure turbine gearbox has to be replaced and those repairs can be done very quickly and you could also do it with a module swap. If you had to replace just the fan, you could swap a new fan on and take the old fan off and do that in 5 to 10 days. So that's - and a lot of airlines have - if they have a large fleet of CFM56 engines, they are expressly trying to avoid that first shop visit that I described that takes months and cost millions of dollars. And in many cases you can do that with hospital shop visits only repairing one section of the engine or bringing one section of the engine up to a higher number of hours and cycles available and keep that engine flying longer. And so the hospital shop visit market today is about 40% of all shop visits and it's projected over the next 6 years to become about 60% of all shop visits. It partially happens as the fleet ages, people are more cannibalizing what they have and less doing full restorations in any event. So that's really the difference and that's what QuickTurn is focused on is that hospital shop visit market. The other reason why it's helpful to have it in a separate facility is that if you run a big MRO shop and an engine comes in, your motivation or your inclination is to find lots of things to fix. So if you have an engine that goes into an MRO, oftentimes you'll end up with a bill that's multiples of what you thought it was going to be because people find things. It's like if you took your car in and you didn't tell the mechanic to inspect the brakes, but they did anyway and they probably say you need a new pair of brakes and who could say no. So it's better to have a hospital shop in a separate facility where the orientation and motivation is to do what the customer wanted to have done and get it back in service quickly obviously safely, but quickly. Yes. So we've talked we do want to get the leverage to the point where we're a strong DD and I think if we achieve those numbers this year, we will achieve that goal. So that would accomplish that, which I think is great. We are always looking for good assets to buy and CFM56s are, as you can tell, our passion. So that could present opportunities for additional capital. Beyond that, I think we would look to dividends, share repurchases and they're all in the mix. Well, obviously it will be a function of the share price and what we think the prospects are for the business going forward. I think that that will drive. The dividend, you know what you get. The share buyback is a function of the price. Yeah."

Welcome to the Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.  At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Alan Andreini. Sir, please begin.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Howard. I would like to welcome you all to the Fortress Transportation Infrastructure third quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, the CEO of FTAI; and Angela Nam, the CFO of FTAI. We have posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website which we encourage you to download if you have not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only mode and is being webcast. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including EBITDA. The reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements by their nature are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our quarterly report filed with the SEC. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Adams: Thanks, Alan. I'm pleased to announce our 30th dividend as a public company and our 45th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on November 28, based on a shareholder record date of November 14. Also, please note FTAI successfully completed the spinoff of its infrastructure business on the 1st of August of this year. Historical financial condition and the results of operations related to the infrastructure business prior to the spinoff date have been disclosed under Discontinued Operations within the consolidated financial statements. Now, let's turn to the numbers. The key metric for us is adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was $108.9 million, down 24% compared to $143.7 million in Q2 2022 and up 25% compared to $87.2 million in Q3 2021. The above numbers are for consolidated FTAI which includes both leasing and aerospace products. Starting this quarter, we will be presenting leasing and aerospace products as separate segments going forward. Let's start with leasing. Leasing had a good quarter, posting approximately $96 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of the $96 million of EBITDA came in at $75 million for Q3, down from $87 million in Q2 as expected. The principal reason for the decline was due to the sale of approximately $145 million of book value of assets in Q2 and Q3 attributed to our cargo campaign sales in which we sold 5 aircraft and 30 engines. With very strong demand for assets and the addition of some new acquisitions which we will talk about later, we expect Q4 will rebound. And next year, 2023, we're very confident in leasing EBITDA of $350 million to $400 million for the year, excluding gains on asset sales. Part of the $96 million in EBITDA for leasing came from gains on asset sales which also performed as expected. We sold $64.9 million book value of assets for a gain of $20.6 million. We have more asset sales coming in Q4 to recycle capital invested in some of 2021's larger acquisitions. In addition, we'll continue to make freighter sales to capitalize on the continuing robust freighter market. We're very comfortable assuming gains on asset sales continuing at approximately $25 million per quarter or $100 million for all of 2023. Aerospace products had another solid quarter with $19 million of EBITDA. We started these activities only a little over a year ago and in the last 4 quarters have booked approximately $70 million of EBITDA without any contribution from PMA. We see tremendous potential and feel good about generating $20 million to $30 million in quarterly EBITDA and think $100 million-plus in 2023 EBITDA to be very doable. We feel confident about this number because we're seeing a rapidly expanding backlog of aerospace products business with other leasing companies, MROs, or maintenance repair organizations and airlines. With respect to Q4, we have begun closing the sale of $200 million in assets and have signed letters of intent to purchase $300 million in new assets also in Q4. The net pickup in leasing EBITDA from the new investments minus the give-up from the sales we estimate to be $40 million per annum or $10 million per quarter. Importantly, 2 of these asset sales involved FTAI retaining the engine services contract on behalf of the buyer which should generate $1 million per annum per aircraft or $10 million total per annum of aerospace EBITDA over the remaining lease term of approximately 8 years. After 3 years of macro trade headwinds, we now have macro factors that are greatly helping us. First, OEMs have instituted mostly double digit percentage price increases for parts effective this quarter. And parts price increases creates more opportunity for our cost saving products to increase market share for us. And since service shop visits costs are predominantly parts, the replacement value of our engines goes up correspondingly. Second, many airlines are trying to reduce expensive full engine restorations and instead increase module swaps and light shop visits that do not require disassembly which plays right to our strengths and into our products. Thirdly, delays in new aircraft deliveries are creating scarcity of 737NGs and A320 COs which will drive strong demand for 737NGs, A320 COs and, importantly, CFM56 engines for many years to come. And fourth, industry demand for travel has returned to almost pre-COVID levels. Regarding PMA, or parts manufacturing authorization, there's no change in our planning which includes a full complement of airfoil parts becoming available throughout next year. In summary, it feels like we are finally operating in an environment with strong tailwinds. We managed through the COVID disruptions, followed by Russia-Ukraine and will have our portfolio optimized by this year end. And with demand for air travel surging globally, combined with proprietary cost-saving aerospace products, 2023 is shaping up to be an outstanding year. With that, let me turn the call back to Alan.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Joe. Howard, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator:  Our first question or comment comes from the line of Giuliano Bologna from Compass Point.\nGiuliano Bologna: Congrats on another quarter, great quarter. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be curious, when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m looking at some of the numbers that you just mapped out around asset sales and redeployment of capital into new assets that are happening during 4Q, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling a fair amount more assets than you sold in the last two quarters and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to recognize pretty impressive gains on sale that were even above the range during one of those quarters of the $20 million to $30 million range. Is it fair to assume that the combination of the large asset sales could move you towards the higher end of that $20 million to $30 million range in 4Q? And then kind of as an add-on to that, with the EBITDA take-up and probably some lease-up demand in the portfolio, is it also fair to assume that you can get back within the, call it, $90 million to $100 million run rate during two for core leasing?\nJoe Adams: Yes. So I would say on the gains, yes, it's fair to assume that some of the asset sales we were targeting for Q2 got delayed and have been pushed in -- or targeted for Q3 got delayed and are pushed into Q4. So I do think there's upside over the sort of guided range we have in Q4 just because of that, the sequencing and the timing. So it's shaping up to be a pretty good quarter from an asset sales point of view. On the leasing side, as I indicated, we're very comfortable next year hitting the sort of $90 million to $100 million per quarter. The Q4 will really be a function of the timing of closings and when those occur. So I think it's possible that we can get there. But in today's world, it seems like there's more delays than accelerations and sort of every time you turn around, there's something about a part not available or a maintenance shop can't get something delivered. And so I'm a little hesitant to promise on that just because we're in a world .\nGiuliano Bologna: Hopefully -- the call may have cut out. Hopefully it wasn't on my side. But if the others are still there and it's still working. I'd be curious, I realize it's an imperfect science but with the vote coming up on the merger that would effectively -- that would convert and remove the K-1. One of the topics that's come up in some discussions is index inclusion and how that could impact your shareholder base. I'm curious if you've done any analysis around kind of the low end and the high end of the range of what index buying may need to happen on the back of converting into a PFIC.\nAlan Andreini: Joe, are you there? Did you hear Giuliano\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question?\nJoe Adams: I did, yes. And I gave a long answer which unfortunately it sounds like you didn't hear it. But I'll -- so in terms of asset sales, we have pushed -- some of the deals we expected to close in Q3 got delayed and will end up closing in Q4. So we think there is upside to the sort of typical run rate of what we've been expecting on gain on sale. So I think that you're right. We should be at the high end of that number or potentially even above it, just given the sequence and closing deals is taking a little bit longer than we expect. In terms of the leasing EBITDA, I said we're very comfortable with next year being in that $90 million to $100 million per quarter range. But it's really a function of the timing of the closing of some of these new acquisitions. And in today's world, everything seems to take a little bit longer than expected. It's either a delay on a part or a delay on a maintenance shop which -- so I'm a little hesitant to be able to predict Q4 yet given that item. Now ultimately, these supply chain disruptions are good for us because we have available equipment and engines other people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. But it is a reality of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s world that everything seems to be taking a little bit longer to get done. So I feel good about the total run rate once we get all the assets deployed. Q4 is a little bit variable. Definitely will be up. Question is whether we get to the $90 million or not for the quarter.\nAlan Andreini: Joe, did you happen to hear Giuliano's second question relating to the indexes? Giuliano, if Joe didn't hear that, can you repeat it, please?\nGiuliano Bologna: Yes. I think it was when we lost you, so I'll re-ask those questions quickly. One of the questions that I was curious about was with the vote approaching on November 9 for the reverse merger that will effectively change the corporate structure and remove the K-1 and convert you guys to PFIC. I realize it's imperfect science but one of the topics that's come up is index included and what that could mean just from an index ownership perspective over time. And I'm curious if you've done any analysis or you have any sense of what kind of the low end or high end ranges for how the impact of special index buying from kind of a need to buy perspective as a percentage of the outcome to shares?\nJoe Adams: Yes. We have done some analysis and we have a list of some potential funds that might -- we might get included in. And I think the -- historically, obviously well with Aircastle which Aircastle was very successful at getting included and has a very similar corporate structure to the one we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adopting. So that would bode well. But it is -- there is a qualitative element in all these applications, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not totally sure. But I would say the range is probably between 10% and 30% of our total stock market capitalization should end up in passive funds.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Hillary Cacanando from Deutsche Bank.\nHillary Cacanando: So, for the -- in terms of the insurance recovery, you have mentioned that you are expecting -- previously you had mentioned that you're expecting partial recovery from your insurance claims this year. I just wanted to understand like how much of the -- is that still the case? And if so, how much of the recovery relates to assets in Ukraine that actually may have been destroyed versus how much of the recovery will be for planes that are still operational and still operating in Russia?\nJoe Adams: Yes. Happy to talk about insurance. Just to recap, we have about $290 million of insurance claims on our $125 million of book value of assets that we've filed. And really, as I mentioned before, we've broken it into 3 buckets of the different strategies with each one. The first one is sort of -- I think that would be the most -- the first to pay is the contingent insurance coverage that we have. And that's about $90 million and it's covered mostly engines. The second is Ukraine which is about $75 million. And the third is Russian assets airplanes, mostly airplanes that are lost in Russia, about $125 million. I would say we've made progress on 2 of those 3 categories, namely the contingent coverage and the Ukraine assets. And progress means that we've had a good dialogue and we have a framework of a plan but we don't have a sort of definitive -- enough of a definition of the plan for me to give you a definitive time line, although I am optimistic that that could -- those 2 buckets could resolve in the next 3 to 6 months is my hope. The Ukrainian assets that we were thinking or destroyed may not be and they may be in good shape as far as we can tell. We now have people on the ground. And so we're working on various strategies with respect to those assets, either with insurance or without insurance that we can monetize. But clearly, those are -- that's a priority for us to focus and work on those. And then the Russian assets is a bit frustrating. It's frustrating for the whole industry in that the insurance companies just refuse to engage. And I think you saw AerCap and DAE have filed lawsuits. Ultimately, the good news is that none of the participants are talking again about, well, we canceled the policy and you don't have coverage. Or it's not a loss; it's all about sanctions and obfuscation that I think ultimately will -- they'll run out of excuses and room and litigation forces the issue. So I think that will pay, as I've said from the very beginning but I think it may take the longest of the three\nHillary Cacanando: Okay. Got it. And then my second question is, obviously we're seeing all these supply chain issues affecting the OEMs. And you've also mentioned the cost, the increase in I guess price and cost escalation. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the cost escalation that you're seeing on the engine side and if we could actually see an impact, maybe like the benefit from the maintenance side of the business that you could actually like point to in terms of quantifying the benefit.\nJoe Adams: Yes. So all of our engine maintenance reserve payments are indexed to shop visit costs. and job visits costs are 90% parts. And so if the parts prices just went up 10%, effectively you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting a 10% increase in our maintenance reserve payments. And so that for the CFM, GE, Safran fleet that goes into effect November 1, we had a feeling that was coming. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been looking to acquire more engines this summer and add as much as we can. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re -- I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re well positioned in that. And then that should translate -- that will translate into additional EBITDA for us starting then, starting November.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from Benchmark Company.\nJosh Sullivan: Just kind of following up on that question. As far as the process where FTAI retains the maintenance streams in some of these aircraft sales which aircraft or customer types are most drawn to that arrangement? Or where should we see that process really gain some traction?\nJoe Adams: It's all older CFM56 engines. And the way we're positioning ourselves in the market is our view is for CFM56 engines, the first 10 to 12 years is covered by the OEM under power by our maintenance agreements for the most part. And so we're not going after that business. It's not really available. But once the engine has passed maybe the second shoppers that are -- or looking at the second shop is about year 12 or 14, a lot of those maintenance contracts are up for bid and us to acquire. And so what we want to do is use our products and our services to be effectively the OEM for the second half of the life of that engine. And so that's the way we position ourselves with airlines and MRO shops is that we can take over your maintenance activity, much like GE does on the front end. We can save you money and we can totally derisk it for you because you won't have any negative surprise events. You won't have any overruns or surprise expenses to deal with. And in the case of airlines that are looking to phase out the fleet, we can buy the fleet and then provide you a new engine whenever you want it. So we'll provide you liquidity, flexibility and cost savings. So we're finding a very broad appeal for that pitch. It resonates with people, particularly accelerated by the fact that the prices just went up, are going up 10%. And airlines are experiencing a lot of cost inflation and they are looking for every potential way to do it. So I think it is resonating. And I think all of that we're able to do before any incremental savings that might come from PMA which we expect next year will.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. No, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helpful. And then maybe, could you just give us some general thoughts on the current leasing environment maybe by geography? What are you seeing as far as duration or some of the other features on leases that might be changing in this environment?\nJoe Adams: Yes. So a lot of the airlines are now coming saying that they have new orders. They've built their fleet plan around receiving NEOs and MAX aircraft over the next couple of years and they're seeing those delayed. So we're seeing airlines come saying, show me anything you have that in the NG and the CO range where I could add capacity in meaningful numbers. So it's a very, very strong environment. And they're willing to -- typically, those leases are 5 to 6 years in duration. You do from one D check to another. So the term of the agreement is attractive and the quantity that people are looking to get is very broad-based. So I'd say obviously, the only market that is still relatively closed or constrained is China but that's -- they're an outlier. Every other region of the world is really robust. Latin America, as I mentioned previously, we've done a lot of business in Latin America. It's above average growth rates. Middle East, Southeast Asia, very strong. And then Western Europe is -- was probably the latest to recover because of omicron but its capacity is coming back and being added there now again as well. So I think it's a very, very strong market environment. Obviously, Russia's gone forever which is about 5% of market, so it's not that material. But a very good global dynamic.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Joe, appreciate the outlook here. Could you just run us through the set of asset sales and net additions to the portfolio closing out the year? And then I guess the bigger question we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having -- I mean, the outlook here is pretty good but your cash balance is a little bit low. So, how do you expect to manage through liquidity here in the next few quarters?\nJoe Adams: Yes. So I think we had about $70 million of cash at the end of Q3. When you look at the various asset sales and asset purchases, I think we should end up the year potentially with sort of $50-ish million drawn on the revolver. So we have a $225 million revolver that is undrawn at the moment. It's fully available. So that's how we're going to manage liquidity as we have done in the past. So mostly the pluses and minuses, we're adding $300 million of assets and effectively cash flows will receive from the operations as well as the asset sales, it's pretty much -- pretty close to a wash. So we expect to end the year with very little -- with most of the revolver, if not all of it, available going into next year.\nBrandon Oglenski: And I guess, longer term, where do you want to see leverage on the portfolio, especially -- has that changed at all with higher interest rates as well?\nJoe Adams: Not so much to the higher interest rates. What we've communicated to the rating agencies is that A, we want to be BB and B, we want to manage debt to EBITDA under 5x. And if you look at our pro forma -- if we do $550 million to $600 million of EBITDA next year, we'll be under 4x. And I think both agencies, Moody's, S&P and Fitch have all indicated if we do that, we would be either upgraded or sort of -- we'd be in the BB range and that's kind of consistent with where we want to be. So I don't think it's necessarily interest rate driven. We do have some opportunities now. And I think next year, we would look to as a priority to repay some debt with excess cash flow, so bring that net debt balance down and get even lower in terms of the debt to EBITDA and higher in terms of rating. So, I think that's where we're leaning at the moment. And I think part of the program of selling assets and buying assets is to manage so that we're not necessarily adding a lot of capital at this point. We're recycling and picking up EBITDA.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Appreciate that. And then on the greater than the $0.5 billion in EBITDA targets for next year which I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reiterated here, what type of portfolio utilization level do you think you need to achieve to get there?\nJoe Adams: Well, the aircraft, I think generally, we've been over 90% which I think we will be. We've had -- we still have some assets that we've repositioned from Russia-Ukraine that are either to be sold or to be leased. And we added some aircraft like 737-800s this summer which we bought at a very attractive price off-lease. All of those are going on lease this month in October. 2 in October, 1 in November. So those types of -- when I say the portfolio will be optimized by the end of the year, everything we're doing is to get assets redeployed from Russia-Ukraine, or cargo assets that we were targeting for sale, get those sold. So I think by the end of the year, utilization should be -- for aircraft should be 90%-plus. Engines is always -- we've always targeted 50% to 75%. And effectively, utilization is really what drives it. It's the number of hours flown and the total amount of the portfolio. So we've been -- for instance, the last 2 quarters, we've acquired quite a lot of CFM56 engines that are off-lease. So utilization hasn't really gone up in spite of a strong market environment because we've been adding to the denominator. And we will keep doing that because we could see there was a price increase coming and we also think the economics of those engines are extremely attractive. So we would add as many of those as we can. So, I think that the target range is still the same, 50% to 75% on engine utilization. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what -- we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really manage to that. We manage to sort of having the total EBITDA of the portfolio optimized.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brian Mckenna from JMP Securities.\nBrian Mckenna: So the business has clearly navigated some unexpected headwinds over the past couple of years. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious, though, the backdrop today seems like it couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be better. But with the potential for a recession next year or maybe some pullback in related activity, would you think about accelerating asset sales in the near term or slowing the pace of new investments in order to delever the business even more, that way you have more liquidity and excess capital to be more offensive in any slowdown?\nJoe Adams: Well, we've been doing that this year. With the cargo sales, we consciously decided early this year that we felt like the cargo market is maybe as good as it gets and we decided that it was better to be early than late. So I think that was a good decision. And we've sold probably $400 million of cargo assets to do -- to generate capital. But on the flip side, just sitting with cash, given the attractive environment in the CFM56 engine and the substantial competitive advantage we have, that didn't seem like a good idea either. And I think from our point of view, it feels like we already had recessions. We had 2 of them. And the economic -- potential economic recession will have less impact on CFM56 demand than COVID did, for example. So we feel that there's -- even if there is an economic slowdown globally, the demand for those assets and the travel recovery is sort of a bigger driver than the global economy.\nBrian Mckenna: Helpful. And then, I appreciate the color on the insurance claims. But if you were to see some windfall from these claims over the next couple of quarters, I guess what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your number one priority for that capital? Is it paying down some incremental debt and if so which maturities would you look to pay down first? Would you even maybe dividend some of it back to shareholders, or would you put some of it into incremental asset purchases? Just curious how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about that.\nJoe Adams: I think probably repayment of debt. And we'll look at all the various issues. I mean, we've debated as part of the dividend from the infrastructure, we repaid the 2025s which is the next maturity due. So we brought that down to $650 million. We could do more of that. The other attractive investment would be the more expensive debt which you can also -- that has more -- it's more accretive when you pay down the highest cost debt. So that -- I think those would be the two choices but I think our focus would be to repay debt.\nOperator: Our next question or comment comes from the line of Frank Galanti from Stifel.\nFrank Galanti: This is Frank. Can you hear me?\nJoe Adams: Yes.\nFrank Galanti: Great. I wanted to start on the module factory and around the competitive landscape there. I guess first, can you just sort of talk high level what the business provides from a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective? Like does it actually -- is it sort of a 2-year kick down the road from a maintenance visit? And sort of how does that compare to a quick engine change? Just trying to think through where people find value in the module factory. And then I guess secondarily, who does this? Who do you see as your big competitors that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going up against? Obviously with the PMA parts and the used service and materials, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a cost advantage. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only minimal at this point with the PMA approval progress so far. So just sort of wanted to dig in on that business specifically.\nJoe Adams: Sure. So the customers for the module factory, I think you would sort of divide them into 2 different categories of how they see the benefit. One would be optimizing. So you might have an LTT that needs a shop visit but the rest of the engine doesn't. And so if you can do a module swap and optimize the number of hours and cycles and match up that with the other parts of that engine, you can significantly reduce your maintenance cost because you don't have to put the whole engine through for a shop visit. And that was similar -- there's a cost savings and a benefit for that. And that was illustrated in the WestJet deal that we won with Lufthansa. So that's one customer would be optimizing. The second is avoiding that shop visit by doing engine -- module exchanges totally. So lots of airlines today, particularly as they look at their CFM56 suite are saying, what can I do to avoid a full restoration, meaning you have to induct the whole engine into an MRO shop, disassemble it and then every part in that engine gets looked at and it often ends up in a significant increase in total cost. So a module swap would allow you to exchange the fan or the LPT and put a new core in and keep the fan and the LPT and not have to touch those. So that's the target market for that product and it's substantial. We've met with many airlines over the last 3 to 6 months and it's their stated goal was to try to reduce the number of full restorations they do. And modules fit perfectly into being able for them to sort of achieve that objective. And so the question is, who does that? And so if you look at in the industry today, the big airlines that have their own MRO shop do this internally. So it could be a Delta, United, American. They manage module exchanges right now in terms of their own fleet because they have enough airplanes and they have an MRO shop. The market that doesn't have access to that is all other airlines of which there are hundreds. And if you went out today and said, who can I buy a fan from or who can I buy an LPT from, it's no one but us. So we're the first to sort of create this storefront where people can do that. And it's very powerful for a lot of these airlines that are just learning about the opportunity. And so we're seeing airlines start with 1 or 2 modules, leasing companies that are trying to do it to minimize return compensation and maintenance shops who are trying to win business. So the entire ecosystem is open to this. And today, there's no one else offering this product. So we think it's very beneficial to the airlines, very beneficial in maintenance shops, beneficial to the whole industry and it opens everybody up to have that capability.\nFrank Galanti: Okay, great. Yes, that's super helpful. Appreciate that. And then for my second question, I wanted to dig in on the PMA parts. And I apologize; you may have gone through this in the beginning of the call. I've got sick kids, so I was a little bit late getting on. But can you sort of reiterate the time line on the remaining parts approval? And then specifically around the second part, obviously that's been delayed. What's changed from when you first kind of contemplated getting approval on that part relative today? Sort of walk us through why that's been so delayed.\nJoe Adams: Yes. I think, as I mentioned previously, there's two things going on. There's the natural process of design .\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. We lost connection. Go ahead, Mr. Adams.\nJoe Adams: So where did I drop off?\nFrank Galanti: Just sort of the beginning of the PMA question.\nJoe Adams: Okay. So there's a natural process in all of these where designs are tweaked and test results are come in and there's modifications made, so that's part of the process that occurs in every one of these. So that's part of the delay. The second is FAA responsiveness and turnaround time. And the FAA has been unusually slow in terms of getting back to people with answers, responding, having the right people in the meeting. They have personnel vacancies that have not been filled. So that part of it is out of our control and unusual. It's never happened that way before. So all those -- those are the 2 reasons for delays. But as I mentioned, all the parts and process are proceeding. They're doing very well. And it's expected that all the remaining parts that are under development will be submitted for approval next year in 2023.\nFrank Galanti: Okay, that's helpful. And I got another question, if I could, around Chromalloy. Veritas is looking -- or is going to be buying that company. I just wanted to confirm that it's got no effect on FTAI from an operations perspective. And then sort of second around that and this is maybe a bit premature but given where we stand or you guys stand in the PMA approval process but can you sort of talk about sort of the duration of the competitive advantage with the PMA business? Because if the PMA business only is for the CFM56-7B/5B engine, what can FTAI do from a competitive advantage perspective kind of in the out years?\nJoe Adams: Yes. So I can confirm that there's no effect on the Chromalloy joint venture. There is no change in control provision, no termination right in the agreements and we look forward to the -- working with Veritas. I think it's a very significant positive for Chromalloy. It was a quite robust auction and price which I think reflects very well on the quality of the management team and the future opportunities. So I think it's a positive from our point of view that the transaction happens and we look forward to that. In terms of duration, there is a -- we are focused on the CFM56 engine really exclusively. We started working with Chromalloy on a CF6-80 engine and we've had a great partnership on that. And we've been reducing our exposure in the CF6-80 engine, so that is becoming more mature. So the sweet spot of the CFM56 engine from a number of shop visits point of view really runs from probably 2023 to a minimum of 2030. And it might have been extended, I think, by these new delivery delays as well that are coming out. And also by the total maintenance cost of some of this new technology is still an unknown. So we feel very good about at least the next 6 to 7 years, having 3,000-plus shop visits a year which is a huge, huge market opportunity. After 2030, I'm not quite sure yet. But I feel like we have a lot of time to come up with some new ideas. We already have some ideas on the drawing board for next year in terms .\nOperator: Please stand by.\nFrank Galanti: Not sure if you had any additional -- you said you had something on the drawing board but that sort of answers my question. Appreciate taking the questions.\nJoe Adams: I'm back. Can you hear me?\nFrank Galanti: Yes, we can hear you. You had said something about we had things on the drawing board.\nJoe Adams: Yes. We have some ideas about other maintenance-related products that we're developing for next year. So I think it's not going to be static. We're not going to sit and wait until 2030 and do nothing.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. Our last question for today will come from the line of Mr. Greg Lewis from BTIG.\nGreg Lewis: Yes, Joe, I just had one question. Realizing that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still early days. We got to get the C Corp conversion. But I guess, as we think about this bigger picture, like right now, FTAI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly trading at a nice discount to its peers. I heard a lot about continuing to deploy cash for assets. You did touch on the dividend. I mean, at a certain point, do we need to start thinking about buying back the stock?\nJoe Adams: Sure. I think when we have the decision with excess cash flow, I think we're going to look at all 3 alternatives which is pay down debt, increase the dividend or buy back stock. So I don't have any preset answer to that. It'll be a function of what the outlook is, what the opportunities are, where the various securities are trading. So we'll take a look at all of that.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Andreini for any closing remarks.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Howard. Thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q4. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day. Speakers, stand by.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Adams",
            "content": "Thanks, Alan. I'm pleased to announce our 30th dividend as a public company and our 45th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on November 28, based on a shareholder record date of November 14. Also, please note FTAI successfully completed the spinoff of its infrastructure business on the 1st of August of this year. Historical financial condition and the results of operations related to the infrastructure business prior to the spinoff date have been disclosed under Discontinued Operations within the consolidated financial statements. Now, let's turn to the numbers. The key metric for us is adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was $108.9 million, down 24% compared to $143.7 million in Q2 2022 and up 25% compared to $87.2 million in Q3 2021. The above numbers are for consolidated FTAI which includes both leasing and aerospace products. Starting this quarter, we will be presenting leasing and aerospace products as separate segments going forward. Let's start with leasing. Leasing had a good quarter, posting approximately $96 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of the $96 million of EBITDA came in at $75 million for Q3, down from $87 million in Q2 as expected. The principal reason for the decline was due to the sale of approximately $145 million of book value of assets in Q2 and Q3 attributed to our cargo campaign sales in which we sold 5 aircraft and 30 engines. With very strong demand for assets and the addition of some new acquisitions which we will talk about later, we expect Q4 will rebound. And next year, 2023, we're very confident in leasing EBITDA of $350 million to $400 million for the year, excluding gains on asset sales. Part of the $96 million in EBITDA for leasing came from gains on asset sales which also performed as expected. We sold $64.9 million book value of assets for a gain of $20.6 million. We have more asset sales coming in Q4 to recycle capital invested in some of 2021's larger acquisitions. In addition, we'll continue to make freighter sales to capitalize on the continuing robust freighter market. We're very comfortable assuming gains on asset sales continuing at approximately $25 million per quarter or $100 million for all of 2023. Aerospace products had another solid quarter with $19 million of EBITDA. We started these activities only a little over a year ago and in the last 4 quarters have booked approximately $70 million of EBITDA without any contribution from PMA. We see tremendous potential and feel good about generating $20 million to $30 million in quarterly EBITDA and think $100 million-plus in 2023 EBITDA to be very doable. We feel confident about this number because we're seeing a rapidly expanding backlog of aerospace products business with other leasing companies, MROs, or maintenance repair organizations and airlines. With respect to Q4, we have begun closing the sale of $200 million in assets and have signed letters of intent to purchase $300 million in new assets also in Q4. The net pickup in leasing EBITDA from the new investments minus the give-up from the sales we estimate to be $40 million per annum or $10 million per quarter. Importantly, 2 of these asset sales involved FTAI retaining the engine services contract on behalf of the buyer which should generate $1 million per annum per aircraft or $10 million total per annum of aerospace EBITDA over the remaining lease term of approximately 8 years. After 3 years of macro trade headwinds, we now have macro factors that are greatly helping us. First, OEMs have instituted mostly double digit percentage price increases for parts effective this quarter. And parts price increases creates more opportunity for our cost saving products to increase market share for us. And since service shop visits costs are predominantly parts, the replacement value of our engines goes up correspondingly. Second, many airlines are trying to reduce expensive full engine restorations and instead increase module swaps and light shop visits that do not require disassembly which plays right to our strengths and into our products. Thirdly, delays in new aircraft deliveries are creating scarcity of 737NGs and A320 COs which will drive strong demand for 737NGs, A320 COs and, importantly, CFM56 engines for many years to come. And fourth, industry demand for travel has returned to almost pre-COVID levels. Regarding PMA, or parts manufacturing authorization, there's no change in our planning which includes a full complement of airfoil parts becoming available throughout next year. In summary, it feels like we are finally operating in an environment with strong tailwinds. We managed through the COVID disruptions, followed by Russia-Ukraine and will have our portfolio optimized by this year end. And with demand for air travel surging globally, combined with proprietary cost-saving aerospace products, 2023 is shaping up to be an outstanding year. With that, let me turn the call back to Alan. Yes. So I would say on the gains, yes, it's fair to assume that some of the asset sales we were targeting for Q2 got delayed and have been pushed in -- or targeted for Q3 got delayed and are pushed into Q4. So I do think there's upside over the sort of guided range we have in Q4 just because of that, the sequencing and the timing. So it's shaping up to be a pretty good quarter from an asset sales point of view. On the leasing side, as I indicated, we're very comfortable next year hitting the sort of $90 million to $100 million per quarter. The Q4 will really be a function of the timing of closings and when those occur. So I think it's possible that we can get there. But in today's world, it seems like there's more delays than accelerations and sort of every time you turn around, there's something about a part not available or a maintenance shop can't get something delivered. And so I'm a little hesitant to promise on that just because we're in a world . I did, yes. And I gave a long answer which unfortunately it sounds like you didn't hear it. But I'll -- so in terms of asset sales, we have pushed -- some of the deals we expected to close in Q3 got delayed and will end up closing in Q4. So we think there is upside to the sort of typical run rate of what we've been expecting on gain on sale. So I think that you're right. We should be at the high end of that number or potentially even above it, just given the sequence and closing deals is taking a little bit longer than we expect. In terms of the leasing EBITDA, I said we're very comfortable with next year being in that $90 million to $100 million per quarter range. But it's really a function of the timing of the closing of some of these new acquisitions. And in today's world, everything seems to take a little bit longer than expected. It's either a delay on a part or a delay on a maintenance shop which -- so I'm a little hesitant to be able to predict Q4 yet given that item. Now ultimately, these supply chain disruptions are good for us because we have available equipment and engines other people dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t. But it is a reality of todaya\u0302\u0080\u0099s world that everything seems to be taking a little bit longer to get done. So I feel good about the total run rate once we get all the assets deployed. Q4 is a little bit variable. Definitely will be up. Question is whether we get to the $90 million or not for the quarter. Yes. We have done some analysis and we have a list of some potential funds that might -- we might get included in. And I think the -- historically, obviously well with Aircastle which Aircastle was very successful at getting included and has a very similar corporate structure to the one wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re adopting. So that would bode well. But it is -- there is a qualitative element in all these applications, so wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not totally sure. But I would say the range is probably between 10% and 30% of our total stock market capitalization should end up in passive funds. Yes. Happy to talk about insurance. Just to recap, we have about $290 million of insurance claims on our $125 million of book value of assets that we've filed. And really, as I mentioned before, we've broken it into 3 buckets of the different strategies with each one. The first one is sort of -- I think that would be the most -- the first to pay is the contingent insurance coverage that we have. And that's about $90 million and it's covered mostly engines. The second is Ukraine which is about $75 million. And the third is Russian assets airplanes, mostly airplanes that are lost in Russia, about $125 million. I would say we've made progress on 2 of those 3 categories, namely the contingent coverage and the Ukraine assets. And progress means that we've had a good dialogue and we have a framework of a plan but we don't have a sort of definitive -- enough of a definition of the plan for me to give you a definitive time line, although I am optimistic that that could -- those 2 buckets could resolve in the next 3 to 6 months is my hope. The Ukrainian assets that we were thinking or destroyed may not be and they may be in good shape as far as we can tell. We now have people on the ground. And so we're working on various strategies with respect to those assets, either with insurance or without insurance that we can monetize. But clearly, those are -- that's a priority for us to focus and work on those. And then the Russian assets is a bit frustrating. It's frustrating for the whole industry in that the insurance companies just refuse to engage. And I think you saw AerCap and DAE have filed lawsuits. Ultimately, the good news is that none of the participants are talking again about, well, we canceled the policy and you don't have coverage. Or it's not a loss; it's all about sanctions and obfuscation that I think ultimately will -- they'll run out of excuses and room and litigation forces the issue. So I think that will pay, as I've said from the very beginning but I think it may take the longest of the three Yes. So all of our engine maintenance reserve payments are indexed to shop visit costs. and job visits costs are 90% parts. And so if the parts prices just went up 10%, effectively youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re getting a 10% increase in our maintenance reserve payments. And so that for the CFM, GE, Safran fleet that goes into effect November 1, we had a feeling that was coming. So wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been looking to acquire more engines this summer and add as much as we can. So wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re -- I think wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re well positioned in that. And then that should translate -- that will translate into additional EBITDA for us starting then, starting November. It's all older CFM56 engines. And the way we're positioning ourselves in the market is our view is for CFM56 engines, the first 10 to 12 years is covered by the OEM under power by our maintenance agreements for the most part. And so we're not going after that business. It's not really available. But once the engine has passed maybe the second shoppers that are -- or looking at the second shop is about year 12 or 14, a lot of those maintenance contracts are up for bid and us to acquire. And so what we want to do is use our products and our services to be effectively the OEM for the second half of the life of that engine. And so that's the way we position ourselves with airlines and MRO shops is that we can take over your maintenance activity, much like GE does on the front end. We can save you money and we can totally derisk it for you because you won't have any negative surprise events. You won't have any overruns or surprise expenses to deal with. And in the case of airlines that are looking to phase out the fleet, we can buy the fleet and then provide you a new engine whenever you want it. So we'll provide you liquidity, flexibility and cost savings. So we're finding a very broad appeal for that pitch. It resonates with people, particularly accelerated by the fact that the prices just went up, are going up 10%. And airlines are experiencing a lot of cost inflation and they are looking for every potential way to do it. So I think it is resonating. And I think all of that we're able to do before any incremental savings that might come from PMA which we expect next year will. Yes. So a lot of the airlines are now coming saying that they have new orders. They've built their fleet plan around receiving NEOs and MAX aircraft over the next couple of years and they're seeing those delayed. So we're seeing airlines come saying, show me anything you have that in the NG and the CO range where I could add capacity in meaningful numbers. So it's a very, very strong environment. And they're willing to -- typically, those leases are 5 to 6 years in duration. You do from one D check to another. So the term of the agreement is attractive and the quantity that people are looking to get is very broad-based. So I'd say obviously, the only market that is still relatively closed or constrained is China but that's -- they're an outlier. Every other region of the world is really robust. Latin America, as I mentioned previously, we've done a lot of business in Latin America. It's above average growth rates. Middle East, Southeast Asia, very strong. And then Western Europe is -- was probably the latest to recover because of omicron but its capacity is coming back and being added there now again as well. So I think it's a very, very strong market environment. Obviously, Russia's gone forever which is about 5% of market, so it's not that material. But a very good global dynamic. Yes. So I think we had about $70 million of cash at the end of Q3. When you look at the various asset sales and asset purchases, I think we should end up the year potentially with sort of $50-ish million drawn on the revolver. So we have a $225 million revolver that is undrawn at the moment. It's fully available. So that's how we're going to manage liquidity as we have done in the past. So mostly the pluses and minuses, we're adding $300 million of assets and effectively cash flows will receive from the operations as well as the asset sales, it's pretty much -- pretty close to a wash. So we expect to end the year with very little -- with most of the revolver, if not all of it, available going into next year. Not so much to the higher interest rates. What we've communicated to the rating agencies is that A, we want to be BB and B, we want to manage debt to EBITDA under 5x. And if you look at our pro forma -- if we do $550 million to $600 million of EBITDA next year, we'll be under 4x. And I think both agencies, Moody's, S&P and Fitch have all indicated if we do that, we would be either upgraded or sort of -- we'd be in the BB range and that's kind of consistent with where we want to be. So I don't think it's necessarily interest rate driven. We do have some opportunities now. And I think next year, we would look to as a priority to repay some debt with excess cash flow, so bring that net debt balance down and get even lower in terms of the debt to EBITDA and higher in terms of rating. So, I think that's where we're leaning at the moment. And I think part of the program of selling assets and buying assets is to manage so that we're not necessarily adding a lot of capital at this point. We're recycling and picking up EBITDA. Well, the aircraft, I think generally, we've been over 90% which I think we will be. We've had -- we still have some assets that we've repositioned from Russia-Ukraine that are either to be sold or to be leased. And we added some aircraft like 737-800s this summer which we bought at a very attractive price off-lease. All of those are going on lease this month in October. 2 in October, 1 in November. So those types of -- when I say the portfolio will be optimized by the end of the year, everything we're doing is to get assets redeployed from Russia-Ukraine, or cargo assets that we were targeting for sale, get those sold. So I think by the end of the year, utilization should be -- for aircraft should be 90%-plus. Engines is always -- we've always targeted 50% to 75%. And effectively, utilization is really what drives it. It's the number of hours flown and the total amount of the portfolio. So we've been -- for instance, the last 2 quarters, we've acquired quite a lot of CFM56 engines that are off-lease. So utilization hasn't really gone up in spite of a strong market environment because we've been adding to the denominator. And we will keep doing that because we could see there was a price increase coming and we also think the economics of those engines are extremely attractive. So we would add as many of those as we can. So, I think that the target range is still the same, 50% to 75% on engine utilization. And thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s not what -- we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t really manage to that. We manage to sort of having the total EBITDA of the portfolio optimized. Well, we've been doing that this year. With the cargo sales, we consciously decided early this year that we felt like the cargo market is maybe as good as it gets and we decided that it was better to be early than late. So I think that was a good decision. And we've sold probably $400 million of cargo assets to do -- to generate capital. But on the flip side, just sitting with cash, given the attractive environment in the CFM56 engine and the substantial competitive advantage we have, that didn't seem like a good idea either. And I think from our point of view, it feels like we already had recessions. We had 2 of them. And the economic -- potential economic recession will have less impact on CFM56 demand than COVID did, for example. So we feel that there's -- even if there is an economic slowdown globally, the demand for those assets and the travel recovery is sort of a bigger driver than the global economy. I think probably repayment of debt. And we'll look at all the various issues. I mean, we've debated as part of the dividend from the infrastructure, we repaid the 2025s which is the next maturity due. So we brought that down to $650 million. We could do more of that. The other attractive investment would be the more expensive debt which you can also -- that has more -- it's more accretive when you pay down the highest cost debt. So that -- I think those would be the two choices but I think our focus would be to repay debt. Yes. Sure. So the customers for the module factory, I think you would sort of divide them into 2 different categories of how they see the benefit. One would be optimizing. So you might have an LTT that needs a shop visit but the rest of the engine doesn't. And so if you can do a module swap and optimize the number of hours and cycles and match up that with the other parts of that engine, you can significantly reduce your maintenance cost because you don't have to put the whole engine through for a shop visit. And that was similar -- there's a cost savings and a benefit for that. And that was illustrated in the WestJet deal that we won with Lufthansa. So that's one customer would be optimizing. The second is avoiding that shop visit by doing engine -- module exchanges totally. So lots of airlines today, particularly as they look at their CFM56 suite are saying, what can I do to avoid a full restoration, meaning you have to induct the whole engine into an MRO shop, disassemble it and then every part in that engine gets looked at and it often ends up in a significant increase in total cost. So a module swap would allow you to exchange the fan or the LPT and put a new core in and keep the fan and the LPT and not have to touch those. So that's the target market for that product and it's substantial. We've met with many airlines over the last 3 to 6 months and it's their stated goal was to try to reduce the number of full restorations they do. And modules fit perfectly into being able for them to sort of achieve that objective. And so the question is, who does that? And so if you look at in the industry today, the big airlines that have their own MRO shop do this internally. So it could be a Delta, United, American. They manage module exchanges right now in terms of their own fleet because they have enough airplanes and they have an MRO shop. The market that doesn't have access to that is all other airlines of which there are hundreds. And if you went out today and said, who can I buy a fan from or who can I buy an LPT from, it's no one but us. So we're the first to sort of create this storefront where people can do that. And it's very powerful for a lot of these airlines that are just learning about the opportunity. And so we're seeing airlines start with 1 or 2 modules, leasing companies that are trying to do it to minimize return compensation and maintenance shops who are trying to win business. So the entire ecosystem is open to this. And today, there's no one else offering this product. So we think it's very beneficial to the airlines, very beneficial in maintenance shops, beneficial to the whole industry and it opens everybody up to have that capability. Yes. I think, as I mentioned previously, there's two things going on. There's the natural process of design . So where did I drop off? Okay. So there's a natural process in all of these where designs are tweaked and test results are come in and there's modifications made, so that's part of the process that occurs in every one of these. So that's part of the delay. The second is FAA responsiveness and turnaround time. And the FAA has been unusually slow in terms of getting back to people with answers, responding, having the right people in the meeting. They have personnel vacancies that have not been filled. So that part of it is out of our control and unusual. It's never happened that way before. So all those -- those are the 2 reasons for delays. But as I mentioned, all the parts and process are proceeding. They're doing very well. And it's expected that all the remaining parts that are under development will be submitted for approval next year in 2023. Yes. So I can confirm that there's no effect on the Chromalloy joint venture. There is no change in control provision, no termination right in the agreements and we look forward to the -- working with Veritas. I think it's a very significant positive for Chromalloy. It was a quite robust auction and price which I think reflects very well on the quality of the management team and the future opportunities. So I think it's a positive from our point of view that the transaction happens and we look forward to that. In terms of duration, there is a -- we are focused on the CFM56 engine really exclusively. We started working with Chromalloy on a CF6-80 engine and we've had a great partnership on that. And we've been reducing our exposure in the CF6-80 engine, so that is becoming more mature. So the sweet spot of the CFM56 engine from a number of shop visits point of view really runs from probably 2023 to a minimum of 2030. And it might have been extended, I think, by these new delivery delays as well that are coming out. And also by the total maintenance cost of some of this new technology is still an unknown. So we feel very good about at least the next 6 to 7 years, having 3,000-plus shop visits a year which is a huge, huge market opportunity. After 2030, I'm not quite sure yet. But I feel like we have a lot of time to come up with some new ideas. We already have some ideas on the drawing board for next year in terms . I'm back. Can you hear me? Yes. We have some ideas about other maintenance-related products that we're developing for next year. So I think it's not going to be static. We're not going to sit and wait until 2030 and do nothing. Sure. I think when we have the decision with excess cash flow, I think we're going to look at all 3 alternatives which is pay down debt, increase the dividend or buy back stock. So I don't have any preset answer to that. It'll be a function of what the outlook is, what the opportunities are, where the various securities are trading. So we'll take a look at all of that."

And I would now like to turn today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference over to Alan Andreini. Please go ahead sir.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Lisa. I would like to welcome all you to the Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, the CEO of FTAI; Ken Nicholson, the CEO of FTAI Infrastructure; Scott Christopher, the CFO of FTAI Infrastructure; and Angela Nam, the soon to be CFO of FTAI Aviation. We have posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you have not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only mode and is being webcast. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including FAD. The reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement. Before I turn the call over to Joe and Ken, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements by their nature are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our quarterly report filed with the SEC. Now I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Adams: Thanks, Alan. Welcome to the FTAI second quarter earnings call. Today, we have presented and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be discussing the financials as of June 30 on a consolidated basis. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very excited that everything is in place for the spin-off of FTAI Infrastructure to be completed next Monday. So, we will also provide some pro forma information about the two separate companies, which will be trading next Tuesday under the symbols FTAI and FIP. To start, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased to announce our 29th dividend is a public company and our 44th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $033 per share will be paid on August 29, based on a shareholder record date of August 15. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now turn to the consolidated numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD or funds available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA was $165.3 million up 220% compared to $51.6 million in Q1, 2022, and up 143% compared to $68.0 million in Q2 2021. FAD was $109.4 million up 53% compared to $71.4 million in Q1, 2022, and up 60% compared to $68.3 million in Q2 2021. During the second quarter, the $109.4 million FAD number was comprised of $161.6 million from our aviation leasing portfolio, $9.9 million from our infrastructure business, and negative $62.1 million from corporate and other. Starting now with aviation. Aviation had a really good quarter, posting approximately $160 million of EBITDA, and $105 million of net income. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re benefiting from strong demand globally driven by the recovery and travel demand, which in turn is fueling growth in engine aftermarket services. Lease rates have returned to at or above pre-COVID levels and improving asset utilization is pushing maintenance reserve collection up while inflation is driving higher per hour and cycle rates. Asset prices are also up. We took advantage by selling about a $100 million book value of assets for a gain of $55 million. And we have more asset sales coming in Q3 and Q4, both to recycle capital invested in some of our 2021 larger acquisitions, and continued capitalizing on the robust freighter market. Aerospace products had an excellent quarter with $17 million in EBITDA and a significant increase in order backlog. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the process of completing two separate asset sales where FTAI will retain engine maintenance service contracts for the next eight years covering 22 engines. We believe this marks a unique way to scale the number of engines we manage while recycling capital for new investments. In addition, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been awarded a major engine exchange program covering between 10 and 20 engines for a large Southeast Asian airline. All told today, we now have five airlines, three leasing companies, and five maintenance repair organizations, or MROs signed up to use the module factory for a significant portion of their CFM56 fleet. And every user we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had so far has been a repeat customer. Used serviceable material USM, sales experience more activity in Q2 as shop visits increased. Demand for used CFM56 material is high and growing and sufficient to easily support 20 engine to 30 engine tear downs per year, which continue to generate approximately a million in profit per engine for us. Our PMA initiative made significant progress in Q2 on the next four parts development. Although the process is slower than expected, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very happy with the parts being produced and are properly supplying all data requested. At this point, we expect all four new products to be submitted for final approval by this time next year. We currently expect to complete an additional $200 million in asset sales in Q3 and have concurrently signed up $300 million in an attractive new acquisitions to replace these. The new deals are expected to be accretive by adding more EBITDA than the assets removed. Although from a timing perspective, Q3 likely will experience a slight decrease in leasing EBITDA until those new investments have fully closed. Turning to the insurance claims. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making good progress by supplying all information requested by the insurers regarding our $290 million in claims for assets lost in Russia, Ukraine. With three different buckets of claims, we think it is possible to realize a partial recovery by year end 2022 this year with the balance collected in 2023 and 2024. As a reminder, any recoveries will be a 100% income since all related assets were written off fully in Q1. To pull it all together, we expect aviation without any insurance recoveries will produce per quarter $90 million to $100 million in EBITDA from leasing, $20 million to $30 million in asset sale gains, which we think will be recurring each quarter, and $20 million to $30 million in EBITDA from aerospace products, totaling $550 million to $600 million in per annum EBITDA from aviation. With this level of EBITDA, we expect FTAI Aviation to pay a dividend going forward of $1.20 per annum. While FIP, Fortress, FTAI Infrastructure expects to pay $0.12 per annum for the total of a $1.32 for the two stocks post-spin. Let me now turn the call over to Ken to discuss Infrastructure.\nKen Nicholson: Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, our Infrastructure business will be a standalone company commencing next Tuesday. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re extremely excited about the prospects of our Infrastructure platform and believe are well-positioned to drive substantial growth at each of our four existing businesses. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dynamic time in the industrial and energy markets with inflation and focus on energy security as prominent as ever. And our assets are extremely well-positioned to capitalize on several opportunities. Quickly to the second quarter results. In total, our Infrastructure business posted $26.7 million of EBITDA in the second quarter, up 34.8% sequentially from $19.8 million in the first quarter of 2022, importantly, each of our four core companies reported sequential growth in revenue and EBITDA. As we head into the second half of the year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing good momentum across the portfolio and expect to continue to generate meaningful sequential growth as our businesses continue to ramp up operations, following recently completed developments, and as new contracts kick in. In the aggregate, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re targeting achieving annual adjusted EBITDA in excess of $200 million in the next 12 months to 24 months. With no additional investment required to meet that target. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll briefly review each of our Infrastructure companies starting with Transtar. Transtar had an excellent quarter posting growth across all aspects of the business, including volumes, pricing, revenue, and EBITDA. EBITDA increased from $14.8 million in Q1 to $18.8 million for Q2, a 29% quarter-over-quarter gain. More importantly, cash flow was $20 million for the quarter of sales from non-core assets continued to exceed capital expenditures. Volumes at Transtar are increased from 54,000 to 57,000 carloads from Q1 to Q2 while pricing or average rate per car grew from $562 to $599 per carload. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re insulated from inflation and higher fuel costs that Transtar with the ability to pass through higher operating costs under our contract with U.S. Steel and ancillary services also grew at Transtar with car repair efforts, bringing a new revenue for the quarter. While, the third quarter is typically seasonally a little softer than other quarters during the year. We expect results to remain steady as we look ahead driven by continued progress on a number of initiatives to gain new customers and grow revenue from other sources, including car repair and real estate income. Next down to Jefferson. Q2 EBITDA Jefferson was $4.2 million up 11% compared to $3.8 million in Q1 of 2022. We saw increases in volumes of both refined products and crude oil as utilization of our terminal capacity continued to steadily ramp up during the quarter. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very bullish about the second half of the year at Jefferson and expect revenue and EBITDA to grow materially in the third and fourth quarters. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing a substantial pickup in volumes of refined products, shipped to Mexico and yellow wax crude trains are now running at nine trains to 10 trains per month. More importantly at ExxonMobil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request, we now expect a complete construction of new storage tanks and commenced terminal operations under our 10-year contract during the fourth quarter of this year ahead of our original schedule of January, 2023. We expect this contract to generate approximately $20 million of incremental EBITDA annually, bringing substantial committed throughput volume to the terminal and provide a springboard for increased volumes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 growth and volumes. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also an active discussions with Exxon about activating an additional connecting pipeline, which will bring incremental crude volume from Jefferson to the expanded Exxon Beaumont refinery. Additionally, we will look to compliment this expansion by providing bidirectional service on the Southern Star crude oil pipeline between Jefferson and Motiva, allowing for increased blending capabilities and higher crude oil throughput at the terminal. In short, the much anticipated ramp at Jefferson is now upon us. Moving on Long Ridge. Long Ridge generated $7.5 million in EBITDA in Q2 versus $6.1 million in Q1. As we have communicated in the past, we target quarterly EBITDA for our 50% share of Long Ridge to be in the range of $12 million to $15 million per quarter. Our results for 2Q included the impact of gas purchases during the quarter that were required from external suppliers as we transitioned our internal gas production  gas and generated EBITDA for the month within our targets and going forward, we expect to continue steady EBITDA from the power plant in line with our targets. Development at Long Ridge continues to be robust. In July, we enter into agreements with Newlight Technologies for the construction of a new $300 million facility to rebuilt on Long Ridge property, which will produce carbon negative and biodegradable plastic products from natural gas, Long Ridge will sell power and natural gas to Newlight, as well as provide land under long term lease. In addition, we expect to be an investor in the project. If certain conditions are met, we expect the facility to be operational in 2024. Finally, to close that with Repauno. At Repauno, our key focus is on commencing a development of our Phase 2 LPG transloading system. This system is expected to triple our throughput capacity and quadruple our operating margins when it comes online in a couple of years. We have demand from multiple international off-takers and our goals to enter into a long-term agreement with one or more parties during the third quarter. We have completed engineering for the new storage tank and associating piping, and systems, and have negotiated construction contracts. We plan to finance all construction costs with tax exempt debt. In the meantime, in the second quarter, we expanded our existing capabilities by loading fully refrigerated LPG to large gas carrier marine vessels. With this important step, we move closer to our goal of loading VLGCs, or very large gas carriers across our dock facility. In addition, the newly expanded LPG truck racks continues to see how utilization providing both propane and butane to local heating and lending markets, meeting additional customer needs in the area. Finally, we continue to see increased interest in the renewable energy space with 250 acres primed for development. We have announced a coordinated effort to develop a unique marine cable manufacturing facility with Rise Light, which will provide a critical American made infrastructure link to bring renewable electricity from offshore wind generation to local consumers. Also our Clean Planet joint venture continues to progress through the permitting process for the first plastics recycling plant at Repauno. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expecting to complete construction of the Clean Planet facility in 2024. With that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn it back to Joe.\nJoe Adams: Thanks, Ken. Next week is a big week for FTAI shareholders with the consummation of the spin. FIP will eliminate K-1s for shareholders upon the spin and FTAI will begin a six week to eight week redone of selling, which when complete will eliminate K-1s for all shareholders as well. Index funds, ETFs, and a broader investor universe will be able to own both stocks. And importantly, both companies will focus, refine, and articulate their uniqueness and value add in the respective market served. For aviation, FTAI is capitalizing on global travel recovery and growth and aftermarket engine services to be the leading low cost commercial engine power provider for narrow-body aircraft globally. The unique combination of engine leasing and maintenance management provides airlines cost savings and capital preservation through proprietary products and practices while focusing on the largest and most liquid engine market in the world.\nKen Nicholson: And I would just say for infrastructure, we very much look forward to updating investors on a standalone basis starting next quarter. We do expect to post meaningful growth in the near-term across each of our four key business units. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very attractive time to on long-term assets, well insulated from inflation and with high scarcity value in the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest industrial and energy markets. We view the growth of Transtar this quarter as a good indication of things to come and following the years of development where accelerating the pace of ramp up at Jefferson and Repauno terminals, while at Long Ridge with the power plant complete, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now beginning to drive incremental cash flow and value. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn it back to Alan.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Ken. Lisa, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take our first question from Guiliano Bologna from Compass Point.\nGuiliano Bologna: Thank you. Joe, and starting off with on the aviation side. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be curious, a couple of different things and how they kind of interact together. You obviously mapped out a handful of asset sales from some of the called the four of the nine assets you got back from Russian carriers. Last quarter that you said to generate call a $30 million gain on sale. And then you had a handful of other 737 NGs that you got back that, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re potentially going to go on lease. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious when we look at the asset sale numbers obviously came in a bit higher than what I had expected. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious what the composition of those asset sales looks like? Or if we sold, and if you sold more of the Russian assets and you mentioned some cargo assets as well during the call. And then talking \u00e2\u0080\u0093 then looking on the other side, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious what kind of assets you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at on the LOI side, because you obviously have a pretty strong LOI pipeline and you mentioned call $300 million of potential acquisitions? So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just curious, what types of assets are you selling? What types of assets are you acquiring? And how should we think about the EBITDA contribution coming out on the sales then back in on the acquisitions?\nJoe Adams: Yes. So the composition is a little \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as I mentioned is two different groupings. One is cargo and the other is recycling capital from mainly the Avianca deal, but also some others with long term leases that we did last year. The cargo assets, we also sold in addition to, selling some of the assets, the 757s and 767s we took back from Russia and Ukraine. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also sold some 747s in this quarter. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the gain is, higher than, than we had originally projected. That market is mentioned I, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know when the cargo market will slow down, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to miss it. So, we decided that it was sort of a good time to, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather be early than late. And that market, we had bought those assets at a very attractive time several years ago when no one was paying attention or thinking about cargo. So there were quite good returns for us. But we decided it was time to sort of lighten up on the cargo side. And then in the third quarter, I think I alluded to the deals that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling with long term leases attached. So, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a lot of capital that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been raised by new leasing companies that like that wants to buy deals. And we structured those so that we can retain the engine maintenance service contract and do that for the Lessor which is great for us, because we could use Lessor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, other Lessor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital and retain the best part of the deal. So those are the deals we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re targeting to close in mostly in Q3 and, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll add a lot of, we add backlog to our aerospace products business that way, and we think we can continue to grow it. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very pleased that, the Lessor acceptance of that has been not by one Lessor, but by two Lessor. So, we see that as something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very, very significant for us to continue to grow the service business and highlight our ability to create value out of portfolio deals, which is why I reference that. I think this gain on sale is something that we think is should be recurring for us each quarter. I think we can do that. We can buy packages of assets and then find, the parts that are most attractive other people and take advantage of that. And in this case, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to even keep the engine maintenance service as part of that. On the buy side we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on all CFM56 engines, or mostly that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been the folks along, we acquired 25 engines in Q2 that were all off lease. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where you get the best prices when you have an asset that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some you have to put revenue, you have to attach revenue to it is that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a market that very few people compete with us on that. So that was a great on buy side. And then additionally, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got some deals with big airlines that we have existing relationships with that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve established a good relationship with. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also CFM56 engines. And they would add to very similar to the transactions we did last year with Avianca . So, we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great combination. We pick up EBITDA by doing that, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s both recognizing again and increasing EBITDA seems like a very good very good win.\nGuiliano Bologna: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great. I appreciate and switching over to Infrastructure. Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to focus a little more on Jefferson. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious, obviously there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, yeah, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of commentary on the call about Jefferson, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an outlook or map or a roadmap to getting roughly around $80 million EBITDA. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious, what gives you like a lot more, like, what gives you a lot more confidence that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to get there and then think about the different components. Obviously there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Exxon deal coming on. But they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll say the wax, yellow wax train car volumes, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re access to increased start to increase during 2Q. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious, what the different components are and how to think about contribution from some of the different initiatives that are going on at Jefferson?\nJoe Adams: Yes, look we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pretty bullish on the second half of the year at Jefferson. The look all the assets are in place. We are \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re finishing up the new assets for the ExxonMobil contract, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really happy that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be able to start operations under that contract. Now in the fourth quarter that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously a big piece of the bridge to $80 million. But a bigger piece is just continued increases in utilization. All of our assets in place today are being utilized at less than 50%, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a process for frankly, a few years of building out those assets and cultivating the relationships with the ExxonMobil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Motiva\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and others in the Beaumont refinery complex. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a lengthy process, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now finally there. As I mentioned, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re opening up another crude pipe between Jefferson and Exxon. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of making a small change to the Southern Star pipeline between Exxon and Motiva to allow it to be bidirectional. All of those things play into more demand and more requests for throughput from our two largest customers. Yes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thrilled that yellow wax trains continue to accelerate, the second quarter was a good quarter. I think the third quarter will be an even better quarter, refine products in the Mexico are strong and getting stronger new terminals are being opened in Mexico. And so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing indications and seeing business in this month of July that make us very comfortable with our outlook for $80 million of EBITDA, in the next 12 months to 24 months.\nGuiliano Bologna: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great. I appreciate it. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll jump back in the queue.\nOperator: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take our next question from Josh Sullivan from the Benchmark Company.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey, good morning\nJoe Adams: Good morning.\nJosh Sullivan: Just question on the overall leasing market, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had both Airbus and Boeing come out here lowering delivery assumptions due to supply chain issues, mainly within the engine availability market or vertical. So first off is that lack of OEM engine supply supporting the module business in USM. And then secondly on the aircraft leasing market how are airlines responding to that lack of OEM aircraft supply? Is that a conversation you guys are having with airlines about capacity at this point?\nJoe Adams: Yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good for us. I like that fact that, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harder to make new airplanes because it makes owning the ones we own better and more demand. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of demand for the existing NG, 737 NGs and A320 CO  asset. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got as travel demand has been very, very robust and relatively price and elastic airlines, need lift and need capacity. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, to the extent this new deliveries get stretched out, it just extends the longevity of the fleet that we own, which is good. And then the other thing I mentioned, which is also good is for us is inflation because as inflation, in increases, the price of a shop visit our advantage gets bigger and also our revenue collected from maintenance reserves goes up. So, we like both of those trends and, it seems like, as people have indicated, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going be, I think somebody said, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to be talking about stop talking about this probably until 2024 is the expectation. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got pretty good period where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be positive, I think for us.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. And then, and then one for Ken, just, just on Phase 2 Repauno, do you have customers in place or what are you seeing there to drive the next phase?\nKen Nicholson: Hey Josh, we are very close. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you, we have a contract signed, with a, with an off taker. I will tell you the team at Repauno, spent the better part of two weeks in Europe recently. And I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a very good position to sign something up in the third quarter, plenty of demand from very large investment grade counterparties. We want make sure we sign the best deal. And but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re close everything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ready to go, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not at the point yet where we have a contract executed, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re close.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. Thank you for the time.\nKen Nicholson: Thanks.\nOperator: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take our next question from Christian Wetherbee with Citi.\nEli Winski: Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. This is Eli Winski on for Chris. So maybe thinking about some of the sensitivity around the infrastructure side and going over to Jefferson. Ken, you were talking about, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll obviously get the Exxon contract and then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to focus on better asset utilization, but what are the, what are some of the puts and takes to getting better asset utilization specifically on maybe the rail congestion side? How does that impact growing some of that business?\nKen Nicholson: Really no issues with congestion. I mean, we can handle double the train activity we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re handling today. I mean that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the things we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working on as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve developed the terminal, ensuring that whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inbound crew train through outbound refined, product trains, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got plenty of capacity to handle the additional business. I, when we go through the calculation of, exactly what our throughput capacity is, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about 400,000 barrels per day, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the capacity. We take all that stuff into consideration. I mean, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, I, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not too concerned about congestion issues. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got plenty of track at the terminal. And so we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t certainly haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t experienced any congestion to date and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think congestion is going to be an issue for us.\nEli Winski: Okay. That makes sense. And then on the Exxon side, you said, you have a lot of the assets in place, but, but what is left and then separately on the $20 million of incremental EBITDA, what does that ramp up there look like? So you said that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $20 million annually, but when does that really start to pick up, when should we expect a lot of that to be coming in what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left to there?\nKen Nicholson: That really, there should be a very short ramp up to that contract. I mean the operations commence when everything is built, what is being built specifically is just under 2 million barrels of total storage. So we have storage tanks that are under construction. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built 4 million barrels to date. This is an additional 2 million we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bringing online. And then just piping and manifolds. The way that system will work is we will receive refined products by pipe accumulate and store the refined products. And then we will load large ships for export of those products. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really just down to storage tanks, piping, and manifolds all stuff we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built before. So far on track for completion during the fourth quarter, feel pretty good with our ability to get it done. I would say mid part of the fourth quarter, although the team down there is, very focused on, completing as quickly as possible. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at a stage of construction now where most of the risks that you would typically see geotechnical and what have you are behind us. And now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re welding and painting. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not digging any holes or driving piles or anything like that that can, typically be a cause for delay.\nEli Winski: Yes. Sounds like the tougher stages are over onto Mexico for refined products. How involved is the government right now still in restricting moves. So, you said that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see a substantial pickup there, but what does the government play in level of?\nKen Nicholson: Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re. I mean, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always a ongoing dialogue. Right now, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not seeing any reduction, in movements. I mean, Exxon as active as ever in loading trains for movements down to Mexico, we watch it closely. And there are, on occasion percolation of, a story here or story there but at the end of the day, the country needs gasoline and diesel. And Exxon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got a base of about a thousand, ExxonMobil gas stations that they need to serve. And so we have not seen any issues or any slow downs, coming across from some of what you might read in the papers about, government interaction.\nEli Winski: All right. That makes sense. Thank you all.\nOperator: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take our next question from Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: Thanks, and good morning. I know in the slides you called out a $200 million plus EBITDA run rate for the infrastructure businesses over the next one to two years, you referenced $80 million from Jefferson earlier. I think you gave the number of a $100 million for Transtar in the slide. So, when I add up the pieces, it sounds like we could be a decent fit above $200 million. So, I was wondering if you could just kind of refresh us on your latest thoughts on the EBITDA contribution from each of the different assets as you look out the next couple of years and maybe what level of corporate costs are getting factored into that forecast as well?\nJoe Adams: Yes absolutely. You were spot on the companies that you mentioned, Transtar is $100 million of the total of $200 million. Jefferson $80 million, Long Ridge, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re targeting $50 million, could easily be more to the extent we produce excess gas, particularly at current market pricing, but behold $50 million plus for Long Ridge, and Repauno right now, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re including at $10 million, which is really only including, Phase 1 and a little bit of incremental activity that does not include Phase 2. So that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not in the $200 million estimate. You add all that up and yes, you get, you get in excess of $200 million closer to $240 million, and then we deduct $30 million to $40 million of corporate expense, and that gets you to, just north of $200 million.\nJustin Long: Perfect. And secondly, I wanted to ask about the pro forma debt for the two businesses post-spin next week. I know you gave the numbers in the slides, but how are you thinking about targeted leverage for each of these businesses a year from now? And based on that target, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the capacity that you feel like you have for each entity to invest in growth?\nJoe Adams: So for aviation, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re targeting maintaining the BB ratio and somewhere probably in the neighborhood of four times to five times debt to EBITDA. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity, I think, to go up as we grow EBITDA. But I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re comfortable where it is, at this point. \nKen Nicholson: And I would say for infrastructure, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generally the same in terms of the ratios, obviously the infrastructure business, slightly smaller, business right now. But in terms of a ratio it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in that sort of four to five times EBITDA target. The beauty of, the infrastructure businesses in terms of investment capital for growth. A lot of what we do is eligible for tax exempt financing, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used historically at Jefferson. And we can use Repauno and potentially even at Long Ridge. And so, debt capacity obviously would be, will be smart and disciplined about, incurring debt. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been successful in the past growing through investment by accessing the tax exempt markets. And Jefferson, our average rate of borrowing is, in the high twos as an example, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure in this current market environment, Repauno for Phase 2 will be at a similar rate, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still be a significantly lower rate than, where the more traditional taxable markets would be. So, I feel like we can maintain a, four times to five times leverage ratio, but at the same time, continue to incur debt for specific projects at attractive levels.\nJustin Long: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nJoe Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take our next question from Frank Galanti with Stifel.\nFrank Galanti: Yes. Hi thanks for taking my questions and congratulations getting the financing done to be able to spend the Infrastructure business. I wanted to follow up on the engine maintenance program. So, you had mentioned when you sold a couple of the engines you were able to keep the maintenance portion. Can you sort of talk about what that physically entails and then sort of the economic, so is that simply using the module factory or is that full overhaul services up in Montreal? And then how do, how should we think about that from an economics unit economics perspective?\nJoe Adams: Sure. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good question. So how it works is that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve, we sell the aircraft to the new owner and agree to provide replacement engines for the life of those leases, when needed. So when an engine is due for a shop visit, we would take the engine that needs the shop visit and exchange in return, a engine that is meets minimum requirements of cycles and hours available in a swap. And so that engine then becomes our engine. We can either put it in the module factory or do an overhaul or sell it. And in the economics, in the meantime, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing is we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re collecting the full maintenance reserves from the airline for that engine along the way. So the way we price it out given our advantage cost with on the maintenance side is that we could, we could generate an additional million dollars per aircraft, per year through that transaction. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very attractive for us and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also attractive for the new owner. Obviously they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing it, voluntarily because managing those engine events is not something everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capable or experienced or has had good outcomes on. So, we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s example of our ability to provide a competitive service at something that we can then generated significant profit because of our proprietary products and advantage. So, very exciting. I think because it opens up a very, very large market, 60% of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fleet is owned by leasing companies. So as we looked out, that was \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an important area for us to spend time and to try to grow and to profit from. And so this is a way to do that on a pretty significant scale.\nFrank Galanti: Great. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s super helpful. And then sort of continue to get on the aviation path, I wanted to ask about the module factory. Can you sort of talk about customer interest since the inception of that? And I guess my assumption is that that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s picking up. But so in that way, are there needs to put more engines into that business? If I remember correctly, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about 10 that was originally put in. And then is there any interest or need to move past the three modules that you guys have developed and expand those services?\nJoe Adams: Well, in terms of the scale, I mean, yes, we would probably as volume grows and obviously what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing is, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re turning modules. So, we would increase the number of modules in the module factory as the business grows. We are seeing very broad based growth in users, as I mentioned, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got, it takes a while to market this, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spent time with many, many airlines and each week we are educating airlines are spending time with them and finding that they have needs and demands. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building backlog for 2023 right now. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing a very broad based acceptance on the airline level of the maintenance shops have been very, I would say much easier to sell, because they they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the business of doing this regularly, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been for many of these shops. They never had a place to go to buy a fan or to buy an LPT. So this is something now that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re recognizing they can use to just generate, additional income for their own maintenance shop. And then and then as I mentioned, the leasing companies, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing the leasing companies use this now for return compensation. So at the end of the lease an engine you often have return comp issues with the airline. The airline has to provide a certain, minimum member of hours and cycles back. And if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, they have to pay cash. And so we can oftentimes, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an LPT that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meet the requirements, we could sell an LPT to the airline or the leasing company so that the return comp conditions are met and they save money and they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to do a shop visit. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s becoming a useful tool so that for people to save money on the end of lease issues. So, really developing a very broad market for this, and it is an education process. It takes time, but given that we can, sell to almost everybody in the ecosystem, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge growth opportunity for us. And the backlog, as I mentioned, is continuing to build. And as we, with the sale of these assets and retaining the engine maintenance agreements that gives us committed volume, which we like as with the West Jet deal, we have an eight-year deal, a seven-year deal. We now have two eight-year deals. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll add to that. So, we see it with a nice ramp in terms of, if we did double the volume, if we had 10 engines, we might have 15 engines and/or as much as 20, but if each engine is sort of $2 million to $3 million, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a huge investment to get that kind of a turnover ramp, which we would expect to turn a module within three months to six months and sort of and do it multiple times a year. So, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that as a big capital user, and it should scale quite easily. In terms of going beyond these three modules. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see anything quite as attractive as this right now. So our focus is really on that. And we could develop something later in the future, but right now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all eyes on this opportunity.\nFrank Galanti: Great. Ad I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d squeeze in one more question if I could on the PMA business. So, can you sort of talk about the approval process, and why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken longer than anticipated, and I guess, are there customers that are interested in just one part that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approved? Or are they sort of waiting until there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a number of parts before engaging? Yes.\nJoe Adams: Well, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, I mean, people know that additional parts are in development, so it having a critical mass is very helpful. So, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re attempting to achieve from the very beginning. And so once we have that critical mass, then I think people will know that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming. So they tend to key off that. The process is just; I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been an element of cautiousness. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of data requests and a slower turnaround time than normal. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all those factors, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a great partner, they know how to do this, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done it hundreds of times. And the parts are very, very \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very happy with what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got in the pipeline.\nFrank Galanti: Great. Thank you very much.\nJoe Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: And that concludes today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Alan Andreini for any additional or closing remarks.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you. Thank you all for participating today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference call. We look forward to updating you for both companies after Q3.\nOperator: And that concludes today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joe Adams",
            "content": "Thanks, Alan. Welcome to the FTAI second quarter earnings call. Today, we have presented and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll be discussing the financials as of June 30 on a consolidated basis. But wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re very excited that everything is in place for the spin-off of FTAI Infrastructure to be completed next Monday. So, we will also provide some pro forma information about the two separate companies, which will be trading next Tuesday under the symbols FTAI and FIP. To start, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m pleased to announce our 29th dividend is a public company and our 44th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $033 per share will be paid on August 29, based on a shareholder record date of August 15. Leta\u0302\u0080\u0099s now turn to the consolidated numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD or funds available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA was $165.3 million up 220% compared to $51.6 million in Q1, 2022, and up 143% compared to $68.0 million in Q2 2021. FAD was $109.4 million up 53% compared to $71.4 million in Q1, 2022, and up 60% compared to $68.3 million in Q2 2021. During the second quarter, the $109.4 million FAD number was comprised of $161.6 million from our aviation leasing portfolio, $9.9 million from our infrastructure business, and negative $62.1 million from corporate and other. Starting now with aviation. Aviation had a really good quarter, posting approximately $160 million of EBITDA, and $105 million of net income. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re benefiting from strong demand globally driven by the recovery and travel demand, which in turn is fueling growth in engine aftermarket services. Lease rates have returned to at or above pre-COVID levels and improving asset utilization is pushing maintenance reserve collection up while inflation is driving higher per hour and cycle rates. Asset prices are also up. We took advantage by selling about a $100 million book value of assets for a gain of $55 million. And we have more asset sales coming in Q3 and Q4, both to recycle capital invested in some of our 2021 larger acquisitions, and continued capitalizing on the robust freighter market. Aerospace products had an excellent quarter with $17 million in EBITDA and a significant increase in order backlog. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re in the process of completing two separate asset sales where FTAI will retain engine maintenance service contracts for the next eight years covering 22 engines. We believe this marks a unique way to scale the number of engines we manage while recycling capital for new investments. In addition, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been awarded a major engine exchange program covering between 10 and 20 engines for a large Southeast Asian airline. All told today, we now have five airlines, three leasing companies, and five maintenance repair organizations, or MROs signed up to use the module factory for a significant portion of their CFM56 fleet. And every user wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve had so far has been a repeat customer. Used serviceable material USM, sales experience more activity in Q2 as shop visits increased. Demand for used CFM56 material is high and growing and sufficient to easily support 20 engine to 30 engine tear downs per year, which continue to generate approximately a million in profit per engine for us. Our PMA initiative made significant progress in Q2 on the next four parts development. Although the process is slower than expected, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re very happy with the parts being produced and are properly supplying all data requested. At this point, we expect all four new products to be submitted for final approval by this time next year. We currently expect to complete an additional $200 million in asset sales in Q3 and have concurrently signed up $300 million in an attractive new acquisitions to replace these. The new deals are expected to be accretive by adding more EBITDA than the assets removed. Although from a timing perspective, Q3 likely will experience a slight decrease in leasing EBITDA until those new investments have fully closed. Turning to the insurance claims. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re making good progress by supplying all information requested by the insurers regarding our $290 million in claims for assets lost in Russia, Ukraine. With three different buckets of claims, we think it is possible to realize a partial recovery by year end 2022 this year with the balance collected in 2023 and 2024. As a reminder, any recoveries will be a 100% income since all related assets were written off fully in Q1. To pull it all together, we expect aviation without any insurance recoveries will produce per quarter $90 million to $100 million in EBITDA from leasing, $20 million to $30 million in asset sale gains, which we think will be recurring each quarter, and $20 million to $30 million in EBITDA from aerospace products, totaling $550 million to $600 million in per annum EBITDA from aviation. With this level of EBITDA, we expect FTAI Aviation to pay a dividend going forward of $1.20 per annum. While FIP, Fortress, FTAI Infrastructure expects to pay $0.12 per annum for the total of a $1.32 for the two stocks post-spin. Let me now turn the call over to Ken to discuss Infrastructure. Thanks, Ken. Next week is a big week for FTAI shareholders with the consummation of the spin. FIP will eliminate K-1s for shareholders upon the spin and FTAI will begin a six week to eight week redone of selling, which when complete will eliminate K-1s for all shareholders as well. Index funds, ETFs, and a broader investor universe will be able to own both stocks. And importantly, both companies will focus, refine, and articulate their uniqueness and value add in the respective market served. For aviation, FTAI is capitalizing on global travel recovery and growth and aftermarket engine services to be the leading low cost commercial engine power provider for narrow-body aircraft globally. The unique combination of engine leasing and maintenance management provides airlines cost savings and capital preservation through proprietary products and practices while focusing on the largest and most liquid engine market in the world. Yes. So the composition is a little a\u0302\u0080\u0093 as I mentioned is two different groupings. One is cargo and the other is recycling capital from mainly the Avianca deal, but also some others with long term leases that we did last year. The cargo assets, we also sold in addition to, selling some of the assets, the 757s and 767s we took back from Russia and Ukraine. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve also sold some 747s in this quarter. So thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s why the gain is, higher than, than we had originally projected. That market is mentioned I, we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t know when the cargo market will slow down, but we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t want to miss it. So, we decided that it was sort of a good time to, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099d rather be early than late. And that market, we had bought those assets at a very attractive time several years ago when no one was paying attention or thinking about cargo. So there were quite good returns for us. But we decided it was time to sort of lighten up on the cargo side. And then in the third quarter, I think I alluded to the deals that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re selling with long term leases attached. So, therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s still a lot of capital thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s been raised by new leasing companies that like that wants to buy deals. And we structured those so that we can retain the engine maintenance service contract and do that for the Lessor which is great for us, because we could use Lessora\u0302\u0080\u0099s, other Lessora\u0302\u0080\u0099s capital and retain the best part of the deal. So those are the deals wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re targeting to close in mostly in Q3 and, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll add a lot of, we add backlog to our aerospace products business that way, and we think we can continue to grow it. And wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re very pleased that, the Lessor acceptance of that has been not by one Lessor, but by two Lessor. So, we see that as something thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s very, very significant for us to continue to grow the service business and highlight our ability to create value out of portfolio deals, which is why I reference that. I think this gain on sale is something that we think is should be recurring for us each quarter. I think we can do that. We can buy packages of assets and then find, the parts that are most attractive other people and take advantage of that. And in this case, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re able to even keep the engine maintenance service as part of that. On the buy side wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re focused on all CFM56 engines, or mostly thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s been the folks along, we acquired 25 engines in Q2 that were all off lease. So thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s where you get the best prices when you have an asset thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s some you have to put revenue, you have to attach revenue to it is thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s a market that very few people compete with us on that. So that was a great on buy side. And then additionally, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve got some deals with big airlines that we have existing relationships with that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve established a good relationship with. Theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re also CFM56 engines. And they would add to very similar to the transactions we did last year with Avianca . So, we think ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a great combination. We pick up EBITDA by doing that, so ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s both recognizing again and increasing EBITDA seems like a very good very good win. Yes, look wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re pretty bullish on the second half of the year at Jefferson. The look all the assets are in place. We are a\u0302\u0080\u0093 wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re finishing up the new assets for the ExxonMobil contract, and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re really happy that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to be able to start operations under that contract. Now in the fourth quarter thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s obviously a big piece of the bridge to $80 million. But a bigger piece is just continued increases in utilization. All of our assets in place today are being utilized at less than 50%, and ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s been a process for frankly, a few years of building out those assets and cultivating the relationships with the ExxonMobila\u0302\u0080\u0099s, Motivaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s and others in the Beaumont refinery complex. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s been a lengthy process, but wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re now finally there. As I mentioned, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re opening up another crude pipe between Jefferson and Exxon. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re kind of making a small change to the Southern Star pipeline between Exxon and Motiva to allow it to be bidirectional. All of those things play into more demand and more requests for throughput from our two largest customers. Yes, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re thrilled that yellow wax trains continue to accelerate, the second quarter was a good quarter. I think the third quarter will be an even better quarter, refine products in the Mexico are strong and getting stronger new terminals are being opened in Mexico. And so wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing indications and seeing business in this month of July that make us very comfortable with our outlook for $80 million of EBITDA, in the next 12 months to 24 months. Good morning. Yes, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s good for us. I like that fact that, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s harder to make new airplanes because it makes owning the ones we own better and more demand. So therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a lot of demand for the existing NG, 737 NGs and A320 CO  asset. So, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve got as travel demand has been very, very robust and relatively price and elastic airlines, need lift and need capacity. So ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s, to the extent this new deliveries get stretched out, it just extends the longevity of the fleet that we own, which is good. And then the other thing I mentioned, which is also good is for us is inflation because as inflation, in increases, the price of a shop visit our advantage gets bigger and also our revenue collected from maintenance reserves goes up. So, we like both of those trends and, it seems like, as people have indicated, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s not going be, I think somebody said, theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re not going to be talking about stop talking about this probably until 2024 is the expectation. So, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve got pretty good period where ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s going to be positive, I think for us. Yes absolutely. You were spot on the companies that you mentioned, Transtar is $100 million of the total of $200 million. Jefferson $80 million, Long Ridge, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re targeting $50 million, could easily be more to the extent we produce excess gas, particularly at current market pricing, but behold $50 million plus for Long Ridge, and Repauno right now, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re including at $10 million, which is really only including, Phase 1 and a little bit of incremental activity that does not include Phase 2. So thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s not in the $200 million estimate. You add all that up and yes, you get, you get in excess of $200 million closer to $240 million, and then we deduct $30 million to $40 million of corporate expense, and that gets you to, just north of $200 million. So for aviation, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re targeting maintaining the BB ratio and somewhere probably in the neighborhood of four times to five times debt to EBITDA. So therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s capacity, I think, to go up as we grow EBITDA. But I think wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re comfortable where it is, at this point. Thanks. Sure. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a good question. So how it works is that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve, we sell the aircraft to the new owner and agree to provide replacement engines for the life of those leases, when needed. So when an engine is due for a shop visit, we would take the engine that needs the shop visit and exchange in return, a engine that is meets minimum requirements of cycles and hours available in a swap. And so that engine then becomes our engine. We can either put it in the module factory or do an overhaul or sell it. And in the economics, in the meantime, what wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re doing is wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re collecting the full maintenance reserves from the airline for that engine along the way. So the way we price it out given our advantage cost with on the maintenance side is that we could, we could generate an additional million dollars per aircraft, per year through that transaction. So ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a very attractive for us and ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s also attractive for the new owner. Obviously theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re doing it, voluntarily because managing those engine events is not something everybodya\u0302\u0080\u0099s capable or experienced or has had good outcomes on. So, we think ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a a\u0302\u0080\u0093 ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s example of our ability to provide a competitive service at something that we can then generated significant profit because of our proprietary products and advantage. So, very exciting. I think because it opens up a very, very large market, 60% of the worlda\u0302\u0080\u0099s fleet is owned by leasing companies. So as we looked out, that was a\u0302\u0080\u0093 thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s an important area for us to spend time and to try to grow and to profit from. And so this is a way to do that on a pretty significant scale. Well, in terms of the scale, I mean, yes, we would probably as volume grows and obviously what wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re doing is, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re turning modules. So, we would increase the number of modules in the module factory as the business grows. We are seeing very broad based growth in users, as I mentioned, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve got, it takes a while to market this, but wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve spent time with many, many airlines and each week we are educating airlines are spending time with them and finding that they have needs and demands. And wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re building backlog for 2023 right now. So, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing a very broad based acceptance on the airline level of the maintenance shops have been very, I would say much easier to sell, because they theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re in the business of doing this regularly, and therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s never been for many of these shops. They never had a place to go to buy a fan or to buy an LPT. So this is something now that theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re recognizing they can use to just generate, additional income for their own maintenance shop. And then and then as I mentioned, the leasing companies, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing the leasing companies use this now for return compensation. So at the end of the lease an engine you often have return comp issues with the airline. The airline has to provide a certain, minimum member of hours and cycles back. And if they dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t, they have to pay cash. And so we can oftentimes, if ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s an LPT that doesna\u0302\u0080\u0099t meet the requirements, we could sell an LPT to the airline or the leasing company so that the return comp conditions are met and they save money and they dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t have to do a shop visit. So ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s becoming a useful tool so that for people to save money on the end of lease issues. So, really developing a very broad market for this, and it is an education process. It takes time, but given that we can, sell to almost everybody in the ecosystem, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a huge growth opportunity for us. And the backlog, as I mentioned, is continuing to build. And as we, with the sale of these assets and retaining the engine maintenance agreements that gives us committed volume, which we like as with the West Jet deal, we have an eight-year deal, a seven-year deal. We now have two eight-year deals. So, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll add to that. So, we see it with a nice ramp in terms of, if we did double the volume, if we had 10 engines, we might have 15 engines and/or as much as 20, but if each engine is sort of $2 million to $3 million, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s not a huge investment to get that kind of a turnover ramp, which we would expect to turn a module within three months to six months and sort of and do it multiple times a year. So, I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t see that as a big capital user, and it should scale quite easily. In terms of going beyond these three modules. I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t see anything quite as attractive as this right now. So our focus is really on that. And we could develop something later in the future, but right now, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s everybodya\u0302\u0080\u0099s all eyes on this opportunity. Well, I think ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s, I mean, people know that additional parts are in development, so it having a critical mass is very helpful. So, I think thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s part of what wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re attempting to achieve from the very beginning. And so once we have that critical mass, then I think people will know that thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s coming. So they tend to key off that. The process is just; I think therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s been an element of cautiousness. Therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a lot of data requests and a slower turnaround time than normal. So ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s all those factors, but wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve got a great partner, they know how to do this, theya\u0302\u0080\u0099ve done it hundreds of times. And the parts are very, very a\u0302\u0080\u0093 theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re very happy with what wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve got in the pipeline. Thanks."

            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. As Joe mentioned, our Infrastructure business will be a standalone company commencing next Tuesday. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re extremely excited about the prospects of our Infrastructure platform and believe are well-positioned to drive substantial growth at each of our four existing businesses. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a dynamic time in the industrial and energy markets with inflation and focus on energy security as prominent as ever. And our assets are extremely well-positioned to capitalize on several opportunities. Quickly to the second quarter results. In total, our Infrastructure business posted $26.7 million of EBITDA in the second quarter, up 34.8% sequentially from $19.8 million in the first quarter of 2022, importantly, each of our four core companies reported sequential growth in revenue and EBITDA. As we head into the second half of the year, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing good momentum across the portfolio and expect to continue to generate meaningful sequential growth as our businesses continue to ramp up operations, following recently completed developments, and as new contracts kick in. In the aggregate, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re targeting achieving annual adjusted EBITDA in excess of $200 million in the next 12 months to 24 months. With no additional investment required to meet that target. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll briefly review each of our Infrastructure companies starting with Transtar. Transtar had an excellent quarter posting growth across all aspects of the business, including volumes, pricing, revenue, and EBITDA. EBITDA increased from $14.8 million in Q1 to $18.8 million for Q2, a 29% quarter-over-quarter gain. More importantly, cash flow was $20 million for the quarter of sales from non-core assets continued to exceed capital expenditures. Volumes at Transtar are increased from 54,000 to 57,000 carloads from Q1 to Q2 while pricing or average rate per car grew from $562 to $599 per carload. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re insulated from inflation and higher fuel costs that Transtar with the ability to pass through higher operating costs under our contract with U.S. Steel and ancillary services also grew at Transtar with car repair efforts, bringing a new revenue for the quarter. While, the third quarter is typically seasonally a little softer than other quarters during the year. We expect results to remain steady as we look ahead driven by continued progress on a number of initiatives to gain new customers and grow revenue from other sources, including car repair and real estate income. Next down to Jefferson. Q2 EBITDA Jefferson was $4.2 million up 11% compared to $3.8 million in Q1 of 2022. We saw increases in volumes of both refined products and crude oil as utilization of our terminal capacity continued to steadily ramp up during the quarter. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re very bullish about the second half of the year at Jefferson and expect revenue and EBITDA to grow materially in the third and fourth quarters. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing a substantial pickup in volumes of refined products, shipped to Mexico and yellow wax crude trains are now running at nine trains to 10 trains per month. More importantly at ExxonMobila\u0302\u0080\u0099s request, we now expect a complete construction of new storage tanks and commenced terminal operations under our 10-year contract during the fourth quarter of this year ahead of our original schedule of January, 2023. We expect this contract to generate approximately $20 million of incremental EBITDA annually, bringing substantial committed throughput volume to the terminal and provide a springboard for increased volumes a\u0302\u0080\u0093 growth and volumes. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re also an active discussions with Exxon about activating an additional connecting pipeline, which will bring incremental crude volume from Jefferson to the expanded Exxon Beaumont refinery. Additionally, we will look to compliment this expansion by providing bidirectional service on the Southern Star crude oil pipeline between Jefferson and Motiva, allowing for increased blending capabilities and higher crude oil throughput at the terminal. In short, the much anticipated ramp at Jefferson is now upon us. Moving on Long Ridge. Long Ridge generated $7.5 million in EBITDA in Q2 versus $6.1 million in Q1. As we have communicated in the past, we target quarterly EBITDA for our 50% share of Long Ridge to be in the range of $12 million to $15 million per quarter. Our results for 2Q included the impact of gas purchases during the quarter that were required from external suppliers as we transitioned our internal gas production  gas and generated EBITDA for the month within our targets and going forward, we expect to continue steady EBITDA from the power plant in line with our targets. Development at Long Ridge continues to be robust. In July, we enter into agreements with Newlight Technologies for the construction of a new $300 million facility to rebuilt on Long Ridge property, which will produce carbon negative and biodegradable plastic products from natural gas, Long Ridge will sell power and natural gas to Newlight, as well as provide land under long term lease. In addition, we expect to be an investor in the project. If certain conditions are met, we expect the facility to be operational in 2024. Finally, to close that with Repauno. At Repauno, our key focus is on commencing a development of our Phase 2 LPG transloading system. This system is expected to triple our throughput capacity and quadruple our operating margins when it comes online in a couple of years. We have demand from multiple international off-takers and our goals to enter into a long-term agreement with one or more parties during the third quarter. We have completed engineering for the new storage tank and associating piping, and systems, and have negotiated construction contracts. We plan to finance all construction costs with tax exempt debt. In the meantime, in the second quarter, we expanded our existing capabilities by loading fully refrigerated LPG to large gas carrier marine vessels. With this important step, we move closer to our goal of loading VLGCs, or very large gas carriers across our dock facility. In addition, the newly expanded LPG truck racks continues to see how utilization providing both propane and butane to local heating and lending markets, meeting additional customer needs in the area. Finally, we continue to see increased interest in the renewable energy space with 250 acres primed for development. We have announced a coordinated effort to develop a unique marine cable manufacturing facility with Rise Light, which will provide a critical American made infrastructure link to bring renewable electricity from offshore wind generation to local consumers. Also our Clean Planet joint venture continues to progress through the permitting process for the first plastics recycling plant at Repauno. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re expecting to complete construction of the Clean Planet facility in 2024. With that, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll turn it back to Joe. And I would just say for infrastructure, we very much look forward to updating investors on a standalone basis starting next quarter. We do expect to post meaningful growth in the near-term across each of our four key business units. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a very attractive time to on long-term assets, well insulated from inflation and with high scarcity value in the countrya\u0302\u0080\u0099s largest industrial and energy markets. We view the growth of Transtar this quarter as a good indication of things to come and following the years of development where accelerating the pace of ramp up at Jefferson and Repauno terminals, while at Long Ridge with the power plant complete, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re now beginning to drive incremental cash flow and value. And Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll turn it back to Alan. Hey Josh, we are very close. I cana\u0302\u0080\u0099t tell you, we have a contract signed, with a, with an off taker. I will tell you the team at Repauno, spent the better part of two weeks in Europe recently. And I think wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re in a very good position to sign something up in the third quarter, plenty of demand from very large investment grade counterparties. We want make sure we sign the best deal. And but wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re close everythinga\u0302\u0080\u0099s ready to go, but wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not at the point yet where we have a contract executed, but wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re close. Thanks. Really no issues with congestion. I mean, we can handle double the train activity wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re handling today. I mean thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s one of the things wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been working on as wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve developed the terminal, ensuring that whether ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s inbound crew train through outbound refined, product trains, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve got plenty of capacity to handle the additional business. I, when we go through the calculation of, exactly what our throughput capacity is, therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s about 400,000 barrels per day, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s the capacity. We take all that stuff into consideration. I mean, I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t, I, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not too concerned about congestion issues. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve got plenty of track at the terminal. And so we havena\u0302\u0080\u0099t certainly havena\u0302\u0080\u0099t experienced any congestion to date and I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t, I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t think congestion is going to be an issue for us. That really, there should be a very short ramp up to that contract. I mean the operations commence when everything is built, what is being built specifically is just under 2 million barrels of total storage. So we have storage tanks that are under construction. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve built 4 million barrels to date. This is an additional 2 million wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re bringing online. And then just piping and manifolds. The way that system will work is we will receive refined products by pipe accumulate and store the refined products. And then we will load large ships for export of those products. So ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s really just down to storage tanks, piping, and manifolds all stuff wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve built before. So far on track for completion during the fourth quarter, feel pretty good with our ability to get it done. I would say mid part of the fourth quarter, although the team down there is, very focused on, completing as quickly as possible. Therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s not, I wouldna\u0302\u0080\u0099t say wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re at a stage of construction now where most of the risks that you would typically see geotechnical and what have you are behind us. And now wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re welding and painting. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not digging any holes or driving piles or anything like that that can, typically be a cause for delay. Yes, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll tell you wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re. I mean, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s always a ongoing dialogue. Right now, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not seeing any reduction, in movements. I mean, Exxon as active as ever in loading trains for movements down to Mexico, we watch it closely. And there are, on occasion percolation of, a story here or story there but at the end of the day, the country needs gasoline and diesel. And Exxona\u0302\u0080\u0099s got a base of about a thousand, ExxonMobil gas stations that they need to serve. And so we have not seen any issues or any slow downs, coming across from some of what you might read in the papers about, government interaction. And I would say for infrastructure, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s generally the same in terms of the ratios, obviously the infrastructure business, slightly smaller, business right now. But in terms of a ratio ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s in that sort of four to five times EBITDA target. The beauty of, the infrastructure businesses in terms of investment capital for growth. A lot of what we do is eligible for tax exempt financing, and thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s something wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve used historically at Jefferson. And we can use Repauno and potentially even at Long Ridge. And so, debt capacity obviously would be, will be smart and disciplined about, incurring debt. But wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been successful in the past growing through investment by accessing the tax exempt markets. And Jefferson, our average rate of borrowing is, in the high twos as an example, and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m not sure in this current market environment, Repauno for Phase 2 will be at a similar rate, but ita\u0302\u0080\u0099ll still be a significantly lower rate than, where the more traditional taxable markets would be. So, I feel like we can maintain a, four times to five times leverage ratio, but at the same time, continue to incur debt for specific projects at attractive levels."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q1 2022 Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. . I would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, Mr. Alan Andreini. Please go ahead.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Tanya. I would like to welcome you to the Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer; Ken Nicholson, our newly appointed CEO of FTAI Infrastructure; Scott Christopher, the Chief Financial Officer of FTAI, who will become the CFO of FTAI Infrastructure; and Angela Nam, the Chief Accounting Officer of FTAI, who will become the CFO of FTAI Aviation, which will be the new name of FTAI. We have posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you have not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only mode and is being webcast. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including FAD. The reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement. Before I turn the call over to Joe and Ken, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements by their nature are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our quarterly report filed with the SEC. Now I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Thank you, Alan. To start the call, I'm pleased to announce our 28th dividend as a public company and our 43rd consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on May 24 based on a shareholder record date of May 13. First, a couple of highlights. Yesterday, our Board formally approved the spin-off FTAI Infrastructure from FTAI. And we expect the spin to be completed in the next 4 to 8 weeks. Secondly, as to Russia, Ukraine war and our assets lost in that conflict, we are writing off $195 million in Q1 for impairments, bad debt and lost revenue, but we expect to recapture all of that $195 million over the coming year. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD or funds available for distribution. Absent the impact to our assets in the Russian-Ukraine war, which we estimate to be approximately $70 million in Q1, adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately $122 million, down 2% compared to $124.8 million in Q4 of 2021. And up 158% compared to $47.2 million in Q1 2021. Including onetime charges, actual adjusted EBITDA was $51.6 million in Q1 '22, which is down 60% compared to Q4 2021 and down 9% compared to Q1 2021. FAD was $71.4 million in Q1 2022, down 41% compared to $120.1 million in Q4 2021 and up 396% compared to $14.4 million in Q1 of 2021. During the first quarter, the $71.4 million FAD number was comprised of $117.1 million from our Aviation leasing portfolio, $7.1 million from our infrastructure businesses and negative $52.8 million from corporate and other. Turning now to Aviation. Let's start with the impact of the Russia's war in Ukraine. We reported Q1 2022 Aviation EBITDA of $48 million. Write-off of uncollectible debt or canceled leases with customers that ceased operations reduced EBITDA in the quarter by about $70 million. So we estimate EBITDA without the war effect would have been approximately $120 million or an improvement from Q4 2021 of $104 million. In addition, we are writing off 100% of the book value of $125 million of the 12 aircraft and 20 engines that remain today in Russia or Ukraine. For those aircraft and engines, we have filed insurance claims totaling $290 million, which we ultimately expect to recover most, if not all, of this amount. So when we do recover, all proceeds will be booked as income when received. We also took back 9 aircraft from Russian and Ukrainian operators and are under LOI to sell 4 of these aircraft to cargo operators at a gain of approximately $30 million, while the remaining 5 aircraft are all 737 NGs, for which there is very strong demand for both the aircraft and the engines. So we expect all 9 of those aircraft to be on lease or sold by the end of Q2. We'll be taking further advantage of the strong cargo market and expect to sell other 747 and 767 aircraft and engines for significant additional gains in Q2. Turning to our aerospace products. We posted Q1 '22 EBITDA of $16 million, comprised mostly of income from CFM56 module sales again this quarter. And looking ahead, given the very visible and robust recovery in air travel demand worldwide, we're seeing a significant ramp in activity and backlog for our aerospace products. We currently have a backlog of approximately 180 modules contracted or on order and over $100 million of used serviceable material USM sales on order through multiple programs with MROs, maintenance and repair organizations and airlines. We continue seeing growing market acceptance of our CFM56 product offerings with today over 20 active customers, including many of the world's largest airlines and independent maintenance shops and are importantly seeing a very high level of repeat usage. We expect demand to accelerate as heavy volumes of CFM56 shop visits are being scheduled now for the second half of this year. Let me now turn the call over to Ken to discuss infrastructure.\nKenneth Nicholson: Thank you very much, Joe. We're excited about the prospects for our infrastructure business. And to the next 3 slides, I'm going to talk about our recent results at each of our assets and highlight several projects and plans we have for growth in the coming months and the remainder of the year. It's an incredibly dynamic time in the transportation and energy markets with high commodity prices, extreme focus on energy security and the mounting forces pushing energy transition, and we are in a great position with each of our businesses ideally suited to act on these opportunities. Starting on Page 9 with Transtar. Transtar generated $34.1 million in revenue and $14.6 million in EBITDA for the quarter. Revenue was up $1.1 million or 3.5% quarter-over-quarter at slightly lower carloads were more than offset by higher average pricing. More specifically on carloads, cold-rolled steel shipments out of U.S. Steel rebounded in March, showing promise for continued improvements next quarter while hot rolled coil shipments have remained steady. Shipment cycle times that were delayed at customers for unloading in the fourth quarter and much of the first quarter are moving at a faster pace, permitting Transtar railcar fleets have turned more efficiently. EBITDA for the quarter was approximately -- it was impacted, I apologize by $2 million of nonrecurring items and the lagging fuel surcharge revenue. We experienced higher fuel costs in the first quarter for which we will be reimbursed in the second quarter due to the mechanics of our fuel surcharge program with U.S. Steel. Most importantly, cash flow from operations for the quarter was $16.6 million in excess of adjusted EBITDA as cash realized from the optimization of Transtar railcar fleet was $3 million for the quarter, more than offsetting capital expenditures of $1.1 million. We're very excited about the future for Transtar. We're accelerating our commercial focus on third-party business, adding to our commercial staff and pursuing a number of revenue enhancement programs. In total, we estimate an opportunity for approximately $30 million of incremental revenue -- sorry, incremental EBITDA over the next 12 to 24 months through these programs with minimal incremental capital need. Transtar is also an ideal platform for a fleet of acquisitions, and we're experiencing a growing pipeline of acquisition opportunities that we believe if successful in acquiring would be highly accretive to the business. Turning to Jefferson. First quarter EBITDA of $3.8 million was up 35% compared to $2.8 million in Q1 of '21 and up 66% compared to $2.3 million in Q4 of '21, driven largely by strong ship dock utilization for end up crude oil movements as well as the commencement of yellow wax crude by rail from the Uinta basin. With the recent disruptions in global trade flows, Jefferson's multimodal infrastructure provides customers valuable optionality to handle volumes via marine, pipeline and rail. For the first quarter of 2022, crude oil and refinery intermediate revenues have grown 15% versus Q4 and 50% year-over-year. Volumes to the terminal have more than tripled versus the first quarter of 2021 and have increased 32% versus last quarter. From a project perspective, Jefferson remains on schedule for the end of the year and on budget for the previously announced 10-year deal with ExxonMobil. That project will bring substantial committed throughput volume and revenue to the terminal via our cross-channel pipeline system and provide a springboard for increased volumes. With the dislocation in the energy markets and demand by our refineries for more secure sources of supply, we're seeing growing activity at Jefferson. One of the emerging markets for crude supplies in the Uinta Basin of Utah, where volumes of yellow wax crude have been rapidly growing to replace imported barrels. At Jefferson, we moved an average of 3 trains per month through the terminal in Q1. In the second quarter, we expect to move to 8 trains per month, and we have capacity of handling up to 24 trains per month, and that is our goal as we enter the second half of the year. Jefferson is the only terminal in the Beaumont region capable of transloading large quantities of yellow wax crude, and the process involves a significant amount of handling, heating railcars to unload the product and blending with lighter crude, so it's a particularly high-margin business for us. Turning to Long Ridge. We're pleased to report that our new 485-megawatt power plant is up and running on a continuing basis, and we expect to generate strong cash flows under our power sales agreements for years to come. In addition, we're taking advantage of our own natural gas assets to produce gas in excess of our power plants needs for sale into the merchant market where gas pricing needless to say, continues to be extremely strong. As the first quarter financials demonstrate, we took an unscheduled maintenance outage during the quarter to repair and complete commissioning of one of our steam turbines. The outage lasted approximately 6 weeks and represented an approximate $8 million adverse impact on EBITDA for the quarter due to lost revenues during the outage. All costs to make the repairs were covered under warranty. While far from ideal, the outage did result in 2 positives. First, we performed maintenance that was originally scheduled to take place in April, letting us avoid taking that outage and setting the stage for an upgrade in power production to 505 megawatts at little to no cost. Second, we completed our hydrogen blending project. In March, we became the first utility scale power plant in the United States to run on hydrogen, starting with a 5% blend. This is an important development of the national infrastructure bill, which was passed last year includes $8 billion of funding for the development of hydrogen hubs, and we have applied as a recipient. As an early mover with multiple advantages, Long Ridge is well positioned to secure funding from this program. So with the power plant in good shape, we are now focused on driving incremental growth by securing new business from power-intensive industries that want to locate new facilities at Long Ridge. We're seeing a robust pipeline of prospects and expect to announce our first major counterparty in the coming months. Finally, Repauno. Building on a successful first year of operation in 2021, we're kicking off the 2022 season in very good shape. Our business today is somewhat seasonal with activity picking up in the month of April and continuing into the fourth quarter, so expect Repauno to generate solid results in the second and third quarters in particular. The newly expanded LPG truck rack has seen high utilization, providing both propane and butane to local heating and blending markets during a period of significant market volatility. Our newly commissioned cavern chiller allows for fully refrigerated butane exports, and we have executed on a base agreement with an international off taker for multiple cargoes beginning this month. We expect to move over 175 million gallons of LPG in 2022 versus 130 million gallons in 2021 with upside to over 250 million gallons with spot movements, which are on the increase. We continue to advance our build-out plans for additional product storage, increased rail access with the construction of a double unit train loop, 600,000 barrels of new storage and pipeline connectivity in major production areas. We're finalizing permitting and construction contracting for the new storage facility, which will more than double our throughput capacity and triple cash flow potential once complete. We expect to fund the capacity entirely low-cost tax exempt debt making the expansion highly accretive. With that, let me turn it back over to Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks, Ken. It's hard to imagine a 2-year period that's been more difficult and volatile than the last 2 between COVID and the war in Ukraine. Our business models have been stress tested in ways that we would never have expected. The good news is FTAI has come through this period in good shape and in fact, very good shape. The aviation industry is once again in growth mode and our aerospace products are more in demand now than we had ever thought. And with the world's rediscovered desire for more energy independence, our infrastructure assets are more critical today and more valuable than they were just 2 months ago. Putting it all together, it's a perfect time to separate the companies. To that end, we filed this morning our public Form 10, which means that we should have 2 separate trading companies in the next 4 to 8 weeks. Heading FTAI Infrastructure will be Ken Nicholson, who you just heard from. Ken has been my partner for over 20 years, including the last 10 since we started FTAI, and I'm very excited to be working with him in this new role. To sum it up, after years of preparation, the separation of FTAI Aviation and FTAI Infrastructure is now at hand, and we're very excited by the prospects for both companies. Turning back to Alan now.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Joe. Tanya, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: . And our first question comes from Justin Long of Stephens.\nJustin Long : I wanted to start with aviation. Last quarter, you talked about the run rate for EBITDA from aviation being around $550 million, and that included $50 million to $100 million from aerospace services. So at the midpoint, if you strip that out, aviation leasing was expected to do about $475 million of EBITDA. If you set Russia and Ukraine aside and take that out of numbers, what does that pro forma number look like going forward?\nJoseph Adams : Yes. So I'll give you the answer first, and then I'll sort of walk back through how I get there. And the answer, I think, for the year would be $475 million of EBITDA for both leasing and aerospace products. And I would use $375 million of EBITDA for leasing and $100 million now for aerospace products. We're more comfortable, I think, at the high end of that earlier range given the widespread acceptance and the backlog that we see building. So if you take the $475 million and then you look at the $375 million for the leasing, as I mentioned, we had about $35 million of leasing EBITDA in Q1 and the war in Ukraine cost us about 70, so call that roughly $105 million if the war hadn't happened for the leasing business. And so that if you use that as a base, the assets that we -- that came off lease that I mentioned that are either off-lease or stuck in Russia Ukraine figure that's about a $20 million impact to Q2 negative impact. But we added business from the Avianca deal is about . So net-net, that's probably $95 million for Q2 from leasing. And then on top of that, we're going to have, as I mentioned, a $30 million gain from a sale of the 4 cargo claims that we were able to get back. So called Q2 roughly $125 million. And then if you look at the balance of that to get to $375 million to $380 million is about $220 million for Q3 and Q4. So that's kind of how I get to that number, and hopefully, that's helpful because I apologize for all the variances and changes, but this -- our world was sort of interrupted unfortunately, as many people have been, but that's the math.\nJustin Long : That's extremely helpful. I know there's a lot going on. So on that last point about the $220 million in the back half of the year, does that assume any gains?\nJoseph Adams : No.\nJustin Long : Okay. And I guess, secondly, on Jefferson, any update on what you're expecting in terms of EBITDA over the remainder of the year and how things could ramp, and it was helpful to get some color on the trends per month that you're expecting in the back half. But curious if you could put a sensitivity around that in terms of what one train per month means to EBITDA?\nKenneth Nicholson: Yes. Justin. Happy to do that. Maybe to answer your specific question, one train per month, one train of yellow wax crude can generate -- it depends, but anywhere up to $100,000 of EBITDA to significant. This is one of the reasons we're so bullish and so excited about it. Unloading one train can be a very high-margin business between the heating involved, the blending and what have you. So it could be very substantial for Jefferson, and we're excited about the trends we're seeing here in the second quarter. Big picture with Jefferson, obviously, we have a lot going on. We've got big Exxon contracts kicking off at the early part of next year. Our ultimate goal is to get Jefferson to $80 million to $100 million of EBITDA, a precise trajectory for which we get there is -- I can't provide that kind of precision quarter-over-quarter. But our goal is at the end of the year. And as we kick off the new Exxon business in January of next year to be pretty close to that number on a run rate basis.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citi.\nChristian Wetherbee : Maybe just on the leasing side. I think, Joe, you mentioned that you'd recover -- I think you said all of the $195 million that you're writing down. I guess could you help us sort of bridge that gap? Are you talking specifically about the leasing business? And is that just sort of new business opportunities that are out there? Is it a combination of that and insurance recoveries? I just want to make sure I understand how you're thinking about that.\nJoseph Adams : So yes, the recovering of the $195 million is really primarily would be from insurance and recovery of that debt, not from any additional activity around that. So that's what we were referring to in that. And I think the -- as I mentioned, we filed $290 million of insurance claims $75 million of that is for assets that are in Ukraine that look to us. We don't have a first-hand inspection. We have aerial photos of the area, that look destroyed. So that is pretty straightforward from an insurance point of view. So the other ones in Russia are -- ultimately, you have to prove that you can't get your assets back. But every day that goes by, that seems to be easier and easier to prove. So I think that it's going to become fairly clear. So a big chunk of, I think what we're referring to that $195 is the insurance recovery ultimately for those assets.\nChristian Wetherbee : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then just on Jefferson, I just want to make sure I understood the point there on the slide about the ramp-up. When you think about the 8 trains. I know we have 24, I think, monthly trains of capacity. We're thinking about 8 trains. I just want to make sure, is that the April run rate that we're on right now? Or are you expecting sort of a run rate to accelerate as you go into May and June to be able to hit that for the second quarter?\nKenneth Nicholson: No, that is the run rate we are on currently.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Giuliano Bologna of Compass Point.\nGiuliano Bologna : I guess to start off, continuing along a similar topic on the Jefferson terminal. The details around the trains and the capacity are very helpful. But the first thing I was interested in thinking of your plan about is that there\u2019s actually an increased focus on importing  from Canada and a large part of that would most likely be coming via rail. And you guys obviously have a rail terminal. I realize that a big part of what you're mapping out here is not necessarily from Canada on the train side initially, but I'm curious if there are opportunities on the Canadian side to get long-term agreements in place for multiyear supplies or it might be the potential to get the  built Canadian side putting that forward. And then the kind of add-on to that is, I'm curious if the capacity is any different if you're bringing in crude from Canada versus yellow wax and if the EBITDA contribution would be any different between the 2.\nKenneth Nicholson: Yes. Look, the general tone and atmospherics around Canadian crude by rail are very positive. The White House making statements weeks ago regarding increased imports from Canada by any mode other than pipe. So that's a very good thing for crude by rail. I would tell you the activity today is still relatively light compared to where the activity was pre-COVID, about 2 to 3 trains a day get loaded in Canada, in Alberta and Saskatchewan regions, and that number was between 10 and 12 trains pre-COVID. So we're still a relatively reduced levels, but it is growing. And with the White House sentiment, we are bullish that we're going to start seeing some crude trains coming in from Canada in the short term. Hard to specifically quantify that, but I do think we'll start to see a good uptick. Specifically on your point, the economics I described on the Uinta Basin, yellow wax crude, they're roughly the same for Canadian crude. It's also a very heavy barrel that requires heating when it comes in and tankers and generally requires blending. And so the economics are typically the same. We'd love to see more Canadian crude coming in. We have the capacity to handle it. We've got plenty of storage. We have blending capabilities. So we're eager to see that market pick up.\nGiuliano Bologna : That's great. And then moving up to a slightly different topic. But on the aviation side and more so on the aerospace services -- partially on the aerospace services side. I know that you guys already an approval for the first PMA part. I was curious if there's any on the timing for the second PMA part? And then as a little bit add on to that question for the second PMA part. I'm curious if you have a lot of order first out of the first 2 parts combined, you have the order book for parts are shipping up there.\nJoseph Adams : Yes, the parts and development there's a number of parts that are in development, they're all progressing. And there's a very active dialogue in terms of -- with the regulators. So those are all making very good progress, and we expect to see them in various points of approval over the next year. So those are moving ahead. And there is -- until they're approved, we have conditional orders, but it really doesn't translate into and actually get the approval. So I'm confident that there is demand. There's demand certainly from us and our engines, and we believe from the market. So\u2026\nOperator: And our next question comes from Greg Lewis of BTIG.\nGregory Lewis : I just had a question on aviation. Clearly, a couple of factors have driven the ability for the team to start monetizing or selling off some aircraft into the cargo. You mentioned that. It doesn't sound like we're going to see much more of that as the year plays out. But just kind of curious, how should we think about the monetization of those assets and the recycling of that cash here as we look out over the next couple of quarters?\nJoseph Adams : Well, there is potential for more of that. I was just commenting that in the base numbers, it's not built in. So I think that we are thinking of that the cargo market is at a really, really robust demand level, which maybe doesn't last forever. Historically, that's been true. And so we'll probably take more opportunity to monetize some of the cargo aircraft and engines in Q2 and Q3. And then the other potential monetization, as I talked about last quarter, some of the newer airplanes that we acquired on the Avianca deal and some of the other ones with long-term leases can be easily sold to other leasing companies today at very good prices, and we're close to doing a couple of deals where we would sell those at a gain and then retain the engine services contract for the next 7 to 8 years. So from our point of view, it's the ultimate best of all worlds, you acquire something, you sell it, again, take all your capital out and you retain the part of the business that we love, which is servicing the engines. And so that is a model that I think we think can be replicated. So we believe we can do more of that, and that will allow us to recycle capital and then also simultaneously build the backlog for our aerospace services products and lock that in. So very excited about that. I think the first couple of deals could happen in the next quarter or 2, and we think we'll be doing more of that. And overall, from a portfolio point of view, we're headed, as we mentioned, towards increasing the percentage of CFM56 product in our portfolio. It's today probably about up from 50% to about 60%. And I would expect, over time, to see that grow even to 70% or 80%, given the significant competitive advantage and the huge market opportunity that we have in that space.\nGregory Lewis : Okay. That's great to hear, Joe. And then I guess maybe this one is for Ken. Congratulations on, I guess, taking over the Infrastructure side. I know it's been discussed that there's been -- there's a lot of money on the sidelines in terms of looking at investment in infrastructure. And clearly, the company over the years has shown an ability or willingness to kind of partner with other investors to kind of build out the business and even do some asset monetization on your end. Just kind of curious how that's -- what that's looking like? Is there any update or any color you can kind of give us around the potential to bring on additional partners into the infrastructure business, maybe post or prior to the spin?\nKennethNicholson: Yes. Look, I mean, it's a pretty robust environment out there. There's -- as you said, there's a lot of capital available, but there are a lot of assets, a lot of infrastructure needs. We're always looking for projects. I would say generally, we'd be partnering with folks on the strategic front. Some of our customers, that's where it makes more sense for terminal build-outs where we put capital in customers, we help make their supply chains more efficient and what have you. I think there's a huge opportunity out there. In the rail space, we've got 3 or 4 different acquisitions we're currently looking at. I'm not sure those are anything we necessarily partner with folks on. Those are things that we would have the capacity to do on our own, more on the ports and terminal space where we're building out capacity, that's where joint ventures and partnerships like that could start to make a fair amount of sense.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Zazula of Barclays.\nDavid Zazula : Joe. I guess first one is on used serviceable material. Airlines in general have been really ramping up and placing a premium on capacity and trying to use more aircraft. I guess I'm wondering whether you think that will have a positive or negative effect on the used serviceable material market and your business going forward? It seems like you're counting on some significant ramp going on this year?\nJoseph Adams : Yes, it's a good point. And we've mentioned that there hadn't been a lot of transacting in the used serviceable  market until the shop visits start to really pick up, which they are now. And so we're looking at a meaningful growth. I mentioned $100 million backlog of USM. And it's one of the reasons I think we're comfortable with the high end of the range for $100 million for aerospace products as that business will start to meaningfully contribute now in Q2 -- starting in Q2 and for the rest of the year. So the demand is very real. It's actually getting to be harder to find the parts now than it is to sell them. So that's a very good sign. And we have been building inventory. One of the constraints on new service material is getting the parts repaired because you take them out of an old engine you have to -- many of them have to be repaired. The repair shops are short staff. They don't have the supply chain constraints. So we have built a fair amount of inventory that we have repaired. So we're actually a pretty attractive partner for many of these airlines and also particularly the maintenance shops. And what we're trying to do with the USM now is use that as a lever to get more module transactions as well. So in other words, we can decide who to give our valuable USM to if they, in turn, do more business with us on the module side.\nDavid Zazula : That's helpful. And then just a follow on for Ken or Scott, maybe. I guess you put out a potential number for increased spot market activity at Repauno. I guess, should we think about that as being kind of proportional run rate as far as how much it flows down to the bottom line? Or is that something that maybe you'd see a higher margin on that incremental activity?\nKenneth Nicholson: Yes. You got it right. It is higher margin on the incremental activity. The -- on that slide, we showed Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 is what is operating today, and that's representative of the total margin out of Phase 1 operating at about 90% of its capacity. Phase 2, we need to build more storage in a loop track that's underway. We're just completing the permitting. That's going to take 12-months plus to actually put into place, but it was meant to be illustrative to give you a sense for the incremental margin that comes out of that. It is a higher-margin business because it just has more scale. And so the actual contribution per gallon or per barrel is higher after Phase II gets implemented. Phase II will start construction in another month or 2 or year. And as I said, that will take 12-plus months to implement, but we wanted to make sure people understood how accretive that could be. We've also applied for authorization to issue tax exempt debt to build out the entirety of that project. And so I think it could be incredibly accretive for Repauno.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brian Mckenna of JMP Securities.\nBrian Mckenna : I know the big focus in the near term is getting the spin completed and deleveraging the business. But for the stand-alone aviation company, how should we think about the capital management strategy longer term, given what will be a healthy cash flowing business? And then can you just remind us what are the expected CapEx needs on a recurring go-forward basis for the business?\nJoseph Adams : Yes. So there is -- and we put out a slide on the capital structure in the deck, which I think is very helpful because the spin itself will generate $800 million of capital for aviation or FTAI aviation, which will reduce debt roughly to about $1.9 billion pro forma for the spin. And then in addition, as I mentioned, we have a potential asset sales of $300 million and another $200 million of insurance proceeds, which could bring possibly bring debt down to about $1.2 billion and equity to about $1.3 billion. So we'd be almost 1:1 debt to total debt to equity and under 3x debt to EBITDA. So very, very strong pro forma financial profile coming out of the spin. Now that gives us the opportunity, and I think we're trying to get positioned so that we could be very opportunistic in what almost certainly, there will be some more volatility and that creates opportunities for us to be able to use that firepower when the situations present themselves. So we're working to get ourselves set up to be able to really capitalize on that while aviation is in a very strong growth and recovery mode.\nBrian Mckenna : Got it. And then just a bigger picture question. Given the geopolitical events that have taken place this year, does it make you rethink at all your global strategy and footprint within aviation? And then can you just remind us how much of the leasing portfolio is tied to the U.S., Europe and then the rest of the world?\nJoseph Adams : Europe is the biggest for us. It's 60%, 60%. And U.S. is probably 25%. So I -- I don't think you could -- I think Russia is unique in a way. I think there's not a country in the world that's sort of analogous that it was -- that was able to do what they did. So I think that people have accepted that that's probably not something that's going to happen in any other place, really. I don't see that as a significant risk. So obviously, it's -- it was a shock. I think the insurance market is going to pay and they'll raise rates, but I think people are going to continue leasing airplanes all around the world. And I don't see it as a major change other than I think Russia will be off limits of  maybe a long, long time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan of Benchmark Corporation.\nJoshua Sullivan: Just as far as follow-up on that financing question, what are your thoughts on the time in year approach to the $800 million?\nKenneth Nicholson: It's Ken. We're very close. I would say it's very well advanced, and it is next few weeks. I think things are pretty well organized, and we should be having that financing all complete and committed literally in a few weeks. Feeling good about it.\nJoshua Sullivan : Okay. And then just one on aerospace. What's the appetite by airlines for additional sale leasebacks, air traffic picking up airlines still having eon capacity here, interest rates moving, your aero parts offerings maturing, a lot of moving parts here, but just curious on the signals you're getting from the sale-leaseback market.\nJoseph Adams : It's good. I mean airlines are still -- they all lost money in Q1. They're all very positive, but they're still losing money. So they need capital, they need capital partners. So I think leasing as a percent of total fleet is 60% now, it's been increasing. So if anything, the airlines have proven that they're more volatile than people realize. So it's yet again. So I think leasing is a very critical part of their business model and sale leasebacks are definitely on the table. I mean we've been catching the airlines on a sale leaseback where we manage the engines for them, which is another way of them getting out of the business of having to manage shop visit. So it's additional reduction in capital for them, which they like, and it's great for us. So that's been our pitch, and we're very flexible, very good to work with. And so we've converted, I think, quite a few airlines already over to that where they don't really want to manage shop visits again. So we want to be the largest aftermarket engine shop provider or power provider in the business. So we're -- I think we have a differentiated and better model to a product that is really important for them.\nJoshua Sullivan : So would those be kind of like power by the hour type relationships?\nJoseph Adams : No. I mean it's still at least. We're not going to go power by the hour for, but you'd have a minimum rent. And then when the engine is due for its major overhaul, we do an exchange. And so instead of the engine, typically now, if you have a 10-year lease or 8-year lease and the shop visit is requiring you a 4, the airline has to do the shop visit it has to go out and get a spare engine, and it could take 6 months or 9 months, and it could cost $1 million just in getting a spare in transportation and all the downtime. So by giving an exchange, so we'll just -- instead of beyond having to manage that shop visit we just supply them with a new engine, and they give us the runout engine. And so that then eliminates the downtime for them. They save money and then we manage the shop visits. And all along the way, we're collecting maintenance reserves. So we're actually compensated for the maintenance and then some because we have a lower cost. So it's a win-win.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Robert Dodd of Raymond James.\nRobert Dodd : Just back to the aviation and kind of related business spend. I mean, what can you tell us about the expected dividend policy/mix, aviation versus infrastructure going forward and particularly on the aviation side, I mean how should we think about it beyond just what it's going to be post-spin, but what conceptually could be the driver of whether that increases stays flat, et cetera.\nJoseph Adams : Yes. So the aviation business should generate a lot of free cash flow going forward. We'll have, as I mentioned, we'll have a strong balance sheet. We'll have sort of an ability to recycle capital and grow the earnings. And so that's a perfect model to be able to increase dividends. And -- that's been our objective from the beginning, we've been able to maintain the dividend in this -- even in this tumultuous period. And we think that the future would allow us to grow that for the aviation business.\nRobert Dodd : Perfect. And one follow-up, if I can, also the aviation, post restructuring have spin and restructuring the balance sheet, do you have a target ROE? I mean, pre-Russia, pre-COVID, the aviation leasing business was regularly in the, call it, the mid-teens ROE. Is -- do you think that's an achievable target going forward with the newly lower leverage balance sheet or well, the previous one didn't have an . But any kind of target you think is achievable for that business on the leasing side or on the combined leasing plus maintenance side?\nJoseph Adams : I think it could be substantially higher than that into the 20s, even 30s in terms of ROE. So I believe that's very doable.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Andreini for closing remarks.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q2.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joseph Adams",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan. To start the call, I'm pleased to announce our 28th dividend as a public company and our 43rd consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.33 per share will be paid on May 24 based on a shareholder record date of May 13. First, a couple of highlights. Yesterday, our Board formally approved the spin-off FTAI Infrastructure from FTAI. And we expect the spin to be completed in the next 4 to 8 weeks. Secondly, as to Russia, Ukraine war and our assets lost in that conflict, we are writing off $195 million in Q1 for impairments, bad debt and lost revenue, but we expect to recapture all of that $195 million over the coming year. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA and FAD or funds available for distribution. Absent the impact to our assets in the Russian-Ukraine war, which we estimate to be approximately $70 million in Q1, adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately $122 million, down 2% compared to $124.8 million in Q4 of 2021. And up 158% compared to $47.2 million in Q1 2021. Including onetime charges, actual adjusted EBITDA was $51.6 million in Q1 '22, which is down 60% compared to Q4 2021 and down 9% compared to Q1 2021. FAD was $71.4 million in Q1 2022, down 41% compared to $120.1 million in Q4 2021 and up 396% compared to $14.4 million in Q1 of 2021. During the first quarter, the $71.4 million FAD number was comprised of $117.1 million from our Aviation leasing portfolio, $7.1 million from our infrastructure businesses and negative $52.8 million from corporate and other. Turning now to Aviation. Let's start with the impact of the Russia's war in Ukraine. We reported Q1 2022 Aviation EBITDA of $48 million. Write-off of uncollectible debt or canceled leases with customers that ceased operations reduced EBITDA in the quarter by about $70 million. So we estimate EBITDA without the war effect would have been approximately $120 million or an improvement from Q4 2021 of $104 million. In addition, we are writing off 100% of the book value of $125 million of the 12 aircraft and 20 engines that remain today in Russia or Ukraine. For those aircraft and engines, we have filed insurance claims totaling $290 million, which we ultimately expect to recover most, if not all, of this amount. So when we do recover, all proceeds will be booked as income when received. We also took back 9 aircraft from Russian and Ukrainian operators and are under LOI to sell 4 of these aircraft to cargo operators at a gain of approximately $30 million, while the remaining 5 aircraft are all 737 NGs, for which there is very strong demand for both the aircraft and the engines. So we expect all 9 of those aircraft to be on lease or sold by the end of Q2. We'll be taking further advantage of the strong cargo market and expect to sell other 747 and 767 aircraft and engines for significant additional gains in Q2. Turning to our aerospace products. We posted Q1 '22 EBITDA of $16 million, comprised mostly of income from CFM56 module sales again this quarter. And looking ahead, given the very visible and robust recovery in air travel demand worldwide, we're seeing a significant ramp in activity and backlog for our aerospace products. We currently have a backlog of approximately 180 modules contracted or on order and over $100 million of used serviceable material USM sales on order through multiple programs with MROs, maintenance and repair organizations and airlines. We continue seeing growing market acceptance of our CFM56 product offerings with today over 20 active customers, including many of the world's largest airlines and independent maintenance shops and are importantly seeing a very high level of repeat usage. We expect demand to accelerate as heavy volumes of CFM56 shop visits are being scheduled now for the second half of this year. Let me now turn the call over to Ken to discuss infrastructure. Thanks, Ken. It's hard to imagine a 2-year period that's been more difficult and volatile than the last 2 between COVID and the war in Ukraine. Our business models have been stress tested in ways that we would never have expected. The good news is FTAI has come through this period in good shape and in fact, very good shape. The aviation industry is once again in growth mode and our aerospace products are more in demand now than we had ever thought. And with the world's rediscovered desire for more energy independence, our infrastructure assets are more critical today and more valuable than they were just 2 months ago. Putting it all together, it's a perfect time to separate the companies. To that end, we filed this morning our public Form 10, which means that we should have 2 separate trading companies in the next 4 to 8 weeks. Heading FTAI Infrastructure will be Ken Nicholson, who you just heard from. Ken has been my partner for over 20 years, including the last 10 since we started FTAI, and I'm very excited to be working with him in this new role. To sum it up, after years of preparation, the separation of FTAI Aviation and FTAI Infrastructure is now at hand, and we're very excited by the prospects for both companies. Turning back to Alan now. Yes. So I'll give you the answer first, and then I'll sort of walk back through how I get there. And the answer, I think, for the year would be $475 million of EBITDA for both leasing and aerospace products. And I would use $375 million of EBITDA for leasing and $100 million now for aerospace products. We're more comfortable, I think, at the high end of that earlier range given the widespread acceptance and the backlog that we see building. So if you take the $475 million and then you look at the $375 million for the leasing, as I mentioned, we had about $35 million of leasing EBITDA in Q1 and the war in Ukraine cost us about 70, so call that roughly $105 million if the war hadn't happened for the leasing business. And so that if you use that as a base, the assets that we -- that came off lease that I mentioned that are either off-lease or stuck in Russia Ukraine figure that's about a $20 million impact to Q2 negative impact. But we added business from the Avianca deal is about . So net-net, that's probably $95 million for Q2 from leasing. And then on top of that, we're going to have, as I mentioned, a $30 million gain from a sale of the 4 cargo claims that we were able to get back. So called Q2 roughly $125 million. And then if you look at the balance of that to get to $375 million to $380 million is about $220 million for Q3 and Q4. So that's kind of how I get to that number, and hopefully, that's helpful because I apologize for all the variances and changes, but this -- our world was sort of interrupted unfortunately, as many people have been, but that's the math. No. So yes, the recovering of the $195 million is really primarily would be from insurance and recovery of that debt, not from any additional activity around that. So that's what we were referring to in that. And I think the -- as I mentioned, we filed $290 million of insurance claims $75 million of that is for assets that are in Ukraine that look to us. We don't have a first-hand inspection. We have aerial photos of the area, that look destroyed. So that is pretty straightforward from an insurance point of view. So the other ones in Russia are -- ultimately, you have to prove that you can't get your assets back. But every day that goes by, that seems to be easier and easier to prove. So I think that it's going to become fairly clear. So a big chunk of, I think what we're referring to that $195 is the insurance recovery ultimately for those assets. Yes, the parts and development there's a number of parts that are in development, they're all progressing. And there's a very active dialogue in terms of -- with the regulators. So those are all making very good progress, and we expect to see them in various points of approval over the next year. So those are moving ahead. And there is -- until they're approved, we have conditional orders, but it really doesn't translate into and actually get the approval. So I'm confident that there is demand. There's demand certainly from us and our engines, and we believe from the market. So... Well, there is potential for more of that. I was just commenting that in the base numbers, it's not built in. So I think that we are thinking of that the cargo market is at a really, really robust demand level, which maybe doesn't last forever. Historically, that's been true. And so we'll probably take more opportunity to monetize some of the cargo aircraft and engines in Q2 and Q3. And then the other potential monetization, as I talked about last quarter, some of the newer airplanes that we acquired on the Avianca deal and some of the other ones with long-term leases can be easily sold to other leasing companies today at very good prices, and we're close to doing a couple of deals where we would sell those at a gain and then retain the engine services contract for the next 7 to 8 years. So from our point of view, it's the ultimate best of all worlds, you acquire something, you sell it, again, take all your capital out and you retain the part of the business that we love, which is servicing the engines. And so that is a model that I think we think can be replicated. So we believe we can do more of that, and that will allow us to recycle capital and then also simultaneously build the backlog for our aerospace services products and lock that in. So very excited about that. I think the first couple of deals could happen in the next quarter or 2, and we think we'll be doing more of that. And overall, from a portfolio point of view, we're headed, as we mentioned, towards increasing the percentage of CFM56 product in our portfolio. It's today probably about up from 50% to about 60%. And I would expect, over time, to see that grow even to 70% or 80%, given the significant competitive advantage and the huge market opportunity that we have in that space. Yes, it's a good point. And we've mentioned that there hadn't been a lot of transacting in the used serviceable  market until the shop visits start to really pick up, which they are now. And so we're looking at a meaningful growth. I mentioned $100 million backlog of USM. And it's one of the reasons I think we're comfortable with the high end of the range for $100 million for aerospace products as that business will start to meaningfully contribute now in Q2 -- starting in Q2 and for the rest of the year. So the demand is very real. It's actually getting to be harder to find the parts now than it is to sell them. So that's a very good sign. And we have been building inventory. One of the constraints on new service material is getting the parts repaired because you take them out of an old engine you have to -- many of them have to be repaired. The repair shops are short staff. They don't have the supply chain constraints. So we have built a fair amount of inventory that we have repaired. So we're actually a pretty attractive partner for many of these airlines and also particularly the maintenance shops. And what we're trying to do with the USM now is use that as a lever to get more module transactions as well. So in other words, we can decide who to give our valuable USM to if they, in turn, do more business with us on the module side. Yes. So there is -- and we put out a slide on the capital structure in the deck, which I think is very helpful because the spin itself will generate $800 million of capital for aviation or FTAI aviation, which will reduce debt roughly to about $1.9 billion pro forma for the spin. And then in addition, as I mentioned, we have a potential asset sales of $300 million and another $200 million of insurance proceeds, which could bring possibly bring debt down to about $1.2 billion and equity to about $1.3 billion. So we'd be almost 1:1 debt to total debt to equity and under 3x debt to EBITDA. So very, very strong pro forma financial profile coming out of the spin. Now that gives us the opportunity, and I think we're trying to get positioned so that we could be very opportunistic in what almost certainly, there will be some more volatility and that creates opportunities for us to be able to use that firepower when the situations present themselves. So we're working to get ourselves set up to be able to really capitalize on that while aviation is in a very strong growth and recovery mode. Europe is the biggest for us. It's 60%, 60%. And U.S. is probably 25%. So I -- I don't think you could -- I think Russia is unique in a way. I think there's not a country in the world that's sort of analogous that it was -- that was able to do what they did. So I think that people have accepted that that's probably not something that's going to happen in any other place, really. I don't see that as a significant risk. So obviously, it's -- it was a shock. I think the insurance market is going to pay and they'll raise rates, but I think people are going to continue leasing airplanes all around the world. And I don't see it as a major change other than I think Russia will be off limits of  maybe a long, long time. It's good. I mean airlines are still -- they all lost money in Q1. They're all very positive, but they're still losing money. So they need capital, they need capital partners. So I think leasing as a percent of total fleet is 60% now, it's been increasing. So if anything, the airlines have proven that they're more volatile than people realize. So it's yet again. So I think leasing is a very critical part of their business model and sale leasebacks are definitely on the table. I mean we've been catching the airlines on a sale leaseback where we manage the engines for them, which is another way of them getting out of the business of having to manage shop visit. So it's additional reduction in capital for them, which they like, and it's great for us. So that's been our pitch, and we're very flexible, very good to work with. And so we've converted, I think, quite a few airlines already over to that where they don't really want to manage shop visits again. So we want to be the largest aftermarket engine shop provider or power provider in the business. So we're -- I think we have a differentiated and better model to a product that is really important for them. No. I mean it's still at least. We're not going to go power by the hour for, but you'd have a minimum rent. And then when the engine is due for its major overhaul, we do an exchange. And so instead of the engine, typically now, if you have a 10-year lease or 8-year lease and the shop visit is requiring you a 4, the airline has to do the shop visit it has to go out and get a spare engine, and it could take 6 months or 9 months, and it could cost $1 million just in getting a spare in transportation and all the downtime. So by giving an exchange, so we'll just -- instead of beyond having to manage that shop visit we just supply them with a new engine, and they give us the runout engine. And so that then eliminates the downtime for them. They save money and then we manage the shop visits. And all along the way, we're collecting maintenance reserves. So we're actually compensated for the maintenance and then some because we have a lower cost. So it's a win-win. Yes. So the aviation business should generate a lot of free cash flow going forward. We'll have, as I mentioned, we'll have a strong balance sheet. We'll have sort of an ability to recycle capital and grow the earnings. And so that's a perfect model to be able to increase dividends. And -- that's been our objective from the beginning, we've been able to maintain the dividend in this -- even in this tumultuous period. And we think that the future would allow us to grow that for the aviation business. I think it could be substantially higher than that into the 20s, even 30s in terms of ROE. So I believe that's very doable."

            "name": "Kenneth Nicholson",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Joe. We're excited about the prospects for our infrastructure business. And to the next 3 slides, I'm going to talk about our recent results at each of our assets and highlight several projects and plans we have for growth in the coming months and the remainder of the year. It's an incredibly dynamic time in the transportation and energy markets with high commodity prices, extreme focus on energy security and the mounting forces pushing energy transition, and we are in a great position with each of our businesses ideally suited to act on these opportunities. Starting on Page 9 with Transtar. Transtar generated $34.1 million in revenue and $14.6 million in EBITDA for the quarter. Revenue was up $1.1 million or 3.5% quarter-over-quarter at slightly lower carloads were more than offset by higher average pricing. More specifically on carloads, cold-rolled steel shipments out of U.S. Steel rebounded in March, showing promise for continued improvements next quarter while hot rolled coil shipments have remained steady. Shipment cycle times that were delayed at customers for unloading in the fourth quarter and much of the first quarter are moving at a faster pace, permitting Transtar railcar fleets have turned more efficiently. EBITDA for the quarter was approximately -- it was impacted, I apologize by $2 million of nonrecurring items and the lagging fuel surcharge revenue. We experienced higher fuel costs in the first quarter for which we will be reimbursed in the second quarter due to the mechanics of our fuel surcharge program with U.S. Steel. Most importantly, cash flow from operations for the quarter was $16.6 million in excess of adjusted EBITDA as cash realized from the optimization of Transtar railcar fleet was $3 million for the quarter, more than offsetting capital expenditures of $1.1 million. We're very excited about the future for Transtar. We're accelerating our commercial focus on third-party business, adding to our commercial staff and pursuing a number of revenue enhancement programs. In total, we estimate an opportunity for approximately $30 million of incremental revenue -- sorry, incremental EBITDA over the next 12 to 24 months through these programs with minimal incremental capital need. Transtar is also an ideal platform for a fleet of acquisitions, and we're experiencing a growing pipeline of acquisition opportunities that we believe if successful in acquiring would be highly accretive to the business. Turning to Jefferson. First quarter EBITDA of $3.8 million was up 35% compared to $2.8 million in Q1 of '21 and up 66% compared to $2.3 million in Q4 of '21, driven largely by strong ship dock utilization for end up crude oil movements as well as the commencement of yellow wax crude by rail from the Uinta basin. With the recent disruptions in global trade flows, Jefferson's multimodal infrastructure provides customers valuable optionality to handle volumes via marine, pipeline and rail. For the first quarter of 2022, crude oil and refinery intermediate revenues have grown 15% versus Q4 and 50% year-over-year. Volumes to the terminal have more than tripled versus the first quarter of 2021 and have increased 32% versus last quarter. From a project perspective, Jefferson remains on schedule for the end of the year and on budget for the previously announced 10-year deal with ExxonMobil. That project will bring substantial committed throughput volume and revenue to the terminal via our cross-channel pipeline system and provide a springboard for increased volumes. With the dislocation in the energy markets and demand by our refineries for more secure sources of supply, we're seeing growing activity at Jefferson. One of the emerging markets for crude supplies in the Uinta Basin of Utah, where volumes of yellow wax crude have been rapidly growing to replace imported barrels. At Jefferson, we moved an average of 3 trains per month through the terminal in Q1. In the second quarter, we expect to move to 8 trains per month, and we have capacity of handling up to 24 trains per month, and that is our goal as we enter the second half of the year. Jefferson is the only terminal in the Beaumont region capable of transloading large quantities of yellow wax crude, and the process involves a significant amount of handling, heating railcars to unload the product and blending with lighter crude, so it's a particularly high-margin business for us. Turning to Long Ridge. We're pleased to report that our new 485-megawatt power plant is up and running on a continuing basis, and we expect to generate strong cash flows under our power sales agreements for years to come. In addition, we're taking advantage of our own natural gas assets to produce gas in excess of our power plants needs for sale into the merchant market where gas pricing needless to say, continues to be extremely strong. As the first quarter financials demonstrate, we took an unscheduled maintenance outage during the quarter to repair and complete commissioning of one of our steam turbines. The outage lasted approximately 6 weeks and represented an approximate $8 million adverse impact on EBITDA for the quarter due to lost revenues during the outage. All costs to make the repairs were covered under warranty. While far from ideal, the outage did result in 2 positives. First, we performed maintenance that was originally scheduled to take place in April, letting us avoid taking that outage and setting the stage for an upgrade in power production to 505 megawatts at little to no cost. Second, we completed our hydrogen blending project. In March, we became the first utility scale power plant in the United States to run on hydrogen, starting with a 5% blend. This is an important development of the national infrastructure bill, which was passed last year includes $8 billion of funding for the development of hydrogen hubs, and we have applied as a recipient. As an early mover with multiple advantages, Long Ridge is well positioned to secure funding from this program. So with the power plant in good shape, we are now focused on driving incremental growth by securing new business from power-intensive industries that want to locate new facilities at Long Ridge. We're seeing a robust pipeline of prospects and expect to announce our first major counterparty in the coming months. Finally, Repauno. Building on a successful first year of operation in 2021, we're kicking off the 2022 season in very good shape. Our business today is somewhat seasonal with activity picking up in the month of April and continuing into the fourth quarter, so expect Repauno to generate solid results in the second and third quarters in particular. The newly expanded LPG truck rack has seen high utilization, providing both propane and butane to local heating and blending markets during a period of significant market volatility. Our newly commissioned cavern chiller allows for fully refrigerated butane exports, and we have executed on a base agreement with an international off taker for multiple cargoes beginning this month. We expect to move over 175 million gallons of LPG in 2022 versus 130 million gallons in 2021 with upside to over 250 million gallons with spot movements, which are on the increase. We continue to advance our build-out plans for additional product storage, increased rail access with the construction of a double unit train loop, 600,000 barrels of new storage and pipeline connectivity in major production areas. We're finalizing permitting and construction contracting for the new storage facility, which will more than double our throughput capacity and triple cash flow potential once complete. We expect to fund the capacity entirely low-cost tax exempt debt making the expansion highly accretive. With that, let me turn it back over to Joe. Yes. Justin. Happy to do that. Maybe to answer your specific question, one train per month, one train of yellow wax crude can generate -- it depends, but anywhere up to $100,000 of EBITDA to significant. This is one of the reasons we're so bullish and so excited about it. Unloading one train can be a very high-margin business between the heating involved, the blending and what have you. So it could be very substantial for Jefferson, and we're excited about the trends we're seeing here in the second quarter. Big picture with Jefferson, obviously, we have a lot going on. We've got big Exxon contracts kicking off at the early part of next year. Our ultimate goal is to get Jefferson to $80 million to $100 million of EBITDA, a precise trajectory for which we get there is -- I can't provide that kind of precision quarter-over-quarter. But our goal is at the end of the year. And as we kick off the new Exxon business in January of next year to be pretty close to that number on a run rate basis. No, that is the run rate we are on currently. Yes. Look, the general tone and atmospherics around Canadian crude by rail are very positive. The White House making statements weeks ago regarding increased imports from Canada by any mode other than pipe. So that's a very good thing for crude by rail. I would tell you the activity today is still relatively light compared to where the activity was pre-COVID, about 2 to 3 trains a day get loaded in Canada, in Alberta and Saskatchewan regions, and that number was between 10 and 12 trains pre-COVID. So we're still a relatively reduced levels, but it is growing. And with the White House sentiment, we are bullish that we're going to start seeing some crude trains coming in from Canada in the short term. Hard to specifically quantify that, but I do think we'll start to see a good uptick. Specifically on your point, the economics I described on the Uinta Basin, yellow wax crude, they're roughly the same for Canadian crude. It's also a very heavy barrel that requires heating when it comes in and tankers and generally requires blending. And so the economics are typically the same. We'd love to see more Canadian crude coming in. We have the capacity to handle it. We've got plenty of storage. We have blending capabilities. So we're eager to see that market pick up. Yes. Look, I mean, it's a pretty robust environment out there. There's -- as you said, there's a lot of capital available, but there are a lot of assets, a lot of infrastructure needs. We're always looking for projects. I would say generally, we'd be partnering with folks on the strategic front. Some of our customers, that's where it makes more sense for terminal build-outs where we put capital in customers, we help make their supply chains more efficient and what have you. I think there's a huge opportunity out there. In the rail space, we've got 3 or 4 different acquisitions we're currently looking at. I'm not sure those are anything we necessarily partner with folks on. Those are things that we would have the capacity to do on our own, more on the ports and terminal space where we're building out capacity, that's where joint ventures and partnerships like that could start to make a fair amount of sense. Yes. You got it right. It is higher margin on the incremental activity. The -- on that slide, we showed Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 is what is operating today, and that's representative of the total margin out of Phase 1 operating at about 90% of its capacity. Phase 2, we need to build more storage in a loop track that's underway. We're just completing the permitting. That's going to take 12-months plus to actually put into place, but it was meant to be illustrative to give you a sense for the incremental margin that comes out of that. It is a higher-margin business because it just has more scale. And so the actual contribution per gallon or per barrel is higher after Phase II gets implemented. Phase II will start construction in another month or 2 or year. And as I said, that will take 12-plus months to implement, but we wanted to make sure people understood how accretive that could be. We've also applied for authorization to issue tax exempt debt to build out the entirety of that project. And so I think it could be incredibly accretive for Repauno. It's Ken. We're very close. I would say it's very well advanced, and it is next few weeks. I think things are pretty well organized, and we should be having that financing all complete and committed literally in a few weeks. Feeling good about it."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Q4 2023 FTAI Aviation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would like to hand the call over to Alan Andreini, Investor Relations. You may begin.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Michelle. I would like to welcome you all to the FTAI fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer; Angela Nam, our Chief Financial Officer; and David Moreno, our Chief Operating Officer. We have posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you have not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only mode and is being webcast. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including EBITDA. The reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements by their nature are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our annual report filed with the SEC. Now I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Adams: Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 35th dividend as a public company and our 50th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on March 20 based on a shareholder record date of March 8. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metric for us is adjusted EBITDA. We ended the year strongly with adjusted EBITDA of $162.3 million in Q4 2023, which is up just over 5% compared to $154.2 million in Q3 2023 and up 31% compared to $123.5 million in Q4 2022. During the fourth quarter, the $162.3 million EBITDA number was comprised of $121.8 million from our Leasing segment, $54.6 million from our Aerospace Products segment, a negative $14.1 million from Corporate and Other. Now let's look at all of 2023 versus all of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $597.3 million in 2023, up 40% versus $428.1 million in 2022. Turning now to Leasing. Leasing had another good quarter, posting approximately $122 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of $122 million of EBITDA came in at $99 million for Q4, versus $102 million in Q3. Additionally, on the acquisition side, we acquired at attractive prices, $229 million in new equipment, comprised of 10 aircrafts and 33 engines, which will contribute to further growth in future Leasing EBITDA. We're very comfortable in producing approximately $425 million of Leasing EBITDA for 2024, excluding projected gains on asset sales of approximately $50 million. Part of the $122 million in EBITDA for Leasing came from gains on asset sales. We sold $33.5 million book value of assets at a 40% margin for a gain of $22.7 million in the quarter, benefiting from exceptionally strong demand globally for our portfolio of assets. And we remain comfortable assuming gains on asset sales continuing at approximately $12.5 million per quarter or $50 million for all of 2024. Aerospace Products had yet another excellent quarter with $54.6 million of EBITDA and an overall EBITDA margin of 34%. We sold 61 modules in Q4 to 17 unique customers comprised of six new customers and 11 repeat customers. We see tremendous potential in Aerospace Products and feel good about generating EBITDA for 2024 towards the middle or higher end of the $200 million to $250 million range. We continue to expect strong growth in Aerospace Products as customers experience the clear benefits of our MRE products and programs. We are both expanding the number of customers and the usage per customer at an accelerating pace. Additionally, we are very pleased with the introduction, acceptance of and demand for our second focus engine, the V2500. With this, we have the ability to become the leading full-service aftermarket power provider for all 737NG and A320neo aircraft globally. Overall, looking ahead, we continue to expect our annual aviation EBITDA for 2024 to be between $675 million to $725 million, not including corporate and other. With that, I will turn the call back to Alan.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Joe. Michelle, you may now open the call to questions and answers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKristine Liwag: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nJoe Adams: Good morning.\nKristine Liwag: Hey, Joe. On the leasing portion, we saw a sequential decline in revenue. Can you talk about what drove this slight stepdown?\nJoe Adams: Yes. The biggest driver was we had four aircraft A320s on lease to Bamboo Airlines, which we terminated in the third quarter last year. So they were taken back, they were off leased for Q4. And there'll be off leased for Q1. That revenue is about $5 million per quarter of EBITDA. And the reason we did that is the credit wasn't great. And we had other opportunities to put those out on lease at higher rates and better terms. And so ultimately, it's a very NPV positive for us, but it had a negative impact on revenues and EBITDA in Q4 and will also affect Q1 of 2024.\nKristine Liwag: Thanks. And you know, Joe, saying that you were able to release these assets at a higher monthly lease rates and better terms, can you talk about the overall environment that suggests that it seems like demand continues to outpace supply? So is there a general view when you've got assets up for re-lease, like how much of a step-up in the monthly lease rate are you seeing for those assets?\nJoe Adams: Well, it depends on when the lease was originally done. But in general, lease rates for aircraft are up anywhere from 20% to 40%. So if the operator is either not a great operator or the operator isn't willing to pay market rates, then you move the assets. It's always more expensive to move than to keep it where it is, so you favor extensions over new leases. But in this case, we just didn't have confidence in the Company, so we decided it was better -- much better to move them.\nKristine Liwag: Great. Thanks. And if I could squeeze one last question. In the quarter, you were able to acquire 33 engines and 10 aircrafts. Can you talk about the availability of assets in the market? I guess to some degree you guys are very unique because you're the asset owner and you also have an MRO capability. Does this give you an edge in being able to buy assets that maybe other just pure leasing assets or operators may not be interested in?\nJoe Adams: Yes, absolutely. We -- particularly on the engine side, if an engine is tagged unserviceable, it\u2019s very -- there are very, very few buyers for that engine other than pure part-out companies, which typically pay very low prices. And so we're uniquely positioned because we can take an engine that's tagged unserviceable and repair it. And it could be -- the best situation is that it's unserviceable because of only one module, in which case we get the other two modules at a discount when it's really not. They shouldn't be trading at a discount, but they do because it's coupled with an unserviceable module. So we are -- we can buy anything. And so when people put up packages and some buyers like to nitpick, and they'll say, I want that one, I want that one, but I don't want that one. The seller is like, I don't want to deal with that. I want one buyer. And so we're able to acquire, I think, much more effectively than other people for that reason. There's nothing we can't digest.\nKristine Liwag: Great. Thank you for the color.\nJoe Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey, good morning.\nJoe Adams: Good morning.\nJosh Sullivan: So I just wanted to get some color on the market response for lease rents after the FAA put in the production cap on the MAX earlier this year. And I guess maybe it would be helpful to also understand just how lease rents have walked from pre-COVID levels to today?\nJoe Adams: Sure. David Moreno will take that.\nDavid Moreno: Hi, Josh. So lease rates typically are $60,000 plus maintenance reserves. During COVID, there were special arrangements made, let's say power by the hour or rates that were $45,000 to $50,000 plus maintenance reserves. Those days are now long gone. Today...\nJoe Adams: [That\u2019s for one] (ph) CFM56 engine.\nJosh Sullivan: Yes, that's per engine. Yes. Today those days are long gone. Lease rates are up $75,000 plus maintenance reserves and those continue to rise as there's a shortage of CFM and V2500s today in the market.\nJoe Adams: And the cap, as you mentioned, the cap on the MAX production means that people are going to keep their NGs and CLs longer because they can't meet their growth projections with the new aircraft. So that cap is likely to extend the imbalance between supply and demand for at least a couple of years.\nJosh Sullivan: And then secondly, I just -- I know you've talked about the parts business averaging around 35% EBITDA margins. Obviously, 50-plus is a good result this quarter in EBITDA. But what are the moving parts around, maybe EBITDA per module?\nJoe Adams: So it's a function of mix, certain modules we have higher margins on, particularly the core. It'll be a function on the size of the customer, and it'll be a function on the timing and the urgency with which they need the module. So it sort of all goes into the mix on a quarterly basis. And we've been averaging about $500,000 per module in each of the quarters. We've had a couple of times where we've had some positive surprises because another reason is we often can buy things really cheaply. As I mentioned, when we buy a package of engines, we might end up with a very low basis in a module that produces an outsized gain for that reason. So -- but I would say that the $500,000 has been pretty steady over the last couple of years and it's a good assumption going forward until we have more PMA.\nJosh Sullivan: Great. Thank you for the time.\nJoe Adams: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Joe, could you talk about the V2500 MRE program where it's being worked? How big could the contribution be? And then in respect to your comment that you -- your vision for FTAI is to be the leading full service aftermarket power provider globally for the NG and the -- or the CFM -- and the 56 and the V2500 engine, can you just give us a picture of what does that mean in terms of quantum, who is the leader today?\nJoe Adams: Sure. So maybe a bit of history. I mean, we have owned V2500 for several years, so it's not that we just discovered. We've had about 50 to 60 engines in the portfolio for a while. Starting about six months ago, we got particularly interested in it with the GTF powder metal issue coming on the scene, it was obvious that many of those V2500 operators who had thought they would be phasing those engines out over the next three years to four years, were going to end up keeping them much, much longer. And that's the main driver what peaked our interest in that engine. So about six months ago, we started hiring people, building up our engineering talent expertise, talking to MRO partners, lining up assets to buy. And it's been very, very successful. It's all in place, probably a lot better than I would have ever expected as the demand for shop visits is extremely high. And a lot of operators either don't have the capital or the ability to shop those engines today. So there's a tremendous opportunity for us to step in and do that. We have today about 15 engines in maintenance shops. We're using two different shops right now. There's multiple providers that we've discussed, and we're sort of -- it's a bit of a test drive right now where we're -- we've got some very attractive short term deals. And ultimately, we will select probably a long term partner on the MRO side or two to work with over the next few years, but we haven't done that fully. We also are very close on a large fleet deal where we would take over the management of engines on over 30 aircraft for an airline, V2500s, and we would then be responsible for engine exchanges. So as we have used the term MRE, we maintain, repair and then exchange. So when an engine is run out, needs a shop visit, the airline gives that back to us and we give them an engine that's been through a performance restoration, has hours and cycles that they need to keep flying. So that we're fairly close on, I expect in the next few weeks. And we have a couple of other deals like that. So the prospects are pretty exciting and it does sort of give us a complete offering for anybody that operates a 737NG or an A320ceo, we can provide CFM56 or V2500 power. And that really is -- our mission is to provide to airlines flexibility in the power they need, so that we always have an engine available if they need it. And if they have too many, they give it back to us without a fight over return compensation. So that's very compelling for a lot of airlines. And then we provide them immediate and tangible cost savings because they don't have to manage a shop visit, they don't have to have an engineering department, they don't have to go provision spares, and they don't have to find out that the shop visit they thought was going to cost a million dollars cost $4 million. So there's a growing recognition that that is an easy thing for airlines to buy into, is we can save them time and money and provide them great flexibility, as we say to them, what don't you like about that? Which part of it is unpalatable? And there isn't a part that's unpalatable. So it's a great sell and that's what we're shooting for as our reason for being as a company is to provide that leading provider of aftermarket power to the global industry for those aircraft. In terms of contribution next year, I mean, I think the V2500 should add $25 million of EBITDA easily with some upside. So we're still early on and as I mentioned, we got a couple of large deals that could swing it one way or another, but it's off and running and I think very well received and great timing because of the need for that engine.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Giuliano Bologna with Compass Point. Your line is open.\nGiuliano Bologna: All right, congratulations on another great quarter. For my first question, I'm curious why you think you're seeing accelerated acceptance in the aerospace area?\nJoe Adams: Well, I think people that have used it have experienced the fact that they've saved time and money and they have a great amount of flexibility and they often come back afterwards and say, I wish I had known about this before. I mean, why wouldn't I want to do this? And so that once people experience, the ease with which they can avoid a shop visit, which is usually very painful for people. No one I've talked to in the airline industry ever has told me after a shop visit, that was a great experience. So they all have scars, and I think what we provide is the easy button, and it's caught on. And then word of mouth also helps because once one airline does it and they go to conferences and they have people in their engineering departments of other airlines, they tell them, you should look at this and it worked really well. All of that just keeps building the momentum.\nGiuliano Bologna: That's great. And then, an inevitable question. Can you give us an update on the PMA initiative and program?\nJoe Adams: Sure. So great progress continues. We're very happy with the development and what we've seen in the test results, which actually speaks to the performance of those underlying parts when they're in operation, which is critical and very important. So all good on that. Obviously, on the timing side, the FAA runs a very rigorous process. It's been an extremely successful program for them, PMA. They've never had any safety issues, but they are extremely careful and thorough. So it's inherently very difficult to predict when the actual completion of those approval processes are received. But we're very excited and we definitely are 100% sure it's worth the wait.\nGiuliano Bologna: That's very helpful. And then one last one. Are you still seeing discounts for off-lease assets? It looks like you bought a lot of off-lease assets in the fourth quarter.\nJoe Adams: Yes. As I mentioned, if you have an asset that needs maintenance, you immediately -- if it's off lease and it needs maintenance, you've narrowed the field of buyers down to like a handful of people. And so that's -- that dynamic has not yet changed. And I'm not sure it will. I think people are still, most of the people we see in the marketplace with capital to invest are looking for assets that are on lease that don't need maintenance. So that's really where we -- and as I said, we can fix anything. And we relish fixing things because that's how you add value.\nGiuliano Bologna: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you so much and I will jump back into the queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Galanti with Stifel. Your line is open.\nFrank Galanti: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to talk about sort of FTAI Aviation competitive positioning in the module swap business. So first on the V2500, do you see not having PMA -- first party PMA? If you sort of talk about that dynamic relative to the CFM56. And then from a broader perspective, it's my understanding that you can get module swaps from other people, other MROs, other airlines with MROs to do module swaps and that this is sort of not a new function. And so from my perspective, it feels like PMA is the sort of competitive advantage here. And I don't see that or the modularity on the V2500s relative to the CFM56. Sort of my perception of it, can you sort of talk about where I'm misunderstanding that or those dynamics?\nJoe Adams: Sure. Well, there's a couple of concepts in there that are mixed together, but there is PMA available for the V2500. So that's an option for us to be able to utilize PMA. We don't have the same arrangement where we develop the PMA, so we would be more of a consumer on a commercial basis with the manufacturers if we decided to use that. So that's an opportunity for cost savings on the V2500. There are other opportunities such as use serviceable material that we have a good line of sight to be able to utilize. There are some repairs that we are working on and our engineering team is working on. There are favorable agreements that we've struck with some of the maintenance shops. And so when you add it all up, and it's not the same playbook exactly as a CFM56, but it's the same process of going through the cost of shop visiting and figuring out where you can take out costs and where you can do things smarter and better. We think we can perform a full restoration of the V2500, which today has a full list price of about $10 million. We think we can do that for $7.5 million. So it's roughly about a $2.5 million savings available for to be either for us or for our customers or for both of us. If you compare that on the CFM56, the savings with full PMA, availability on our favorable terms, as shop visits say, is roughly about $6.8 million, and we think we can bring that in a little, about $3.25 million or so. So it's -- dollar amount-wise CFM is better, and it's percentage-wise better, but V2500 is still good. The second question was about module availability. And there are -- you can find modules on an ad hoc basis from an MRO. We actually buy some -- we bought modules from MROs and they buy from us and because you don't always have the module you're looking for in inventory. So that is one of the competitive advantages of our module factories. We have in our fleet over 400 CFM engines. That's 1,200 modules. There's no one that has anywhere near that availability that I'm aware of. So inventories of modules in a repaired state is a competitive advantage. And I say repaired state because we do repair them and restore them. And if they're not repaired, then they're pretty worthless from an airline's point of view. So It's a package. It's all of those things above. And when we say -- people say, what are you? And we say, well, we're an MRE. We maintain, repair, and exchange, which is very different than anybody else in the industry. And then we combine that with the ability to provide power, we have the ability to deliver what I think is our ultimate competitive advantage, which is flexibility and cost savings. That's our pitch.\nFrank Galanti: Okay, that's helpful. Sort of thinking about the customer experience then a little further on the on the module side, in the last -- I guess in 4Q \u201822, the deck had said that you guys had sold over 100 modules to 26 customers. And based on this release, it said 178 modules to 30 customers. And if you sort of go through the press releases and look at each sort of quarter, you said there are new customers, there are five or two or six in this quarter. You sort of add those up to 26, you get to 40. So is that -- so from my understanding then, there were 30 customers, 26 customers in 2022, 30 customers in \u201823, but that sort of leaves 10 customers that didn't come back in \u201823. Is that the right way to think about those numbers? If you sort of talk about from their perspective why that would be, if you sort of saw that customers going away in a year?\nJoe Adams: No, I don't think the numbers are exactly right. But there are times where a customer to be a repeat customer has to have a need. So not every customer is a repeat customer every quarter. So in other words, if you don't have a shop visit, you don't need a module. So it's a timing issue. I think what we've said is we have a very, very high level of repeat customer business, but sometimes you might have a customer that goes out of business. So you can't have a 100% repeat customer in every quarter. It just doesn't happen that way. You have to have the need. But it's been very, very high. The customers that have used our modules have always said that was a great experience and I would like to do that again. And they will do it again when they have a need.\nFrank Galanti: Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions. Appreciate it.\nJoe Adams: Yep.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Mckenna with Citizens JMP. Your line is open.\nBrian Mckenna: Okay, great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. So it's great to see another very strong quarter within aerospace products. So within the $55 million of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, was there any year-end seasonality or any one-off benefits? Or is it really just continued strength across the business given just increasing levels of demand for the products and services? And I'm just trying to get a sense of a good jumping off point for the segment to start 2024.\nJoe Adams: Yeah. So I think we mentioned to people there was a one-time $5 million write-up in the value of QuickTurn.\nAngela Nam: That's right. So we made an initial investment in QuickTurn in January and then bought -- consolidated and bought the remaining interest in December. But accounting requires you to revalue your initial investment to fair value at the time of consolidation. So that resulted in a one-time non-cash accounting gain of about $5 million.\nJoe Adams: I don't think we experienced any seasonality in the fourth quarter, and I don't think we have enough history and market penetration to actually to see what seasonality effects there will be on that business yet. It's still growing too fast.\nBrian Mckenna: Yeah, got it. Okay, great. And then, just broadly, the business clearly is reaching new levels of scale every quarter here. And so if I look out over the next couple of years, cash flow is really going to take another stair step higher. So how should we think about the CapEx needs of the business over time, the absolute level of cash needed for investment back into the business. And again, I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about the timing of maybe generating some excess cash flow, and then what some of the uses of that excess liquidity will be.\nJoe Adams: Sure. So from the cash flow availability, we think about it as, if you start with EBITDA and you strip out gain on sale and then you deduct maintenance CapEx for the engines, which is what you would need to do to keep the engines flying in repaired condition, we think that number is about between $60 million and $80 million per annum. So that leaves, $300-plus-million available capital to do whatever we want with. So therefore, our priorities have been to manage to a strong BB rating, and we think we should achieve that. And we're there with two agencies already, but we want to be upgraded, so we want to maintain the strong coverages. Second is to do new deals. And obviously, we have a new engine now, the V2500. So we'll be investing capital in more V2500s. Today, we own about 60. I would expect we will own probably 150 to 200 of those engines by the end of this year. So that's an opportunity for us to invest, but it's discretionary. And then thirdly, when we generate cash, we would look to either stock buybacks or dividends for excess capital. So those are the priorities. I think it's -- this year is still a pretty active investing opportunity. So I think we'll see some really good deals, which I think will be accretive and generate very good results for shareholders. So we don't see a lack of investment opportunities at this point.\nBrian Mckenna: Got it. Thanks, Joe.\nJoe Adams: Yep.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Zazula with Barclays. Your line is open.\nDavid Zazula: Hey, good morning, Joe. Thanks for taking my question. First one is cash position, a little bit stronger. Could you talk about the near-term kind of working capital needs and near-term working capital intensity, given that you're expanding the product's business out? Has that changed what you're thinking for working capital, the needs of cash, and the revolver capacity you have in the near term?\nJoe Adams: No, I mean, we had -- at year end, we had $90 million of cash, $300 million undrawn on the revolvers, so almost $400 million of available liquidity. I think we have $200 million of LOIs in the pipeline right now for deals. And so we're good. And we'll also -- we'll generate some more cash by selling assets throughout the year. So don't see any significant needs or issues at this point.\nDavid Zazula: Great. And then with the FAA, you talked about PMA kind of broadly the process, but specifically the changes of leadership of the FAA and then with the FAA having kind of new focus around Boeing and having to shift some resources there, do you see either of those events kind of impacting your PMA process over the near medium term?\nJoe Adams: I think that the main issues that the FAA had from our perspective were during COVID. There was just long turnaround times and they lost -- they had high turnover of personnel, some experienced personnel. So those problems have been addressed and have been largely fixed from what we see. So the other issues that you mentioned, a new administrator and the [MAX have not had] (ph), we have no sign that there's any impact from either of those. But the main thing was the staffing and the people coming into the office thing, which has been addressed.\nDavid Zazula: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. We have time for one last question, and that question comes from Sherif Elmaghrabi with BTIG. Your line is open.\nSherif Elmaghrabi: Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I want to start with the well intervention vessels. It looks like those didn't work during the quarter. How are you thinking about these assets, especially given the well interventions going through a bit of an upcycle and that's cash that could be recycled into the portfolio?\nJoe Adams: Yes, you're correct. It was a bit of a headwind for us in the fourth quarter that both vessels were off hire. The Pioneer, the smaller vessel, is now on hire. It started its charter in December, I think. And that should generate about $6 million a year in EBITDA. So that\u2019s -- and that's now on a five-year charter, so it's in good shape. And we're actively marketing that vessel for sale. The other vessel, the Pride, they had a breakdown, a maintenance event on the crane. It's still in repair until March. And we expect that there's a charter in place for that to go on hire in April, which is actually a pretty good charter. So you will see continuing headwinds in the first quarter and then hopefully both vessels will be on higher in the second quarter and onward and we hope to sell both vessels hopefully this year.\nSherif Elmaghrabi: That's helpful. And then just on the 2025 notes coming due early next year, are you planning to pay that down and reduce leverage or could we see those refinanced sooner?\nJoe Adams: It was actually late next year, I think.\nAngela Nam: October of next year.\nJoe Adams: Yes. So that -- we have a lot of time, we have over 18 months. And we evaluate the market from time to time and think about those, but there's not a real important deadline yet, so we're monitoring it.\nSherif Elmaghrabi: Okay, thanks very much everyone.\nJoe Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Alan Andreini for any closing remarks.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Michelle, and thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q1.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

            "name": "Joe Adams",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 35th dividend as a public company and our 50th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on March 20 based on a shareholder record date of March 8. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metric for us is adjusted EBITDA. We ended the year strongly with adjusted EBITDA of $162.3 million in Q4 2023, which is up just over 5% compared to $154.2 million in Q3 2023 and up 31% compared to $123.5 million in Q4 2022. During the fourth quarter, the $162.3 million EBITDA number was comprised of $121.8 million from our Leasing segment, $54.6 million from our Aerospace Products segment, a negative $14.1 million from Corporate and Other. Now let's look at all of 2023 versus all of 2022. Adjusted EBITDA was $597.3 million in 2023, up 40% versus $428.1 million in 2022. Turning now to Leasing. Leasing had another good quarter, posting approximately $122 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of $122 million of EBITDA came in at $99 million for Q4, versus $102 million in Q3. Additionally, on the acquisition side, we acquired at attractive prices, $229 million in new equipment, comprised of 10 aircrafts and 33 engines, which will contribute to further growth in future Leasing EBITDA. We're very comfortable in producing approximately $425 million of Leasing EBITDA for 2024, excluding projected gains on asset sales of approximately $50 million. Part of the $122 million in EBITDA for Leasing came from gains on asset sales. We sold $33.5 million book value of assets at a 40% margin for a gain of $22.7 million in the quarter, benefiting from exceptionally strong demand globally for our portfolio of assets. And we remain comfortable assuming gains on asset sales continuing at approximately $12.5 million per quarter or $50 million for all of 2024. Aerospace Products had yet another excellent quarter with $54.6 million of EBITDA and an overall EBITDA margin of 34%. We sold 61 modules in Q4 to 17 unique customers comprised of six new customers and 11 repeat customers. We see tremendous potential in Aerospace Products and feel good about generating EBITDA for 2024 towards the middle or higher end of the $200 million to $250 million range. We continue to expect strong growth in Aerospace Products as customers experience the clear benefits of our MRE products and programs. We are both expanding the number of customers and the usage per customer at an accelerating pace. Additionally, we are very pleased with the introduction, acceptance of and demand for our second focus engine, the V2500. With this, we have the ability to become the leading full-service aftermarket power provider for all 737NG and A320neo aircraft globally. Overall, looking ahead, we continue to expect our annual aviation EBITDA for 2024 to be between $675 million to $725 million, not including corporate and other. With that, I will turn the call back to Alan. Good morning. Yes. The biggest driver was we had four aircraft A320s on lease to Bamboo Airlines, which we terminated in the third quarter last year. So they were taken back, they were off leased for Q4. And there'll be off leased for Q1. That revenue is about $5 million per quarter of EBITDA. And the reason we did that is the credit wasn't great. And we had other opportunities to put those out on lease at higher rates and better terms. And so ultimately, it's a very NPV positive for us, but it had a negative impact on revenues and EBITDA in Q4 and will also affect Q1 of 2024. Well, it depends on when the lease was originally done. But in general, lease rates for aircraft are up anywhere from 20% to 40%. So if the operator is either not a great operator or the operator isn't willing to pay market rates, then you move the assets. It's always more expensive to move than to keep it where it is, so you favor extensions over new leases. But in this case, we just didn't have confidence in the Company, so we decided it was better -- much better to move them. Yes, absolutely. We -- particularly on the engine side, if an engine is tagged unserviceable, it's very -- there are very, very few buyers for that engine other than pure part-out companies, which typically pay very low prices. And so we're uniquely positioned because we can take an engine that's tagged unserviceable and repair it. And it could be -- the best situation is that it's unserviceable because of only one module, in which case we get the other two modules at a discount when it's really not. They shouldn't be trading at a discount, but they do because it's coupled with an unserviceable module. So we are -- we can buy anything. And so when people put up packages and some buyers like to nitpick, and they'll say, I want that one, I want that one, but I don't want that one. The seller is like, I don't want to deal with that. I want one buyer. And so we're able to acquire, I think, much more effectively than other people for that reason. There's nothing we can't digest. Thanks. Good morning. Sure. David Moreno will take that. [That's for one] (ph) CFM56 engine. And the cap, as you mentioned, the cap on the MAX production means that people are going to keep their NGs and CLs longer because they can't meet their growth projections with the new aircraft. So that cap is likely to extend the imbalance between supply and demand for at least a couple of years. So it's a function of mix, certain modules we have higher margins on, particularly the core. It'll be a function on the size of the customer, and it'll be a function on the timing and the urgency with which they need the module. So it sort of all goes into the mix on a quarterly basis. And we've been averaging about $500,000 per module in each of the quarters. We've had a couple of times where we've had some positive surprises because another reason is we often can buy things really cheaply. As I mentioned, when we buy a package of engines, we might end up with a very low basis in a module that produces an outsized gain for that reason. So -- but I would say that the $500,000 has been pretty steady over the last couple of years and it's a good assumption going forward until we have more PMA. Thank you. Sure. So maybe a bit of history. I mean, we have owned V2500 for several years, so it's not that we just discovered. We've had about 50 to 60 engines in the portfolio for a while. Starting about six months ago, we got particularly interested in it with the GTF powder metal issue coming on the scene, it was obvious that many of those V2500 operators who had thought they would be phasing those engines out over the next three years to four years, were going to end up keeping them much, much longer. And that's the main driver what peaked our interest in that engine. So about six months ago, we started hiring people, building up our engineering talent expertise, talking to MRO partners, lining up assets to buy. And it's been very, very successful. It's all in place, probably a lot better than I would have ever expected as the demand for shop visits is extremely high. And a lot of operators either don't have the capital or the ability to shop those engines today. So there's a tremendous opportunity for us to step in and do that. We have today about 15 engines in maintenance shops. We're using two different shops right now. There's multiple providers that we've discussed, and we're sort of -- it's a bit of a test drive right now where we're -- we've got some very attractive short term deals. And ultimately, we will select probably a long term partner on the MRO side or two to work with over the next few years, but we haven't done that fully. We also are very close on a large fleet deal where we would take over the management of engines on over 30 aircraft for an airline, V2500s, and we would then be responsible for engine exchanges. So as we have used the term MRE, we maintain, repair and then exchange. So when an engine is run out, needs a shop visit, the airline gives that back to us and we give them an engine that's been through a performance restoration, has hours and cycles that they need to keep flying. So that we're fairly close on, I expect in the next few weeks. And we have a couple of other deals like that. So the prospects are pretty exciting and it does sort of give us a complete offering for anybody that operates a 737NG or an A320ceo, we can provide CFM56 or V2500 power. And that really is -- our mission is to provide to airlines flexibility in the power they need, so that we always have an engine available if they need it. And if they have too many, they give it back to us without a fight over return compensation. So that's very compelling for a lot of airlines. And then we provide them immediate and tangible cost savings because they don't have to manage a shop visit, they don't have to have an engineering department, they don't have to go provision spares, and they don't have to find out that the shop visit they thought was going to cost a million dollars cost $4 million. So there's a growing recognition that that is an easy thing for airlines to buy into, is we can save them time and money and provide them great flexibility, as we say to them, what don't you like about that? Which part of it is unpalatable? And there isn't a part that's unpalatable. So it's a great sell and that's what we're shooting for as our reason for being as a company is to provide that leading provider of aftermarket power to the global industry for those aircraft. In terms of contribution next year, I mean, I think the V2500 should add $25 million of EBITDA easily with some upside. So we're still early on and as I mentioned, we got a couple of large deals that could swing it one way or another, but it's off and running and I think very well received and great timing because of the need for that engine. Well, I think people that have used it have experienced the fact that they've saved time and money and they have a great amount of flexibility and they often come back afterwards and say, I wish I had known about this before. I mean, why wouldn't I want to do this? And so that once people experience, the ease with which they can avoid a shop visit, which is usually very painful for people. No one I've talked to in the airline industry ever has told me after a shop visit, that was a great experience. So they all have scars, and I think what we provide is the easy button, and it's caught on. And then word of mouth also helps because once one airline does it and they go to conferences and they have people in their engineering departments of other airlines, they tell them, you should look at this and it worked really well. All of that just keeps building the momentum. Sure. So great progress continues. We're very happy with the development and what we've seen in the test results, which actually speaks to the performance of those underlying parts when they're in operation, which is critical and very important. So all good on that. Obviously, on the timing side, the FAA runs a very rigorous process. It's been an extremely successful program for them, PMA. They've never had any safety issues, but they are extremely careful and thorough. So it's inherently very difficult to predict when the actual completion of those approval processes are received. But we're very excited and we definitely are 100% sure it's worth the wait. Yes. As I mentioned, if you have an asset that needs maintenance, you immediately -- if it's off lease and it needs maintenance, you've narrowed the field of buyers down to like a handful of people. And so that's -- that dynamic has not yet changed. And I'm not sure it will. I think people are still, most of the people we see in the marketplace with capital to invest are looking for assets that are on lease that don't need maintenance. So that's really where we -- and as I said, we can fix anything. And we relish fixing things because that's how you add value. Sure. Well, there's a couple of concepts in there that are mixed together, but there is PMA available for the V2500. So that's an option for us to be able to utilize PMA. We don't have the same arrangement where we develop the PMA, so we would be more of a consumer on a commercial basis with the manufacturers if we decided to use that. So that's an opportunity for cost savings on the V2500. There are other opportunities such as use serviceable material that we have a good line of sight to be able to utilize. There are some repairs that we are working on and our engineering team is working on. There are favorable agreements that we've struck with some of the maintenance shops. And so when you add it all up, and it's not the same playbook exactly as a CFM56, but it's the same process of going through the cost of shop visiting and figuring out where you can take out costs and where you can do things smarter and better. We think we can perform a full restoration of the V2500, which today has a full list price of about $10 million. We think we can do that for $7.5 million. So it's roughly about a $2.5 million savings available for to be either for us or for our customers or for both of us. If you compare that on the CFM56, the savings with full PMA, availability on our favorable terms, as shop visits say, is roughly about $6.8 million, and we think we can bring that in a little, about $3.25 million or so. So it's -- dollar amount-wise CFM is better, and it's percentage-wise better, but V2500 is still good. The second question was about module availability. And there are -- you can find modules on an ad hoc basis from an MRO. We actually buy some -- we bought modules from MROs and they buy from us and because you don't always have the module you're looking for in inventory. So that is one of the competitive advantages of our module factories. We have in our fleet over 400 CFM engines. That's 1,200 modules.

I think we have $200 million of LOIs in the pipeline right now for deals. And so we're good. And we'll also -- we'll generate some more cash by selling assets throughout the year. So don't see any significant needs or issues at this point. I think that the main issues that the FAA had from our perspective were during COVID. There was just long turnaround times and they lost -- they had high turnover of personnel, some experienced personnel. So those problems have been addressed and have been largely fixed from what we see. So the other issues that you mentioned, a new administrator and the [MAX have not had] (ph), we have no sign that there's any impact from either of those. But the main thing was the staffing and the people coming into the office thing, which has been addressed. Yes, you're correct. It was a bit of a headwind for us in the fourth quarter that both vessels were off hire. The Pioneer, the smaller vessel, is now on hire. It started its charter in December, I think. And that should generate about $6 million a year in EBITDA. So that's -- and that's now on a five-year charter, so it's in good shape. And we're actively marketing that vessel for sale. The other vessel, the Pride, they had a breakdown, a maintenance event on the crane. It's still in repair until March. And we expect that there's a charter in place for that to go on hire in April, which is actually a pretty good charter. So you will see continuing headwinds in the first quarter and then hopefully both vessels will be on higher in the second quarter and onward and we hope to sell both vessels hopefully this year. It was actually late next year, I think. Yes. So that -- we have a lot of time, we have over 18 months. And we evaluate the market from time to time and think about those, but there's not a real important deadline yet, so we're monitoring it. Thanks."

I would now like to hand the conference over to Alan Andreini, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, . I would like to welcome you all to the FTAI Aviation Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer; and Angela Nam, our Chief Financial Officer. We have posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you have not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only mode and is being webcast. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including EBITDA. The reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement.  Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements by their nature are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our quarterly report filed with the SEC.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 34th dividend as a public company and our 49th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on November 28, based on a shareholder record date of November 14.  Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA. We had another strong quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $154.2 million in Q3 2023, which is up 1% compared to $153.1 million in Q2 of 2023 and up 42% compared to $108.9 million in Q3 2022.  During the third quarter, the $154.2 million EBITDA number was comprised of $119.6 million from our Leasing segment, $40.6 million from our Aerospace Products segment and negative $6 million from Corporate and Other.  Turning now to Leasing. Leasing had another good quarter posting approximately $120 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of the $120 million of EBITDA came in at $102 million for Q3 versus $94 million in Q2.  Additionally, on the acquisition side, we closed on 10 aircraft and 23 engines at attractive prices, which will contribute to further growth in future Leasing EBITDA. Part of the $120 million in EBITDA for Leasing came from gains on asset sales. We sold $55.4 million book value of assets at a 24% margin for a gain of $17.6 million benefiting from strong demand for assets globally. And we've had more asset sales coming in the final quarter of this year.  Aerospace Products had yet another excellent quarter with $40.6 million of EBITDA and an overall EBITDA margin of 38%. We sold 41 modules in Q3 to 11 unique customers comprised of 2 new customers and 9 repeat customers. We see tremendous potential in Aerospace Products and feel very good about generating consistent EBITDA growth.  As to the balance of 2023, we see FTAI coming in above the high end of the $550 million to $600 million EBITDA range, which we communicated at the beginning of 2023. Looking ahead to 2024, our current expectation is for Leasing EBITDA to total $475 million for the year, including $50 million from gains on asset sales.  Based on a strong backlog and an expanding customer base, we are looking for $200 million to $250 million of Aerospace Products EBITDA in 2024, up from $98 million year-to-date 2023 and $70 million in 2022. Overall, we therefore expect annual aviation EBITDA for 2024 to be between $675 million to $725 million, not including Corporate and Other.  With that, I'll turn the call back to Alan.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Joe. , you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan, which with The Benchmark Company.\nJoshua Sullivan: Congratulations on the strong quarter here. Just with the earnings this week, we've had some updates from the large aerospace OEMs. Just wanted to check in on what Fortress has seen on the leasing and module market as these new generation of engines face these ongoing [indiscernible] issues. And particularly as it relates to the geared turbofan engine versus the GE56 options Fortress is offering?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So as you can imagine, demand for the prior technology equipment is very, very high in light of what is going to be accelerated maintenance on the new technology and some estimates, the company or others are estimating that approximately 600 A320s with GTF engines on them will be grounded in the first half of 2024 and approximately 300 on average through 2026.  So that's a significant amount of assets that are going to be out of service for an extended period of time. And so anybody that has A320ceos just keeping them and is doing the maintenance to refresh the engine. So both of those are very good for us, and that lease rates are trending up. Almost week to week, you can see increases right now. And so that's positive and it's likely going to continue for some time.  And maintenance events, people that we're estimating they were going to take assets out of service or not do another shop visit or might part them out are delaying and deferring that. So there'll be more maintenance and assets will last longer. So all of those factors are very, very good for the equipment that we maintain and own.\nJoshua Sullivan: Got it. And then secondly, just on the 2024 guidance you provided, what are you baking in for PMA assumptions into that number? And then if we get an approval sooner than later, what does the PMA ramp look like from manufacturing to stocking to actually getting a customer check?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, in that $200 million to $250 million number, we've included about $15 million to $20 million of EBITDA from PMA. And that would come from both the sale of PMA parts as well as modules. And we're not sure on the ramp. It's hard to actually forecast that. So I would assume that most of that is towards the back end of the year is our current assumption.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.\nLouis Raffetto: It's Lou Raffetto on for Myles. Maybe just within Aerospace Products, I want to make sure I understand what drove the sequential step-up in sales and EBITDA in the quarter? I mean you did 4 more module swaps, but I'm not sure that equates to the $40 million step-up in sales and obviously, the strong growth in EBITDA as well?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So we also had growth in the sale of used service raw material. So USM was higher and is likely going to continue to grow. As we've mentioned previously, we started a number of teardowns in the second quarter, and it generally takes 3 to 6 months for that revenue to show up in EBITDA.  So we're seeing strong demand for USM obviously, with shop visits increasing and that's 1 key way of saving money on a shop visit. So we see the teardown in used service raw material activity growing. And then within the modules, the mix of modules matters in terms of the revenue and the core has more revenue than the fan and the low-pressure turbine.  So it's -- we had more core sales activity in this third quarter than we had in the second quarter. So it's proving -- that's exactly what we've been expecting and what we're selling. It's a harder sell. It's a longer sell to sell core. It's easier to do a fan in 2 days or a low-pressure turbine in a week. The core is a little bit more complicated, but we've been pitching that for a couple of years now and now we've got a lot of customers there recognizing the substantial savings there.\nLouis Raffetto: All right. Great. And so just so I'm clear on the USM. So that's good now. Does that tied at all to the step-up that we saw, I think, a $40 million step-up in the CFM engine parts inventory? Or is it maybe not linked, but just you're building that inventory to sort of sell? It's not -- again, not necessarily directly linked, but sort of along the same line?\nEun Nam: Yes. This is Angela. As Joe mentioned, the number of teardowns equates to increase of inventory, but you won't see the revenue generation for 3 to 6 months. So we had a lot of teardowns in Q2, Q3, and you'll see that revenue come through Q4 and Q1.\nLouis Raffetto: Right. So that's kind of like a -- almost look at that as a leading indicator to some extent?\nEun Nam: Yes.\nLouis Raffetto: Okay. And then maybe just within Leasing, can you comment on the strong step-up in the maintenance revenue sequentially -- year-over-year and sequentially, while the lease income actually did step down sequentially, and I think year-over-year as well?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, there's 2 things went on. One is we elected to terminate 4 A320 aircraft leases to a carrier in Southeast Asia. And we did that to get higher rates and better terms. And so we did that intentionally. There's such strong demand for these assets, we've already got multiple parties that are negotiating to get them. So we had -- when you terminate a lease, you have lease maintenance revenues that you recognize from the prior lease come through.  So that's why you see a step up in the maintenance revenue. And then the lease side is a bit of an accounting issue. When we do engine swaps for aircraft that are on lease, we book the difference in value. When you put a new engine on an aircraft and you take an old engine off, there's generally an increase in the value from the new engine going in.  That gets amortized under the rules, the lease accounting rules as a lease incentive. And so that shows up as -- it's a contra revenue, actually, so it reduces your lease revenue, strangely. But those -- that's why you see it going down. It's a noncash item, too. So it's even more confusing from that point of view.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Giuliano Bologna with Compass Point.\nGiuliano Bologna: Congratulations on a great quarter.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nGiuliano Bologna: One thing I'm curious about -- asking about is, you obviously mentioned that you're including $15 million to $20 million of PMA contribution in the products outlook. So there's obviously some great confidence about being able to receive approval for PMA in the near term.  What I was curious about asking kind of with that being said is, do you think the PMA approval timeline could be slowed down at all by the issues the FAA is dealing with? At the moment, there's [indiscernible] turbofan issues, [indiscernible] parts, government shutdown concerns. I'm just curious how you think about that and how you're thinking about the impact of PMA approval timeline?\nJoseph Adams: Sure. So yes, we've had a very good progress on the parts that are in the works and a very good dialogue. So we haven't seen anything significant on that front. But recognizing that the FAA does have a lot on its plate, probably never more -- more than ever in history, and they now have an administrator. So that's a good thing, and they've added people. So we see it moving ahead, but it is inherently very difficult to be precise about when you expect things to actually be resolved.\nGiuliano Bologna: Got it. That's very helpful. And then one more on a topic that kind of came up earlier, but there's obviously a lot of tightening in MRO capacity across the industry. And I'm curious how you think about that impacting your business and how long that could -- that trend could continue?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, it's good for us because our pitch to airlines is we can save you time and save you money on maintenance events. And the longer the time you'd have to spend by sending an engine into an MRO, the more savings we provide. So -- and I think the GTF issue, there's some -- basically, every GTF engine is going to have to go through a shop visit in the next couple of years on an accelerated basis.  So that's going to push out what was potentially available capacity is going to be used up by the GTF. So the market is definitely very -- getting tight and going to get tighter, and that's very good for us because we're essentially just pre-building modules to supply people in a short period of time and have them avoid or skip the agony of a shop visit.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Hillary Cacanando with Deutsche Bank.\nHillary Cacanando: Congratulations on the great quarter. Just a quick question on the 2024 guidance. I was wondering if you can also provide how many modules you're expecting to sell? If you kind of -- maybe you could give us some guidance on that as well?  And then on the USM side, could you tell us like how much of the EBITDA was attributed to USM for the third quarter? And then for 2024, if you could talk about like how many engines you expect to part out during the year from the USM?\nJoseph Adams: Okay. I'll take two, and I'll give one to Angela. I think we expect to part out -- I think this year, we're parting out of roughly 40 engines and next year, we're expecting it to go to 50. And we essentially make approximately $1 million per engine from that activity.  On the number of modules next year that we're -- our assumption is in the neighborhood of 200 modules for next year. But there's a wide range on that and there's different mix. So I wouldn't -- that's not terribly precise. But that's sort of order of magnitude where we are. What was this year -- what would we think this year will be, a 100?\nEun Nam: Yes. 100.\nUnidentified Company Representative: 130.\nJoseph Adams: 130 this year. So that's sort of the order of magnitude of growth on that. And then USM, Angela?\nEun Nam: USM for fourth quarter?\nJoseph Adams: Q3.\nEun Nam: Q3. It's about 25% of our aerospace EBITDA from USM.\nJoseph Adams: No, for the third quarter of this year.\nEun Nam: Third quarter of this year. Yes, 25% of our EBITDA.\nJoseph Adams: Okay, 25%. So roughly $10 million this quarter.\nHillary Cacanando: Okay. Got it. That's really helpful. And then I just have 1 more follow-up question. So it looks like you sold fewer engines in the third quarter, 8 engines versus 17 engines last quarter and just given the strong environment, just strong demand for engines, I was just wondering why you sold fewer than last quarter? Was that deliberate or just timing?\nJoseph Adams: We have been selling mostly the non-CFM56 or non-V2500 engines. So those engine sales, we've been signing up in the last few quarters have been a lot of Pratt 4000s, CF6-80s, RB211s, which we now own fewer and fewer of those. So that's why I think engine sales -- we're not interested in selling a lot of our CFM56 or V2500 assets today because we think they're still going up in value.  And we would expect to hold those rather than monetize it. We could actually monetize them today at a very nice gain, but that would probably be short-lived. I mean they're going to go up in value. So we're -- and that's one of the reasons why we've stepped down gain on sale for next year as we've repositioned our fleet to more CFM56 and increasingly now V2500. And we have fewer assets that we're looking to sell, and we also think they're all going up in value.\nHillary Cacanando: Okay. So your strategy is more towards just leasing the engines rather than selling the CSM, right? You would rather lease them, rather than sell?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. On that basis, yes. We're also still -- we're effectively selling modules. So we're selling engines for engine shop visits and then rebuilding them. So -- but just outright selling an engine, we don't see that as a big activity.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Mckenna with JMP Securities.\nBrian Mckenna: So it will be great just to get an update on where you are in the process around insurance claims related to the Russia and Ukraine war? And then is there any updated timeline around selling the ships portfolio? And can you just remind us how much liquidity both of these situations could bring in?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. I think a good number for the combined proceeds that we would expect to -- I think it's reasonable to get from both of those would be around $300 million. And I would break that out roughly half and half. So on the insurance side, it's now turned into a negotiation with the airlines who wrongfully took our assets, but they're using Russian money like Aeroflot has done a couple of occasions already. We have 3 separate negotiations that are advancing to settle. So that would avoid the lengthy litigation that is the fallback strategy. So we're hoping we can resolve 1 or 2 of those possibly fairly soon and the other one by, say, the middle of next year.  On the ship side, we also have 2 assets, both of which are being marketed. The macro for that industry is really good. People are not building any new ships and there's very strong demand. So I would also expect that we could monetize those ships, possibly the smaller one fairly soon, but by the middle of next year would be a reasonable target on that as well.\nBrian Mckenna: Helpful. And then just switching gears a little bit. So it's been a few quarters since you acquired QuickTurn. So can you just give us an update on how this acquisition is going so far and then where you are in the integration process? And then just more broadly on M&A. In this environment, are you seeing any uptick in strategic opportunities that could accelerate the strategy or the growth of the company longer term?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So QuickTurn is doing great. We have streamlined the activity focused mostly on engine tests and very light hospital shop visits and module swaps, which was the big driver of why we really were interested in that facility. We did over 20 engine tests in September and what's our estimate for October?\nUnidentified Company Representative: 20.\nJoseph Adams: About 20. So that's a pretty good run rate. And demand from industry partners, major airlines around the world is good. So we think that is playing out very nicely, and we'll continue to use that for delivering and exchanging modules. So we're very happy with that acquisition.  On the broader topic of M&A, there are things happening in the industry. It's obviously the industry, the aftermarket segment has got people's attention. It's performing very well in a market where not a lot of things are performing well. So that's sort of a bit of a rising sector. And we are seeing things that are being offered for sale.  We're very focused on engines and engine maintenance. So we're not going to get off of that track. But there are segments that have aspects that would be interesting to us that we're looking at. And I mentioned before, engine piece part repair is still a focus for us and we've made progress on that, but I still think that, that is an interesting segment for us to get bigger in.\nBrian Mckenna: Great. Congrats on another nice quarter.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Sherif Elmaghrabi with BTIG.\nSherif Elmaghrabi: So first, you talked about having more core sales in Q3. Could we see some lumpiness going forward as the mix shift between core and fan? Or is this kind of more of a hockey stick trajectory?\nJoseph Adams: I think it's moderate. I mean the mix is not going to shift dramatically because, again, you have -- an engine has 3 different modules, so you're going to ultimately move all of them at some point. So it's really just a quarter-to-quarter fluctuation not something that I would say would be that dramatic over a longer measurement period.\nSherif Elmaghrabi: Okay. And then given PMA is sounding more of a 2025 story, and I know you said it's hard to be precise, but can you remind us of the timeline between PMA approval and when we start seeing them show up in the modules? And where do we sit on that timeline for the 4 PMAs going through approval right now?\nJoseph Adams: So there -- as I said, good progress on all of them. We will -- as soon as those part numbers -- parts are approved, we will put them into our engines. And so they will be available almost immediately. Chromalloy begins production usually ahead of when they submit -- finally submit, so there's inventory available immediately.  What -- the longer lead time will be third-party sales or other airlines who have to go through an approval process and an engineering review and that varies airline to airline, which is why it's always difficult to predict how long that will take and what the ramp period is. But you're talking months, not years.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Galanti with Stifel.\nFrank Galanti: Great. I wanted to sort of dig in just sort of a true-up question. Earlier in your comments, you said this year, you expect 130 modules to be sold. That would be something like 10 modules in 4Q. I just want to sort of give an opportunity to correct that number if that number is indeed wrong.  But then on a bigger scale, you sort of -- in the prepared remarks, you mentioned that EBITDA kind of growing sequentially in order to see that, especially around next year, if there's only 200 modules sold, your margins are in the 50-plus percent range, which means a lot more cores. How do you sort of think about the lumpiness and then the kind of sequential growth of cash flows out of modules sold?\nJoseph Adams: On the first question, you're right. The 130 is low, we should be in the 150 to 160 for the year total for modules -- for the year for modules. So that is correct. And the second question was margins. I mean we've been talking about blended margins of around 35% for Aerospace Products. the USM margins tend to be lower than module margins. So it sort of blends out to a mid-30s is what we've been indicating, and there could be some variations. We've had quarters where it was in the 40s.  We haven't had any low quarters yet, but we could. And so it's really hard to -- I think -- we're comfortable with the mid-30s range. But actually, how it plays out each quarter is going to be -- we'll have to talk about it when it happens.\nFrank Galanti: Sure. That's helpful. And switching over to sort of the lease income on the aviation side. You mentioned lease amortization is sort of eats into that lease income number. But looking quarter-over-quarter, that's only a $5 million increase in lease intangible amortization. So if you back that in, you're only at $41 million, which is still a $7 million lease income for the quarter and that seems like too much relative to utilization increasing. And really, the question is maybe if there's any comment on that? But then secondly, in the guide for '24, can you sort of break down what your assumptions are from a utilization perspective relative to a portfolio growth perspective?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So we indicated that leasing for 2024 would be approximately $425 million, if you exclude gain on sale. And we have put -- we are seeing higher lease rates, and we have added quite a few engines on lease in Q3 and Q4, and we have some acquisitions we're making. So when you put that together, if you take $100 million run rate currently, $425 million assumes, I think, modest growth going forward for 2024 for Leasing. And certainly, we're seeing a very strong market, which if it continues, it would provide, I think, some potential upside.\nFrank Galanti: Okay. That's helpful. And one more, if I could. On the PMA side, is there any possibility you can comment on if the engineering work is complete for the 4 modules graining to be approved?\nJoseph Adams: No, I wouldn't comment on specific parts at this point.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nDavid Zazula: This is David Zazula on for Brandon. Congrats on the real growth in Aerospace Products this quarter. Joe, if I could ask kind of a broad one to start. You guys have done very well, it appeared to us anyway, on the cargo side during the last couple of years, and that market has been under at least a little bit more pressure from what we can tell. Can you talk a little bit about your exposure there and how you're thinking about the cargo mix, what you're hearing from those type of customers right now?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. Our cargo exposure is de minimis. We decided, I think starting 18 months ago, to basically get out. It was a very, very strong market sort of driven by COVID and e-commerce, and we didn't see -- we saw a lot more downside than upside. And so we basically got out of the cargo market. I don't see an immediate rebound. So I wouldn't rush to go back in.\nDavid Zazula: And then on the module side, it seems like you had an uptick in repeat customers. I guess can you talk anything about the composition of those customers and what feedback you're getting there?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. We're getting great repeat. I mean every customer I think we've had sold a module to has come back for more. So we have a 100% success rate on repeat customers and we actually have a number of those customers who've given us orders for 2024 or indications, they've said, we want 8 fans or we want 6 LPTs or 5 cores next year.  So that helps us because we can position that and plan for the year ahead of time. And people have -- I mean, it really is -- it's an amazingly simple concept that really saves people time and money. And so people once they do it, they're like, \"Wow, I mean, why didn't we do this for years?\" So it's -- we haven't -- I don't think we've had a single negative comment from anybody on the customer side indicating they wouldn't do it -- they wouldn't use it more.\nDavid Zazula: Great. And then for Angela, it looks like you drew down the revolver a little bit this quarter, and then Joe was talking about some kind of exciting opportunities down the pike. Is there anything you can tell us about kind of the incremental capital policy or what you're thinking about at least as you stand right now?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. We do have some leads for some of the opportunities, the investment opportunities are very attractive right now. And we're looking at several debt financing alternatives of not a huge amount, but some amount. And it may be temporary given the $300 million of potential liquidity we get from the Russia assets and the ship sales. So we're in good shape. It's really just potentially timing.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets.\nKenneth Herbert: Joe, maybe I wanted to see if I could ask a question on an earlier comment you made specifically around just tightness in the CFM56 or more broadly the narrowbody MRO network. Are you starting to see that reflected yet in quotes for sort of extended turn times as we think about turnaround times on the CFM56, sort of where they are now and where they could go into the first part of the next year?\nJoseph Adams: Do you want to take that?\nUnidentified Company Representative: Sure. So broadly speaking, we are starting to see a longer lead time on piece part repair. So one of the key drivers for our turn time on shop visit is going to be piece part repairs. And what we're seeing is a delay in that supply chain side of the business. Our position on piece parts is we have a program where we're able to carry [indiscernible] material. As we've discussed, the engines that we're tearing down the 40 engines this year, a lot of those engines, we can teardown and use and mitigate a lot of those delays on turn times. And that's also going to drive a lot of demand for modules because modules, in a way, are a replacement of doing a full shop visit. And you can do a lot of these shop visits outside of a traditional overhaul shop.  So the delay in a way is very good for our module program, and we're mitigated through having piece part repairs in our teardown program. But we are starting to see that delay creep up, and we're expecting that to continue to creep up as the new technology engines are going to take up more capacity in the OEM and MRO space.\nKenneth Herbert: Great. Helpful. And just one follow-up. Are you expecting any incremental pushback from your airline customers on piece part pricing in 2024? As you sort of think about your ability and the demand for USM and maybe even new parts or PMA parts, how was the pricing dynamic playing out? And is that going to continue to be sort of a nice tailwind for the alternative material marketplace?\nJoseph Adams: It's a great tailwind. I mean the OEMs have taken significant price hikes. And as you -- I'm sure you're aware, it was low double digits in 2022 and that it was a sort of 9% to 10% price hike on parts that was implemented in August of this year, so it wasn't even a full year.  So that's sort of the pricing umbrella that USM operates under. And so to the extent the OEMs continue to raise prices like that, which I believe they will, we will benefit from that. And it also makes the whole engine worth a lot more as basically, the replacement value of that is it goes up with really in lockstep with the piece part prices.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Alan for closing remarks.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, and thank you all for participating in today's conference call.

So we had a lot of teardowns in Q2, Q3, and you'll see that revenue come through Q4 and Q1. Yes. Yes. 100. USM for fourth quarter? Q3. It's about 25% of our aerospace EBITDA from USM. Third quarter of this year. Yes, 25% of our EBITDA."

            "name": "Joseph Adams",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 34th dividend as a public company and our 49th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on November 28, based on a shareholder record date of November 14.  Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA. We had another strong quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $154.2 million in Q3 2023, which is up 1% compared to $153.1 million in Q2 of 2023 and up 42% compared to $108.9 million in Q3 2022.  During the third quarter, the $154.2 million EBITDA number was comprised of $119.6 million from our Leasing segment, $40.6 million from our Aerospace Products segment and negative $6 million from Corporate and Other.  Turning now to Leasing. Leasing had another good quarter posting approximately $120 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of the $120 million of EBITDA came in at $102 million for Q3 versus $94 million in Q2.  Additionally, on the acquisition side, we closed on 10 aircraft and 23 engines at attractive prices, which will contribute to further growth in future Leasing EBITDA. Part of the $120 million in EBITDA for Leasing came from gains on asset sales. We sold $55.4 million book value of assets at a 24% margin for a gain of $17.6 million benefiting from strong demand for assets globally. And we've had more asset sales coming in the final quarter of this year.  Aerospace Products had yet another excellent quarter with $40.6 million of EBITDA and an overall EBITDA margin of 38%. We sold 41 modules in Q3 to 11 unique customers comprised of 2 new customers and 9 repeat customers. We see tremendous potential in Aerospace Products and feel very good about generating consistent EBITDA growth.  As to the balance of 2023, we see FTAI coming in above the high end of the $550 million to $600 million EBITDA range, which we communicated at the beginning of 2023. Looking ahead to 2024, our current expectation is for Leasing EBITDA to total $475 million for the year, including $50 million from gains on asset sales.  Based on a strong backlog and an expanding customer base, we are looking for $200 million to $250 million of Aerospace Products EBITDA in 2024, up from $98 million year-to-date 2023 and $70 million in 2022. Overall, we therefore expect annual aviation EBITDA for 2024 to be between $675 million to $725 million, not including Corporate and Other.  With that, I'll turn the call back to Alan. Yes. So as you can imagine, demand for the prior technology equipment is very, very high in light of what is going to be accelerated maintenance on the new technology and some estimates, the company or others are estimating that approximately 600 A320s with GTF engines on them will be grounded in the first half of 2024 and approximately 300 on average through 2026.  So that's a significant amount of assets that are going to be out of service for an extended period of time. And so anybody that has A320ceos just keeping them and is doing the maintenance to refresh the engine. So both of those are very good for us, and that lease rates are trending up. Almost week to week, you can see increases right now. And so that's positive and it's likely going to continue for some time.  And maintenance events, people that we're estimating they were going to take assets out of service or not do another shop visit or might part them out are delaying and deferring that. So there'll be more maintenance and assets will last longer. So all of those factors are very, very good for the equipment that we maintain and own. Yes, in that $200 million to $250 million number, we've included about $15 million to $20 million of EBITDA from PMA. And that would come from both the sale of PMA parts as well as modules. And we're not sure on the ramp. It's hard to actually forecast that. So I would assume that most of that is towards the back end of the year is our current assumption. Yes. So we also had growth in the sale of used service raw material. So USM was higher and is likely going to continue to grow. As we've mentioned previously, we started a number of teardowns in the second quarter, and it generally takes 3 to 6 months for that revenue to show up in EBITDA.  So we're seeing strong demand for USM obviously, with shop visits increasing and that's 1 key way of saving money on a shop visit. So we see the teardown in used service raw material activity growing. And then within the modules, the mix of modules matters in terms of the revenue and the core has more revenue than the fan and the low-pressure turbine.  So it's -- we had more core sales activity in this third quarter than we had in the second quarter. So it's proving -- that's exactly what we've been expecting and what we're selling. It's a harder sell. It's a longer sell to sell core. It's easier to do a fan in 2 days or a low-pressure turbine in a week. The core is a little bit more complicated, but we've been pitching that for a couple of years now and now we've got a lot of customers there recognizing the substantial savings there. Yes, there's 2 things went on. One is we elected to terminate 4 A320 aircraft leases to a carrier in Southeast Asia. And we did that to get higher rates and better terms. And so we did that intentionally. There's such strong demand for these assets, we've already got multiple parties that are negotiating to get them. So we had -- when you terminate a lease, you have lease maintenance revenues that you recognize from the prior lease come through.  So that's why you see a step up in the maintenance revenue. And then the lease side is a bit of an accounting issue. When we do engine swaps for aircraft that are on lease, we book the difference in value. When you put a new engine on an aircraft and you take an old engine off, there's generally an increase in the value from the new engine going in.  That gets amortized under the rules, the lease accounting rules as a lease incentive. And so that shows up as -- it's a contra revenue, actually, so it reduces your lease revenue, strangely. But those -- that's why you see it going down. It's a noncash item, too. So it's even more confusing from that point of view. Thanks. Sure. So yes, we've had a very good progress on the parts that are in the works and a very good dialogue. So we haven't seen anything significant on that front. But recognizing that the FAA does have a lot on its plate, probably never more -- more than ever in history, and they now have an administrator. So that's a good thing, and they've added people. So we see it moving ahead, but it is inherently very difficult to be precise about when you expect things to actually be resolved. Yes, it's good for us because our pitch to airlines is we can save you time and save you money on maintenance events. And the longer the time you'd have to spend by sending an engine into an MRO, the more savings we provide. So -- and I think the GTF issue, there's some -- basically, every GTF engine is going to have to go through a shop visit in the next couple of years on an accelerated basis.  So that's going to push out what was potentially available capacity is going to be used up by the GTF. So the market is definitely very -- getting tight and going to get tighter, and that's very good for us because we're essentially just pre-building modules to supply people in a short period of time and have them avoid or skip the agony of a shop visit. Okay. I'll take two, and I'll give one to Angela. I think we expect to part out -- I think this year, we're parting out of roughly 40 engines and next year, we're expecting it to go to 50. And we essentially make approximately $1 million per engine from that activity.  On the number of modules next year that we're -- our assumption is in the neighborhood of 200 modules for next year. But there's a wide range on that and there's different mix. So I wouldn't -- that's not terribly precise. But that's sort of order of magnitude where we are. What was this year -- what would we think this year will be, a 100? 130 this year. So that's sort of the order of magnitude of growth on that. And then USM, Angela? Q3. No, for the third quarter of this year. Okay, 25%. So roughly $10 million this quarter. We have been selling mostly the non-CFM56 or non-V2500 engines. So those engine sales, we've been signing up in the last few quarters have been a lot of Pratt 4000s, CF6-80s, RB211s, which we now own fewer and fewer of those. So that's why I think engine sales -- we're not interested in selling a lot of our CFM56 or V2500 assets today because we think they're still going up in value.  And we would expect to hold those rather than monetize it. We could actually monetize them today at a very nice gain, but that would probably be short-lived. I mean they're going to go up in value. So we're -- and that's one of the reasons why we've stepped down gain on sale for next year as we've repositioned our fleet to more CFM56 and increasingly now V2500. And we have fewer assets that we're looking to sell, and we also think they're all going up in value. Yes. On that basis, yes. We're also still -- we're effectively selling modules. So we're selling engines for engine shop visits and then rebuilding them. So -- but just outright selling an engine, we don't see that as a big activity. Yes. I think a good number for the combined proceeds that we would expect to -- I think it's reasonable to get from both of those would be around $300 million. And I would break that out roughly half and half. So on the insurance side, it's now turned into a negotiation with the airlines who wrongfully took our assets, but they're using Russian money like Aeroflot has done a couple of occasions already. We have 3 separate negotiations that are advancing to settle. So that would avoid the lengthy litigation that is the fallback strategy. So we're hoping we can resolve 1 or 2 of those possibly fairly soon and the other one by, say, the middle of next year.  On the ship side, we also have 2 assets, both of which are being marketed. The macro for that industry is really good. People are not building any new ships and there's very strong demand. So I would also expect that we could monetize those ships, possibly the smaller one fairly soon, but by the middle of next year would be a reasonable target on that as well. Yes. So QuickTurn is doing great. We have streamlined the activity focused mostly on engine tests and very light hospital shop visits and module swaps, which was the big driver of why we really were interested in that facility. We did over 20 engine tests in September and what's our estimate for October? About 20. So that's a pretty good run rate. And demand from industry partners, major airlines around the world is good. So we think that is playing out very nicely, and we'll continue to use that for delivering and exchanging modules. So we're very happy with that acquisition.  On the broader topic of M&A, there are things happening in the industry. It's obviously the industry, the aftermarket segment has got people's attention. It's performing very well in a market where not a lot of things are performing well. So that's sort of a bit of a rising sector. And we are seeing things that are being offered for sale.  We're very focused on engines and engine maintenance. So we're not going to get off of that track. But there are segments that have aspects that would be interesting to us that we're looking at. And I mentioned before, engine piece part repair is still a focus for us and we've made progress on that, but I still think that, that is an interesting segment for us to get bigger in. Thanks. I think it's moderate. I mean the mix is not going to shift dramatically because, again, you have -- an engine has 3 different modules, so you're going to ultimately move all of them at some point. So it's really just a quarter-to-quarter fluctuation not something that I would say would be that dramatic over a longer measurement period. So there -- as I said, good progress on all of them. We will -- as soon as those part numbers -- parts are approved, we will put them into our engines. And so they will be available almost immediately. Chromalloy begins production usually ahead of when they submit -- finally submit, so there's inventory available immediately.  What -- the longer lead time will be third-party sales or other airlines who have to go through an approval process and an engineering review and that varies airline to airline, which is why it's always difficult to predict how long that will take and what the ramp period is. But you're talking months, not years. On the first question, you're right. The 130 is low, we should be in the 150 to 160 for the year total for modules -- for the year for modules. So that is correct. And the second question was margins. I mean we've been talking about blended margins of around 35% for Aerospace Products. the USM margins tend to be lower than module margins. So it sort of blends out to a mid-30s is what we've been indicating, and there could be some variations. We've had quarters where it was in the 40s.  We haven't had any low quarters yet, but we could. And so it's really hard to -- I think -- we're comfortable with the mid-30s range. But actually, how it plays out each quarter is going to be -- we'll have to talk about it when it happens. Yes. So we indicated that leasing for 2024 would be approximately $425 million, if you exclude gain on sale. And we have put -- we are seeing higher lease rates, and we have added quite a few engines on lease in Q3 and Q4, and we have some acquisitions we're making. So when you put that together, if you take $100 million run rate currently, $425 million assumes, I think, modest growth going forward for 2024 for Leasing. And certainly, we're seeing a very strong market, which if it continues, it would provide, I think, some potential upside. No, I wouldn't comment on specific parts at this point. Yes. Our cargo exposure is de minimis. We decided, I think starting 18 months ago, to basically get out. It was a very, very strong market sort of driven by COVID and e-commerce, and we didn't see -- we saw a lot more downside than upside. And so we basically got out of the cargo market. I don't see an immediate rebound. So I wouldn't rush to go back in. Yes. We're getting great repeat. I mean every customer I think we've had sold a module to has come back for more. So we have a 100% success rate on repeat customers and we actually have a number of those customers who've given us orders for 2024 or indications, they've said, we want 8 fans or we want 6 LPTs or 5 cores next year.  So that helps us because we can position that and plan for the year ahead of time. And people have -- I mean, it really is -- it's an amazingly simple concept that really saves people time and money. And so people once they do it, they're like, \"Wow, I mean, why didn't we do this for years?\" So it's -- we haven't -- I don't think we've had a single negative comment from anybody on the customer side indicating they wouldn't do it -- they wouldn't use it more. Yes. We do have some leads for some of the opportunities, the investment opportunities are very attractive right now. And we're looking at several debt financing alternatives of not a huge amount, but some amount. And it may be temporary given the $300 million of potential liquidity we get from the Russia assets and the ship sales. So we're in good shape. It's really just potentially timing. Do you want to take that? It's a great tailwind. I mean the OEMs have taken significant price hikes. And as you -- I'm sure you're aware, it was low double digits in 2022 and that it was a sort of 9% to 10% price hike on parts that was implemented in August of this year, so it wasn't even a full year.  So that's sort of the pricing umbrella that USM operates under. And so to the extent the OEMs continue to raise prices like that, which I believe they will, we will benefit from that. And it also makes the whole engine worth a lot more as basically, the replacement value of that is it goes up with really in lockstep with the piece part prices."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q2 2023 FTAI Aviation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there\u2019ll be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like the hand to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Alan Andreini, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Justin. I would like to welcome you all to the FTAI Aviation Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer, and Angela Nam, our Chief Financial Officer. We have posted investor presentation in our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you have not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen only mode and is being webcast. In addition, we will be discussing some non GAAP financial measures during the call today including EBITDA. The reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward looking statements including regarding future earnings. These statements by their nature are uncertain and they differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non GAAP financial measures and forward looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our quarterly report filed with the FCC. Now I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoe Adams: Thank you, Alan. To start today, I\u2019m pleased to announce our 33rd dividend as a public company and our 48th consecutive dividends since inception. The dividend of 30 cents per share will be paid on August 29th, based on a shareholder record date of August 14th. Now let\u2019s turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA. We got another strong quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $153.1 million in Q2 of 2023, which is up 20% compared to $127.7 million in Q1 of 2023 and up 2% compared to $150.7 million in Q2 of 2022, where we had over $64 million of gains on sale in that quarter. During the first quarter the $153.1million EBITDA number was comprised of $125.9 million from our leasing segment, and $30.1 million from our aerospace product segment and negative $2.8 million from corporate and other. Turning now to leasing. Leasing had a great quarter posting approximately $126 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of the $126 million came in at $94 million for Q2, versus $91 million in Q1 of 2023. With strong demand for assets, and the peak of the Northern Hemisphere summer season, we expect Q3 will grow incrementally. Additionally, on the acquisition side, we closed on 15 aircrafts and 23 engines at very attractive prices, which will contribute to further growth in future leasing EBITDA. We remain confident in leasing EBITDA to have $350 million to $400 million for the year, excluding gains on asset sales. Part of $ 26 million in EBITDA for leasing pain from gains on asset sales. We sold $69.6 million books I have assets at a 31% margin gain of $31.9 million benefiting from strong demand for assets globally. We have more asset sales coming in the remainder of the year, and continue to be comfortable assuming gains on asset sales of approximately $25 million per quarter, or $100 million for all of 2023 Aerospace products had yet another excellent quarter with $30 million of EBITDA and an overall EBITDA margin of 44%. We sold 37 modules in Q2 to nine unique customers, comprised of three new customers and six repeat customers. We see tremendous potential and continue to feel good about generating $20 to $30 million in quarterly EBITDA and think $100 million plus in 2023 EBITDA remains very doable. We feel confident about this number because we\u2019re seeing an expanding backlog of aerospace products business With leasing companies, MROs, or maintenance, repair and overhaul organizations and airlines. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Alan.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Joe. Justin, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from John Sullivan from the Benchmark Company. Your line is now open.\nJosh Sullivan: Good morning, nice quarter here. Given the strength in the aviation leasing side in the issues the newest generation of engines are facing, and now we have RTX geared turbofan engine, looking at some accelerated shop visit cycles into an already tight MRO market, I know you don\u2019t have any GTFs, but have you seen any of that GTF pressure starting to play out for demand in your products and services?\nJoe Adams: Yes, we, you know, the airlines we talked to are all holding on to their, you know, old last generation equipment. So, we\u2019ve seen airlines decide to extend leases, they\u2019re looking for more assets, you know, the H220 Co family, or the 77800, those markets are very tight. It\u2019s very hard to get additional capacity, this is going to put more pressure on the on those fleets, because you\u2019re going to have you know, with the GTF, it\u2019s estimated you\u2019ll have 1200 engine shop visits over the next 12 months, 200 in the next two to three months. So that\u2019s in the busy summer season, trying to schedule that between now and September is going to be extremely challenging. So, anybody that has, you know, existing flying assets is going to keep them and they\u2019re looking for more and there\u2019ll be more demand for spare engine. So I think as you point out, it\u2019s already a very tight market, and this is going to turn, you know, the stress up, you know, another couple of levels in terms of putting more demand for the assets that we own.\nJosh Sullivan: And then maybe what do you seen as far as the sale leaseback market, you know, the large deals in the bidding process? Maybe what is your pipeline look like? Or what really gets the market going again?\nJoe Adams: Yeah, it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s picking up. I mean, previously, I think the last few calls, we\u2019ve been saying that the best buys for us have been assets that are off lease that have, you know, we can buy cheap and put, you know, cash flow attached to it and then create value that way. We\u2019re now starting to see that we\u2019re very competitive again on assets that are either on lease or with fail leaseback transactions with airlines. We think it\u2019s primarily because a lot of the mid-tier leasing companies were relying on debt financing provided by the ABS market, which is really not available. And it\u2019s very challenging for people to price out deals with no debt or with much higher cost debt. So, it\u2019s not that we\u2019ve increased our pricing, it\u2019s that the market seems to have come, you know, to us. So, we\u2019re seeing, you know, in several portfolio deals that are very attractive with cash flow attached and sell lease backs, which never seem to go away totally, because airlines always need money. So those markets, I think for the next at least for the next six to nine months, we see very good investment opportunities. That\u2019s a fairly recent development.\nJosh Sullivan: Thank you for the time.\nOperator: And thank you. One moment. And one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Gianna Bologna from Compass Point. Your line is now open.\nGuiliano Bologna: Good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter here. One question I\u2019d be curious about. Obviously, we\u2019re seeing some very strong performance at the, you know, the module factory and you service materials driving the product segment, you\u2019re also seeing strong lease leasing EBIDTA, if I look at the first half of the year, at the segment level before corporate, you\u2019re analyzing 585-586 million EBIDTA already. And you\u2019ve been talking about you know, 550 to 600 at the segment level, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the competence level around that range, because you\u2019re growing rapidly and you\u2019re already running up closer to the high end of that range in the first half of the year.\nJoe Adams: Our confidence level is pretty high, it\u2019s so it\u2019s every quarter you have behind you it\u2019s easier look, you know, and hit the year. So, I think and we have pretty good backlog at this point, as you can tell from my comments. So, I think that, you know, if the environment doesn\u2019t, you know, swerve in some fashion you know, against us, which doesn\u2019t look at all likely we\u2019ve got you know, we\u2019re pretty confident in those numbers for the year. So that\u2019s, that\u2019s good. And in generally you\u2019ve got pretty decent visibility out, you know, three to six months on, you know what activity is in the pipeline.\nGuiliano Bologna: That\u2019s great. Maybe just for a little more context, obviously leasing, we have a good sense of where that is. And you probably have a good sense of the pipeline, but also on the M&A side. And then thinking just on the product side, in terms of the drivers, that give you a little bit confidence there, I\u2019m curious of where the how the backlog works on the module factory aside, if you\u2019re continuing to see that module volume demand continuing to step up, we\u2019ve been saying it for the last few quarters.\nJoe Adams: Yes, as you know, we\u2019ve mentioned we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve had a high level of repeat customers, I don\u2019t think anybody that we\u2019ve done business with hasn\u2019t indicated they\u2019re going to do more and, and many of those customers have already put in orders for, you know, the balance of this year and indicated what they\u2019d like to do next year, as they, as they have, you know, visibility on their shop visits. So, it\u2019s very good. And we add new customers as well, as you can see, we, you know, we continue to develop the repeat business, but we\u2019re also adding, you know, each quarter will add, you know, a handful of new customers, which will also grow so, so I think the backlog on modules is excellent, and visibility is increasing. And people once they\u2019ve used it, you know, can say, well, now I\u2019m going to use it, you know, in all my shop visits, and that gives us, you know, a longer-term view into what the, what the pipeline will look like, it allows us also, you know, helpfully to pre build inventory. So, the more visibility we have, what that what the customer is going to do, the easier it is for us to increase our throughput in turn time because we\u2019ve been preposition assets. And in that way, the other the other businesses, the USM users\u2019 material business, and we see that increasing, we\u2019ve been running as we indicated, we probably did approximately 30 tear downs. Last year, we\u2019ve been running at that a little bit higher than that in the first half of this year. But we\u2019re going to increase the rate of tear downs. And we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve taken a number of engines in to inventory and started the processes. As you\u2019re probably aware, it takes about three to six months before you get revenue because you\u2019d have to tear down the engine, label all the parts inspect, and many, many of those parts have to be repaired. So, they have to be sent out and then brought back so we see that level tear down activity increasing over 40 engines in this year and, and see very, very strong demand as the original equipment manufacturers, as you\u2019re probably aware of putting a price increase in August one of the share, which was quite a bit earlier than they\u2019ve previously done it. So, I guess if you annualize that rate increase that\u2019s, that\u2019s also, you know, well into the double digits. So new part prices are going up rapidly. So, use or service material is very valuable. And we have probably the biggest supply of US service will material in the world, maybe other than the OEM, who doesn\u2019t like to sell USM anyway. But that, that gives us quite a good tool to get additional business and cross sell modules and other maintenance services. So, we\u2019re, we\u2019re going to take the USM activity level up in next two quarters.\nGuiliano Bologna: That\u2019s great. I really appreciate the answering all the caller, I\u2019ll jump back in the queue.\nOperator: And thank you, in one moment, our next question. And our next question comes from Hilary Cacanando from Deutsche Bank, your line is now open.\nHilary Cacanando: Hi. Hi, Joe. Thanks for taking my questions. So in the aerospace segment, you know, the total revenues declined sequentially. But the EBITDA at that margin was a lot stronger than last quarter at 44% versus 32%. Last quarter, could you give us some color on what\u2019s causing that difference? And I guess just related to that, should we continue to expect someone to get going forward?\nJoe Adams: If it\u2019s primarily mix, that it\u2019s hard to, you know, control that quarter, but it was favorable this quarter, because we had slightly less use serviceable material sales and we also had more core modules that we sold, which tend to be higher margin, so we have less of the lowest margin and more of the highest margin, we would continue to suggest that 35% is still a good place to hold in the middle. As you know, for modeling purposes, we think that\u2019s a sustainable number and not will not always be above to the degree it was this quarter, which was really just driven by mix and then there\u2019s occasionally there\u2019s just an opportunistic sale that you haven\u2019t had the right asset at the right time for somebody who desperately needs it. So, you can also see sometimes we intentionally make sure we have that asset, so that\u2019s part of the business.\nHilary Cacanando: Got it. Thank you. And then I guess on the start, since we got rid of the K-one, SEC has gotten included in a number of indices, and was recently included in Russell 2000 last month. If any other indices are looking to add you to their index, particularly just kind of provide more color on that? Thank you.\nJoe Adams: We think that the next one that we\u2019re going to be considered for is the S&P 600 and that could be at the end of as early as the end of Q3 and estimates are from the index folks is that that number could be another 12 to 15 million shares.\nHilary Cacanando: Okay. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much.\nJoe Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays, your line is now open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Joe, I was wondering if you could provide us an update on the products approval process with the FTAI and where that stands?\nJoe Adams: Yes, everything is progressing and on the timeline that we\u2019ve talked about previously, which is we expect the additional four products to be available around the end of this year. And other than that, we\u2019re not providing any more detail about the process around that.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, but still on track for end of year. And strategically, Joe, I guess, how do you look to leverage that portfolio? Do you think it\u2019s going to be more powerful for you, in your own assets? Or is this going to be something that you think flourishes more third-party sales?\nJoe Adams: So, I think we\u2019ve always felt like, you know, we\u2019re going to use it, and we\u2019ll be a quick adopter. So, in that, we believe will facilitate other people adopting it. And as we saw with the CF 680 engine previously, we put PMA in those engines and lease them and no airline in the world had any issue with leasing an engine, PMA and some airlines will say, Well, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily put PMA in our own engines, but no one would not lease an engine. So similarly, we expect to be this, the similar in this market as it is, and that\u2019s why I think the, the integration of our products and the ability to cross sell, is very powerful, in that we have a solution for everyone. There\u2019s nobody out there, and we can offer something to value to help save on maintenance expense, which is an increasingly stands out on PMA airlines, as you\u2019re well aware, the chasm numbers are going up and maintenance, and particularly engine maintenance is one of the big drivers, so we think that this, our ability to offer a wide range of products, to anybody that owns an engine or flies and engines is really powerful.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay, appreciate that. And then on the capital side, I guess, are you comfortable with where you\u2019re running debt levels right now? And do you think you need a little bit more cash? Is there a capital required going forward?\nJoe Adams: We\u2019ve had access, we have a revolver that we\u2019ve always had access to that acts as our liquidity, and we\u2019ve had good access to the debt markets and the preferred markets. So, we think that the credit metrics are improving, as we\u2019ve told people, we expect to be in the mid threes debt to total EBITDA, which we achieved, look at the numbers, we achieved that this quarter, which we were saying, we were hoping to achieve that by the end of the year. So that\u2019s, that\u2019s good. And we think that that will position us to be strong that\u2019ll be in life as long as your strong double being you pretty much always have access to capital. So, we\u2019re, we\u2019re very close to that and think we\u2019re going to get good position you know, the, the need for capital is really driven off of investment opportunities, which is a good thing. And as I mentioned, we are seeing an increase in opportunities, which we didn\u2019t really expect but the world is funny and you know, things are always changing. So we\u2019re well positioned, you know, if, if opportunities present themselves to you know further Increase our position in CFM 56 market.\nBrandon Oglenski: All right, appreciate the response. Thank you.\nJoe Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: And thank you. one moment but our next question and our next question comes from Frank Galanti with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nFrank Galanti: Great, Thank you. Appreciate you taking my question I wanted to ask on ask about PMA approval for airlines in both the leasing and the module factory. So, is there been a change in the past couple of months on further PMA acceptance? And if possible, it\u2019d be helpful to sort of know of the LPT module sold what percentage of boats have PMA in it?\nJoe Adams: I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve sold any modules with PMA. And is that correct? We are flying in our lease fleet, what 15 or so engines for about 15 engines with PMA, in the CFM, 56 fleet. We\u2019ve had 100% of our CF680 fleet, and we\u2019re proud for Nelson\u2019s leave as PMA, which always has been the case. So we\u2019ve been in the CFM, 56. Fleet, we have about 15 engines that were flying leasing to other airlines that are flying with PMA.\nFrank Galanti: Is there any particular reason why there wouldn\u2019t be PMA in the LPT module? From a customer or from a strategic market entry perspective?\nJoe Adams: No, as I said, if you look at the development and CSAT, you know, engine marketing, we expect it to be similar. So that ultimately, it\u2019s purely a matter of timing as to when an engine needs a restoration of the LP T\u2019s and when it does, that\u2019s when there\u2019s an opportunity to use the PMA, you can\u2019t just you wouldn\u2019t necessarily take an engine off wing that doesn\u2019t is not due for a shop visit and swap out. Good, you know, OEM parts for PMA, you just do it when it\u2019s ready in the shop.\nFrank Galanti: Okay, and then sort of switching it up just from a generally higher interest rate environment. How does that, from your perspective affect the lease business, particularly lease rates?\nJoe Adams: Well, it\u2019s had a, I mean, I would say our, you know, at the lowest rate, our cost of debt was we did an issue a five and a half percent. And estimates right now we\u2019re trading in this probably seven and a half percent range on cost of debt capital. So are just to bring it to our personal situation, our cost of debt is up about 200 basis points, but I would say our return on assets that we\u2019re looking at deal wise, is probably up four to 500 basis points. So, from a, you know, investment point of view, it\u2019s, it\u2019s fine. We are you know, we\u2019re more than covering, you know, the increased cost of debt. The other side of it is how does it affect the industry and I, I alluded to that earlier, and I think a lot of sort of mid-tier leasing companies that used to go out and raise an equity fund and, and assume they were going to be able to leverage that, with relatively cheap debt are struggling, that\u2019s hard, it\u2019s hard to get the debt, the debt is way more expensive than it was before, by orders of magnitude, you know, not 200 basis points, but multiples of that. So, the numbers don\u2019t work, which means that they\u2019re not competitive, or prices come down or, and all of that, you know, is what sort of leads us to be in a pretty good position, because our cost of debt is up a little bit, not a lot. And we don\u2019t leverage each individual deal. So. So we\u2019re in a, we\u2019re in an environment more like 2010 and 11, where, you know, he who has money or she who has money is, you know, in a good spot. So that\u2019s kind of the-- that\u2019s the macro on, you know, on the new aircraft side, I don\u2019t-- we don\u2019t really participate in that market. So you\u2019d be better to ask, you know, the people have the big new aircraft orders, than us.\nFrank Galanti: That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks very much.\nJoe Adams: Yep.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Bryan McKenna from JMP securities. Your line is now open.\nBryan McKenna: Great. Thanks. So Joe, could you talk about the opportunity in the repair market? I know you\u2019ve spoken about this a little bit in the past. But I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about this opportunity today, both in the US and then in Europe as well. And would you look to potentially do an acquisition here to create some more scale initially versus trying to build it organically from scratch?\nJoe Adams: Yeah. Great question. We since we last spoke up in Montreal, we have made progress on the repair. Joint Venture, we took a trip through Europe and met with quite a few different options, and we\u2019ve narrowed it down. And so I think we are progressing with on that, and we had expected or hoped that we would have something by the end of this year, that would be in place. And I still believe that, that seems, you know, doable. And we\u2019re still very interested, as I mentioned, we\u2019re increasing our teardown activity fairly meaningfully, which means our repair volume is going to be up materially, which makes us an even better partner for people who have repair products. So I think it\u2019s only gotten better. And the repair market is, you know, a lot of people are paying attention to it now because OEM parts prices keep going up, and up and up. And so recycling, or fixing, or repairing is pretty attractive-- is a pretty attractive business for everyone. So very excited about that, would we, you know, buy versus build. And, you know, I think we\u2019re trying, you know, building something from scratch, is probably the best overall economics, but it takes a long, long time. So I don\u2019t-- I think we\u2019d rather avoid that. And, you know, if we can get in, you know, into something sooner, that would be better. It could involve investing some modest amount of capital. But it\u2019s I doubt that it\u2019s not going to-- there\u2019s no one company out there that has the portfolio that we could, you know, sort of acquire. And so it\u2019s probably more of a partnership structure.\nBryan McKenna: Got it. Very helpful. And then maybe just a question on your externally managed structure. So you clearly have had a long standing relationship with Fortress since inception, but just given the growth trajectory of F tie and the size and scale the business today, versus just a couple of years ago. Would you ever look to internalize the business and move out from under the Fortress umbrella?\nJoe Adams: Well, we got a lot of benefits from being part of Fortress. And we also are in the process of being a sole Fortress is under contract to be sold to Mubadala, which would likely not close until around the end of the year, so it\u2019s really a decision the new owner would need to make on that front.\nBryan McKenna: Got it. Thanks, Joe. And congrats on another great quarter.\nJoe Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Robert Dodd from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nRobert Dodd: Hi. Excuse me. Hi, guys. And congratulations on the quarter [indiscernible]. So question, you partly answered it about capital allocation, right. I mean, obviously, you know, I usually ask about the dividend, the dividend is extremely well covered from free cash flow. Your leverage is now in the middle of your target range for that strong double B. I mean, what\u2019s the appetite for? And is there any appetite for allocating capital to increasing the dividend, or is it just the opportunities for investment in acquisition of assets are just much more attractive. And if you can give us-- you\u2019ve given us the delever acquisition dividend kind of priority order before. But you\u2019ve already hit your leverage kind of target. So can you can you rank where you view the priorities on capital allocation now, given that the leverage has improved significantly?\nJoe Adams: Yes, it\u2019s similar. I mean, the number one priority has always been investment opportunities. And as I mentioned previously, there\u2019s an uptick in activity there. So I think that has caught our attention at the moment. So that\u2019s number one. We\u2019ve never not been able to, you know, buy assets that we wanted to buy and so didn\u2019t want to keep that string unbroken. So that\u2019s number one. And secondly is making sure that we have the good credit metrics to maintain double B and to be strong double B, which as you said, we\u2019re there probably a little ahead of schedule, so that\u2019s good. And then after that, we would then look at dividends and stock buybacks. But I think the priority is still acquisitions number one, debt level number two, and then equity activity.\nRobert Dodd: Got it. And [indiscernible] one, what would it take confidence by? You\u2019ve been very clear, you\u2019re very confident in the guidance. What would it have taken for you to increase the indication for the aerospace products? Obviously, $100 million plus is still your indication. You have it effectively 60 already for this year with the building pipelines. So are you just being conservative or the common, where unless the market swerves against you? Are you worried about a market\u2019s worth? Or is it just pure conservative as it?\nJoe Adams: Well, I\u2019m always worried about a market\u2019s worth, [indiscernible] predict, you never know. But I mean, it feels very good. And, you know, I mentioned everything. We went from having everything working against us to having everything working in favor. So I\u2019m happy about that. And I\u2019m, you know, every day I wake up, I would say, I hope this continues. So now we\u2019re not worried about it. But you always have to be worried about it, because it\u2019s the airline industry. But no, I think it really is just the passage of time. This is still a relatively new business. We\u2019ve got new customers and feedback that is very positive and building orders. But you know, I think time is really just, it\u2019s still in the early innings. It\u2019s actually really early innings for us and the industry. And I just think it\u2019s, you know, time is, is sort of what we really just need to continue to build a track record.\nRobert Dodd: God, I appreciate that. Thank you. And again, congrats on before.\nJoe Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: And thank you. And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Alan Andreini for closing remarks.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Justin. Thank you all for participating in today\u2019s conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q3.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Adams",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 33rd dividend as a public company and our 48th consecutive dividends since inception. The dividend of 30 cents per share will be paid on August 29th, based on a shareholder record date of August 14th. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA. We got another strong quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $153.1 million in Q2 of 2023, which is up 20% compared to $127.7 million in Q1 of 2023 and up 2% compared to $150.7 million in Q2 of 2022, where we had over $64 million of gains on sale in that quarter. During the first quarter the $153.1million EBITDA number was comprised of $125.9 million from our leasing segment, and $30.1 million from our aerospace product segment and negative $2.8 million from corporate and other. Turning now to leasing. Leasing had a great quarter posting approximately $126 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of the $126 million came in at $94 million for Q2, versus $91 million in Q1 of 2023. With strong demand for assets, and the peak of the Northern Hemisphere summer season, we expect Q3 will grow incrementally. Additionally, on the acquisition side, we closed on 15 aircrafts and 23 engines at very attractive prices, which will contribute to further growth in future leasing EBITDA. We remain confident in leasing EBITDA to have $350 million to $400 million for the year, excluding gains on asset sales. Part of $ 26 million in EBITDA for leasing pain from gains on asset sales. We sold $69.6 million books I have assets at a 31% margin gain of $31.9 million benefiting from strong demand for assets globally. We have more asset sales coming in the remainder of the year, and continue to be comfortable assuming gains on asset sales of approximately $25 million per quarter, or $100 million for all of 2023 Aerospace products had yet another excellent quarter with $30 million of EBITDA and an overall EBITDA margin of 44%. We sold 37 modules in Q2 to nine unique customers, comprised of three new customers and six repeat customers. We see tremendous potential and continue to feel good about generating $20 to $30 million in quarterly EBITDA and think $100 million plus in 2023 EBITDA remains very doable. We feel confident about this number because we're seeing an expanding backlog of aerospace products business With leasing companies, MROs, or maintenance, repair and overhaul organizations and airlines. With that, I'll turn the call back to Alan. Yes, we, you know, the airlines we talked to are all holding on to their, you know, old last generation equipment. So, we've seen airlines decide to extend leases, they're looking for more assets, you know, the H220 Co family, or the 77800, those markets are very tight. It's very hard to get additional capacity, this is going to put more pressure on the on those fleets, because you're going to have you know, with the GTF, it's estimated you'll have 1200 engine shop visits over the next 12 months, 200 in the next two to three months. So that's in the busy summer season, trying to schedule that between now and September is going to be extremely challenging. So, anybody that has, you know, existing flying assets is going to keep them and they're looking for more and there'll be more demand for spare engine. So I think as you point out, it's already a very tight market, and this is going to turn, you know, the stress up, you know, another couple of levels in terms of putting more demand for the assets that we own. Yeah, it's interesting, it's picking up. I mean, previously, I think the last few calls, we've been saying that the best buys for us have been assets that are off lease that have, you know, we can buy cheap and put, you know, cash flow attached to it and then create value that way. We're now starting to see that we're very competitive again on assets that are either on lease or with fail leaseback transactions with airlines. We think it's primarily because a lot of the mid-tier leasing companies were relying on debt financing provided by the ABS market, which is really not available. And it's very challenging for people to price out deals with no debt or with much higher cost debt. So, it's not that we've increased our pricing, it's that the market seems to have come, you know, to us. So, we're seeing, you know, in several portfolio deals that are very attractive with cash flow attached and sell lease backs, which never seem to go away totally, because airlines always need money. So those markets, I think for the next at least for the next six to nine months, we see very good investment opportunities. That's a fairly recent development. Our confidence level is pretty high, it's so it's every quarter you have behind you it's easier look, you know, and hit the year. So, I think and we have pretty good backlog at this point, as you can tell from my comments. So, I think that, you know, if the environment doesn't, you know, swerve in some fashion you know, against us, which doesn't look at all likely we've got you know, we're pretty confident in those numbers for the year. So that's, that's good. And in generally you've got pretty decent visibility out, you know, three to six months on, you know what activity is in the pipeline. Yes, as you know, we've mentioned we've, we've had a high level of repeat customers, I don't think anybody that we've done business with hasn't indicated they're going to do more and, and many of those customers have already put in orders for, you know, the balance of this year and indicated what they'd like to do next year, as they, as they have, you know, visibility on their shop visits. So, it's very good. And we add new customers as well, as you can see, we, you know, we continue to develop the repeat business, but we're also adding, you know, each quarter will add, you know, a handful of new customers, which will also grow so, so I think the backlog on modules is excellent, and visibility is increasing. And people once they've used it, you know, can say, well, now I'm going to use it, you know, in all my shop visits, and that gives us, you know, a longer-term view into what the, what the pipeline will look like, it allows us also, you know, helpfully to pre build inventory. So, the more visibility we have, what that what the customer is going to do, the easier it is for us to increase our throughput in turn time because we've been preposition assets. And in that way, the other the other businesses, the USM users' material business, and we see that increasing, we've been running as we indicated, we probably did approximately 30 tear downs. Last year, we've been running at that a little bit higher than that in the first half of this year. But we're going to increase the rate of tear downs. And we've, we've taken a number of engines in to inventory and started the processes. As you're probably aware, it takes about three to six months before you get revenue because you'd have to tear down the engine, label all the parts inspect, and many, many of those parts have to be repaired. So, they have to be sent out and then brought back so we see that level tear down activity increasing over 40 engines in this year and, and see very, very strong demand as the original equipment manufacturers, as you're probably aware of putting a price increase in August one of the share, which was quite a bit earlier than they've previously done it. So, I guess if you annualize that rate increase that's, that's also, you know, well into the double digits. So new part prices are going up rapidly. So, use or service material is very valuable. And we have probably the biggest supply of US service will material in the world, maybe other than the OEM, who doesn't like to sell USM anyway. But that, that gives us quite a good tool to get additional business and cross sell modules and other maintenance services. So, we're, we're going to take the USM activity level up in next two quarters. If it's primarily mix, that it's hard to, you know, control that quarter, but it was favorable this quarter, because we had slightly less use serviceable material sales and we also had more core modules that we sold, which tend to be higher margin, so we have less of the lowest margin and more of the highest margin, we would continue to suggest that 35% is still a good place to hold in the middle. As you know, for modeling purposes, we think that's a sustainable number and not will not always be above to the degree it was this quarter, which was really just driven by mix and then there's occasionally there's just an opportunistic sale that you haven't had the right asset at the right time for somebody who desperately needs it. So, you can also see sometimes we intentionally make sure we have that asset, so that's part of the business. We think that the next one that we're going to be considered for is the S&P 600 and that could be at the end of as early as the end of Q3 and estimates are from the index folks is that that number could be another 12 to 15 million shares. Thanks. Yes, everything is progressing and on the timeline that we've talked about previously, which is we expect the additional four products to be available around the end of this year. And other than that, we're not providing any more detail about the process around that. So, I think we've always felt like, you know, we're going to use it, and we'll be a quick adopter. So, in that, we believe will facilitate other people adopting it. And as we saw with the CF 680 engine previously, we put PMA in those engines and lease them and no airline in the world had any issue with leasing an engine, PMA and some airlines will say, Well, we wouldn't necessarily put PMA in our own engines, but no one would not lease an engine. So similarly, we expect to be this, the similar in this market as it is, and that's why I think the, the integration of our products and the ability to cross sell, is very powerful, in that we have a solution for everyone. There's nobody out there, and we can offer something to value to help save on maintenance expense, which is an increasingly stands out on PMA airlines, as you're well aware, the chasm numbers are going up and maintenance, and particularly engine maintenance is one of the big drivers, so we think that this, our ability to offer a wide range of products, to anybody that owns an engine or flies and engines is really powerful. We've had access, we have a revolver that we've always had access to that acts as our liquidity, and we've had good access to the debt markets and the preferred markets. So, we think that the credit metrics are improving, as we've told people, we expect to be in the mid threes debt to total EBITDA, which we achieved, look at the numbers, we achieved that this quarter, which we were saying, we were hoping to achieve that by the end of the year. So that's, that's good. And we think that that will position us to be strong that'll be in life as long as your strong double being you pretty much always have access to capital. So, we're, we're very close to that and think we're going to get good position you know, the, the need for capital is really driven off of investment opportunities, which is a good thing. And as I mentioned, we are seeing an increase in opportunities, which we didn't really expect but the world is funny and you know, things are always changing. So we're well positioned, you know, if, if opportunities present themselves to you know further Increase our position in CFM 56 market. Thanks. I don't think we've sold any modules with PMA. And is that correct? We are flying in our lease fleet, what 15 or so engines for about 15 engines with PMA, in the CFM, 56 fleet. We've had 100% of our CF680 fleet, and we're proud for Nelson's leave as PMA, which always has been the case. So we've been in the CFM, 56. Fleet, we have about 15 engines that were flying leasing to other airlines that are flying with PMA. No, as I said, if you look at the development and CSAT, you know, engine marketing, we expect it to be similar. So that ultimately, it's purely a matter of timing as to when an engine needs a restoration of the LP T's and when it does, that's when there's an opportunity to use the PMA, you can't just you wouldn't necessarily take an engine off wing that doesn't is not due for a shop visit and swap out. Good, you know, OEM parts for PMA, you just do it when it's ready in the shop. Well, it's had a, I mean, I would say our, you know, at the lowest rate, our cost of debt was we did an issue a five and a half percent. And estimates right now we're trading in this probably seven and a half percent range on cost of debt capital. So are just to bring it to our personal situation, our cost of debt is up about 200 basis points, but I would say our return on assets that we're looking at deal wise, is probably up four to 500 basis points. So, from a, you know, investment point of view, it's, it's fine. We are you know, we're more than covering, you know, the increased cost of debt. The other side of it is how does it affect the industry and I, I alluded to that earlier, and I think a lot of sort of mid-tier leasing companies that used to go out and raise an equity fund and, and assume they were going to be able to leverage that, with relatively cheap debt are struggling, that's hard, it's hard to get the debt, the debt is way more expensive than it was before, by orders of magnitude, you know, not 200 basis points, but multiples of that. So, the numbers don't work, which means that they're not competitive, or prices come down or, and all of that, you know, is what sort of leads us to be in a pretty good position, because our cost of debt is up a little bit, not a lot. And we don't leverage each individual deal. So. So we're in a, we're in an environment more like 2010 and 11, where, you know, he who has money or she who has money is, you know, in a good spot. So that's kind of the-- that's the macro on, you know, on the new aircraft side, I don't-- we don't really participate in that market. So you'd be better to ask, you know, the people have the big new aircraft orders, than us. Yep. Yeah. Great question. We since we last spoke up in Montreal, we have made progress on the repair. Joint Venture, we took a trip through Europe and met with quite a few different options, and we've narrowed it down. And so I think we are progressing with on that, and we had expected or hoped that we would have something by the end of this year, that would be in place. And I still believe that, that seems, you know, doable. And we're still very interested, as I mentioned, we're increasing our teardown activity fairly meaningfully, which means our repair volume is going to be up materially, which makes us an even better partner for people who have repair products. So I think it's only gotten better. And the repair market is, you know, a lot of people are paying attention to it now because OEM parts prices keep going up, and up and up. And so recycling, or fixing, or repairing is pretty attractive-- is a pretty attractive business for everyone. So very excited about that, would we, you know, buy versus build. And, you know, I think we're trying, you know, building something from scratch, is probably the best overall economics, but it takes a long, long time. So I don't-- I think we'd rather avoid that. And, you know, if we can get in, you know, into something sooner, that would be better. It could involve investing some modest amount of capital. But it's I doubt that it's not going to-- there's no one company out there that has the portfolio that we could, you know, sort of acquire. And so it's probably more of a partnership structure. Well, we got a lot of benefits from being part of Fortress. And we also are in the process of being a sole Fortress is under contract to be sold to Mubadala, which would likely not close until around the end of the year, so it's really a decision the new owner would need to make on that front. Thanks. Yes, it's similar. I mean, the number one priority has always been investment opportunities. And as I mentioned previously, there's an uptick in activity there. So I think that has caught our attention at the moment. So that's number one. We've never not been able to, you know, buy assets that we wanted to buy and so didn't want to keep that string unbroken. So that's number one. And secondly is making sure that we have the good credit metrics to maintain double B and to be strong double B, which as you said, we're there probably a little ahead of schedule, so that's good. And then after that, we would then look at dividends and stock buybacks. But I think the priority is still acquisitions number one, debt level number two, and then equity activity. Well, I'm always worried about a market's worth, [indiscernible] predict, you never know. But I mean, it feels very good. And, you know, I mentioned everything. We went from having everything working against us to having everything working in favor. So I'm happy about that. And I'm, you know, every day I wake up, I would say, I hope this continues. So now we're not worried about it. But you always have to be worried about it, because it's the airline industry. But no, I think it really is just the passage of time. This is still a relatively new business. We've got new customers and feedback that is very positive and building orders. But you know, I think time is really just, it's still in the early innings. It's actually really early innings for us and the industry. And I just think it's, you know, time is, is sort of what we really just need to continue to build a track record. Thanks."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Q1 2023 FTAI Aviation Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Alan Andreini, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Justine. I would like to welcome you all to the FTAI first quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer; and Angela Nam, our Chief Financial Officer. We have posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you have not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only-mode and is being webcast. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including EBITDA. The reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements by their nature are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our quarterly report filed with the SEC. Now I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 32nd dividend as a public company and our 47th consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on May 23, based on a shareholder record date of May 12. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metrics for us are adjusted EBITDA. We began the year well with adjusted EBITDA of $127.7 million in Q1, 2023, which is up 3% compared to $123.5 million in Q4 2022 and up 184% compared to $45 million in Q1, 2022, which had been adversely affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. During the first quarter, the $127.7 million EBITDA number was comprised of $107.6 million from our leasing segment, $27.4 million from our aerospace products segment, and negative $7.3 million from corporate and other. Turning out to leasing. Leasing had a good quarter, posting approximately $108 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of $108 million came in at $91 million for Q1, up from $85 million in Q4. With strong demand for assets and the commencement of the Northern Hemisphere summer season, we expect Q2 will continue to grow. We remain very confident in leasing EBITDA of $350 million to $400 million for the year, excluding gains on asset sales. Part of the $108 million in EBITDA for leasing came from gains on asset sales. We sold $92.2 million book value of assets for a gain of $16.5 million, slightly below our expectations, but we have more asset sales coming in Q2 and the rest of the year and are comfortable assuming gains on asset sales of approximately $25 million per quarter, or $100 million for all of 2023. Aerospace products had another excellent quarter with $27 million of EBITDA. We started these activities at the end of 2020, and in the last six quarters have booked approximately $120 million of EBITDA without any contribution from PMA. We see tremendous potential and continue to feel good about generating $20 million to $30 million in quarterly EBITDA and think $100 million plus in 2023 EBITDA remains very doable. We feel confident about this number because we're seeing a rapidly expanding backlog of aerospace products business with other leasing companies, maintenance and repair organizations, and airlines. With that, let me turn the call back over to Alan.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Joe. Justin, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Josh Sullivan from Benchmark Company.\nJosh Sullivan: Hey, good morning. And congratulations on the results and progress here. So you're now annualizing EBITDA at some good rates, and you walk through some of the components there. Just curious if the $550 million to $600 million EBITDA guidance is still the right framework at this point as well.\nJoseph Adams: Yes.\nJosh Sullivan: That was yes, I broke up there.\nJoseph Adams: Yes, that was yes.\nJoseph Adams: Sorry it was a one word, obviously it was one word answer, maybe. But yes, as we indicated each one of segments, if you add up each one of the segments, it's very much on target. And we think as we're heading into the strong season, Q2, Q3 that there is probably some upside in these numbers as well.\nJosh Sullivan: Got it. And then just within the gain on sales here, I know they can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, as you mentioned, but was there any particular program that moved around, or how should we think about those gain on sales moving forward?\nJoseph Adams: No, it is lumpy, and typically you get a lot of transactions that target closing towards the end of the year, and some of them, they slip over in the Q1. So Q1 is usually the slowest because you've emptied out your bucket of deals usually. So it's not unusual for Q1 to be a bit slow. And then it builds through the year. And most people have annual budgets that end in December, so you tend to see it growing towards the end of the year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Giuliano Bologna from Compass Point.\nGiuliano Bologna: Good morning, and congratulations on a great high quality weight quarter, this quarter. The first question I was curious about asking was around PMA. I'm curious if you have any updated thoughts around PMA or if there's any change in your opinion there, and if there's any update around the timetable compared to what you've laid out in the basket.\nJoseph Adams: No, there's no significant no real change in the timeline or what we outlined before, which is we expect all four products to be ready for final submission in the middle of this year. And I would say good progress has been made on every front that you need to achieve to be able to do that. So there's no change in what we've said previously, and I would just say good progress on all fronts towards getting those parts in the market.\nGiuliano Bologna: That's great. And then a slightly different area that probably doesn't get much focus. You still have those two offshore assets that are in the other category. I'd be curious if there's any update around potential thought process, around maybe selling one or two of them this year. And then also I'd be curious if those had any financial impact in the quarter, positive or negative in the results.\nJoseph Adams: Sure. There was a little bit of a negative impact of probably $3 million in Q1 because we had some repairs that needed to be done on one of the larger vessels. So that was a bit of a drag on the numbers this quarter and the ship is back in service, so we expect the next two quarters to be good. So that should reverse. In terms of selling, we're actively evaluating it and still believe that most likely the best timing to do transact would be towards the end of this year, around the end of this year, given that the larger vessel just started operating in the well intervention market. And the more credentialized it becomes, the wider the universe of potential buyers. And that market has recovered a lot. So I feel better and better about being able to achieve that on that timeline towards the end of this year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Frank Galanti from Stifel.\nFrank Galanti: Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Congrats on the nice quarter here. I wanted to ask sort of on the aerospace business, can you sort of talk about what the component, I guess the makeup or the mix of that $27 million of EBITDA, how much was modules, how much was USM?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So this quarter, it was about two thirds from The Module Factory, one third from US, Used Service launch, USM. It was a little bit more USM this quarter than there has been as we've been predicting, that market is picking up given parts shortages and price increases. So that's a good thing. We\u2019ve indicated we'll probably be targeting about 40 teardowns a year and we make approximately a $1 million per teardown. So $40 million of EBITDA divided by four would be $10 million. So there's a little bit of upside, I think, going forward for USM. And then I think there's a lot of upsides as I've mentioned before at our Module Factories, we have a strong backlog of customers who, some of whom are fully committed and some have just given us verbal that they're looking for programs of eight or more modules a year and the number of airlines indicating that keeps growing. So we feel very good about the repeat customer mix of which in Q1 there were probably seven customers out of the 10 who were repeats and three that were new customers. So we're progressing as we expected in terms of both growing the number of customers as well as growing the number of modules per customer.\nFrank Galanti: Great. And actually I wanted to follow up on that comment. Is there a sense for, the question is really around customer stickiness sort of like a churn number? I know it might be early in the business to sort of get a sense for that, but do you have like a percentage churn that the business is currently operating under? Or I guess another way to think about it, is there a way to quantify how much capacity those 26 or 29 customers that you've used before, like are you at 10% of their shop visits? Are you at 5, 25, 50? Like is there a lot more room to grow in those customers, the 29 customers that you've worked with in the past?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, there's a lot of room to grow, and as you've indicated, well, first of all, I would say there's no churn in that. We've not lost any customers. Nobody has used the product has said to us or indicated that they wouldn't use it again. So that's a very good thing. And people like the product. And if you look at their total number of shop visits starting out, you're talking about airlines that have potentially anywhere from 10 to 100 shop visits a year. And so that's 30 to 300 modules per year. So we're barely if you're talking about doing four, going to eight, you're still at a very small percentage of their total available shop capacities opportunities. So we think that number will continue to grow. We haven't lost any customers. We think people, once they use it, they will repeat it again. In particular, as shop visit time, and time in the shop keeps growing and getting longer, the more cost savings a module swap presents to the airline. So we think the advantage of using them will only continue to get better and grow in the coming years.\nFrank Galanti: And just one clarifying question. You said 10 to 100 shop visits a year. Is that per customer or for the 29 customers in aggregate?\nJoseph Adams: No, that's per customer.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Zazula from Barclays.\nDavid Zazula: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I guess first on the aerospace products business. I think a lot of the investors we talk to are concerned about a macro slowing. It'd be interested in your assessment of the sensitivity of those businesses to a slowdown in the macro. Do you think it would reduce or increase demand or how you think customers would respond?\nJoseph Adams: We don't think it'll have much of an effect because one is because of COVID and the fact that airlines stopped doing shop visits for basically two years. Most green time has been burned off. So there's very little available green time in fleets. As a matter of fact, in the last month we've had two or more airlines indicated that they need between 20 and 30 engines because they have nothing left. The tap is, the bucket is empty. So I think that mitigates any type of macro slowdown. And then secondly, you always hear that if there is a macro slowdown the focus on cost cutting accelerates. So more and more companies then go into a mode like what can I cut? What can I reduce? And we offer cost savings that is we're very direct about. We can save you money on your shop visit, or you can even avoid a shop visit by doing a module swap. So we think that it's a great product if airlines really need to hunker down and focus on cost cutting.\nDavid Zazula: Great. And then additionally, CFM56, I think you guys have done very well there, a lot of life left in that project. But as you're thinking long term, are you evaluating any other further generation engines, ecosystems to get into? How are you thinking about that? What would you think of for long term timing and how would you evaluate among the different potential projects as you look on down the line?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, we are thinking that we have two engines that we're particularly focused on right now, which we think are great candidates to do similar things that we've done on the CFM56. We see don\u2019t, really, we see the sweet spot for the CFM56 really running from 2024 to 2030. It's probably been extended out now because of delays in new aircraft delivery, difficulty with new engines staying on wing as long as people thought they would, supply chain disruptions, freighter conversions, all those factors are making the CFM56 life expectancy look longer and longer. So we don't feel that we need to divert attention from the organization. But as I say, somebody in every company needs to be thinking five years ahead. And so we do have two engines that we're working on. I'm not going to disclose what those are. But feel like those would be excellent candidates for us to consider adding when the time is right to do that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Hillary Cacanando from Equity Analyst.\nHillary Cacanando: Yes. Hi, Joe. Thanks for taking my question. So you had previously mentioned that you were looking at other maintenance related products to develop this year. And I think you mentioned something about repair in one of the industry conferences. Would you be able to talk a little bit more about that where you are in the process? And is this something that we can see happening this year?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, that's a great question. It is something that we're very actively engaged and working on. I'm very excited about the repair market opportunity. It's growing quite rapidly. It's got a lot of support from both cost savings, where essentially, you could repair a part for 20% of the cost of a new part. So it's a great product. And there's a number of companies that are continuing to develop more and more repairs. So we love the repair market. It fits perfectly into our portfolio. It also plays well with on the ESG side and that you're not making a new part, you're saving the old one. It's a recycling opportunity. So ESG is good. It's very pro repair business. In terms of progress, we do have a couple, I'd say two or three specific opportunities which we're running down. And as I said before, we hope that we can conclude do something material on the repair side this year in 2023.\nHillary Cacanando: Great. That's great to hear. And then I had another question in your presentation you noticed that there's strong backlog from airlines, lessors and MROs. I was wondering if you could provide a little more color regarding where you're seeing the most demand. I would think there's a strong demand coming from the airlines. But I was wondering if lessors are just as willing to use materials. And I guess related to that, when you do get all your PMA parts approved, do you think that lessors would be -- there would be strong demand from the lessors as well? Because I would think that lessors may be a little more sensitive about using non-OEM parts since they have to market those products. Just wanted to get your thoughts.\nJoseph Adams: Sure. So a few questions there. And on the last part, the PMA question and lessors, I do think there's growing acceptance and there is actual evidence of that in the CF680 engine, which I've talked about is a great case study. And we have bought 80 of those engines. We put PMA in all of those engines. We've done over 100 leases, never had any operator not take that engine because of PMA. And we've sold 53 of them, or 54 now where the prices were very competitive or as good or better than if it was all OEM equipment. And ironically, many of the buyers of those engines were the leasing companies. And so sometimes you can go ask them if they have PMA in their engine and they will say no, but they actually do. It's just they don't know it. So I think that the same fact pattern will play out in the CFM56 engine as well. So I do believe that there will be growing acceptance in that. In terms of where their activity, I mean, the good news is there's growing activity from all three categories. You have airlines. As I mentioned, a number of airlines have used up all their green time and so they're looking at summer schedules and then they're deciding to keep their NGS and the CO fleets longer. So they need more engines, or they might be doing an airframe overhaul that they didn't think they were going to do that. Now they need engines for the next five years. So airlines are clearly demand for engines is very strong. MROs as well because shops are filling up and sometimes shop turn times are slowing down or extending. So they need more engines to be able to do the shop visits that they have in-house and want to bid for it. And then leasing companies. It's really two different activities. One is we buy a fair amount of off lease assets from leasing companies. So a lot of leasing companies don't have the ability to put a lot of assets out if they're off lease, particularly engines. And so we're a great buyer. And then we can solve end of lease return comp issues with module swaps, and we're doing more and more of that. So at the end of a lease, if an airline owes a lot of money cash as a return compensation because the engine, they're going to give back doesn't have a certain number of hours in the cycles. We can help solve that by doing a module exchange for less than what the cash outlay would be otherwise. So we have a lot of products and solutions that we can offer, and the leasing companies are sort of accepting of all those because they're trying to get things done and move on.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brian McKenna from JMP Securities.\nBrian McKenna: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So what's the outlook for asset acquisitions for the remainder of the year? It seems like it continues to be a good environment to acquire assets, particularly for assets off lease. And then is there any increasing opportunity for sale leasebacks, given that we're likely going to see a softening economic backdrop here broadly?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, you're right on both counts. We're seeing a lot of off leased assets available that we continue to be the best, one of the best buyers for because we have the ability to scrap airframes and just lease engines, which a lot of other people don't. And so we're acquiring two packaged deals right now that fall right into that category at great prices, and then a lot of one off, leasing companies trying to clean up assets that they want to just get rid of and move on. So that area is pretty active. And we also in the module business probably half of our module sales involve us taking back a module in return or as an exchange, so we're not really depleting the inventory on half of those transactions. We just -- we then take that, replace the run out module, and then put it back through our factory and do it all over again. So we're able to replenish that. And then you're right on the there's still a number of airlines, COVID and Russia -Ukraine were pretty big jolts to the aviation system, and so there are airlines that have been sort of living on the edge for quite a while and sale lease backs are returning in terms of activity because of it\u2019s a great way of raising capital and we've done quite a bit of that. And so, particularly end of, if an airline is looking at, they have a new aircraft order and they're looking at phasing out a fleet. It's a way of raising cash today and forward selling their airplane. So we see all those areas of activity. And the good news about the CFM56 market is there's 20,000 of those engines in the world. So it's enormous and will be for many, many years so.\nBrian McKenna: Super helpful. Thanks, Joe. And then just a question on capital and liquidity. If the preferred market opens up again over the next few quarters, would you look to raise some additional capital through this part of the market? And then on liquidity more broadly, is there a minimum level of cash we like to run the business at?\nJoseph Adams: We typically run around $25 million to $50 million in cash and then we have availability on a revolver. So we feel that's very comfortable and have been doing that. In Q1, we actually paid down debt, so that was a good result in the quarter. We generated a lot of cash flow. And in terms of the preferred market, we will look to that periodically. We've always liked that market when it's open and if it becomes available, we'll look at it again for sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Robert Dodd from Raymond James.\nRobert Dodd: Hi, everybody. And congratulations on the quarter. Back to that capital question if I can. I mean, obviously you paid down debt. You're now on just Q1 run rate EBITDA. You're at 4x debt-to- EBITDA. If things go right, by the end of the year, you could be pretty close to three. So, I mean, can you give us, given where that leverage path is heading, can you give us idea of what you plan to do with the potential additional, at least from a metric perspective and additional capital you could have available while being in your ranges? Like, is it accelerated asset purchases, accelerated inventory build in the module swap, or maybe a dividend increase? Or can you give some idea of how you're thinking about allocating what could be an increased capital availability as we go through the year? Conceptual capital availability.\nJoseph Adams: Yes. I would speak in terms of priorities. Our first priority, as you mentioned, is to be sort of in the 3.5x debt to total EBITDA range, which we think gets us into the solid, strong BB with all agencies. So that's number one priority. I think we've been consistent about that. So right now, that is what we're shooting for, and obviously we're on track to do that with these numbers. So that's good. Then the second priority has always been investments. When you can generate 20% or 25% unlevered returns on new investments, those are things we've never not been able to do a deal we wanted to do so that is obviously having the firepower to do that is critically important from an earnings growth point of view. And then beyond that, we would look at all other options, including a dividend increase, stock buyback, or further debt pay down it\u2019s sort of it would be, we take a look at what the market opportunities are at the time and what the various security prices are. We also have securities we could buy back as well, other than just common. So we've got a lot of different opportunities, and we would like to be able to avail ourselves of those if things get disrupted.\nRobert Dodd: Just to that point. On the inventory of the modules, I mean, I think I asked about this before, you talked about it before. Are you revising up the inventory level you'd like to keep, or would you revise up the inventory level that you'd like to keep of modules and parts, et cetera? If demand plays out the way you expect it to or the way you turn the more thing, the components doesn't necessarily demand higher inventory levels.\nJoseph Adams: Yes, it's more the latter. Right now, we're running the aerospace products business with between $150 million and $200 million of capital, or working capital, which we churn frequently. And we think as we grow the business, that number probably goes up to $250 million to $300 million. But we're talking about doubling and tripling the volume with that. So it's not very capital intensive. It really is driven more by inventory turns and you become more efficient as you have more volume.\nOperator: And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Alan Andreini, you are available.\nAlan Andreini: Thanks Justin. And thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q2.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

So there's a little bit of upside, I think, going forward for USM. And then I think there's a lot of upsides as I've mentioned before at our Module Factories, we have a strong backlog of customers who, some of whom are fully committed and some have just given us verbal that they're looking for programs of eight or more modules a year and the number of airlines indicating that keeps growing. So we feel very good about the repeat customer mix of which in Q1 there were probably seven customers out of the 10 who were repeats and three that were new customers. So we're progressing as we expected in terms of both growing the number of customers as well as growing the number of modules per customer. Yes, there's a lot of room to grow, and as you've indicated, well, first of all, I would say there's no churn in that. We've not lost any customers. Nobody has used the product has said to us or indicated that they wouldn't use it again. So that's a very good thing. And people like the product. And if you look at their total number of shop visits starting out, you're talking about airlines that have potentially anywhere from 10 to 100 shop visits a year. And so that's 30 to 300 modules per year. So we're barely if you're talking about doing four, going to eight, you're still at a very small percentage of their total available shop capacities opportunities. So we think that number will continue to grow. We haven't lost any customers. We think people, once they use it, they will repeat it again. In particular, as shop visit time, and time in the shop keeps growing and getting longer, the more cost savings a module swap presents to the airline. So we think the advantage of using them will only continue to get better and grow in the coming years. No, that's per customer. We don't think it'll have much of an effect because one is because of COVID and the fact that airlines stopped doing shop visits for basically two years. Most green time has been burned off. So there's very little available green time in fleets. As a matter of fact, in the last month we've had two or more airlines indicated that they need between 20 and 30 engines because they have nothing left. The tap is, the bucket is empty. So I think that mitigates any type of macro slowdown. And then secondly, you always hear that if there is a macro slowdown the focus on cost cutting accelerates. So more and more companies then go into a mode like what can I cut? What can I reduce? And we offer cost savings that is we're very direct about. We can save you money on your shop visit, or you can even avoid a shop visit by doing a module swap. So we think that it's a great product if airlines really need to hunker down and focus on cost cutting. Yes, we are thinking that we have two engines that we're particularly focused on right now, which we think are great candidates to do similar things that we've done on the CFM56. We see don't, really, we see the sweet spot for the CFM56 really running from 2024 to 2030. It's probably been extended out now because of delays in new aircraft delivery, difficulty with new engines staying on wing as long as people thought they would, supply chain disruptions, freighter conversions, all those factors are making the CFM56 life expectancy look longer and longer. So we don't feel that we need to divert attention from the organization. But as I say, somebody in every company needs to be thinking five years ahead. And so we do have two engines that we're working on. I'm not going to disclose what those are. But feel like those would be excellent candidates for us to consider adding when the time is right to do that. Yes, that's a great question. It is something that we're very actively engaged and working on. I'm very excited about the repair market opportunity. It's growing quite rapidly. It's got a lot of support from both cost savings, where essentially, you could repair a part for 20% of the cost of a new part. So it's a great product. And there's a number of companies that are continuing to develop more and more repairs. So we love the repair market. It fits perfectly into our portfolio. It also plays well with on the ESG side and that you're not making a new part, you're saving the old one. It's a recycling opportunity. So ESG is good. It's very pro repair business. In terms of progress, we do have a couple, I'd say two or three specific opportunities which we're running down. And as I said before, we hope that we can conclude do something material on the repair side this year in 2023. Sure. So a few questions there. And on the last part, the PMA question and lessors, I do think there's growing acceptance and there is actual evidence of that in the CF680 engine, which I've talked about is a great case study. And we have bought 80 of those engines. We put PMA in all of those engines. We've done over 100 leases, never had any operator not take that engine because of PMA. And we've sold 53 of them, or 54 now where the prices were very competitive or as good or better than if it was all OEM equipment. And ironically, many of the buyers of those engines were the leasing companies. And so sometimes you can go ask them if they have PMA in their engine and they will say no, but they actually do. It's just they don't know it. So I think that the same fact pattern will play out in the CFM56 engine as well. So I do believe that there will be growing acceptance in that. In terms of where their activity, I mean, the good news is there's growing activity from all three categories. You have airlines. As I mentioned, a number of airlines have used up all their green time and so they're looking at summer schedules and then they're deciding to keep their NGS and the CO fleets longer. So they need more engines, or they might be doing an airframe overhaul that they didn't think they were going to do that. Now they need engines for the next five years. So airlines are clearly demand for engines is very strong. MROs as well because shops are filling up and sometimes shop turn times are slowing down or extending. So they need more engines to be able to do the shop visits that they have in-house and want to bid for it. And then leasing companies. It's really two different activities. One is we buy a fair amount of off lease assets from leasing companies. So a lot of leasing companies don't have the ability to put a lot of assets out if they're off lease, particularly engines. And so we're a great buyer. And then we can solve end of lease return comp issues with module swaps, and we're doing more and more of that. So at the end of a lease, if an airline owes a lot of money cash as a return compensation because the engine, they're going to give back doesn't have a certain number of hours in the cycles. We can help solve that by doing a module exchange for less than what the cash outlay would be otherwise. So we have a lot of products and solutions that we can offer, and the leasing companies are sort of accepting of all those because they're trying to get things done and move on. Yes, you're right on both counts. We're seeing a lot of off leased assets available that we continue to be the best, one of the best buyers for because we have the ability to scrap airframes and just lease engines, which a lot of other people don't. And so we're acquiring two packaged deals right now that fall right into that category at great prices, and then a lot of one off, leasing companies trying to clean up assets that they want to just get rid of and move on. So that area is pretty active. And we also in the module business probably half of our module sales involve us taking back a module in return or as an exchange, so we're not really depleting the inventory on half of those transactions. We just -- we then take that, replace the run out module, and then put it back through our factory and do it all over again. So we're able to replenish that. And then you're right on the there's still a number of airlines, COVID and Russia -Ukraine were pretty big jolts to the aviation system, and so there are airlines that have been sort of living on the edge for quite a while and sale lease backs are returning in terms of activity because of it's a great way of raising capital and we've done quite a bit of that. And so, particularly end of, if an airline is looking at, they have a new aircraft order and they're looking at phasing out a fleet. It's a way of raising cash today and forward selling their airplane. So we see all those areas of activity. And the good news about the CFM56 market is there's 20,000 of those engines in the world. So it's enormous and will be for many, many years so. We typically run around $25 million to $50 million in cash and then we have availability on a revolver. So we feel that's very comfortable and have been doing that. In Q1, we actually paid down debt, so that was a good result in the quarter. We generated a lot of cash flow. And in terms of the preferred market, we will look to that periodically. We've always liked that market when it's open and if it becomes available, we'll look at it again for sure. Yes. I would speak in terms of priorities. Our first priority, as you mentioned, is to be sort of in the 3.5x debt to total EBITDA range, which we think gets us into the solid, strong BB with all agencies. So that's number one priority. I think we've been consistent about that. So right now, that is what we're shooting for, and obviously we're on track to do that with these numbers. So that's good. Then the second priority has always been investments. When you can generate 20% or 25% unlevered returns on new investments, those are things we've never not been able to do a deal we wanted to do so that is obviously having the firepower to do that is critically important from an earnings growth point of view. And then beyond that, we would look at all other options, including a dividend increase, stock buyback, or further debt pay down it's sort of it would be, we take a look at what the market opportunities are at the time and what the various security prices are. We also have securities we could buy back as well, other than just common. So we've got a lot of different opportunities, and we would like to be able to avail ourselves of those if things get disrupted. Yes, it's more the latter. Right now, we're running the aerospace products business with between $150 million and $200 million of capital, or working capital, which we churn frequently. And we think as we grow the business, that number probably goes up to $250 million to $300 million. But we're talking about doubling and tripling the volume with that. So it's not very capital intensive. It really is driven more by inventory turns and you become more efficient as you have more volume."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q3 2024 FTAI Aviation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today. Alan Andreini, Investor Relations, please go ahead.\nAlan Andreini : Thank you, Liz. I would like to welcome you all to the FTAI Aviation Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer; Angela Nam, our Chief Financial Officer; and David Moreno, our Chief Operating Officer. We have posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you have not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only mode and is being webcast. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including EBITDA. The reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements, by their nature, are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements, and to review the risk factors contained in our Quarterly Report filed with the SEC. Now I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Adams : Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 38th dividend as a public company and our 53rd consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on November 25th based on a shareholder record date of November 14th. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metric for us is adjusted EBITDA. We continued our strong performance with adjusted EBITDA of $232 million in Q3 2024, which is up 8% compared to $213.9 million in Q2 of this year and up 50% compared to $154.2 million in Q3 of 2023. During the third quarter, the $232.0 million EBITDA number was comprised of $136.4 million from our leasing segment, $101.8 million from our aerospace product segment, and negative $6.2 million from corporate and other. Turning now to leasing, leasing at another great quarter posting approximately $136 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of that number came in at $122 million for Q3 versus $112 million in Q2 of 2024 and $102 million in Q3 2023. Additionally, we sold $20.7 million book value of assets for a gain of $14.3 million and have more sales coming in the final quarter of this year. With continuing high-demand for assets, we remain confident in generating $500 million in leasing EBITDA in 2024, including $50 million in gains on asset sales. Aerospace Products had yet another excellent quarter with $101.8 million EBITDA and an overall EBITDA margin of 34%, which is up 12% compared to $91.2 million in Q2 of this year and up 135% compared to $43.3 million in Q3 2023. We're seeing tremendous growth in adoption and usage of our aerospace products and are increasing our 2024 estimated EBITDA to $360 million to $375 million up from our previous estimate of $325 million to $350 million. Overall, we now expect annual aviation EBITDA for 2024 to be between $860 million to $875 million, not including corporate and other, up from $825 million to $850 million that we guided to last quarter. With that, let me turn the call back over to Alan.\nAlan Andreini : Thank you, Joe. Liz, you may now open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi, team. Thank you, and congrats on a great quarter. Maybe if we could just level set the playing field here. We often hear from investors the idea that FTAI is only capitalizing on the short-term bottlenecks in the aftermarket. Take the slower growth we've seen reported from some of the larger OEMs on their shop visits as an example this quarter or their aftermarket. When we get to a more normalized world and hopefully a few years, time, what does FTAI's business model look like and what's your vision and how do you think about the duration of the CFM56 platform, Joe?\nJoseph Adams: Sure, great. You know, we think about that all the time also. We are happy that we're in an environment, you know, that's so supportive of our business model. And we think it really enhances or it increases the rate at which we can convert customers to adopting a new way of doing things. And so, as we have worked with many airlines and we're increasing every quarter the number of new customers, we have seen no evidence that once people use our products or change the way they think about engine maintenance, which is letting us do it instead of them doing it, we've seen no evidence of anybody wanting to go back to the old way of doing it once the situation normalizes. And the reason is we're providing a tangible cost savings and time savings benefit to the customers. And it's not like they would three years from now wake up and say, let's go back to the old way of spending more money on engine maintenance. So we don't see any evidence that people will revert. And so this quarter we'll have the highest number of new customers that will convert to using our products. And David will talk more about that. And so we see the universe expanding as word of mouth spreads and more customers tell other people, hey, this is great, you should try it. But more often now today, the question we get is not the original question we got, was -- is this a good product and can I save money? It's if I go with you, how can I be sure that you'll be able to supply me the engines I need? And that's where we hear more now from the customer, which is a great development. It's like, I get it. I buy that you have a great product now, can you make sure that I will always have engines available? And so to that end, the acquisition we made of the Montreal facility, which we now call FTAI Canada, really plays nicely into that because if you look back at 2023, for example, we were producing about 30 modules per quarter during that period. We increased that in the first half of 2024 to about 50 modules per quarter. Since we took ownership in the third quarter, we've now increased that production rate to about 75 modules per quarter. And we expect in 2025 that we will be up to about 100 modules per quarter at that facility. And we're well on our way to doing that. So we obviously invite customers to go visit, come see what we do. We've changed a lot of the things that a typical MR would do, and we've made it much more of a manufacturing production line. We've specialized employees. We've ordered a lot of parts, so we're not at the risk of any supply chain disruptions. So we can take people through the facility and say, this is where your engines are going to come from. And we've got a lot of them and we have a lot of activity. And so that's a point of resistance we love to be able to try to sell through because you've got people almost on the finish-line. And so we believe very strongly that the conversion makes sense for people. We believe that it's a very sticky once you do get people converted. And then the only question left is how long do you think people will fly CFM56 engines? And we've obviously made a bet that we think it's a long time, but anybody can have a view on that. But we think that that's the easiest of the points to get comfortable with.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: I have a lot more questions, but I'll just stick to one more if it's okay, Joe. You mentioned you onboarded, I think, the most customers you've ever onboarded this quarter, and they are continuing to want more. So how do you think about how that discussion goes when they do convert, or how many customers did you have join, and when they do first start with you, what are the number of modules they start with and how do you see them ramping?\nDavid Moreno: Hey Sheila, this is David. I'll take that question. So this quarter was our record quarter for new customers. We onboarded 19 new customers. Typically a new customer places an order between one to two modules. And as you can imagine, the first sale is usually the toughest sale with a new customer because once you kind of go through the process, they understand that the time saving, cost savings, and As Joe mentioned, it is a very sticky product. At the same time, we also are starting to see strong repeat customers come in and request about five to 10 modules at a time. That's typically what a repeat customer will do. And what actually happens in practice is they open up and they provide a full schedule of shop visits for the next five years. Our product, demand on that product is event driven, meaning we want to know the shop visits, we want to match the modules with the shop visits, And once they convert to a repeat customer, we kind of have those discussions of understanding the fleet, the fleet plans, and how to maximize their cost savings and timing. An additional thing that we've done also is we're getting a lot of demand for field service. So what we've been doing in the past is we've been distributing modules on field with a lot of third-party field service team. We're getting customers who want us to do everything the full white glove service. So at quick turn, which is now FTAI USA we built a field service team that now is being deployed worldwide to actually do the installation and to offer the complete service. So we're very excited about offering that service and we think that's going to improve the overall experience even further and try further repeat business.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And then our next question comes from Jason Holcomb with Morgan Stanley. Jason, your line is now open.\nJason Holcomb: Good morning, Joe. Joe, on the V2500, in the past, you've mentioned you had inducted around 40 engines this year. Can you provide an update on how that is progressing. Are any engines beginning to come out of the shop yet? And then maybe if you could touch on the customer demand you've been seeing for the V2500. You've called out LATAM Airlines in the past, but are there any other large customer agreements we should be thinking about? Thank you.\nDavid Moreno: Thanks. Thank you, Jason. I can take this. This is David. So on the MRE, we're very excited with the progress so far on the V2500. On the production side, as we mentioned, the engines are in the shop. We're experiencing turnaround times that are on target, so 90 days to 120 days. And those engines now have provided a strong pipeline that are 100% committed to customers. So those engines are coming out of shop. The LATAM program has now officially started. So we've started exchanging engines today. Additionally, we've secured two large North American airlines on MRE for about 20 plus engines in the next few years. So that's, we're very excited about that and further growing that business. Those should be strong contributors starting next quarter or Q4 2024 and more even in 2025. I think we're seeing tremendous opportunity worldwide in many different regions. So we're hoping to expand into Asia sometime very soon on a new deal as well.\nJason Holcomb: Thank you very much for the color David. I'm going to ask a quick follow-up. Are you guys able to share with us the number of CFM56 models you've sold during the quarter and just provide an update on that side? Thank you.\nDavid Moreno: No. We've stopped providing that level of detail. We think it's, you know, commercially not, you know, a great idea. And so we think we give enough information without that.\nJason Holcomb: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Sullivan with Benchmark company. Josh your line is now open.\nJoshua Sullivan: Hey, good morning.\nJoseph Adams: Good morning.\nJoshua Sullivan: With Chromalloy announcing it's now received FAA approval for a V2500 blade recently, what do you think the implications for the industry and then for FAA are going to be?\nJoseph Adams: Well, I would take it as a positive. When you think about the most complex part of the entire engine, it's the high pressure turbine blades. And the fact that that got approved and is evidence that the FAA is confident. They have an extremely rigorous process, as we all know, and it's been a great \u2013 has a great track record of success in the US, and the worldwide. And getting that approved is a great sign for future parts, including the CFM56 parts that we're working on. So I take it as a great step and the process is working and as it did before COVID and it's working now post-COVID.\nJoshua Sullivan: And do you think [Lessor] (ph) will be willing to use the product?\nJoseph Adams: Well, we're a Lessor. I can't speak for everyone else. But I think it's, look, we use data when we make decisions, and our data is --. We have evidence that many of the parts are, you know, are performed extremely well and they cost less. So, you know, we kind of just think about that when we make decisions about what we do.\nJoshua Sullivan: Good, thanks for the time.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks. Liz, are you there? It seems the operator lost connection, So we're waiting for reconnection. Sorry about that. Liz? Liz, are you there?\nOperator: Yeah. I'm speaking to my team.\nJoseph Adams: Sorry, can you continue Q&A, please?\nJoshua Sullivan: Yes. Can you hear me?\nJoseph Adams: Yes.\nOperator: [Technical Difficulty]\nAlan Andreini: It\u2019s Hillary from Deutsche Bank ready to ask a question.\nHillary Cacanando: Oh, yes, sorry, I couldn't hear you. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a great quarter. So Joe, in the Aerospace segment, the EBITDA margin was 34% versus 37% last quarter. So I was wondering if you could just provide a little more details around that.\nJoseph Adams: Yes. This is the first quarter that we incorporated FTAI Canada in the numbers, and there are some legacy contracts for third-parties that we inherited when we acquired the company. And that had a negative effect because there are low or no margin contracts that are running-off. And so if you adjust for that, that would have normalized the margin at 200 to 300 basis points higher than the number we reported. And those contracts have a very short life. So we expect there'll be some impact in Q4, and then we'll be finished with that -- by the end of the year. So it's, it was just an impact from the acquisition that we had to assume those obligations, but they're running off.\nHillary Cacanando: Oh, that's great. So then I guess as a follow-up, when those contracts roll off at the end of the year, will you be expanding your capacity, I guess, you know, when those roll off? And then when you said earlier that you could do, you know, 100 modules per quarter in 2025, are you including, you know, potential additional capacity available when those contracts roll-off or would that be additional modules that you referred to earlier?\nJoseph Adams: Yes, it is, you know, we're gaining on our productivity for the CFM56 by taking employees who are doing other things at the facility that we need them to do and repurpose or giving them CFM56 oriented jobs. So we're able to increase the productivity that I mentioned, the 30 to 50, 75 to 100 with essentially the same workforce. So you're tripling, more or less tripling the productivity with a very similar head count. So it's -- as I mentioned earlier, it was a massively underutilized facility from our point of view and we're able to take the highest return anywhere in the company that we could get is focusing on increasing the productivity there, which we're doing and it's well underway even though we're only a month into it.\nHillary Cacanando: Got it. So you are assuming, so within that 100 modules number, you are assuming that you'll be using the employees that were working on those contracts and be focusing them to your module.\nJoseph Adams: Yes.\nHillary Cacanando: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And everyone, I do apologize for the interruption earlier and we will proceed with our Q&A. And we'll take our next question from Giuliano Bologna from Compass Point. Your line is open.\nGiuliano Bologna: Congratulations on another incredible quarter wrap performance. Something I was curious about was you've done a great job on the product segment, continuing to scale and grow the platform. I'm curious where you see a lot of the growth coming from at this point, and if there's been any kind of distribution between new customer growth or volume growth and how those trends continue to evolve?\nJoseph Adams: Yeah, I mean it is more organic growth. As we've said, we're focusing on the two largest engine markets in the world. Virtually every airline in the world operates a V2500 or a CFM56 engine, and we're still under 5% market share. So our focus is organic growth, And as I mentioned, as an example, with using the facility at FTAI Canada, we're able to triple the productivity with the same number of people. So the organic growth opportunity for us is right in front of us and it's extraordinary. And so we're not really focusing on anything other than that.\nGiuliano Bologna: That's very helpful. I appreciate it and I'll jump back in with you.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nKenneth Herbert: Yeah, hi. Good morning, everybody. Maybe, Joe, just to start off or David, you've obviously you called out, you know, you're not seeing any supply chain issues in terms of executing some of the business today on the part side. It seems to be a major issue for the industry. Can you talk a little bit about how you've effectively managed to de-risk it sounds like your CFM56 and now V2500 availability to parts and the extended lead times there that a lot of other, you know, MRO shops continue to talk about.\nJoseph Adams: Yes, and you probably noticed our, you know, working capital number increased from, you know, by roughly about $120 million from Q2 to Q3. And there's two reasons for that. One is we picked up about $50 million of inventory with the FTAI Canada acquisition. But secondly, we are purchasing a lot of parts to be able to enable our ramp up in productivity. As I mentioned, the 30 to 50 to 75 to 100, the best way to avoid supply chain disruptions is to pre-order and have a lot of inventory. And so there might be other ways, but that is the route we've chosen. We think it has a very high return on capital. You know, customers are very focused on the question, as I mentioned earlier, is we get the most often is can you actually get me the engines that I need and how can I be sure of that? And so we're buying more parts as an insurance policy effectively and we think it's low cost insurance and high payoff. So that's part of the thought process and I think we're well prepared going into 2025 to be able to really execute the best we can.\nKenneth Herbert: Okay, that's very helpful. And then on just the, since the LATAM deal, which I think obviously was playing out very well for you, what's the pipeline look like of other potential opportunities of that size? Or should we be thinking maybe smaller opportunities or are there still some perhaps chunkier opportunities out there as we think about exiting this year in 2025.\nDavid Moreno: Hey Ken, this is David. I'll take that question. So we're seeing many similar opportunities of that size, let's say 20 to 30 airplanes. And Again, the real thesis around is not that the airline wants to raise capital through a sale lease back, is they don't want to do maintenance. So that's really the thesis. So we're actively working those programs. And we expect to have some advancement probably this quarter, Q4 of this year.\nKenneth Herbert: Great. Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good morning everyone, and thanks for taking the question and congrats on a good quarter. Joe, I think you mentioned a pipeline or backlog in the release last night. So can you maybe give us some idea of how much contractual business you are attracting in the products segment? And then maybe longer term as well, how sustainable is your margin profile in the business? Because if we just simply look at other MRO providers, obviously a totally different profit profile.\nDavid Moreno: Hey Brandon, this is David. I can take that question. So as far as backlog, the way that we think about that is that's heavily correlated with the repeat customers. Today, on average, about 66% of our volume is on repeat customers. And the more that you engage customers by nature, you're going to have a higher volume. So we expect that to continue to grow. And as I mentioned earlier, what we're working with is airline scheduling. So we're working on trying to understand when events are coming in, which gives us extreme visibility into future quarters and future years as far as engines and module matches. So if you're very good about as the business grows, we're going to get more and more visibility long term on backlog. The second question as far as margin right, again, we expect margins to continue to increase inherently, as the business grows. The reason for that is the same dynamic, is that the manufacturer is going to be increasing pricing year-over-year. So inherently that is the pricing umbrella that we operate under. And then the second piece is we're focused on driving costs down every year or every quarter more and more. So we're rolling in new repairs. We're thinking about creative ways to use assets to drive further value. So our entire business is focused on driving costs down, And that's why we feel very good about our margin expansion.\nJoseph Adams: But when you think about the difference between our business and an MRO business, one of the big differences is that we own the engine. And we own and work on our own engines. We don't do work on other people's engines. So the typical traditional MRO model is to get a customer to put their engine in your shop and then you mark up labor and parts and supply that engine back to them and you know in many cases you might expand the work scope so you get a little bit more money, but that's a very different business. What we've done is said, we don't want to do any third-party business. We only want to work on our own engines. We want to streamline that. We want to have the single work scope, we want to be able to run it like a manufacturing operation, as efficiently as possible and high volume. So it's a different construct and as I've said many times, the key difference is that it is our engine. We own it. We build it, we put it on the shelf, airline comes in and our pitch is like, do you want it or not? Don't tell me what work scope you want to do or how you want to rearrange it. It's there, it's available, they're very fungible, so it's your call.\nBrandon Oglenski: Appreciate the response, both of you. And then I guess on the capital side, maybe this one for Angela, but where do you see funding needs for the business now that you guys did, some transactions here in the third quarter. And I think you have some offshore assets as well in the leasing business. Can you maybe give an outlook for them?\nJoseph Adams: So on the offshore, we're very close on the sale of those, both those vessels, which it's not 100% done, so I don't want to jinx it, but I would be very surprised if it didn't close in the fourth quarter. And you know, it's on target with, you know, previous guidance we've given about the dollar amount. So we expect that to be concluded this year. And then on other capital needs, Angela can go to that.\nAngela Nam: Yeah. On other capital needs, one of the redemptions that are coming up is on our Series B preferred, which reset to our floating rate on December 15th. So that's something that we'll be looking to redeem similarly as we did for our Series A this quarter. So besides that and continuing to finish our plan on the V2500 engine purchases through the end of the year, we don't have any other purchases that we need capital for yet.\nJoseph Adams: And our next maturity is until 2028.\nAngela Nam: That's right.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. Lou on for Myles. Joe, can you give us an idea of the average green time on the engines you've been buying, and if it's the same as the last couple of years? Is there also any difference between the CFM56 and the V2500?\nJoseph Adams: David will answer that.\nDavid Moreno: Sure. So the way that we invest in engines is we're looking at value on cost per cycle basis. So I'd say the composition of engines that we acquire today are a little different than they were two years ago. Right now we're focused on acquiring assets that need shop visits, so assets that are completely run out that we can add value, and then we can offer them for exchange or for lease. So we're really targeting value add activity on the engine side. As you can imagine, green time is more expensive today than it was, let's say, two years ago. So that's really the focus. The V2500 is also a very tight engine as well. So same strategy at the moment is we're buying run out engines to refurbish those engines and offer them for programs. So that's really the focus at the moment.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right, great. Thank you. And maybe just to follow up on that and earlier question on the V2500, you mentioned sort of the MRE and everything going on there. I'm just curious, are you guys doing the work there sort of through the MRE, sort of the original MRE, or is it really all being done by Pratt at this point with the relationship there?\nJoseph Adams: Yeah, so the way I divide the responsibilities up is three things. First is acquiring the run-out engine, second is doing the performance restoration, and then third is taking it to market for sale, lease, or exchange. We do number 1 and 3, and under the Pratt program, Pratt manages number 2, and they put all new parts, rebuild the engine to a full 20, 000 cycles. There's certain other upgrades of thrust and potential from pre-select to select one that are available. In that Pratt contract, there are things they could do that no one else could do that we saw a lot of value in. At this point, number 2 is managed by Pratt. We have had discussions with Pratt about potentially having Montreal, FTAI Canada become a V2500 shop, but we don't have a conclusion on that. We would like to ultimately have that capability in Montreal, but that's something we haven't finalized the discussion on yet.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right, great. Thank you. Just one quick follow-up. I guess PMA was originally $15 million to $20 million in this year. Not sure if that's still included or sort of been pushed. Just a way to think about that for 2025 at this point?\nJoseph Adams: We're probably going to come up short on that this year, given that it's, you know, we don't have approvals yet. So I would say that we might have missed on that one.\nUnidentified Analyst: And nothing on 2025 yet, I guess, to think about?\nJoseph Adams: We've not given real guidance on 2025 at this point, so that's something, you know, we'll consider early next year.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Thank you very much.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Steven Trent from Citi. Your line is open.\nStephen Trent: Good morning, and thanks very much for taking my questions. Just some quick ones for you. Could you sort of give us an update where you are with respect to insurance settlements as some of your competitors seem to be moving ahead in the court. So we'd just love to hear how that's going. Thank you.\nJoseph Adams: Yes, so I divided into three different lawsuits if you use the word. The first one, we have an agreed deal with the counterparty. That's the smallest one. It's probably about 10 to 11 million, which we think, you know, will close here shortly. The second 1 is a umbrella contingent policy, and we've had some, I would say, some overtures of discussing potential settlements on that one. And then the third one is the all-risk policies that are being run through on the London court cases, which will probably be the last to settle. But there are individual insurers that are discussing early settlements And it typically starts to happen around the time when you get in front of the courthouse and you're facing potentially a bad outcome so that the insurers start to realize they've run out the clock as far as they can and now it's time to move on. So we do see that coming and how much of that we'll get in 2025 is not hard -- it's hard to forecast at this point, but I do expect ultimately total recoveries in the neighborhood of about 150 million, which is all net income to us since we have written all of that off. So I think we'll ultimately get there and it's starting to move in that direction.\nStephen Trent: Okay, that's really helpful, appreciated. And one more kind of quick one for you. I mean, over the last year and change, your stock has done so well. And have you given any thought to entertaining the idea of a stock split? And I know the retail shareholder might not be your number one priority, but just thinking about high level, how you may reach out to these other elements of the market that may balk at today's price per share. Thank you.\nJoseph Adams: Yeah, I've had one or two people recently bring that up and it's something I hadn't really looked at for a while, and so I've asked people for any data they might have to support whether that's something that increases and enhances value and if we can sort of get something that convinces us that it's a good idea, we'll consider it. But so far, what I've seen didn't seem very conclusive, but I'm open. Anytime anyone wants to present something which says they can make our stock go up, I'm open to talking about it.\nStephen Trent: Very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Andre Madrid from BTIG. Your line is open.\nAndre Madrid: Hey, everyone. Good morning, and thanks for the time. Earlier you spoke about the rising demand for field services. Could you maybe explain the margin differential there, if any between field and non-field? And is there any read on how much of the broader mix this could become, the AP mix?\nDavid Moreno: Sure. This is David. I can take that question. So the way to think about field service is it's an additional distribution channel to move velocity on modules. I would think about it less as a margin play, although the margin is quite good because it's just labor in this scenario. But typically a field service event is about $50,000 to $70,000. So they're small dollars. But what it does do is it enhances the entire module experience, right, where you can line up the module, you can line up the team, and you can go execute that immediately, which really, you know, helps airlines that are in a pinch and able to bring back an aircraft really back into service very quickly. So, I would think about it more as an instrument to increase velocity of modules versus let's say an individual margin play.\nAndre Madrid: Got it. And then I know you outlined previously about $60 million to $80 million in maintenance CapEx moving forward, but where exactly is this being deployed and what are the priorities there?\nJoseph Adams: That's a number that we would invest, that we invest to keep our engines in our leasing portfolio in service. So when an engine needs a performance restoration or shop is in our leasing portfolio, that's what we spend annually to keep those engines flying.\nAndre Madrid: Got it. Got it. And one more if I could squeeze in. I mean, I know we were talking about the V2500 PMA part from Chromalloy that got approved and the read through from that, but I feel like we kind of danced around it, didn't really necessarily attack the conversation of when you guys are expecting. I know it said through end of 2024, but could you give any color there if it's sooner as opposed to later?\nJoseph Adams: I love the use of the word attack. Sounds ferocious. We don't give guidance on expectations of when parts will be approved. We've only said that We're very pleased with the progress that's been made, and we are happy with the product itself, but we don't specifically forecast when approvals will be obtained.\nAndre Madrid: Got it, got it. Had to give a shot, but thank you, appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Alan Andreini for any closing remarks.\nAlan Andreini : Thank you, Crystal. And thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "David Moreno",
            "content": "Hey Sheila, this is David. I'll take that question. So this quarter was our record quarter for new customers. We onboarded 19 new customers. Typically a new customer places an order between one to two modules. And as you can imagine, the first sale is usually the toughest sale with a new customer because once you kind of go through the process, they understand that the time saving, cost savings, and As Joe mentioned, it is a very sticky product. At the same time, we also are starting to see strong repeat customers come in and request about five to 10 modules at a time. That's typically what a repeat customer will do. And what actually happens in practice is they open up and they provide a full schedule of shop visits for the next five years. Our product, demand on that product is event driven, meaning we want to know the shop visits, we want to match the modules with the shop visits, And once they convert to a repeat customer, we kind of have those discussions of understanding the fleet, the fleet plans, and how to maximize their cost savings and timing. An additional thing that we've done also is we're getting a lot of demand for field service. So what we've been doing in the past is we've been distributing modules on field with a lot of third-party field service team. We're getting customers who want us to do everything the full white glove service. So at quick turn, which is now FTAI USA we built a field service team that now is being deployed worldwide to actually do the installation and to offer the complete service. So we're very excited about offering that service and we think that's going to improve the overall experience even further and try further repeat business. Thanks. Thank you, Jason. I can take this. This is David. So on the MRE, we're very excited with the progress so far on the V2500. On the production side, as we mentioned, the engines are in the shop. We're experiencing turnaround times that are on target, so 90 days to 120 days. And those engines now have provided a strong pipeline that are 100% committed to customers. So those engines are coming out of shop. The LATAM program has now officially started. So we've started exchanging engines today. Additionally, we've secured two large North American airlines on MRE for about 20 plus engines in the next few years. So that's, we're very excited about that and further growing that business. Those should be strong contributors starting next quarter or Q4 2024 and more even in 2025. I think we're seeing tremendous opportunity worldwide in many different regions. So we're hoping to expand into Asia sometime very soon on a new deal as well. No. We've stopped providing that level of detail. We think it's, you know, commercially not, you know, a great idea. And so we think we give enough information without that. Hey Ken, this is David. I'll take that question. So we're seeing many similar opportunities of that size, let's say 20 to 30 airplanes. And Again, the real thesis around is not that the airline wants to raise capital through a sale lease back, is they don't want to do maintenance. So that's really the thesis. So we're actively working those programs. And we expect to have some advancement probably this quarter, Q4 of this year. Hey Brandon, this is David. I can take that question. So as far as backlog, the way that we think about that is that's heavily correlated with the repeat customers. Today, on average, about 66% of our volume is on repeat customers. And the more that you engage customers by nature, you're going to have a higher volume. So we expect that to continue to grow. And as I mentioned earlier, what we're working with is airline scheduling. So we're working on trying to understand when events are coming in, which gives us extreme visibility into future quarters and future years as far as engines and module matches. So if you're very good about as the business grows, we're going to get more and more visibility long term on backlog. The second question as far as margin right, again, we expect margins to continue to increase inherently, as the business grows. The reason for that is the same dynamic, is that the manufacturer is going to be increasing pricing year-over-year. So inherently that is the pricing umbrella that we operate under.

            "name": "Joseph Adams",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 38th dividend as a public company and our 53rd consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on November 25th based on a shareholder record date of November 14th. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metric for us is adjusted EBITDA. We continued our strong performance with adjusted EBITDA of $232 million in Q3 2024, which is up 8% compared to $213.9 million in Q2 of this year and up 50% compared to $154.2 million in Q3 of 2023. During the third quarter, the $232.0 million EBITDA number was comprised of $136.4 million from our leasing segment, $101.8 million from our aerospace product segment, and negative $6.2 million from corporate and other. Turning now to leasing, leasing at another great quarter posting approximately $136 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of that number came in at $122 million for Q3 versus $112 million in Q2 of 2024 and $102 million in Q3 2023. Additionally, we sold $20.7 million book value of assets for a gain of $14.3 million and have more sales coming in the final quarter of this year. With continuing high-demand for assets, we remain confident in generating $500 million in leasing EBITDA in 2024, including $50 million in gains on asset sales. Aerospace Products had yet another excellent quarter with $101.8 million EBITDA and an overall EBITDA margin of 34%, which is up 12% compared to $91.2 million in Q2 of this year and up 135% compared to $43.3 million in Q3 2023. We're seeing tremendous growth in adoption and usage of our aerospace products and are increasing our 2024 estimated EBITDA to $360 million to $375 million up from our previous estimate of $325 million to $350 million. Overall, we now expect annual aviation EBITDA for 2024 to be between $860 million to $875 million, not including corporate and other, up from $825 million to $850 million that we guided to last quarter. With that, let me turn the call back over to Alan. Sure, great. You know, we think about that all the time also. We are happy that we're in an environment, you know, that's so supportive of our business model. And we think it really enhances or it increases the rate at which we can convert customers to adopting a new way of doing things. And so, as we have worked with many airlines and we're increasing every quarter the number of new customers, we have seen no evidence that once people use our products or change the way they think about engine maintenance, which is letting us do it instead of them doing it, we've seen no evidence of anybody wanting to go back to the old way of doing it once the situation normalizes. And the reason is we're providing a tangible cost savings and time savings benefit to the customers. And it's not like they would three years from now wake up and say, let's go back to the old way of spending more money on engine maintenance. So we don't see any evidence that people will revert. And so this quarter we'll have the highest number of new customers that will convert to using our products. And David will talk more about that. And so we see the universe expanding as word of mouth spreads and more customers tell other people, hey, this is great, you should try it. But more often now today, the question we get is not the original question we got, was -- is this a good product and can I save money? It's if I go with you, how can I be sure that you'll be able to supply me the engines I need? And that's where we hear more now from the customer, which is a great development. It's like, I get it. I buy that you have a great product now, can you make sure that I will always have engines available? And so to that end, the acquisition we made of the Montreal facility, which we now call FTAI Canada, really plays nicely into that because if you look back at 2023, for example, we were producing about 30 modules per quarter during that period. We increased that in the first half of 2024 to about 50 modules per quarter. Since we took ownership in the third quarter, we've now increased that production rate to about 75 modules per quarter. And we expect in 2025 that we will be up to about 100 modules per quarter at that facility. And we're well on our way to doing that. So we obviously invite customers to go visit, come see what we do. We've changed a lot of the things that a typical MR would do, and we've made it much more of a manufacturing production line. We've specialized employees. We've ordered a lot of parts, so we're not at the risk of any supply chain disruptions. So we can take people through the facility and say, this is where your engines are going to come from. And we've got a lot of them and we have a lot of activity. And so that's a point of resistance we love to be able to try to sell through because you've got people almost on the finish-line. And so we believe very strongly that the conversion makes sense for people. We believe that it's a very sticky once you do get people converted. And then the only question left is how long do you think people will fly CFM56 engines? And we've obviously made a bet that we think it's a long time, but anybody can have a view on that. But we think that that's the easiest of the points to get comfortable with. Good morning. Well, I would take it as a positive. When you think about the most complex part of the entire engine, it's the high pressure turbine blades. And the fact that that got approved and is evidence that the FAA is confident. They have an extremely rigorous process, as we all know, and it's been a great \u2013 has a great track record of success in the US, and the worldwide. And getting that approved is a great sign for future parts, including the CFM56 parts that we're working on. So I take it as a great step and the process is working and as it did before COVID and it's working now post-COVID. Well, we're a Lessor. I can't speak for everyone else. But I think it's, look, we use data when we make decisions, and our data is --. We have evidence that many of the parts are, you know, are performed extremely well and they cost less. So, you know, we kind of just think about that when we make decisions about what we do. Thanks. Liz, are you there? It seems the operator lost connection, So we're waiting for reconnection. Sorry about that. Liz? Liz, are you there? Sorry, can you continue Q&A, please? Yes. Yes. This is the first quarter that we incorporated FTAI Canada in the numbers, and there are some legacy contracts for third-parties that we inherited when we acquired the company. And that had a negative effect because there are low or no margin contracts that are running-off. And so if you adjust for that, that would have normalized the margin at 200 to 300 basis points higher than the number we reported. And those contracts have a very short life. So we expect there'll be some impact in Q4, and then we'll be finished with that -- by the end of the year. So it's, it was just an impact from the acquisition that we had to assume those obligations, but they're running off. Yes, it is, you know, we're gaining on our productivity for the CFM56 by taking employees who are doing other things at the facility that we need them to do and repurpose or giving them CFM56 oriented jobs. So we're able to increase the productivity that I mentioned, the 30 to 50, 75 to 100 with essentially the same workforce. So you're tripling, more or less tripling the productivity with a very similar head count. So it's -- as I mentioned earlier, it was a massively underutilized facility from our point of view and we're able to take the highest return anywhere in the company that we could get is focusing on increasing the productivity there, which we're doing and it's well underway even though we're only a month into it. Yes. Thanks. Yeah, I mean it is more organic growth. As we've said, we're focusing on the two largest engine markets in the world. Virtually every airline in the world operates a V2500 or a CFM56 engine, and we're still under 5% market share. So our focus is organic growth, And as I mentioned, as an example, with using the facility at FTAI Canada, we're able to triple the productivity with the same number of people. So the organic growth opportunity for us is right in front of us and it's extraordinary. And so we're not really focusing on anything other than that. Thanks. Yes, and you probably noticed our, you know, working capital number increased from, you know, by roughly about $120 million from Q2 to Q3. And there's two reasons for that. One is we picked up about $50 million of inventory with the FTAI Canada acquisition. But secondly, we are purchasing a lot of parts to be able to enable our ramp up in productivity. As I mentioned, the 30 to 50 to 75 to 100, the best way to avoid supply chain disruptions is to pre-order and have a lot of inventory. And so there might be other ways, but that is the route we've chosen. We think it has a very high return on capital. You know, customers are very focused on the question, as I mentioned earlier, is we get the most often is can you actually get me the engines that I need and how can I be sure of that? And so we're buying more parts as an insurance policy effectively and we think it's low cost insurance and high payoff. So that's part of the thought process and I think we're well prepared going into 2025 to be able to really execute the best we can. But when you think about the difference between our business and an MRO business, one of the big differences is that we own the engine. And we own and work on our own engines. We don't do work on other people's engines. So the typical traditional MRO model is to get a customer to put their engine in your shop and then you mark up labor and parts and supply that engine back to them and you know in many cases you might expand the work scope so you get a little bit more money, but that's a very different business. What we've done is said, we don't want to do any third-party business. We only want to work on our own engines. We want to streamline that. We want to have the single work scope, we want to be able to run it like a manufacturing operation, as efficiently as possible and high volume. So it's a different construct and as I've said many times, the key difference is that it is our engine. We own it. We build it, we put it on the shelf, airline comes in and our pitch is like, do you want it or not? Don't tell me what work scope you want to do or how you want to rearrange it. It's there, it's available, they're very fungible, so it's your call. So on the offshore, we're very close on the sale of those, both those vessels, which it's not 100% done, so I don't want to jinx it, but I would be very surprised if it didn't close in the fourth quarter. And you know, it's on target with, you know, previous guidance we've given about the dollar amount. So we expect that to be concluded this year. And then on other capital needs, Angela can go to that. And our next maturity is until 2028. David will answer that. Yeah, so the way I divide the responsibilities up is three things. First is acquiring the run-out engine, second is doing the performance restoration, and then third is taking it to market for sale, lease, or exchange. We do number 1 and 3, and under the Pratt program, Pratt manages number 2, and they put all new parts, rebuild the engine to a full 20, 000 cycles. There's certain other upgrades of thrust and potential from pre-select to select one that are available. In that Pratt contract, there are things they could do that no one else could do that we saw a lot of value in. At this point, number 2 is managed by Pratt. We have had discussions with Pratt about potentially having Montreal, FTAI Canada become a V2500 shop, but we don't have a conclusion on that. We would like to ultimately have that capability in Montreal, but that's something we haven't finalized the discussion on yet. We're probably going to come up short on that this year, given that it's, you know, we don't have approvals yet. So I would say that we might have missed on that one. We've not given real guidance on 2025 at this point, so that's something, you know, we'll consider early next year. Thanks. Yes, so I divided into three different lawsuits if you use the word. The first one, we have an agreed deal with the counterparty. That's the smallest one. It's probably about 10 to 11 million, which we think, you know, will close here shortly. The second 1 is a umbrella contingent policy, and we've had some, I would say, some overtures of discussing potential settlements on that one. And then the third one is the all-risk policies that are being run through on the London court cases, which will probably be the last to settle. But there are individual insurers that are discussing early settlements And it typically starts to happen around the time when you get in front of the courthouse and you're facing potentially a bad outcome so that the insurers start to realize they've run out the clock as far as they can and now it's time to move on. So we do see that coming and how much of that we'll get in 2025 is not hard -- it's hard to forecast at this point, but I do expect ultimately total recoveries in the neighborhood of about 150 million, which is all net income to us since we have written all of that off. So I think we'll ultimately get there and it's starting to move in that direction. Yeah, I've had one or two people recently bring that up and it's something I hadn't really looked at for a while, and so I've asked people for any data they might have to support whether that's something that increases and enhances value and if we can sort of get something that convinces us that it's a good idea, we'll consider it. But so far, what I've seen didn't seem very conclusive, but I'm open. Anytime anyone wants to present something which says they can make our stock go up, I'm open to talking about it. That's a number that we would invest, that we invest to keep our engines in our leasing portfolio in service. So when an engine needs a performance restoration or shop is in our leasing portfolio, that's what we spend annually to keep those engines flying. I love the use of the word attack. Sounds ferocious. We don't give guidance on expectations of when parts will be approved. We've only said that We're very pleased with the progress that's been made, and we are happy with the product itself, but we don't specifically forecast when approvals will be obtained."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would like now to turn your conference over to Alan Andreini, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Michelle. I would like to welcome you all to the FTAI Aviation second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer; Angela Nam, our Chief Financial Officer; and David Moreno, our Chief Operating Officer. We have posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you have not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in listen-only mode and is being webcast. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including EBITDA. The reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement. Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements, by their nature, are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our quarterly report filed with the SEC. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 37th dividend as a public company and our 52nd consecutive dividend since inception. Dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on August 20 based on a shareholder record date of August 12. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metric for us is adjusted EBITDA. We continued the year strongly with adjusted EBITDA of $213.9 million in Q2 2024, which is up 30% compared to $164.1 million in Q1 of this year, and up 40% compared to $153.1 million in Q2 of 2023. During the second quarter, the $213.9 million EBITDA number was comprised of $125 million from our Leasing Segment, $91.2 million from our Aerospace Products segment and negative $2.3 million from Corporate and Other. Turning now to leasing. Leasing had a great quarter, posting approximately $125 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of the $125 million came in at $112 million for Q1, for Q2 versus $98 million in Q1 of 2024. Additionally, we sold $59 million book value of assets for a gain of $13.5 million. With exceptionally strong demand for assets and the continuation of a robust Northern Hemisphere summer travel season, we now expect to generate $500 million in EBITDA in 2024, which includes $50 million in gains on asset sales versus our prior estimate of $475 million. Aerospace Products had yet another excellent quarter with $91.2 million of EBITDA at an overall EBITDA margin of 37%. We're seeing tremendous growth in the aerospace products business in general and feel good about raising our estimates for 2024 EBITDA in Aerospace Products from our prior estimate of $250 million, up to $325 million to $350 million. We also are experiencing expansion in Aerospace Products margins as demand for refurbished modules and engines remains very high, while increasing efficiencies at our two CFM56 maintenance facilities in Montreal and Miami is controlling or, in some cases, lowering our costs. Overall, looking ahead, we now expect annual aviation EBITDA for 2024 to be between $825 million to $850 million, not counting corporate and other versus our original estimate of $675 million to $725 million. And finally, about two years ago, we first outlined our corporate financial goal of generating in 2026, $1 billion of EBITDA, comprised of $500 million from Leasing and $500 million from Aerospace Products. So now that we're halfway through this time period and ahead of plan, we're resetting the target. Our new goal is $1.25 billion of EBITDA in 2026 comprised of $550 million of Leasing EBITDA and $700 million of Aerospace Products EBITDA. With that, I'll turn the call back to Alan.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Joe. Michelle, you may now open the call to Q&A. Hello?\nOperator: The first question comes from Jason Holcomb with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJason Holcomb: Good morning, Joe, Angela and David.\nJoseph Adams: Good morning.\nAngela Nam: Good morning.\nJason Holcomb: Within Aerospace Products, you've historically mentioned that you target EBITDA margin of around 35%. The last couple of quarters, we've seen you surpass that target. It would be great if you could talk about where you see margins going from here, as you continue to grow and develop the business. Also, it would be great, if you could speak to how that margin path may differ between both the CFM56 and the V2500 engines. Thank you.\nJoseph Adams: Great. Thanks for the question. Yes. We are -- as I mentioned in the remarks, we are seeing margins trending up, and it's fairly basic. It's -- our revenues are going up and our expenses are either flat or down. And so, the revenue side is really demand based where, as you can realize, the equipment is in short supply. Turn times at maintenance shops are getting longer. So that means it puts a premium on having a pre-built engine or module available. So we can actually get higher -- slightly higher prices and still generate significant savings for the customers. At the same time, by controlling costs through our own facilities, we do that with controlling the labor cost and that we have more specialization in the facilities. We're basically running on engine and we're teaching people to do it in a high volume manner. So it's a learning curve process where you get better and better at it is you do it more and more frequently, so that's part of it. And we're also getting smarter about used serviceable material, forecasting the demand. Where is it going to be needed, when are we going to need it, getting our repairs done in advance. So we're using -- we're smarter and more efficient about using used materials. So it's really on both sides of the equation, revenue is up, expenses down that we see growing margins. We will also see increased savings when we close on Lockheed Martin. And so we do see the margins trending towards 40%, and we think that, that will continue to grow as we get better and more experience with that facility as well, and we generate more volume. So a pretty positive outlook for today and also for the near future for the coming years. I would say on your other question on Pratt versus CFM, we have said that the Pratt & Whitney V2500 deal will not be dilutive to margins, and I would continue to say that. We're seeing very good demand for those engines, extremely high. And we're also seeing good turnaround times on getting engines through the shop. So we continue to expect that, that will be the same or as good as or better than the CFM side.\nJason Holcomb: Thank you for that, Joe. I\u2019ll leave it at one.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKyle Wenclawiak: Hi, team. This is Kyle Wenclawiak on for Sheila.\nJoseph Adams: Hello.\nKyle Wenclawiak: Hi, guys. Very nice quarter here and first half really in Aero Products. It's not just the EBITDA growth, but the margins like you said, kind of, trending towards 40% is now kind of the watermark. So maybe just drilling in on your comments, Joe, about the Lockheed facility. How are you thinking about the margin opportunity within that facility as that deal is going to close in the second half and kind of what it means for the productivity, the throughput and the piece part opportunity there for the modules?\nJoseph Adams: Yeah. So good question. I think that we've indicated we expect about $30 million of savings per annum once we close on initially on just on the CFM56 overhaul operations, so that should add 3 percentage points to 4 percentage points to the margins just from that closing. Then, I think the efficiency, we haven't really baked that in yet, but we did see quite an improvement when we took control of the Miami facility. We've seen a pretty significant increase in throughput per person. So we expect a similar trend in that facility, although, we don't yet have our hands on it. So it's something we think we'll be able to accomplish and we don't see any reason because we've done it before. And then lastly, incremental to that is the piece part repair business, which we've talked about for quite some time, and there's a lot of capability in the Lockheed Martin facility that was not really fully developed. So we are going to accelerate the development of the piece part business, we do more repairs for our own engines, repairs for third-parties and then, we'll develop new repairs. And so that I've indicated, we expect to generate probably an incremental $10 million to $15 million of EBITDA from that over, but not really starting until probably 2025 and then potentially growing from there, we'll update you on that. But we see this -- every time we look at the engine and we look at something new, we find millions of dollars lying on the floor. So it's -- there's so many opportunities that we can pursue that are big dollars. So we're very optimistic that we're going to -- we'll keep. This is continuous improvement as what we've always said over the last five, six years. And we\u2019re nowhere near the end of our list of opportunities.\nKyle Wenclawiak: Great. Super helpful. I\u2019ll leave it at one. Thanks, guys.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nJoshua Sullivan: Hey, good morning. Congratulations on the quarter here. What is the relative turnaround time for an airline or lease or using the module factory versus the open market at this point?\nDavid Moreno: Yeah. I can take that. This is David. So the typical industry turn time what we're seeing is anything from 120 days to 180 days. Our turn time on modules is about 30 to 60 days to do module -- to actually build a module, right? And then to actually execute that module depends on the module is anywhere from 5 to 25 days. So from a customer's perspective, they're doing the module swap in 5 to 25 days versus 120 to 180 days. And again, we're seeing industry turn times that are long and getting longer. And I think we're in a much better position predominantly for four reasons, right? Number one is we have capacity up in Montreal and in Miami. So we have the capacity and the workforce. Number two is we have access to use service material via our AAR program. Number three is what Joe mentioned is we have access to repairs at Lockheed, where we can repair parts. And number four, we have the flexibility since it's our fleet of mixing, matching modules as well as planning. So as we see turn times go down industry wide, I think it is accelerating more and more demand for modules because one of the key attributes of modules is a faster product than a traditional MRO.\nJoshua Sullivan: Got it. And then just as a follow-up on the piece part repair business expansion. Is that an organic effort or do you see opportunities to bolt-on inorganically at Montreal?\nJoseph Adams: Both. I think that our base case is organic, but we have a lot of conversations that we've been engaging with different parties in that business for the last two years looking at different alternatives. And there might be some combination of the two, which is organic plus working with another player in the industry. So we are always open-minded and flexible and over whatever the math and the operations would support, we'll take a look at it. there's not enough capacity in the piece part repair business globally. And we realized that last year, I think we spent $50 million on -- with third parties where we we\u2019re a pretty big buyer of care services and no one had ever called on us and marketed as a product to us. It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s -- the industry is -- it\u2019s all order takers. So there\u2019s a lot of things that we think we can do to grow and increase that business that are \u2013 we\u2019re just at the very, very beginning of that.\nJoshua Sullivan: Great. Thank you for the time.\nJoseph Adams: Yeah.\nOperator: One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Hillary Cacanando with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nHillary Cacanando: Thank you. Good morning. You had previously mentioned that savings this year from internalization would be about $30 million. So given that you're raising guidance, does that number change? And could you now expect more savings from internalization for 2024 and how should we think about that number for 2025 and beyond?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. It will go up as we've increased our expectations of -- for this year and for the out year 2026. So we had indicated at the time of the internalization that we would save $30 million annually, which we think we'll do at least that this year, and that number will grow to $40 million or $50 million in the next couple of years and potentially higher than that. So it's a -- I mean we're very confident that the numbers that we'll save are better than what we had thought -- what we expected a couple of months ago.\nHillary Cacanando: Okay. So then we should probably assume for modeling purposes is probably assume like $30 million this year and then maybe like $40 million to $50 million next year and then maybe even higher in 2026, had of upward trending in terms of savings?\nJoseph Adams: Yes.\nHillary Cacanando: Okay. Perfect. And then in Slide number 8 in the Leasing segment, it says that you performed 10 engine exchanges for aircraft leases year-to-date. I think this is the first time you discuss engine exchanges with, your lessee (ph). Could you just over exactly what that is? And if those 10 engine exchanges are included in the 82 module sold number and all these engine exchanges with lessees one-offs or do you have contracts with them to do more?\nJoseph Adams: I'll let David walk through that.\nDavid Moreno: Hey, Hillary. So the answer is, in addition to the 82. So on our entire aircraft portfolio, we manage the shop is it via exchanges. So we're manufacturing engines ahead of removals and providing exchanges instead of lessees doing shop visits, which is typically how these contracts are written, so it's a value add. The reason why we like it is because we're able to charge OEM rates per the contract for every hour in cycle flown. And then we're able to manufacture those entrants for a lot less. So that margin is going to show up through the maintenance revenue on our financial statements. The reason why airlines like it is because they're able to avoid the major shop visits, so they don't -- they have zero turn time. typically, they'd have to lease an engine during that interim period, which can be very expensive as well as they are responsible for the most part, on all negative surprises. So if the shop is it overruns, typically, the airline would be in charge of that over and above. So they really like that service, and it's a value add as part of our aircraft leasing business.\nHillary Cacanando: Okay. Well, thank you so much, David. Thank you, Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Yes. It goes to the -- when we talk about our business model is basically we are in the engine maintenance business. Most lessors are in the maintenance avoidance business, and they force it on to the airline, and we're the opposite. So we want to do the maintenance, and we want the airlines to get out of the maintenance business because we're better at it. So it's really the -- we're providing an outsourced opportunity for airlines to not have to manage shop visits, which for the most part, most airlines are not particularly good at.\nHillary Cacanando: And I'm sure when you're talking to potential like potential lessees, this is something that you pitch as well, right? Like, if we continue to do exchanges as well and that's probably a selling point, assuming, sir?\nJoseph Adams: Yeah. We\u2019re saving them time and money and eliminating a major possible negative surprise in the lease.\nHillary Cacanando: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Giuliano Bologna with Compass Point. Your line is open.\nGiuliano Bologna: Good morning. Congratulations on another incredible quarter, especially on the product side of the business. As the first question, I'd be curious, looking at the leasing side of the business, you outperformed pretty strongly, especially on even on core leasing. I'm curious what drove the leasing outperformance and that's a trend that we should expect to continue going forward.\nJoseph Adams: Yeah. The two big drivers are rents and hours slowing. And so both of those are up. It's very -- the rent market is you probably obviously aware with the demand for equipment, particularly older equipment that we own is quite high airlines around the world or extending leases and not giving those back given that they can't get -- they can't fly a lot of GTF-powered engine aircraft, and they can't get deliveries from Boeing on time. So the old -- the demand for older equipment and engines related to those is very high. And then typically, the second quarter and really the third quarter are very high utilization quarters for airlines because the demand is there for flying. So we see it in the maintenance revenues as well. So it's both rent and maintenance reserves are up.\nGiuliano Bologna: That's very helpful. And then thinking about the storage engines globally and a lot of the supply chain issues that are out there, there are a few industry leaders that have suggested that the industry will take a normalized -- or won't normalize until somewhere between late 2026 and 2030. I'm curious how you think about what that means for the opportunity for FTAI and also what normalization would mean or look like on the side of that? I realize it's pretty far out, so a pretty good run-rate here.\nJoseph Adams: Yeah. So we've always thought to run our business assuming normalization. This is just an unexpected gift that we got. So we think we have a great business even in an environment where everything is smooth and running and functionally well. Having said that, the -- it is difficult to project, but I also would point out that it's not going to be a cliff. You're not going to wake up in 2027 and all of a sudden, everything is good. So it will be a gradual return to normalization over some extended period of time because as you see, fixing supply chains, hiring people back is a very lengthy process, and it only takes one part of that supply chain to negatively affect the entire supply chain. So I think it will be probably what everybody -- generally, the extremes are not right. It's somewhere in the middle. Somebody says 2030, something said 2026, it's probably in the middle, but it's -- it's a gradual return to normal, not all of a sudden a bright line event.\nGiuliano Bologna: That's very helpful. And then one last one. Thinking about the product segment and kind of the demand for CFM56 and V2500. I'm curious what the pipeline or the order backlog looks like in the third quarter and fourth quarter relative to the second quarter, and how we should think about what that pipeline is already indicated or telling us?\nJoseph Adams: So we're getting -- I mean, we have some long-term contracts like if you talk about WestJet and LATAM or Avianca, where we have six to eight year deals locked in. So we have very good visibility on that type of business. The other more transactional is probably we have three to six month visibility. We\u2019re getting people to give us forecast of when they\u2019re going to need equipment earlier so that we can \u2013 as David said, we can order a material, we can plan better. We can have the modules ready. So I would say it\u2019s \u2013 our visibility is getting longer than it even a year ago, and we\u2019re encouraging airlines to really be \u2013 once they\u2019ve tasted and experience the product and they like it. And they say, \u201cWell, okay, now give us all your business and give us your program and give us your profile when you\u2019re going to need it. So I think we\u2019re going to continue to push for more programs, more visibility, longer time to get ready and everybody benefits from that.\nGiuliano Bologna: That\u2019s very helpful. All right. I appreciate it. Congrats on the quarter and I\u2019ll jump back in the queue.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC. Your line is open.\nKenneth Herbert: Yeah. Hey, Joe. Good morning.\nJoseph Adams: Good morning.\nKenneth Herbert: I just wanted to ask you, you did 82 modular swaps this quarter. What percentage of the global sort of CFM56 operator universe are you currently working with and how quickly is that expanding and what sort of the time frame as you think about an airline today with everything going on that may not have been a customer that comes to you and ultimately becomes a customer? Sort of how is that sales cycle compressing?\nJoseph Adams: Lots of aspects of that question. But just if you start off and you -- we indicated that we have now 50 customers in our module factory. And if you think back in 2022, when we sort of rolled out our math for getting to $1 billion, we were forecasting $50 million by 2026. So we're now at 50% in 2024. So things are moving quickly. And part of what happens in a crisis is when people need something, then they're more receptive to changing their business model. And so we see that the current environment is accelerating people's transitioning to outsourcing maintenance, engine maintenance, which is what we're offering the customer. Those 50 represent what we would say, 300 total potential. So maybe we're 1/6 of the operator base, and we're not getting -- with a couple of exceptions, we're not getting 100% of people's business yet. But we're aspiring to because we don't see any reason why we shouldn't once people realize they save money, they save time and they eliminate negative surprises. It's like how hard -- what else do you need to tell you. So I think it's still growing. It's a huge market. The total universe, if you think about 3,000 shop visits a year and you can argue whether it's 4,000 or 2,500 or something, but roughly 3,000, that's 9,000 modules moving through a maintenance facility somewhere in the world per year. And we're talking about doing 400, 500, it's still less than 10%. It's half of 10%. So we're not anywhere near where we think the penetration could get to. And we have our own maintenance capacity, we can do 300 shop visits in Montreal a year, which is 900 modules. And 150 in Miami, which is 450 modules. So we have 1,350 module rebuild capacity that we own now. So if you think about 400, 500 is what we're shooting for that's 5% market penetration, we can handle 15% today based on what we own and we're in a pretty good position to keep growing that. We haven't had anybody that use the product that didn't want to do it again. So that, to me, is one of the main litmus (ph) test is that people like it and they have a good experience, and that's what we're trying to foster so the word-of-mouth spreads, people put testimonials up in their Instagram accounts and they talk about how great this is we have photos of people and maintenance facilities, like I say, I just did an LPT swap in two weeks, and that engine would have been in the shop for 6 months if I hadn't done that. So those are the kind of things where the viral marketing that we're using to accelerate even more. So I might have missed -- there are a lot of elements to your question, but I don't know if I got all of them, but...\nKenneth Herbert: No, that's great. If I could just one follow-up. I mean obviously, you're benefiting from the supply chain disruptions and turnaround times and lead times on material, but you obviously also buy a lot of material to fulfill demand while we're waiting for PMA parts and other stuff. Are you seeing an extension in the material you're looking to buy, the new OEM material or even on the USM side and has that been maybe a headwind to some of throughput?\nJoseph Adams: I mean there's two parts. There's the CFM part and in the Pratt part. Talking about the CFM, I'll talk about Pratt.\nDavid Moreno: Sure. So on the CFM side, yes, we are seeing a delay for, let's say, repairing parts. I think we're well positioned because we have the inventory ahead of time, right? So we are carrying down 40 to 50 engines per year with AR. We're able to recall those parts and use them ahead of time. So really, it's having the USM available and then number two is planning, right? So before module comes in the shop, we understand and we have a kitting process ahead of time. So we produce the kit what exactly is needed in that module. So we're able to be one step ahead in that process, right? Typically, what would happen is that you're engaging in third-party work, an engine would show up and you'd have a very limited amount of time to react in order parts, right? So that's all happening ahead of time. So we feel like we're well positioned, and that's why our turn times have not been impacted.\nJoseph Adams: And on the V2500, I mean we just -- we spent time with Pratt last week, and we're talking about material availability and turn times, and they're very confident. I mean, earlier this year, they had some sort of delays in producing some of the V2500 parts of material, but they're on top of it now. They're very confident, and we are, I would say, a high priority customer. So with an order of 100 shop visits we get -- they're going to put us at the top of the list. So they're very confident that the -- what they've indicated as the 90-day turn times that they're going to deliver on that. It's also it's helpful from our point of view that we're very flexible, and they can put those engines into whatever shop in their network they want to. And that they indicated was very helpful because they can use our orders to fill in shops and don't have enough [Technical Difficulty]\nKenneth Herbert: Great. Thank you very much.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my question. Joe, I appreciate the updated guidance for this year and longer-term outlook on the business. I guess though, with how tight the market is, I mean, I know you're generating better margins now, but when we think of acquisition costs, especially for new engines, does this get more challenging looking ahead or is it the swap aspect that makes this so viable?\nJoseph Adams: Yeah. That's a great question. We've been pretty good at sourcing engines. And I think the main reason is we tend to excel when an engine is in need of a shop visit in the immediate or near future. So if you think about most buyers when a portfolio or an aircraft comes up, and they do their model, and they have to do a shop visit in the next 18, six months to 24 months, it's a huge negative to them. So we're one of the few buyers that actually when we see a shop visit in the near future, we're like, this is great. we'd love this because we know we're going to, A, we can do the shop visit generally for less than other people can and, B, we can also optimize by doing module swaps. We can sometimes do hospital shop repairs, we can generate more -- we can burn off some of the green time that other people can't value. So we have so many ways to make that into a better deal than virtually anybody else that we win a disproportionate now of that business. And there's a lot of engines out there that during COVID, people didn't do any maintenance on. So we're seeing a lot of -- a very good pipeline of acquisition opportunities. And that is one of our core strengths is sourcing run-out engines. So that's the first part of our business model, which is to buy run out engines, then we fix them up and then we lease them, sell them or exchange them. And we love the exchange option too because then you're getting another engine back that's run out generally at a very good price because you're solving some of these problems and you also then get to do it all over again. So it's a virtuous circle for us in sourcing.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. I appreciate that, Joe. And then I guess, as you transition more earnings in the business mix to aviation products, how should investors think about free cash flow in the business? And maybe longer-term, where do you want to see leverage on the balance sheet too? Thanks, Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Yeah. So the second question, we just did an $800 million high-yield deal, and we indicated that our goal is to be strong BB by all agencies and have debt to total EBITDA in the 3 to 3.5 times range. And this quarter, we\u2019re at the bonds have traded up. I think we\u2019re trading pretty much like a strong BB at the moment. And that\u2019s something we think is achievable this year in the near future. So we\u2019re going to maintain that leverage and that rating. In terms of free cash flow, what we do is we take the EBITDA, subtract corporate and interest, and then we use a number for maintenance CapEx, what we would use \u2013 what we need to invest each year to maintain the engines so that they can fly forever at infinitum. And that number tends to be between $60 million and $80 million a year of maintenance CapEx. So when you get \u2013 when you run the math, will generate hundreds of millions of free cash flow in the near future. And that\u2019s \u2013 then our goal since as you remember back from 2022, when we set those targets is not to be in a perpetual cycle of always buying more equipment, but just turning it faster and generating a lot of cash.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thanks for that. Appreciate it.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Stephen Trent with Citi. Your line is now open.\nStephen Trent: Good morning, everybody and thanks very much for taking my question. The first, I recall you had commented about your global footprint and opportunities you sought to expand, for example. And I believe you previously called out Southeast Asia geographically. And I was wondering, since that time, what sort of elements you've seen in the market that might be reinforcing your view on that being an attractive footprint. Thank you.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nDavid Moreno: Hi, Stephen. I can take that question. This is David. So yes, Southeast Asia is a very important region for us. It has a high concentration of 737NG and A320s typically, that fleet has been newer. And now with time, it's maturing and the engines are shop visit. So it's an area that we're keenly focused on. Recently, we started working with an airline by doing all module swaps at their hangar facility. So they have a hanger where they do air framework and light engine work as well. So we started doing module swaps on LPTs, so we have a large program with that airline. And then we've also then recently started offering that as a third-party business. So now we have airlines coming in with aircraft that have engines that need module swaps we are performing those module swaps for those -- for that airline and the aircraft is going back in the air in 15 to 20 days. So it's operating like a pitstop. So we started with a few third-party customers, and we're very excited to grow that presence in Southeast Asia.\nStephen Trent: I appreciate that, David. Very helpful. And just as a follow-up on the M&A side. You guys seem to be really putting together a potent story on MRE and I know you've done your own acquisitions like quick turn and what have you. Long term, would you ever consider a larger competitor acquiring you?\nJoseph Adams: Well, that's -- I mean it's up to the shareholders. We're always -- we're very shareholder oriented. So we all own a lot of stock. And if the right offer came in and somebody was interested, we would certainly entertain it. That's also -- that's a board-level call, not just an individual so.\nStephen Trent: Fair enough and I appreciate that Joseph. Thank you for the time.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Brian McKenna with Citizens JMP. Your line is open.\nBrian Mckenna: All right. Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Most questions have been asked. But it would be great just to get an update on capital management. I'm assuming returns on new investments today are quite high. So I suspect your top priority for capital is investing back into the business for longer-term growth. But can you just walk through your capital priorities today as it relates to new investments, further deleveraging strategic M&A and then dividends and buybacks?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So, we -- first priority is to achieve and maintain the strong BB rating, which I mentioned, and maintain debt at 3 to 3.5 times debt to total EBITDA. So that we're on course. We're in that zone in Q2, and we expect by the end of the year to be solidly in that. So that's priority number one. Priority number two, as you mentioned, is investments. We do have a good pipeline of acquisitions. We also are turning that by selling modules and engines quicker. So our goal is not to have a huge increase in net assets owned this year. Having said that, at the beginning of the year, we did indicate with the V2500 program, we expected to increase our engine count from roughly 6TV 2500 at the beginning of this year to about 150 to 200 by the end of this year. We're well on our way. We're at 130 now. And so we expect to achieve that. And that if you think of an average engine being 5 million or so, adding 100 engines adds about $500 million of capital. So that's been a focus this year is to have the V2500. But once we achieve, having 400 to 500 CFM56 engines and 150 to 200 V2500s, we don't need to grow that number significantly. So after that, it then becomes a question for shareholder returns and dividends and stock buybacks would be the third priority.\nBrian Mckenna: Okay. Great. Helpful. And then just one more follow-up for you, Joe. Just given how much the business has grown over the past couple of years, how are you splitting your time between managing the two segments? And then somewhat related, is there an opportunity to lean in on hiring here just given the broader macro environment to further accelerate growth in some of the emerging opportunities within the aerospace products.\nJoseph Adams: Well, I spend 100% of my time on FTAI, whatever is needed. So I don't think of it as like splitting. I've said to people, my dream is that one day, people will not do a sum of the parts calculation. And think of this as we do as an integrated product. We go to the airlines and we say, look, we can provide you your engine maintenance without you having to do it. You outsource it to us, and we'll always have an engine for you. And we'll save you time and money and provide you a lot of flexibility and that's our pitch. And so what we do is we go buy runout engines, we rebuild them, and then we can offer either a lease, a sale or an exchange to an airline. And so the leasing is just one spoke, one arm of what we offer, but it's an important one because having that ability gives the airline the flexibility to say, well, what, I only want three years, I think is what I'm going to need, and somebody else wants six years. And so you have the ability to customize and say whatever you want, will deliver that for you. And that integrated product is extremely powerful. So we don\u2019t think of it as two different businesses. We report it that way, but someday, we\u2019ll \u2013 hopefully, people will stop doing some of the parts and they\u2019ll say this is just a \u2013 this is a great product. This is an outsourced engine maintenance business for aftermarket for the most popular engines in the world.\nBrian Mckenna: Yeah. Got it. Makes sense. I\u2019ll leave it there and congrats on another great quarter.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for the next question. The next question comes from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. And Joe, I was wondering if you could maybe decompose the $700 million of EBITDA in '26. The $500 million previously, I think, had $50 million of PMA third-party parts and a couple of hundred million of better drop through in the module business. Is the PMA contribution at $700 million, about the same and the remainder's better business elsewhere plus the V2500?\nJoseph Adams: Yes. So there are similar TMA USM, each about $50 million and then we've added probably between 100 and 150 for the V2500 program. And then the rest is just higher margins and more volume on CFM modules.\nMyles Walton: Is that higher margin volume on CFM required that PMA because that was sort of the selling point to get to that higher margin or is the market now so robust that you don't need the PMA for that drop through?\nJoseph Adams: We're going to get it. So I don't think of it as the PMA will come, and that will increase the margins. I think we're going to increase margins even without PMA, but definitely, we're planning on PMA and PMA increasing margins.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And there's been a lot of news about airlines and clearly, yields are working against them, and they're running more into cost questions about containment. Are you finding that this business that you have has more durability in a market where airlines are cost cutting. Where are your weak points where your strengths if we go into that cash conservation mode that sometimes cyclically happens with airlines.\nJoseph Adams: Yeah. It does help us. And we\u2019re providing, as I said, cost savings. So when everybody is told to look at every line item in the P&L, One of the line items that always pops up as engine maintenance as a big one and one that they seem to never be able to get it to go down. So we can provide a flattening out of that in savings. And so when people do have an intense focus on cost savings and outsourcing of these types of activities is \u2013 goes up, the demand for that goes up. So we\u2019re happy in any environment, but particularly when people are focusing on \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re providing is expense management reduction.\nMyles Walton: Okay. All right. Great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. The next question comes from Sherif Elmaghrabi with BTIG. Your line is open.\nSherif Elmaghrabi: Hey, good morning. I want to start with an update on PMA. How is industry acceptance going for your first part? And can you talk through what the second PMA part does within the engine and timing for approval there, please?\nJoseph Adams: Yeah. The timing we've said is shortly. We -- obviously, we're closer today than we were last quarter. We've done many -- we don't forecast specific timing, but very good progress made on all fronts on that. So we're very confident. The first part, we have installed in 15 engines. It's been flying with another airline and no issues, very -- it's a high quality product as always with Cromwell (ph) and we think the industry acceptance is going to grow. There is a school of thought on -- for many airlines that if they're going to put PMA, they want more than one part. So there are airlines that will wait until there's more cards approved. And once those are available, then we expect the industry take up to be quite robust. It's also -- there's an additional element today in supply chain availability in that it's not just cost savings for PMA is availability, which is also important that you have another alternative if you can't get in a timely manner, the OEM parts. That's good color.\nSherif Elmaghrabi: And then on the corporate side, both of the well intervention vessels are now on charter, and it looks like the rate that their earning has melted up nicely. So how are you progressing on the sale of these vessels? And are there any recent transactions you can point you to give us a sense of how they're valued?\nJoseph Adams: Yeah. So you\u2019re right. The market is improving nicely, we have a handshake deal on both vessels today. which we expect to close by the end of the year, subject to a couple of conditions that we think will be met, but the market has strengthened and we expect for the next few years, it\u2019s going to be a strong market. So the vessels are both on charter are doing well, generating EBITDA and the values have gone up. We originally said we thought we would get approximately $150 million, and we\u2019re in that ZIP code. So we\u2019re very happy with that the end of that chapter is close.\nSherif Elmaghrabi: Thanks for taking my questions, Joe.\nJoseph Adams: Thanks.\nOperator: I show no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Alan Andreini for closing remarks.\nAlan Andreini: Thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q3.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Moreno",
            "content": "Yeah. I can take that. This is David. So the typical industry turn time what we're seeing is anything from 120 days to 180 days. Our turn time on modules is about 30 to 60 days to do module -- to actually build a module, right? And then to actually execute that module depends on the module is anywhere from 5 to 25 days. So from a customer's perspective, they're doing the module swap in 5 to 25 days versus 120 to 180 days. And again, we're seeing industry turn times that are long and getting longer. And I think we're in a much better position predominantly for four reasons, right? Number one is we have capacity up in Montreal and in Miami. So we have the capacity and the workforce. Number two is we have access to use service material via our AAR program. Number three is what Joe mentioned is we have access to repairs at Lockheed, where we can repair parts. And number four, we have the flexibility since it's our fleet of mixing, matching modules as well as planning. So as we see turn times go down industry wide, I think it is accelerating more and more demand for modules because one of the key attributes of modules is a faster product than a traditional MRO. Hey, Hillary. So the answer is, in addition to the 82. So on our entire aircraft portfolio, we manage the shop is it via exchanges. So we're manufacturing engines ahead of removals and providing exchanges instead of lessees doing shop visits, which is typically how these contracts are written, so it's a value add. The reason why we like it is because we're able to charge OEM rates per the contract for every hour in cycle flown. And then we're able to manufacture those entrants for a lot less. So that margin is going to show up through the maintenance revenue on our financial statements. The reason why airlines like it is because they're able to avoid the major shop visits, so they don't -- they have zero turn time. typically, they'd have to lease an engine during that interim period, which can be very expensive as well as they are responsible for the most part, on all negative surprises. So if the shop is it overruns, typically, the airline would be in charge of that over and above. So they really like that service, and it's a value add as part of our aircraft leasing business. Sure. So on the CFM side, yes, we are seeing a delay for, let's say, repairing parts. I think we're well positioned because we have the inventory ahead of time, right? So we are carrying down 40 to 50 engines per year with AR. We're able to recall those parts and use them ahead of time. So really, it's having the USM available and then number two is planning, right? So before module comes in the shop, we understand and we have a kitting process ahead of time. So we produce the kit what exactly is needed in that module. So we're able to be one step ahead in that process, right? Typically, what would happen is that you're engaging in third-party work, an engine would show up and you'd have a very limited amount of time to react in order parts, right? So that's all happening ahead of time. So we feel like we're well positioned, and that's why our turn times have not been impacted. Hi, Stephen. I can take that question. This is David. So yes, Southeast Asia is a very important region for us. It has a high concentration of 737NG and A320s typically, that fleet has been newer. And now with time, it's maturing and the engines are shop visit. So it's an area that we're keenly focused on. Recently, we started working with an airline by doing all module swaps at their hangar facility. So they have a hanger where they do air framework and light engine work as well. So we started doing module swaps on LPTs, so we have a large program with that airline. And then we've also then recently started offering that as a third-party business. So now we have airlines coming in with aircraft that have engines that need module swaps we are performing those module swaps for those -- for that airline and the aircraft is going back in the air in 15 to 20 days. So it's operating like a pitstop. So we started with a few third-party customers, and we're very excited to grow that presence in Southeast Asia."

            "name": "Joseph Adams",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 37th dividend as a public company and our 52nd consecutive dividend since inception. Dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on August 20 based on a shareholder record date of August 12. Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metric for us is adjusted EBITDA. We continued the year strongly with adjusted EBITDA of $213.9 million in Q2 2024, which is up 30% compared to $164.1 million in Q1 of this year, and up 40% compared to $153.1 million in Q2 of 2023. During the second quarter, the $213.9 million EBITDA number was comprised of $125 million from our Leasing Segment, $91.2 million from our Aerospace Products segment and negative $2.3 million from Corporate and Other. Turning now to leasing. Leasing had a great quarter, posting approximately $125 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of the $125 million came in at $112 million for Q1, for Q2 versus $98 million in Q1 of 2024. Additionally, we sold $59 million book value of assets for a gain of $13.5 million. With exceptionally strong demand for assets and the continuation of a robust Northern Hemisphere summer travel season, we now expect to generate $500 million in EBITDA in 2024, which includes $50 million in gains on asset sales versus our prior estimate of $475 million. Aerospace Products had yet another excellent quarter with $91.2 million of EBITDA at an overall EBITDA margin of 37%. We're seeing tremendous growth in the aerospace products business in general and feel good about raising our estimates for 2024 EBITDA in Aerospace Products from our prior estimate of $250 million, up to $325 million to $350 million. We also are experiencing expansion in Aerospace Products margins as demand for refurbished modules and engines remains very high, while increasing efficiencies at our two CFM56 maintenance facilities in Montreal and Miami is controlling or, in some cases, lowering our costs. Overall, looking ahead, we now expect annual aviation EBITDA for 2024 to be between $825 million to $850 million, not counting corporate and other versus our original estimate of $675 million to $725 million. And finally, about two years ago, we first outlined our corporate financial goal of generating in 2026, $1 billion of EBITDA, comprised of $500 million from Leasing and $500 million from Aerospace Products. So now that we're halfway through this time period and ahead of plan, we're resetting the target. Our new goal is $1.25 billion of EBITDA in 2026 comprised of $550 million of Leasing EBITDA and $700 million of Aerospace Products EBITDA. With that, I'll turn the call back to Alan. Good morning. Great. Thanks for the question. Yes. We are -- as I mentioned in the remarks, we are seeing margins trending up, and it's fairly basic. It's -- our revenues are going up and our expenses are either flat or down. And so, the revenue side is really demand based where, as you can realize, the equipment is in short supply. Turn times at maintenance shops are getting longer. So that means it puts a premium on having a pre-built engine or module available. So we can actually get higher -- slightly higher prices and still generate significant savings for the customers. At the same time, by controlling costs through our own facilities, we do that with controlling the labor cost and that we have more specialization in the facilities. We're basically running on engine and we're teaching people to do it in a high volume manner. So it's a learning curve process where you get better and better at it is you do it more and more frequently, so that's part of it. And we're also getting smarter about used serviceable material, forecasting the demand. Where is it going to be needed, when are we going to need it, getting our repairs done in advance. So we're using -- we're smarter and more efficient about using used materials. So it's really on both sides of the equation, revenue is up, expenses down that we see growing margins. We will also see increased savings when we close on Lockheed Martin. And so we do see the margins trending towards 40%, and we think that, that will continue to grow as we get better and more experience with that facility as well, and we generate more volume. So a pretty positive outlook for today and also for the near future for the coming years. I would say on your other question on Pratt versus CFM, we have said that the Pratt & Whitney V2500 deal will not be dilutive to margins, and I would continue to say that. We're seeing very good demand for those engines, extremely high. And we're also seeing good turnaround times on getting engines through the shop. So we continue to expect that, that will be the same or as good as or better than the CFM side. Thanks. Hello. Yeah. So good question. I think that we've indicated we expect about $30 million of savings per annum once we close on initially on just on the CFM56 overhaul operations, so that should add 3 percentage points to 4 percentage points to the margins just from that closing. Then, I think the efficiency, we haven't really baked that in yet, but we did see quite an improvement when we took control of the Miami facility. We've seen a pretty significant increase in throughput per person. So we expect a similar trend in that facility, although, we don't yet have our hands on it. So it's something we think we'll be able to accomplish and we don't see any reason because we've done it before. And then lastly, incremental to that is the piece part repair business, which we've talked about for quite some time, and there's a lot of capability in the Lockheed Martin facility that was not really fully developed. So we are going to accelerate the development of the piece part business, we do more repairs for our own engines, repairs for third-parties and then, we'll develop new repairs. And so that I've indicated, we expect to generate probably an incremental $10 million to $15 million of EBITDA from that over, but not really starting until probably 2025 and then potentially growing from there, we'll update you on that. But we see this -- every time we look at the engine and we look at something new, we find millions of dollars lying on the floor. So it's -- there's so many opportunities that we can pursue that are big dollars. So we're very optimistic that we're going to -- we'll keep. This is continuous improvement as what we've always said over the last five, six years. And we're nowhere near the end of our list of opportunities. Thanks. Both. I think that our base case is organic, but we have a lot of conversations that we've been engaging with different parties in that business for the last two years looking at different alternatives. And there might be some combination of the two, which is organic plus working with another player in the industry. So we are always open-minded and flexible and over whatever the math and the operations would support, we'll take a look at it. there's not enough capacity in the piece part repair business globally. And we realized that last year, I think we spent $50 million on -- with third parties where we we're a pretty big buyer of care services and no one had ever called on us and marketed as a product to us. It's amazing. It's -- the industry is -- it's all order takers. So there's a lot of things that we think we can do to grow and increase that business that are \u2013 we're just at the very, very beginning of that. Yeah. Yes. It will go up as we've increased our expectations of -- for this year and for the out year 2026. So we had indicated at the time of the internalization that we would save $30 million annually, which we think we'll do at least that this year, and that number will grow to $40 million or $50 million in the next couple of years and potentially higher than that. So it's a -- I mean we're very confident that the numbers that we'll save are better than what we had thought -- what we expected a couple of months ago. Yes. I'll let David walk through that. Yes. It goes to the -- when we talk about our business model is basically we are in the engine maintenance business. Most lessors are in the maintenance avoidance business, and they force it on to the airline, and we're the opposite. So we want to do the maintenance, and we want the airlines to get out of the maintenance business because we're better at it. So it's really the -- we're providing an outsourced opportunity for airlines to not have to manage shop visits, which for the most part, most airlines are not particularly good at. Yeah. We're saving them time and money and eliminating a major possible negative surprise in the lease. Thanks. Yeah. The two big drivers are rents and hours slowing. And so both of those are up. It's very -- the rent market is you probably obviously aware with the demand for equipment, particularly older equipment that we own is quite high airlines around the world or extending leases and not giving those back given that they can't get -- they can't fly a lot of GTF-powered engine aircraft, and they can't get deliveries from Boeing on time. So the old -- the demand for older equipment and engines related to those is very high. And then typically, the second quarter and really the third quarter are very high utilization quarters for airlines because the demand is there for flying. So we see it in the maintenance revenues as well. So it's both rent and maintenance reserves are up. Yeah. So we've always thought to run our business assuming normalization. This is just an unexpected gift that we got. So we think we have a great business even in an environment where everything is smooth and running and functionally well. Having said that, the -- it is difficult to project, but I also would point out that it's not going to be a cliff. You're not going to wake up in 2027 and all of a sudden, everything is good. So it will be a gradual return to normalization over some extended period of time because as you see, fixing supply chains, hiring people back is a very lengthy process, and it only takes one part of that supply chain to negatively affect the entire supply chain. So I think it will be probably what everybody -- generally, the extremes are not right. It's somewhere in the middle. Somebody says 2030, something said 2026, it's probably in the middle, but it's -- it's a gradual return to normal, not all of a sudden a bright line event. So we're getting -- I mean, we have some long-term contracts like if you talk about WestJet and LATAM or Avianca, where we have six to eight year deals locked in. So we have very good visibility on that type of business. The other more transactional is probably we have three to six month visibility. We're getting people to give us forecast of when they're going to need equipment earlier so that we can \u2013 as David said, we can order a material, we can plan better. We can have the modules ready. So I would say it's \u2013 our visibility is getting longer than it even a year ago, and we're encouraging airlines to really be \u2013 once they've tasted and experience the product and they like it. And they say, \u201cWell, okay, now give us all your business and give us your program and give us your profile when you're going to need it. So I think we're going to continue to push for more programs, more visibility, longer time to get ready and everybody benefits from that. Thanks. Good morning. Lots of aspects of that question. But just if you start off and you -- we indicated that we have now 50 customers in our module factory. And if you think back in 2022, when we sort of rolled out our math for getting to $1 billion, we were forecasting $50 million by 2026. So we're now at 50% in 2024. So things are moving quickly. And part of what happens in a crisis is when people need something, then they're more receptive to changing their business model. And so we see that the current environment is accelerating people's transitioning to outsourcing maintenance, engine maintenance, which is what we're offering the customer. Those 50 represent what we would say, 300 total potential. So maybe we're 1/6 of the operator base, and we're not getting -- with a couple of exceptions, we're not getting 100% of people's business yet. But we're aspiring to because we don't see any reason why we shouldn't once people realize they save money, they save time and they eliminate negative surprises. It's like how hard -- what else do you need to tell you. So I think it's still growing. It's a huge market. The total universe, if you think about 3,000 shop visits a year and you can argue whether it's 4,000 or 2,500 or something, but roughly 3,000, that's 9,000 modules moving through a maintenance facility somewhere in the world per year. And we're talking about doing 400, 500, it's still less than 10%. It's half of 10%. So we're not anywhere near where we think the penetration could get to. And we have our own maintenance capacity, we can do 300 shop visits in Montreal a year, which is 900 modules. And 150 in Miami, which is 450 modules. So we have 1,350 module rebuild capacity that we own now. So if you think about 400, 500 is what we're shooting for that's 5% market penetration, we can handle 15% today based on what we own and we're in a pretty good position to keep growing that. We haven't had anybody that use the product that didn't want to do it again. So that, to me, is one of the main litmus (ph) test is that people like it and they have a good experience, and that's what we're trying to foster so the word-of-mouth spreads, people put testimonials up in their Instagram accounts and they talk about how great this is we have photos of people and maintenance facilities, like I say, I just did an LPT swap in two weeks, and that engine would have been in the shop for 6 months if I hadn't done that. So those are the kind of things where the viral marketing that we're using to accelerate even more. So I might have missed -- there are a lot of elements to your question, but I don't know if I got all of them, but... I mean there's two parts. There's the CFM part and in the Pratt part. Talking about the CFM, I'll talk about Pratt. And on the V2500, I mean we just -- we spent time with Pratt last week, and we're talking about material availability and turn times, and they're very confident. I mean, earlier this year, they had some sort of delays in producing some of the V2500 parts of material, but they're on top of it now. They're very confident, and we are, I would say, a high priority customer. So with an order of 100 shop visits we get -- they're going to put us at the top of the list. So they're very confident that the -- what they've indicated as the 90-day turn times that they're going to deliver on that. It's also it's helpful from our point of view that we're very flexible, and they can put those engines into whatever shop in their network they want to. And that they indicated was very helpful because they can use our orders to fill in shops and don't have enough [Technical Difficulty] Thanks. Yeah. That's a great question. We've been pretty good at sourcing engines. And I think the main reason is we tend to excel when an engine is in need of a shop visit in the immediate or near future. So if you think about most buyers when a portfolio or an aircraft comes up, and they do their model, and they have to do a shop visit in the next 18, six months to 24 months, it's a huge negative to them. So we're one of the few buyers that actually when we see a shop visit in the near future, we're like, this is great. we'd love this because we know we're going to, A, we can do the shop visit generally for less than other people can and, B, we can also optimize by doing module swaps. We can sometimes do hospital shop repairs, we can generate more -- we can burn off some of the green time that other people can't value. So we have so many ways to make that into a better deal than virtually anybody else that we win a disproportionate now of that business. And there's a lot of engines out there that during COVID, people didn't do any maintenance on. So we're seeing a lot of -- a very good pipeline of acquisition opportunities. And that is one of our core strengths is sourcing run-out engines. So that's the first part of our business model, which is to buy run out engines, then we fix them up and then we lease them, sell them or exchange them. And we love the exchange option too because then you're getting another engine back that's run out generally at a very good price because you're solving some of these problems and you also then get to do it all over again. So it's a virtuous circle for us in sourcing. Yeah. So the second question, we just did an $800 million high-yield deal, and we indicated that our goal is to be strong BB by all agencies and have debt to total EBITDA in the 3 to 3.5 times range. And this quarter, we're at the bonds have traded up. I think we're trading pretty much like a strong BB at the moment. And that's something we think is achievable this year in the near future. So we're going to maintain that leverage and that rating. In terms of free cash flow, what we do is we take the EBITDA, subtract corporate and interest, and then we use a number for maintenance CapEx, what we would use \u2013 what we need to invest each year to maintain the engines so that they can fly forever at infinitum. And that number tends to be between $60 million and $80 million a year of maintenance CapEx. So when you get \u2013 when you run the math, will generate hundreds of millions of free cash flow in the near future. And that's \u2013 then our goal since as you remember back from 2022, when we set those targets is not to be in a perpetual cycle of always buying more equipment, but just turning it faster and generating a lot of cash. Thanks. Thanks. Well, that's -- I mean it's up to the shareholders. We're always -- we're very shareholder oriented. So we all own a lot of stock. And if the right offer came in and somebody was interested, we would certainly entertain it. That's also -- that's a board-level call, not just an individual so. Thanks. Yes. So, we -- first priority is to achieve and maintain the strong BB rating, which I mentioned, and maintain debt at 3 to 3.5 times debt to total EBITDA. So that we're on course. We're in that zone in Q2, and we expect by the end of the year to be solidly in that. So that's priority number one. Priority number two, as you mentioned, is investments. We do have a good pipeline of acquisitions. We also are turning that by selling modules and engines quicker. So our goal is not to have a huge increase in net assets owned this year. Having said that, at the beginning of the year, we did indicate with the V2500 program, we expected to increase our engine count from roughly 6TV 2500 at the beginning of this year to about 150 to 200 by the end of this year. We're well on our way. We're at 130 now. And so we expect to achieve that. And that if you think of an average engine being 5 million or so, adding 100 engines adds about $500 million of capital. So that's been a focus this year is to have the V2500. But once we achieve, having 400 to 500 CFM56 engines and 150 to 200 V2500s, we don't need to grow that number significantly. So after that, it then becomes a question for shareholder returns and dividends and stock buybacks would be the third priority. Well, I spend 100% of my time on FTAI, whatever is needed. So I don't think of it as like splitting. I've said to people, my dream is that one day, people will not do a sum of the parts calculation. And think of this as we do as an integrated product. We go to the airlines and we say, look, we can provide you your engine maintenance without you having to do it. You outsource it to us, and we'll always have an engine for you. And we'll save you time and money and provide you a lot of flexibility and that's our pitch. And so what we do is we go buy runout engines, we rebuild them, and then we can offer either a lease, a sale or an exchange to an airline. And so the leasing is just one spoke, one arm of what we offer, but it's an important one because having that ability gives the airline the flexibility to say, well, what, I only want three years, I think is what I'm going to need, and somebody else wants six years. And so you have the ability to customize and say whatever you want, will deliver that for you. And that integrated product is extremely powerful. So we don't think of it as two different businesses. We report it that way, but someday, we'll \u2013 hopefully, people will stop doing some of the parts and they'll say this is just a \u2013 this is a great product. This is an outsourced engine maintenance business for aftermarket for the most popular engines in the world. Thanks. Yes. So there are similar TMA USM, each about $50 million and then we've added probably between 100 and 150 for the V2500 program. And then the rest is just higher margins and more volume on CFM modules. We're going to get it. So I don't think of it as the PMA will come, and that will increase the margins. I think we're going to increase margins even without PMA, but definitely, we're planning on PMA and PMA increasing margins. Yeah. It does help us. And we're providing, as I said, cost savings. So when everybody is told to look at every line item in the P&L, One of the line items that always pops up as engine maintenance as a big one and one that they seem to never be able to get it to go down. So we can provide a flattening out of that in savings. And so when people do have an intense focus on cost savings and outsourcing of these types of activities is \u2013 goes up, the demand for that goes up. So we're happy in any environment, but particularly when people are focusing on \u2013 that's what we're providing is expense management reduction. Thanks. Yeah. The timing we've said is shortly. We -- obviously, we're closer today than we were last quarter. We've done many -- we don't forecast specific timing, but very good progress made on all fronts on that. So we're very confident. The first part, we have installed in 15 engines. It's been flying with another airline and no issues, very -- it's a high quality product as always with Cromwell (ph) and we think the industry acceptance is going to grow. There is a school of thought on -- for many airlines that if they're going to put PMA, they want more than one part. So there are airlines that will wait until there's more cards approved. And once those are available, then we expect the industry take up to be quite robust. It's also -- there's an additional element today in supply chain availability in that it's not just cost savings for PMA is availability, which is also important that you have another alternative if you can't get in a timely manner, the OEM parts. That's good color. Yeah. So you're right. The market is improving nicely, we have a handshake deal on both vessels today. which we expect to close by the end of the year, subject to a couple of conditions that we think will be met, but the market has strengthened and we expect for the next few years, it's going to be a strong market. So the vessels are both on charter are doing well, generating EBITDA and the values have gone up. We originally said we thought we would get approximately $150 million, and we're in that ZIP code. So we're very happy with that the end of that chapter is close. Thanks."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the FTAI Aviation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\n I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Alan Andreini, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Shannon. I would like to welcome you all to the FTAI Aviation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me here today are Joe Adams, our Chief Executive Officer; Angela Nam, our Chief Financial Officer; and David Moreno, our Chief Operating Officer. We have posted an investor presentation and our press release on our website, which we encourage you to download if you have not already done so. Also, please note that this call is open to the public in a listen-only mode and is being webcast.\n In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, including EBITDA. The reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings supplement.\n Before I turn the call over to Joe, I would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking statements, including regarding future earnings. These statements by their nature are uncertain and may differ materially from actual results. We encourage you to review the disclaimers in our press release and investor presentation regarding non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements and to review the risk factors contained in our quarterly report filed with the SEC. \n Now I would like to turn the call over to Joe. \nJoseph Adams: Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 36th dividend as a public company and our 51st consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on May 21 based on a shareholder record date of May 10.\n Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metric for us is adjusted EBITDA. We began the year strongly with adjusted EBITDA of $164.1 million in Q1 2024, which is up 1% compared to $162.3 million in Q4 2023 and up 29% compared to $127.7 million in Q1 of 2023. During the first quarter, the $164.1 million EBITDA number was comprised of $104.8 million from our Leasing segment, $70.3 million from our Aerospace Products segment and negative 11% from Corporate & Other. \n Turning now to Leasing. Leasing had another good quarter, posting approximately $105 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of the $105 million came in at $98 million for Q1 versus $99 million of Q4 of last year. With exceptionally strong demand for assets and the commencement of the Northern Hemisphere summer season, we expect meaningful growth in Q2. We remain very confident in Leasing EBITDA of $425 million for the year, excluding gains on asset sales.\n Part of the $105 million in EBITDA for Leasing came from gains on asset sales. We sold $31.9 million book value of assets for a gain of $6.7 million, slightly below our expectations, but we have more assets sales coming in Q2 and the rest of the year and are comfortable assuming gains on asset sales of approximately $12.5 million per quarter or $50 million for all of 2024.\n Aerospace Products had yet another excellent quarter with $70.3 million of EBITDA at an overall EBITDA margin of 37%. We sold 72 CFM56 modules in Q1 to 16 unique customers. Additionally, we sold 6 V2500 engines in Q1 to 3 customers through our recently launched V2500 engine program. We continue to see the tremendous potential in Aerospace products and are comfortable that we will generate approximately $250 million of EBITDA in 2024, the high end of our previous range.\n Our maintain, repair and exchange, or MRE, model for the 2 most widely used engines in commercial aviation produces cost savings and operational flexibility for airlines and aircraft lessors, by allowing them to avoid shop visits through engine or module exchanges. Our recently executed perpetual power agreement with LATAM covering over 60 V2500 and CFM56 engines illustrates the growing acceptance of airlines and lessors to outsource this activity to FTAI Aviation.\n Overall, looking ahead, we continue to expect our annual aviation EBITDA for 2024 to be approximately $725 million, not including Corporate & Other.\n With that, I'll turn the call back to Alan. \nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Joe. Shannon, you may now open the call to Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. \nKristine Liwag: Yesterday, you announced the successful execution of a perpetual power agreement with LATAM Airlines. Can you provide more color on what this agreement entails? How meaningful is this contract? \nDavid Moreno: Kristine, this is David. So to provide additional color on LATAM, the deal itself is predominantly a V2500 maintenance, repair and exchange contract. It does have a smaller component related to the sale leaseback, but what we're doing is we're building engines ahead of a shop visit, and we're providing engine exchanges that are avoiding shop visits for LATAM and offering flexibility. As far as EBITDA and how that's going to show up, we're going to be recognizing V2500 MRE contribution as soon as engines are exchanged. There's going to be a ramp-up period. So as we exchange more engines, there's going to be a ramp-up on Aerospace EBITDA. We're expecting ramp-up to take about 2 to 3 years as well as there's a smaller contribution on the leasing side that's going to commence as soon as we close those airplanes. \nKristine Liwag: I see. And then when you said the ramp-up over 2 to 3 years, you said over 30 aircraft would be part of this agreement. Can you parse out the timing of when that could occur? And also regarding the EBITDA contribution of this deal, what are the economics? \nJoseph Adams: Well, we're not giving a specific number on that yet. I think the -- it's a bit of a function of how many engine exchanges occur and how quickly they occur, and we don't have certainty on that yet. But we do expect that it will ramp up such that we have -- it will be a needle mover in years 2, 3, 4, 5 for our Aerospace Products business. So that's really all we're saying at the moment at this point. It's going to take a little bit of time for that to kick in. But then once it does, it's a needle mover and it's very stable. \nKristine Liwag: If I could do one more follow-up on this. With the V25 MRE that you announced earlier this year, how should we think about the LATAM contract as a proxy for economics for additional V25 MRE. Should this be what we look at for additional V2500 contracts? Is this a good starting point? Is this better? Any sort of context would be helpful. \nJoseph Adams: It's a great starting point. And we would love to do more of these. And we hope we will. We have several projects that are of a similar nature. Each airline, obviously, has their own requirements and their own specs. So they'll all be a little bit different, but we hope this model is used by other airlines. And we -- in discussions with the big operators of V2500s, we've gotten very positive feedback on this. So we expect to do more, and we hope to do more. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Louis Raffetto with Wolfe Research. \nLouis Raffetto: Joe, on the last -- or maybe October earnings call, you said you thought maybe 200 module swaps, not a precise number but ballpark for '24, but doing 72 in the first quarter. Any thoughts on that now? And then sort of rolling into that, obviously, you've got module swaps, you've got the MRE and the V2500, where you just said you're kind of doing these shop visits ahead of time. How should we think about capacity limitations at this point? \nJoseph Adams: So on the first point, I think we -- my recollection is we indicated between 250 and 300 module swaps or exchange sales for this year for 2024 and so we're obviously on a great path given the first quarter of that, and we have a pretty strong backlog. So we feel very good about that number. We have built our plan around being able to deliver that. So we have ample capacity at our 2 maintenance facilities that we use, the Montreal facility and the Miami facility. So we've got adequate capacity to do that. Obviously, we're working to increase capacity and ramp up because we want to stay ahead of this, and we do see substantial upside in the years ahead. So we're building additional capacity, but we have in place what we need to deliver this year. \nLouis Raffetto: Okay. Great. And then -- I'm sorry, go forward, Joe. \nJoseph Adams: What was the second question? Or did I... \nLouis Raffetto: No. You covered both of them. Sorry, I was just going to ask a quick one. Angela, just any commentary around how to think about cash flow in the quarter and rest of the year? \nEun Nam: Sure. So our cash flows for this quarter, as you can see, our operating cash flows were about neutral, but that's because part of our proceeds from sales is sitting and investing. We believe for the rest of the year, our cash flow from operations will improve significantly. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan with The Benchmark Company. \nJoshua Sullivan: Just -- with the addition of the V2500 here, can you just help us understand some of the relative savings maybe versus the GE56 for an airline. I want to say in the past, you've talked about a $3.5 million differential on the GE56. But is there a way to think about that for the V2500? \nJoseph Adams: Yes, we have the same set of -- same approach to that engine as we're taking with the CFM56 engine. We've looked at sourcing used serviceable material, doing hospital repairs, potentially PMA, better -- being able to get better deals with MROs because of volume commitments. And it's all on the table. The shop visit cost for the V is higher than the CFM56. So it's typically full front to back is $9 million to $10 million versus probably $7 million for the CFM56. So we think we can get similar dollar savings out of using all of those albeit on a higher price. So it's a lower percentage, but it's still the same amount of savings. So I think we feel very good about that. We haven't locked in all of the partners that we will -- that we're talking to right now on this program. And as the volumes increase and build, we'll be able to give more specifics around who we're working with and what are the components of that. \nJoshua Sullivan: Got it. And then just given the move in the stock, all the changes, do you have a sense of the investor base at this point versus last year? Any major changes you're seeing. \nAlan Andreini: This is Alan. There have been. And I think that there are people that are initiating on the stock right here. And I think when you see the 13F filed for this quarter, on May 15, you're going to see some names that you've never seen before. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Giuliano Bologna with Compass Point. \nGiuliano Anderes-Bologna: Congrats on the continued outflows on the Products segment. What I was curious about asking was that -- we would obviously love to have an update about PMA. But with that being said, we've heard a lot of discussion recently about the industry pushing into PMA and increased demand for PMA from airlines. I'm curious if you agree with that. And why do you think that's happening? \nJoseph Adams: Sure. So on the first part, we continue to make very good progress on getting approval on the next set of parts. And we don't have -- we're not giving a specific estimate on the timetable, but very good progress. We -- and the quality and the performance of those parts is going to be terrific, and we're very excited about that. So as I said consistently, it's worth the wait.\n On the acceptance, Giuliano, I mean, I think that a lot of -- in the recent last year or so, people focus a lot on the supply chain reliability and when you have a sole source for critical parts, that's a bad dynamic. And so I think people are recognizing that PMA not only delivers cost savings in a very high-quality product but it delivers a second source of product, which can be very, very important if you have an engine sitting in a shop and shop turn times are stretching out beyond 6 months now. If you're waiting for a single part and you have a single supplier and they tell you they can't get you that for a year, then you're in a bad position. So that's, I think, why it's becoming more talked about or maybe more people are recognizing that it's not just a cost saving opportunity. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hillary Cacanando, Deutsche Bank. \nHillary Cacanando: So this one is for Angela. Angela, you have 2 preferreds that go from fixed to floating this year, one in September and one in December. Obviously, you've had some great returns on those securities. Could you talk about what your plans are for them? And how your discussions are going with the rating agencies? \nEun Nam: Sure, Hillary. So yes, you're correct in our Series As and Bs are converting to floating later this year. And we're currently planning on refinancing those preferreds before those reset dates. So we continue to reassess that. \n In regards to the rating agencies, our current analysts are those that typically cover Air Quest lessors. But each rating agency is recognizing the great contribution that we're getting from the Aerospace Products business and the different metrics that will be involved in those sectors. So we are bringing in Aerospace Products business coverage analysts to each of our discussions with the rating agencies this year, which we think will be beneficial to our ratings. \nHillary Cacanando: Great. And then my second question is just on the Leasing side. You mentioned that the demand for these assets remain strong. I know the gains could be lumpy. So how should we think about the segment for the rest of the year? And could you just talk about the pipeline for that segment? You sounded pretty excited about it in terms of what the pipeline looks like for the second quarter? \nJoseph Adams: Sure. So 2 things in the first quarter that depressed Leasing EBITDA -- pure Leasing EBITDA. One is, as you may recall, we had 4 airplanes we took back, terminated a lease with a Vietnamese airline in the fourth quarter last year, and those are off lease. They go on lease in the second quarter, and that had about a $5 million impact -- negative impact to EBITDA. And then secondly, the first quarter is typically seasonally the slowest period for flying hours and a lot of airlines don't fly the same schedules and some of our EBITDA is driven off of hours flown. So all of that changes in Q2 and Q3, and we expect, as I said, a meaningful uptick starting next quarter, and we're -- we're reaffirming our $425 million of leasing EBITDA for the year without gains on asset sales. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Mckenna with Citizens JMP. \nBrian Mckenna: Okay. Great. Joe, I appreciate the comments on the $250 million of EBITDA expected from Aerospace products this year. But if I annualize first quarter results, you're already run rating at $280 million. It sounds like and it seems like there's quite a bit of room as we are heading into 2Q and beyond. So I would think it's reasonable to assume continued growth from the first quarter level. So why not move the upper end of the range for 2024 for the segment? \nJoseph Adams: Well, it's just one quarter. I mean it was a good quarter, and we see good things ahead, but it's 25% of the year. And so we're just not ready to do that. We'll reassess on the second quarter. But at this point, we're sticking with the $250 million. \nBrian Mckenna: Got it. Okay. Makes sense. And then just a follow-up. It's great to see the V2500 program ramping. But how should we think about the incremental margin from this business? It would seem like there are some synergies with your existing platform and ways to leverage the infrastructure already in place. So could this business actually be margin accretive to the segment over time? \nJoseph Adams: It could. I think the -- I mean, the LATAM deal is a good example where it's both V2500 and CFM56 engines. And we offer engine solutions to every airline in the world that operates either a 737NG or an A320 CO family aircraft, which is basically every airline. So it's pretty powerful that we can combine and sell them essentially in a single transaction, those services. There are some unique aspects right now because the V2500, the demand is so high, given that there's over -- reportedly over 600 GTF aircraft -- powered aircraft that are grounded right now, which is x2 that's 1,200 engines that are out of service. And so the demand for the V2500 is extremely high and will stay -- likely stay that way for the next 3 years and it's a smaller market. \n So airlines, I think, are a little more fearful that they may not be able to get the V2500 at all. So we see airlines willing to talk about longer-term leases on that product which inevitably leads to more value creation, right? If we can do the MRE, put it on a long-term lease, then you can sell it as a cash flowing asset and create value 2 different ways. So I think that possibility is something that we're seeing now likely to play out. So I do think it has some added upside. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Zazula with Barclays. \nDavid Zazula: For David, I guess my understanding is with the V2500, you have a little bit less flexibility in how you execute the maintenance and operations of that type of engine. And just with high demand overall, can you just talk about some of the challenges you have in balancing the V2500 versus CFM56 and how you're managing that? \nDavid Moreno: Sure. So on the V2500, you have a lot of the same components that you do on any engine, right, which is you have access to used serviceable material, you have access to independent MROs, and you have access to new parts via either OEM or PMA. The V2500, as we discussed, is a more expensive shop visit. It is a little more complicated from engineering, which therefore creates more demand for ways to avoid that shop visit. So we're seeing a lot of folks come to us not wanting to shop those engines and wanting us to come with solutions. We're able to integrate those solutions and provide a better product. So we are working through all that. There's a lot of innovations around the hospital side of that engine that are coming out just because there's not enough V2500s today in the market. So we're going to continue to develop our capabilities and continue to find innovative ways to maintain those engines. \nJoseph Adams: And it's continuous improvement. We did the same thing on the CFM56 when we started that program, we knew about 10% of what we know now. So I would expect in a year or 2, we're going to be a lot -- we're going to have a lot more tools to work with on the V2500 that we don't have today. But even without the tools, it's still a great market. So... \nDavid Zazula: Very helpful. And for Joe or Angela, impressive work on the tender for the October 2025 notes. Just curious as to what the plan is for that funding. And if -- your balance sheet, you're not looking at expanding the leasing balance sheet significantly, would you consider potentially funding from the Aerospace Products side a refi of those notes or what the plan would be? \nJoseph Adams: Well, I think the refi is done. The next opportunity is the 9.75 that callable -- the call price drops in August, that's the next opportunity for refi to lower our interest costs. In terms of cash flow generation, we will look at using cash flow to repay debt. And our priority on cash flow is to: one, make investments; and, two, then obtain a strong BB rating from all 3 agencies, which we're on track to do; and then, three, we would look at increased dividends or stock buyback.\n On the investment side, we are expecting to increase the balance sheet slightly for the V2500 investments that we're making this year. We expect to end the year at 150 to 200 engines of V2500, which is up from 70 now. So we will be increasing slightly that. But I think the opportunity will come at some point this -- later this year, probably to look at repaying debt and paying some of that more expensive debt off. \nDavid Zazula: And if I could just squeeze one more in? Any update on insurance or where you stand there? \nJoseph Adams: Yes. We have 4 separate work streams going, 3 of them are negotiations with counterparties that are not insurance companies and they're very advanced, and we expect, hopefully, to get those done around the middle of this year, which represents about $75 million out of the expected $150 million that we expect in total to recover. The balance of that will be with insurance companies, which we think will take somewhat longer, which we're expecting to be in the middle of next year. But we think we'll get $150 million. We think half of that in the middle of this year and the other half in the middle of next year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sherif Elmaghrabi with BTIG. \nSherif Elmaghrabi: So a couple on the LATAM deal. What's the lead time on the V2500 exchanges? You touched on your capacity, but I'm curious on the timing side, you said you'd be sort of prepping the engines for exchange ahead of time. And I'm wondering how long it takes before FTAI can recognize revenue? \nDavid Moreno: Yes. So we have engines in shop right now, and we're starting to deliver those engines as soon as we will close the transaction. So the engine exchanges will start relatively soon. The ramp-up will take time. So we are -- we have it in schedule right now for this year of shop visits at expected dates but we're still working on the next outer years. So we're going to be receiving that soon and working through that and producing those engines ahead of time. But those engines have been produced and some of them are finalizing shop visit at the moment. \nJoseph Adams: We started -- I mean, we have 15 engines in the shop right now, the V2500. We started that earlier this year. So some of them are already coming out and we've got a schedule where we expect to be able to meet the requirements for LATAM when they need them, and we'll have those engines ready. They spend a lot of time asking us that question. So, we went through the ringer on that. That was one of their key criteria given the shortages in the industry. \nSherif Elmaghrabi: Yes, that makes sense. And then on the sale/leaseback side of the deal. Obviously, that generates some liquidity for LATAM, right? So does a deal like that, potentially for a future customer, not just this airline, does that open up opportunities for asset sales under the Leasing business? Is that sort of a multiphase deal something you're thinking about? \nJoseph Adams: Yes. Yes, it does. I mean, LATAM in this situation wasn't really focused as much as some airlines are and generating a lot of liquidity from this deal. So it's not a huge amount to them, but they were more focused on the engine exchange program. But airlines are all -- every deal ends up being a snowflake. And it's always a different set of priorities. And -- but the demand for unleased aircraft is very high again. So there's a lot of money that's come into the Leasing segment again. If you have a 6-year lease with a known airline, you can easily monetize that. And we will be doing more of that in the second quarter, so that we'll generate some cash -- more cash and more gains in -- from that activity. So yes, we do like that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Trent with Citi. \nStephen Trent: A couple of my questions have already been answered. But I'm curious as well, when we think about the engine module side, you've got very good exposure. In U.S., you acquired that 50% stake in quick turn, I believe, a facility in Montreal. When you think about this high level, are there sort of any other geographic spots where you maybe think you can add your footprint? \nJoseph Adams: Yes, it would be Southeast Asia, which we did a relatively very good job early on of covering North and South America and Europe. And we started it about 6, 9 months ago, really with a more intense focus on Southeast Asia. And we see -- we've had success there and -- but there's a lot -- I mean, it's a huge, huge market opportunity that we were relatively underrepresented, but that will be changing this year, and we see that as a future significant growth opportunity. Whether we had maintenance capacity there or not is something we've started thinking about. So I don't have anything conclusive yet, but we will look at maintenance facilities that would potentially be either our own or partners in that market in the coming months. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Galanti with Stifel. \nFrank Galanti: Congrats on the great quarter. I wanted to ask about the Aerospace segment. Can you help us understand what the breakdown in the segment was between module swaps, USM sales and full engine sales or exchanges given the varying levels of differentiation and margins between those businesses? \nJoseph Adams: Sure. So we -- in the -- starting with the module factory. We generate about -- this quarter was about $600,000 EBITDA per module sale or exchange. That's up a little bit from the last quarter, and it's consistent with what we've been seeing since really when we started the Montreal factory. Module transactions happen in either 1, 2 or 3. So a customer can choose either -- any of those flavors that you want. Three modules is a whole engine. And in some cases, what airlines realize is that rather than them working to try to keep their fan or the low-pressure turbine that they could actually save more money by just doing a whole engine exchange and not having to deal with that because they may have 0 days of downtime. So -- but on average, the average transaction averages out to 2 modules per transaction. \n In terms of the rest of the -- so we call that in the module factory in the MRE V2500 business is very similar. And the profitability from the V2500 on an equivalent basis is probably a little bit higher than the equivalent on the CFM56 today, but they're pretty comparable. And we expect that to remain similar. That's assuming that an engine has 3 modules for the V2500.\n On USM, it's been -- we've indicated in the past that we -- it was roughly previously about 25% of EBITDA from Aerospace Products, but as we have ramped up the MRE business that percentage is going down to where it less than 15% of EBITDA at this point. And we'll continue as a percentage to decline because that's not a high-growth business. So hopefully, that helps. \nFrank Galanti: That does. And so sort of digging in onto the 3 whole engine CFM sales. So based on last quarter's reclassification of the V2500 gain on sale from that Leasing segment into the Aviation segment, it's sort of my understanding, right, so when you sell full CFM56 engine, that shows up with 3 modules and the result of a gain on sale it shows the Aerospace segment. So just confirm for me that, that's correct. And then so how many of those setting 2 modules were full engines? And of those engines sold, how many of those engines did you sell with sort of the same 3 modules that you had purchased them with? \nJoseph Adams: I have no idea. When we sell a whole engine, as I said, it's the customer's choice. If they wanted to take their fan off and only buy 2 modules, they can do that. So we don't really think of it any differently and we don't break it out that way. It's not relevant to us as -- from a business operation. So I don't have any numbers on that. \nFrank Galanti: Okay. But just -- like if you purchased an engine in COVID and did no work on it, sort of no value-added work, when you sell that, is that showing up in Aerospace EBITDA? \nJoseph Adams: Well, there's no such thing as an engine that sits around for 2 to 3 years, so that doesn't happen. When we buy an engine, we put it into the facility and it's split into 3 modules. It's either repaired, torn down or combined reassembled into an engine. So that doesn't happen. \nFrank Galanti: Okay. So then just to be clear, every CFM56 engine goes through the module factory in some capacity? \nJoseph Adams: No. I mean we've bought airplanes, sold the airframe and leased engines directly. If the engine doesn't require work, it doesn't go into the module factory. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Dodd with Raymond James. \nRobert Dodd: Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for all the detail about cash flow and potential use of funds, et cetera, pay down debt. You did mention the dividend. I'm going to ask about the dividend. I mean, you're barely yielding more than the S&P 500 given the stock performance. Is there -- I mean, you mentioned maybe increasing the dividend later this year with the cash flow you're going to generate. Is there a rule of thumb you're thinking? I mean way back in the past, there used to be a 2x FAD coverage we'll think about the dividend. Obviously, the whole -- the metrics are different now. But is there a rule of thumb we should think about as to what would give you the comfort necessary to increase the dividend from where it is right now? \nJoseph Adams: Yes, you're right. We really haven't thought about the coverage calculation recently for the last 4 years or 5 years, but you have the history. No, I don't think that's necessarily the way we're approaching it today is it's more -- we have investments. We want to have a strong BB. And then when we have excess cash, we'll return it to shareholders somehow. That's kind of the waterfall. \nRobert Dodd: Got it. And one more, if I can. On the capacity question, you're really opportunistic when you added the Lockheed capacity, for example during COVID and the facility was being underutilized, and we were very opportunistic kind of locking that up long term. Are those kind of -- facilities aren't being underutilized now, right? There's backlogs everywhere. Are those kind of opportunities going to be available? Or is it going to be any -- is an expansion in capacity going to be more -- is it going to necessitate an acquisition or be capital intensive? Or are you going to be able to find capacity on an as-needed basis, do you think? \nJoseph Adams: There's capacity out there. There are some shops that -- I mean, the successful shops -- the large shops are very busy and they have -- and many of them have now geared turbofan work that they either want to do or have to do, which is sort of squeezing out some other capacity. But there are lots of other facilities out in the world that we look at it and see, and we also have partners in different parts of the world. So the opportunity for the maintenance side, it's more of a -- it's available, and we have plenty of capacity right now, but we are always looking ahead and trying to stay in front of it. So yes, there's still opportunities, maybe not the same as during COVID but there's -- it's a big industry, and it's global. There's lots of smaller and medium-sized players out there. \nOperator: And I'm currently showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Alan Andreini for closing remarks. \nAlan Andreini: Thank you, Shannon, and thank you all for participating in today's conference call. We look forward to updating you after Q2. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

So our cash flows for this quarter, as you can see, our operating cash flows were about neutral, but that's because part of our proceeds from sales is sitting and investing. We believe for the rest of the year, our cash flow from operations will improve significantly. Sure, Hillary. So yes, you're correct in our Series As and Bs are converting to floating later this year. And we're currently planning on refinancing those preferreds before those reset dates. So we continue to reassess that. \n In regards to the rating agencies, our current analysts are those that typically cover Air Quest lessors. But each rating agency is recognizing the great contribution that we're getting from the Aerospace Products business and the different metrics that will be involved in those sectors. So we are bringing in Aerospace Products business coverage analysts to each of our discussions with the rating agencies this year, which we think will be beneficial to our ratings."

            "content": "Kristine, this is David. So to provide additional color on LATAM, the deal itself is predominantly a V2500 maintenance, repair and exchange contract. It does have a smaller component related to the sale leaseback, but what we're doing is we're building engines ahead of a shop visit, and we're providing engine exchanges that are avoiding shop visits for LATAM and offering flexibility. As far as EBITDA and how that's going to show up, we're going to be recognizing V2500 MRE contribution as soon as engines are exchanged. There's going to be a ramp-up period. So as we exchange more engines, there's going to be a ramp-up on Aerospace EBITDA. We're expecting ramp-up to take about 2 to 3 years as well as there's a smaller contribution on the leasing side that's going to commence as soon as we close those airplanes. Sure. So on the V2500, you have a lot of the same components that you do on any engine, right, which is you have access to used serviceable material, you have access to independent MROs, and you have access to new parts via either OEM or PMA. The V2500, as we discussed, is a more expensive shop visit. It is a little more complicated from engineering, which therefore creates more demand for ways to avoid that shop visit. So we're seeing a lot of folks come to us not wanting to shop those engines and wanting us to come with solutions. We're able to integrate those solutions and provide a better product. So we are working through all that. There's a lot of innovations around the hospital side of that engine that are coming out just because there's not enough V2500s today in the market. So we're going to continue to develop our capabilities and continue to find innovative ways to maintain those engines. Yes. So we have engines in shop right now, and we're starting to deliver those engines as soon as we will close the transaction. So the engine exchanges will start relatively soon. The ramp-up will take time. So we are -- we have it in schedule right now for this year of shop visits at expected dates but we're still working on the next outer years. So we're going to be receiving that soon and working through that and producing those engines ahead of time. But those engines have been produced and some of them are finalizing shop visit at the moment."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Joseph Adams",
            "content": "Thank you, Alan. To start today, I'm pleased to announce our 36th dividend as a public company and our 51st consecutive dividend since inception. The dividend of $0.30 per share will be paid on May 21 based on a shareholder record date of May 10.\n Now let's turn to the numbers. The key metric for us is adjusted EBITDA. We began the year strongly with adjusted EBITDA of $164.1 million in Q1 2024, which is up 1% compared to $162.3 million in Q4 2023 and up 29% compared to $127.7 million in Q1 of 2023. During the first quarter, the $164.1 million EBITDA number was comprised of $104.8 million from our Leasing segment, $70.3 million from our Aerospace Products segment and negative 11% from Corporate & Other. \n Turning now to Leasing. Leasing had another good quarter, posting approximately $105 million of EBITDA. The pure leasing component of the $105 million came in at $98 million for Q1 versus $99 million of Q4 of last year. With exceptionally strong demand for assets and the commencement of the Northern Hemisphere summer season, we expect meaningful growth in Q2. We remain very confident in Leasing EBITDA of $425 million for the year, excluding gains on asset sales.\n Part of the $105 million in EBITDA for Leasing came from gains on asset sales. We sold $31.9 million book value of assets for a gain of $6.7 million, slightly below our expectations, but we have more assets sales coming in Q2 and the rest of the year and are comfortable assuming gains on asset sales of approximately $12.5 million per quarter or $50 million for all of 2024.\n Aerospace Products had yet another excellent quarter with $70.3 million of EBITDA at an overall EBITDA margin of 37%. We sold 72 CFM56 modules in Q1 to 16 unique customers. Additionally, we sold 6 V2500 engines in Q1 to 3 customers through our recently launched V2500 engine program. We continue to see the tremendous potential in Aerospace products and are comfortable that we will generate approximately $250 million of EBITDA in 2024, the high end of our previous range.\n Our maintain, repair and exchange, or MRE, model for the 2 most widely used engines in commercial aviation produces cost savings and operational flexibility for airlines and aircraft lessors, by allowing them to avoid shop visits through engine or module exchanges. Our recently executed perpetual power agreement with LATAM covering over 60 V2500 and CFM56 engines illustrates the growing acceptance of airlines and lessors to outsource this activity to FTAI Aviation.\n Overall, looking ahead, we continue to expect our annual aviation EBITDA for 2024 to be approximately $725 million, not including Corporate & Other.\n With that, I'll turn the call back to Alan. Well, we're not giving a specific number on that yet. I think the -- it's a bit of a function of how many engine exchanges occur and how quickly they occur, and we don't have certainty on that yet. But we do expect that it will ramp up such that we have -- it will be a needle mover in years 2, 3, 4, 5 for our Aerospace Products business. So that's really all we're saying at the moment at this point. It's going to take a little bit of time for that to kick in. But then once it does, it's a needle mover and it's very stable. It's a great starting point. And we would love to do more of these. And we hope we will. We have several projects that are of a similar nature. Each airline, obviously, has their own requirements and their own specs. So they'll all be a little bit different, but we hope this model is used by other airlines. And we -- in discussions with the big operators of V2500s, we've gotten very positive feedback on this. So we expect to do more, and we hope to do more. So on the first point, I think we -- my recollection is we indicated between 250 and 300 module swaps or exchange sales for this year for 2024 and so we're obviously on a great path given the first quarter of that, and we have a pretty strong backlog. So we feel very good about that number. We have built our plan around being able to deliver that. So we have ample capacity at our 2 maintenance facilities that we use, the Montreal facility and the Miami facility. So we've got adequate capacity to do that. Obviously, we're working to increase capacity and ramp up because we want to stay ahead of this, and we do see substantial upside in the years ahead. So we're building additional capacity, but we have in place what we need to deliver this year. What was the second question? Or did I... Yes, we have the same set of -- same approach to that engine as we're taking with the CFM56 engine. We've looked at sourcing used serviceable material, doing hospital repairs, potentially PMA, better -- being able to get better deals with MROs because of volume commitments. And it's all on the table. The shop visit cost for the V is higher than the CFM56. So it's typically full front to back is $9 million to $10 million versus probably $7 million for the CFM56. So we think we can get similar dollar savings out of using all of those albeit on a higher price. So it's a lower percentage, but it's still the same amount of savings. So I think we feel very good about that. We haven't locked in all of the partners that we will -- that we're talking to right now on this program. And as the volumes increase and build, we'll be able to give more specifics around who we're working with and what are the components of that. Sure. So on the first part, we continue to make very good progress on getting approval on the next set of parts. And we don't have -- we're not giving a specific estimate on the timetable, but very good progress. We -- and the quality and the performance of those parts is going to be terrific, and we're very excited about that. So as I said consistently, it's worth the wait.\n On the acceptance, Giuliano, I mean, I think that a lot of -- in the recent last year or so, people focus a lot on the supply chain reliability and when you have a sole source for critical parts, that's a bad dynamic. And so I think people are recognizing that PMA not only delivers cost savings in a very high-quality product but it delivers a second source of product, which can be very, very important if you have an engine sitting in a shop and shop turn times are stretching out beyond 6 months now. If you're waiting for a single part and you have a single supplier and they tell you they can't get you that for a year, then you're in a bad position. So that's, I think, why it's becoming more talked about or maybe more people are recognizing that it's not just a cost saving opportunity. Sure. So 2 things in the first quarter that depressed Leasing EBITDA -- pure Leasing EBITDA. One is, as you may recall, we had 4 airplanes we took back, terminated a lease with a Vietnamese airline in the fourth quarter last year, and those are off lease. They go on lease in the second quarter, and that had about a $5 million impact -- negative impact to EBITDA. And then secondly, the first quarter is typically seasonally the slowest period for flying hours and a lot of airlines don't fly the same schedules and some of our EBITDA is driven off of hours flown. So all of that changes in Q2 and Q3, and we expect, as I said, a meaningful uptick starting next quarter, and we're -- we're reaffirming our $425 million of leasing EBITDA for the year without gains on asset sales. Well, it's just one quarter. I mean it was a good quarter, and we see good things ahead, but it's 25% of the year. And so we're just not ready to do that. We'll reassess on the second quarter. But at this point, we're sticking with the $250 million. It could. I think the -- I mean, the LATAM deal is a good example where it's both V2500 and CFM56 engines. And we offer engine solutions to every airline in the world that operates either a 737NG or an A320 CO family aircraft, which is basically every airline. So it's pretty powerful that we can combine and sell them essentially in a single transaction, those services. There are some unique aspects right now because the V2500, the demand is so high, given that there's over -- reportedly over 600 GTF aircraft -- powered aircraft that are grounded right now, which is x2 that's 1,200 engines that are out of service. And so the demand for the V2500 is extremely high and will stay -- likely stay that way for the next 3 years and it's a smaller market. \n So airlines, I think, are a little more fearful that they may not be able to get the V2500 at all. So we see airlines willing to talk about longer-term leases on that product which inevitably leads to more value creation, right? If we can do the MRE, put it on a long-term lease, then you can sell it as a cash flowing asset and create value 2 different ways. So I think that possibility is something that we're seeing now likely to play out. So I do think it has some added upside. And it's continuous improvement. We did the same thing on the CFM56 when we started that program, we knew about 10% of what we know now. So I would expect in a year or 2, we're going to be a lot -- we're going to have a lot more tools to work with on the V2500 that we don't have today. But even without the tools, it's still a great market. So... Well, I think the refi is done. The next opportunity is the 9.75 that callable -- the call price drops in August, that's the next opportunity for refi to lower our interest costs. In terms of cash flow generation, we will look at using cash flow to repay debt. And our priority on cash flow is to: one, make investments; and, two, then obtain a strong BB rating from all 3 agencies, which we're on track to do; and then, three, we would look at increased dividends or stock buyback.\n On the investment side, we are expecting to increase the balance sheet slightly for the V2500 investments that we're making this year. We expect to end the year at 150 to 200 engines of V2500, which is up from 70 now. So we will be increasing slightly that. But I think the opportunity will come at some point this -- later this year, probably to look at repaying debt and paying some of that more expensive debt off. Yes. We have 4 separate work streams going, 3 of them are negotiations with counterparties that are not insurance companies and they're very advanced, and we expect, hopefully, to get those done around the middle of this year, which represents about $75 million out of the expected $150 million that we expect in total to recover. The balance of that will be with insurance companies, which we think will take somewhat longer, which we're expecting to be in the middle of next year. But we think we'll get $150 million. We think half of that in the middle of this year and the other half in the middle of next year. We started -- I mean, we have 15 engines in the shop right now, the V2500. We started that earlier this year. So some of them are already coming out and we've got a schedule where we expect to be able to meet the requirements for LATAM when they need them, and we'll have those engines ready. They spend a lot of time asking us that question. So, we went through the ringer on that. That was one of their key criteria given the shortages in the industry. Yes. Yes, it does. I mean, LATAM in this situation wasn't really focused as much as some airlines are and generating a lot of liquidity from this deal. So it's not a huge amount to them, but they were more focused on the engine exchange program. But airlines are all -- every deal ends up being a snowflake. And it's always a different set of priorities. And -- but the demand for unleased aircraft is very high again. So there's a lot of money that's come into the Leasing segment again. If you have a 6-year lease with a known airline, you can easily monetize that. And we will be doing more of that in the second quarter, so that we'll generate some cash -- more cash and more gains in -- from that activity. So yes, we do like that. Yes, it would be Southeast Asia, which we did a relatively very good job early on of covering North and South America and Europe. And we started it about 6, 9 months ago, really with a more intense focus on Southeast Asia. And we see -- we've had success there and -- but there's a lot -- I mean, it's a huge, huge market opportunity that we were relatively underrepresented, but that will be changing this year, and we see that as a future significant growth opportunity. Whether we had maintenance capacity there or not is something we've started thinking about. So I don't have anything conclusive yet, but we will look at maintenance facilities that would potentially be either our own or partners in that market in the coming months. Sure. So we -- in the -- starting with the module factory. We generate about -- this quarter was about $600,000 EBITDA per module sale or exchange. That's up a little bit from the last quarter, and it's consistent with what we've been seeing since really when we started the Montreal factory. Module transactions happen in either 1, 2 or 3. So a customer can choose either -- any of those flavors that you want. Three modules is a whole engine. And in some cases, what airlines realize is that rather than them working to try to keep their fan or the low-pressure turbine that they could actually save more money by just doing a whole engine exchange and not having to deal with that because they may have 0 days of downtime. So -- but on average, the average transaction averages out to 2 modules per transaction. \n In terms of the rest of the -- so we call that in the module factory in the MRE V2500 business is very similar. And the profitability from the V2500 on an equivalent basis is probably a little bit higher than the equivalent on the CFM56 today, but they're pretty comparable. And we expect that to remain similar. That's assuming that an engine has 3 modules for the V2500.\n On USM, it's been -- we've indicated in the past that we -- it was roughly previously about 25% of EBITDA from Aerospace Products, but as we have ramped up the MRE business that percentage is going down to where it less than 15% of EBITDA at this point. And we'll continue as a percentage to decline because that's not a high-growth business. So hopefully, that helps. I have no idea. When we sell a whole engine, as I said, it's the customer's choice. If they wanted to take their fan off and only buy 2 modules, they can do that. So we don't really think of it any differently and we don't break it out that way. It's not relevant to us as -- from a business operation. So I don't have any numbers on that. Well, there's no such thing as an engine that sits around for 2 to 3 years, so that doesn't happen. When we buy an engine, we put it into the facility and it's split into 3 modules. It's either repaired, torn down or combined reassembled into an engine. So that doesn't happen. No. I mean we've bought airplanes, sold the airframe and leased engines directly. If the engine doesn't require work, it doesn't go into the module factory. Yes, you're right. We really haven't thought about the coverage calculation recently for the last 4 years or 5 years, but you have the history. No, I don't think that's necessarily the way we're approaching it today is it's more -- we have investments. We want to have a strong BB.

So the opportunity for the maintenance side, it's more of a -- it's available, and we have plenty of capacity right now, but we are always looking ahead and trying to stay in front of it. So yes, there's still opportunities, maybe not the same as during COVID but there's -- it's a big industry, and it's global. There's lots of smaller and medium-sized players out there."
