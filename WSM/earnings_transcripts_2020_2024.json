[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the call over to Elise Wang, Vice President of Investor Relations, to discuss non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements. Please go ahead. \nElise Wang: Thank you. Good afternoon. This call should be considered in conjunction with the press release that we issued earlier today. Unless indicated otherwise, our discussion today will relate to results and guidance based on certain non-GAAP measures.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.\n I will now turn the conference call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer. \nLaura Alber: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. 2020 was a year of challenges and dramatic changes in the way we live. It was also a year where we were pushed to adapt and clarify what is important to us. I could not be prouder of the accomplishments of the team here at Williams-Sonoma. Their dedication was a vital part of our ability to substantially outperform the industry and gain market share. \n In Q4, despite shipping constraints and low retail traffic, we delivered another quarter of accelerating revenue and profitability with 26% comp growth, our highest quarterly comp of the year, and 85% EPS growth. This strong end to the year, combined with our outperformance throughout 2020, drove record fiscal year revenue growth, substantial operating margin expansion and EPS that was almost double that of last year. As we look forward to the year ahead and the longer-term future of our company, we are confident in our ability to drive growth and improve our profitability. We have big goals and good reasons to believe that we will achieve them.\n Today, I want to spend the bulk of our time talking about our 3 key differentiators, which set us apart and have become increasingly relevant. They are, first, our in-house design; second, our digital-first channel strategy; and third, our values.\n Let's start with our in-house design capability. Our in-house teams design our own products, create original aesthetics and work with our talented vendors to bring quality, sustainable products to market. Given that the bulk of our products cannot be found elsewhere and the design quality value equation is so strong, we have pricing power that others do not. Throughout this year, we have been very deliberate in reducing promotions in all of our brands. This is a very significant and material change to our model. We have tested into this change, replacing site-wide promotions with inspiring content. And the effectiveness of this change is clear in our results, including consecutive quarters of product margin expansion compared to last year.\n In Pottery Barn, the multiyear work to improve our value proposition is paying off. We are increasing brand relevance aesthetically with the successful launch of our proprietary rustic modern furniture collections and our famous casual lifestyle point of view. Our value-engineered products are attracting new customers. We have introduced significantly more opening price points, and our multistep finished, high-quality furniture pieces are the best value in the market. We will continue to develop assortments and proven adjacent categories to drive incremental growth.\n One example of this is bath renovation. The bath renovation market is $80 billion or 20% of the U.S. home improvement market. Through in-house product development and our new marketplace model, our bath renovation business is growing at a rate of nearly 30% per year and is projected to contribute an incremental $100 million over the next 3 years.\n In Pottery Barn Kids and Teen, we have amplified our leadership in design and sustainability in the children's home furnishings business. We are proud to say that 100% of our wooden furniture offering is now GREENGUARD Gold certified, aligned with our promise of products that are good for kids and good for the planet. In addition to strong core introductions of furniture, we have added a new modern aesthetic that is growing at over 50% and attracting new customers to our brands.\n Another example of growth is our baby business. Our baby business saw 23% growth last year, and we are actively targeting the 2 billion-plus baby registry market.\n West Elm has truly become the home furnishing brand of choice for millennials and millennial-minded people. We continue to build the business with original design and by filling out white space in underdeveloped categories. For example, this year, we materially expanded into seasonal decor, a historically small business for the brand. In the holiday season, we sold out with many of the products within the first couple of weeks of launch, which built a strong foundation for further incremental volume in the years to come.\n Another category we are aggressively going after is outdoor. Currently, West Elm's outdoor business is less than half the size of Pottery Barn's, and doubling this business will drive an incremental 6% growth for the West Elm brand.\n Now I'd like to talk about Williams-Sonoma. This year marked a dramatic change in strategy for the brand. We implemented a content-driven marketing strategy that featured exclusive products and relevant lifestyle stories instead of promotions. We also grew our exclusive products to 70% of our total business. This has been one of our key strategic initiatives to increase the mix of product only available at Williams-Sonoma, which has grown from 50% to 70% in the last 5 years. Looking ahead, we'll be even more aggressive in growing our exclusive product, which we expect to reach over 80% of our total business by the end of FY '21.\n We also see significant opportunities in categories that are underdeveloped, including the high-end luxury furniture market. Our Williams-Sonoma Home brand is significantly underrepresented in this market and represents a substantial opportunity to drive growth and gain market share for the Williams-Sonoma brand.\n In addition to growth in our brands, we also have growth in new customer segments such as Business-to-Business and the global home category. We are building our mighty Business-to-Business team, and we are accelerating in sales volume across multiple industry verticals. Last year, we drove over $350 million of revenues, and we expect this business to surpass $500 million this year.\n In our global business, our strategy for growth is through the capital-light franchise model. We plan to double our revenues globally in the next 5 years, led by the continued expansion of West Elm, growth in our franchise operations as well as in our Canada e-commerce business.\n Our second differentiator is our digital-first channel strategy. One of the key reasons we outperformed was because our e-commerce platform was able to serve our customers at scale. We are uniquely positioned to take market share as the home industry shifts online. We are already the #1 non-pure-play e-commerce retailer in home furnishing and the top 25 e-commerce retailer in the U.S. across all industries. And today, our business is over 70% e-commerce.\n In our digital channels, we have been acquiring new customers at record rates all year, and our customer retention metrics continue to improve among new customers. We have a platform, the supply chain infrastructure, the tech stack and the talent to push our growth in e-commerce even higher. We are digital-first but not digital-only. Our stores are competitive advantage that support our online business for customers who want to experience our products in person as well as for those who prefer the convenience of our omnichannel services.\n In the past quarter, we increased our total Buy Online Pickup In Store and ship from store sales by over 130% as we leverage our retail network as fulfillment hubs. This is a huge unlock for our distribution operations, and it is one of the reasons we were able to fulfill higher-than-expected volumes this holiday season despite gridlock issues that impacted the industry. \n As we look ahead, our future growth will be driven predominantly by e-commerce. One of the key advantages of having built our tech platform in-house is that we are able to implement and test new initiatives quickly and adjust based on customer feedback. We already have several initiatives planned to further enhance customer engagement and conversion online.\n You also see our 3D visualization capability come to life as we introduce new functionalities to our Design Crew Room Planner, including immersive, multiproduct AR room layouts and 360-degree experiences. These enhancements are important because this tool drives sales. We saw a significant increase in the usage of this tool by our design associates and customers this year, with total plans created up 55% compared to last year. Also, those who utilize this tool currently generate twice as many sales as non-users.\n In our supply chain, we are aggressively expanding our U.S. manufacturing and fulfillment capability by over 20% to 30% next year, including adding close to 2 million square feet of distribution space to our delivery network. This will support our elevated demand, particularly in furniture. To help mitigate industry-wide shipping constraints and higher costs, we will test and expand our in-home delivery to include small packages in addition to leveraging our omnichannel network.\n Being digital-first also enables us to explore new offerings and business models such as Marketplace. Our Marketplace assortment is of the same superior quality as the rest of our products, often exclusive and sourced from our trusted socially responsible vendor base. Marketplace also leverages our website reach and is capital light. This year, Marketplace was just over 4% of our total business, and we are planning to almost triple its size in the next 5 years.\n Our third differentiator is our values. We care deeply about sustainability, equity action and supporting our associates and the communities where we work. Our commitment to sustainability is one of the main reasons our customers choose us over our competitors. \n For example, a recent survey found that our Pottery Barn customers are 3x more likely to be in the top environmentally focused households. There's a direct correlation between the good work we are doing in the world and our increasing relevance with our customers. And we are thrilled to be recognized for the work in this area. Just last month, we were ranked at #16 on Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies, up from 32 last year. And we are continuing our recognition as the only home furnishings retailer on the entire Barron's list. \n As we look to the future, we will deepen our sustainability commitments further. Our Pottery Barn brand kicked off the new year with a commitment to plant 3 million trees in 3 years, where we will plant a tree for every piece of indoor wooden furniture we sell. Company-wide, we will meet our 100% responsibly sourced cotton and 50% responsibly sourced wood goals and grow our selection of sustainably made products. Most exciting is our upcoming announcement of an ambitious public goal for carbon reduction across our operations and throughout our entire supply chain. \n Diversity, equity, inclusion is also central to who we are as a company. We continue to lead in gender equity, and we are proud to be included in Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index this year for our gender equity achievements across talent, pay culture and workplace policies. We also lead in LGBTQ equity and continue to score 90% or higher in the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index. \n In order to improve racial equity, we have established our Equity Action Plan. And although there is still a lot more to do, we have made measurable progress. We have committed our ongoing support to over 25 national and local nonprofit organizations that advocate for racial justice and equity and have increased our Black/African American representation through hiring, partnerships and collaborations. \n And of course, we cannot overemphasize the value of our associates. Our people are at the heart of our business. In 2020, we continue to pay our associates during the initial months of COVID while our stores and offices were closed and provided several pandemic bonuses and hourly wage increases to our frontline workers throughout the year. \n To help protect the safety of our associates and our communities, we continue to provide personal protective gear and COVID testing to our store and supply chain associates. And through our Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Foundation, we have given financial assistance to over 850 associates experiencing COVID hardship this year. In addition to these COVID-related benefits, we also enhanced our parental leave policy to provide more paid time off for primary -- both primary and secondary caregivers. \n The positive impact of all these initiatives was evident in our team's unwavering dedication throughout the year, including the best holiday execution we have ever had. We will continue to follow through on our Equity Action Plan commitments to advance racial equity, both inside our company and in the communities we serve. We have set aggressive goals to further diversify our workforce, vendor partners and collaborators, and we are committed to providing transparency on our progress.\n In summary, our business excelled in 2020 despite the extremely difficult operating environment. We believe this reflects the power of our 3 key differentiators, which we'll continue to invest in to drive growth and gain market share. Looking ahead to 2021 and beyond, we are very optimistic about our runway for growth and profitability.\n But before I give our financial outlook, let me provide some insight into what we are currently seeing in our business. All of our brands are starting the year strong. We're seeing higher-than-expected e-commerce traffic and sales and continuing recovery in our retail comps. Our entertaining-related categories such as Easter and outdoor are driving very strong results for us, giving us the confidence that this entertaining lifestyle trend will accelerate post pandemic as people welcome friends and families back into their home.\n Our B2B business sales trends also continue to accelerate week after week. Growth in our global business is also building momentum, driven by strong demand from our franchise partners and our e-commerce business in Canada. In addition, our merchandise margins continue to expand as we have substantially reduced promotions. \n We will continue to chase inventory. And unfortunately, we are experiencing additional delays due to COVID-related slowdowns, foam shortage due to the inclement February weather in the South and delays due to port congestion and a shipping container shortage. We are doing all that we can to expedite inventory flow for our customers, but our in-stock recovery is now most likely pushed to Q3. And while this is a challenge, it is also one related to our very strong demand.\n We expect this strong demand to continue through 2021 and beyond based on a number of factors. First is the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and our 3 key differentiators that will continue to set us apart from the competition and allow us to take market share. Second, it is the recovery in our retail traffic and the replenishment of our inventory levels as we move throughout the year and beyond that will drive additional growth. And third, it is the favorable macro trends that we believe will continue to benefit our business. \n These include high consumer confidence, a strong housing market, a continuing shift to e-commerce, the expected continuation of working from home, hybrid work and the importance of sustainability and values to the customer. This gives us the confidence that we can deliver mid- to single high -- mid- to high single-digit revenue growth and operating margin expansion in 2021.\n Longer term, our 3 key differentiators, our in-house design, our digital-first channel strategy and our values, will drive profitable market share gains, accelerating our path to $10 billion of revenues and 15% operating margins in the next 5 years. Julie will speak to this financial outlook in more detail. \n But before I turn the call over to her, I want to express my sincere gratitude to our associates, particularly our frontline workers in manufacturing and distribution who worked tirelessly around the clock through the pandemic. Our incredible performance over the past year could not have been achieved without our team's innovation, collaboration and hard work. I could not be prouder of our associates and all that they have accomplished in taking care of each other, our customers and our communities.\n And with that, I would now like to pass the call over to Julie. \nJulie Whalen: Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. I also want to begin by thanking all of our associates for their resilience and hard work over the past year as we navigated an extremely challenging environment, for making operational changes at the onset of the pandemic to preserve liquidity and maintain strong financial health, to managing the impact of widespread store closures while continuing to pay our people, to fulfilling higher-than-expected online volumes as we grappled with parcel shipping caps and supply chain disruptions. We stayed relentlessly focused on taking care of all of our stakeholders, our associates, our customers and our shareholders. And it was this focus that enabled us to report record fourth quarter and fiscal year results today.\n In the fourth quarter, net revenues reached approximately $2.3 billion with net comparable brand revenue growth of 25.7% and an even higher demand comp of nearly 30%, which includes orders placed but not yet filled in the quarter. E-commerce grew at a comp of 47.9%, and our retail stores continued to improve sequentially, ending the quarter with a negative comp of 7.6%. This outperformed our expectations given the substantial COVID restrictions that were in place throughout the quarter and the overall decline in national store traffic of over 30%. \n All brands drove strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Williams-Sonoma delivered a 26.2% comp. Pottery Barn accelerated to a comp of 25.7%. West Elm accelerated to a 25.2% comp on top of last year's 13.9% comp. And Pottery Barn Kids and Teen accelerated to a comp of 25.7%. And in our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined, we delivered another quarter of over 20% growth.\n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin expanded 450 basis points to 42.1% in the fourth quarter, driven by another quarter of substantially higher merchandise margins and occupancy leverage. Higher merchandise margins resulted from a significantly reduced promotional activity as we replaced site-wide promotions with relevant content across all of our brands. Occupancy leveraged 190 basis points in the quarter, resulting from higher sales and relatively flat year-over-year occupancy dollars at approximately $181 million. \n Our efforts to renegotiate rent and to close less profitable stores have enabled us to minimize our occupancy dollar growth and to deliver this occupancy leverage. While we did incur higher shipping costs year-over-year from a higher mix of e-commerce sales and peak shipping surcharges from our third-party shippers, we are pleased to see our selling margins, which include these higher shipping costs, sequentially improve again this quarter, expanding 260 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points from the third quarter.\n SG&A in the fourth quarter was 24.2% of net revenues compared to 26.1% last year, leveraging 190 basis points year-over-year and sequentially improving 10 basis points as a rate from the third quarter. SG&A dollars grew 15.5% compared to last year, primarily driven by higher employment costs from increased incentive compensation given our fiscal year outperformance, higher hourly variable pay, particularly in our supply chain as our teams work to fulfill higher-than-expected volumes during the quarter, and incremental pandemic-related costs such as bonuses for our frontline workers, work-from-home stipend for our corporate associates and increased levels of PPE and cleaning across our facilities. Despite these incremental costs, we were able to maintain a low SG&A rate due to the strength of our sales volume and our overall strong financial discipline, which kept SG&A growth substantially below sales growth.\n As a result, we delivered another quarter of record profitability with operating income growth of 92% to $410 million and operating margin expansion of 630 basis points to 17.9%. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.95 or 85% higher than that of 2019 at $2.13. These fourth quarter results, combined with the outperformance we have seen throughout 2020, allowed us to deliver record financial performance on the year.\n Some of our fiscal year 2020 highlights include net revenues at all-time highs in 2020 at nearly $6.8 billion, including comparable brand revenue growth of 17%. Our e-commerce business grew at a comp of 44.5% this year, taking our e-commerce mix to over 70% or $4.8 billion of our total revenues. In retail, we delivered a negative 22.5% comp despite substantial COVID disruptions with our stores closed or severely limited throughout the year and an overall national decline in store traffic of about 45%. In addition, our stores this year played an integral role in supporting our online growth through virtual design and omni-fulfillment services. \n By brand, we delivered double-digit growth and significant acceleration across all brands. Across the Pottery Barn brands, comps accelerated 15.6% on top of 4.2% last year, with Pottery Barn at a 15.2% comp and our children's business, Party Barn Kids and Teen, at a 16.6% comp. Williams-Sonoma accelerated to a 23.8% comp, driven by e-comm comps well above 70%. West Elm, our largest growth initiative, delivered their 11th consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth and another year of double-digit comp at 15.2% on top of last year's 14.4% comp. Our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined, delivered another year of double-digit growth. \n Additionally, our cross-brand initiatives continue to gain scale and momentum. Most notably is our Business-to-Business division, which delivered approximately $360 million in revenues for the year, up 15% over last year and contributing an incremental 140 basis points to our total company comp.\n In our cross-brand loyalty program, The Key, we enrolled nearly 4 million customers, bringing our total membership to almost 12 million members or 23% over 2019. And our complementary Design Crew services accounted for almost 50% of our FY '20 in-store revenue. \n This top line performance, along with our strong financial discipline all year, enabled us to generate operating income of over $960 million, which was over 90% higher than 2019. This resulted in record operating margin expansion of 560 basis points to 14.2% and EPS of $9.04, almost double that of 2019. Additionally, this level of earnings growth allowed us to substantially increase our return on invested capital from 22.4% to 38.1%, with all brands substantially improving and significantly outperforming our peer set median.\n On the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of over $1.2 billion compared to $432 million in 2019, which reflects our strong financial performance and operating cash flow of almost $1.3 billion, which is more than double last year. In addition to our strong cash balance, we also ended the year with no amount outstanding on our line of credit. This strong liquidity position allowed us to fund the operations of the business, including nearly $170 million in capital expenditures, primarily in technology and supply chain to support our e-commerce growth and to provide shareholder returns of over $300 million through dividends and share repurchases. \n While many companies suspended their dividends in 2020, we continued to pay dividends to our shareholders all year, including increasing our dividend payout by 10% this past quarter for an annual dividend payout to shareholders of $158 million. We also, after initially suspending share repurchases, repurchased shares at the same level as 2019 or approximately $150 million in the back half of 2020.\n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $1.006 billion for a decrease of 8.6% year-over-year, which was a 200 basis point improvement from the third quarter. While we are pleased to see a sequential improvement in our inventory position compared to last quarter and the gradual narrowing of the gap between demand and net cost this quarter, we are continuing to work through our high backorder levels with our vendor partners and expect to be back in stock to more normalized levels in the back half of 2021.\n Now let me turn to our expectations for the year ahead and beyond. Given the ongoing strength of our business as we enter 2021, the expected recovery in our retail business and inventory levels as we move throughout the year as well as the macro trends that will continue to benefit our business, we expect 2021 to be in line with our previously provided long-term financial outlook of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth or 5% to 9% and year-over-year operating margin expansion. \n As far as our capital allocation in 2021, we plan to first invest in the business and then return excess cash to our shareholders. We expect to invest approximately $200 million to $250 million in the business with over 85% of the capital spend prioritized on technology and supply chain initiatives that primarily support our e-commerce growth. In technology, we are focused on enhancing customer engagement and conversion online. And in the supply chain, we are planning to spend primarily on the addition of 2 new distribution centers to provide an incremental 2 million square feet in DC capacity to support our elevated growth as well as various investments in automation to drive speed and efficiency throughout our operations. \n As the consumer and our business continue to shift more online, so have our levels of e-commerce-related capital spend. Over the last 5 years alone, we have shifted from less than 50% e-commerce-related spend to now over 85% of our estimated spend in 2021. And we expect this shift to hold at these levels going forward. \n We also plan to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and increased level of share repurchases. Following the 10% quarterly dividend increase that went into effect last quarter, we announced earlier today another double-digit increase in our quarterly dividend of 11.3% or $0.06 to $0.59 per share. As far as share repurchases, we plan to increase our level of repurchases over last year. Today, we also announced that our Board has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which will supersede the remaining outstanding under our prior authorization. \n While our stock is hovering around all-time highs, we continue to believe that it remains undervalued given our projections for growth and profitability. As a result, we believe investing in our own stock will also drive long-term financial returns.\n And finally, given our strong liquidity position and our expectations for another year of robust operating cash flow generation, we paid off our $300 million term loan early and expect to let our $200 million, 364-day line of credit facility naturally expire in May 2021. All of these decisions reflect our confidence in the long-term growth and profitability outlook of our company and our unwavering commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders.\n Longer term, as Laura mentioned, given the acceleration in our business, along with the macro trends that should continue to favor our business for the long term, we see a faster path to now reach $10 billion in net revenues and 15% operating margins in the next 5 years. We estimate that Pottery Barn will expand to almost $3.5 billion in revenues, West Elm will grow double digits, almost doubling in size to over $3 billion, Williams-Sonoma will reach almost $1.6 billion in revenues, and our Pottery Barn Kids and Teen business will grow to $1.4 billion. \n This anticipated top line growth in addition to strong growth in our core business will be fueled by accelerated double-digit growth across a number of our key initiatives, including our B2B business expanding to $1 billion in revenues, our Marketplace business growing to almost 3x the size of today to over $700 million, our emerging brands expanding to a combined revenue of over $600 million and our global operations more than doubling in size to $700 million.\n From a profitability perspective, further operating margin expansion should predominantly be driven by overall sales leverage from higher sales levels and a continued shift to our more efficient and profitable e-commerce business, reduce occupancy costs from the renegotiation of our lease agreements and the expected closure of approximately 25% of our retail fleet as our leases come up for renewal, continued strength in our product margins from an ongoing focus on more content-led marketing and more value-engineered, high-quality and sustainable products as well as overall strong financial discipline, maintaining expense growth below sales growth.\n In summary, our record performance this year is a testament to the strength of our teams and the power of our 3 key differentiators: our in-house design, our digital-first channel strategy and our values. As we look into next year and beyond, we are optimistic about our business. And given the favorable long-term macro trends, including a strong housing market, the disruption of brick-and-mortar and an accelerating shift to e-commerce, the expected continuation of working from home in some capacity post pandemic and the increasing importance of sustainability and being a values-driven company, combined with our key differentiators, our growth initiatives, our double-digit growth in new customer counts and loyalty members, our strong operating cash flow and liquidity and a proven track record of strong financial discipline, we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive long-term growth and profitability, resulting in market share gains and strong financial returns for our shareholders.\n I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations. I mean it really is a nice cap into what was a difficult year, but you made it through extraordinarily well. Laura, so my first question is for you. It looks like the brands are all hitting sort of this accelerated sweet spot of growth here in the U.S. Can you talk a little bit about the foreign businesses? You haven't yet stepped into Europe. And so we're seeing some players in this space, obviously, launch into Europe kind of as their next phase of kind of TAM growth. So can you talk about that first and foremost? \n And then, Julie, really interesting on the occupancy line. I mean that is -- it's pretty incredible that your sales grew 24% and your occupancy is flat. So I really wanted to understand what the occupancy line trajectory looks like for 2021. Should we assume it's kind of flattish as we go through Q1 and then into the full year? And then on the flip side of that, on the merch margins, are you at historically low levels of clearance? And have you permanently changed the nature of the business such that we won't ever go -- we won't go back, we won't mean revert back to historical levels of promo? And congrats again. \nLaura Alber: Thank you. In terms of global, we recognize as we travel the world that no one else is doing what we're doing. And we've had great success in really bringing e-commerce to some of these markets, particularly the franchise partners who are very well established but didn't have a big e-commerce business. And so we have -- we partnered with great people. \n In the Middle East, we have a really sizable operation. In fact, this week, we just opened a brand-new flagship store in Dubai that is phenomenal with a Williams-Sonoma Home expression that is something you haven't ever seen before. 2 days in, we're off to a great start there. \n And that's just yet one example of the great stores that we're building together and the business we're building together with our franchise partners around the world. There's still a lot of growth there. West Elm is one that hasn't been as established in these franchise markets. And then also e-commerce continues to be a higher percent of sales in these global markets. \n We announced last year that we'd be going into India. We are still on track to do that. It's a little delayed, but it's a big market. Our forecast is that it's one of the most sizable for us, and we're very excited about that partnership. We want to do it really well. And so we put off China, and we don't have plans to enter China at this point. \n Similarly, we are in London with West Elm. We have some things in some of the department stores there. We also have a kids website, but we don't have further plans to expand other than in e-commerce. It's just -- there's a lot more easy places to go right now than Europe with the long leases and also just the difficulty of doing business there. So we're not doing a big push right now in Europe. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Fair enough. \nJulie Whalen: So regarding occupancy and your questions there. So I think first of all, if you look back, you'll see that we have been holding occupancy dollar growth down for a while now, and we do expect that to continue. The important thing to remember is there's many things that go into occupancy, like depreciation from capital investments, also our distribution center rent. So there'll be ups and downs. \n But the reality is, as I said in my prepared remarks, if we're closing apparently about 25% of our fleet at least, that will lower our occupancy dollars and then potentially be offset by these other things that I just mentioned. But then you combine that with the higher sales volume, higher e-commerce volume, and all of that leverages that line. So I do expect both to have more muted dollar growth, but also the higher sales will drive that leverage going forward for the foreseeable future. \n As far as merchandise margins, yes, we do have some of the lowest levels of clearance inventory that we've had in the company. And at this point in time, we expect that to continue. But it's also the fact that we've made a decision to really pull off of site-wide promos and go after content-led relevant marketing. So instead of just doing a blanket e-mail where we give you 20% off, we're getting more and more fine-tuned about what we serve up to you to give you what you want. And if you want it, you can only get it from us. \n And that, combined with the fact that we are value engineering the product to get at the right price and the right quality and the right sustainability levels, and we'll never compromise on that, it puts us in a situation where if you want it, you got to buy it. It's a great price. So people are buying it. So that is -- we are going after that aggressively, and that's why we're so confident in merchandise margins continuing to expand going forward. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. \nSteven Forbes: I just want to follow up on the selling margin or merchandise margin commentary you provided during the call, right? I think you said selling margins expanded 260 basis points during the fourth quarter. So can you remind us what that number was for the year? And then as we think about the path to a 15% EBIT margin, any commentary on the cadence, right, of the selling margin profile in the business as you think about potentially cycling something -- some of these transitory headwinds, whether it be clearance, as you just mentioned, or promotional activity? Do you see anything as it relates to cadence in the selling margin? \nJulie Whalen: I mean selling margins all year have been accelerating from an improvement standpoint and from an expansion standpoint. So again, we expect that to continue going forward. I don't have handy right now the exact amount on the year. But if you look back, you can see by quarter that they've continued to expand in this quarter, in particular, with the largest expansion. \n As far as puts and takes as to what could drive the selling margins, I mean, we've always said that the shipping costs are a part of selling margins. And so that obviously has become something that we've been focused on more recently, especially as our mix shifts to e-commerce, the more furniture we have. And there's been higher rates that have come through with our third-party shippers. But I think the combination of the fact that we can drive these merch margin expansion throughout and then you layer it with occupancy on top of it, is what's been able to give us this incredible gross margin expansion for the entire year. And so that is why we're confident going forward that will continue. \n We obviously also are working specifically on shipping costs and trying to minimize those increases as much as possible to help with the selling margins going forward in addition to the merch margins. And whether that's using more of our omni-fulfillment at our stores, which has been a huge win for us, obviously, during this time, and it's a differentiator of the fact that we have these stores as hubs around the country, to, obviously, trying to figure out ways to take these larger items and bring it into our own delivery network and lowering some of the costs with our third-party shippers. \n Now at the same time, we have great relationships with our third-party shippers. And so we're working with them to come to a great solution. But we are focused not only on offsetting shipping costs but also lowering them in an absolute sense to keep driving these selling margins to where they are. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore. \nOliver Wintermantel: I had a question regarding labor costs. You mentioned COVID pay in 2020 but then also bonuses and all of that. So I wanted to see how you plan for 2021 and beyond for -- on labor costs. \nJulie Whalen: So our labor costs, as we spoke to during the year, have obviously gone up. You've heard that from many other retailers, especially the hourly rates. And so across the board, we have moved to a $14 per hour rate. So at least we were at $14 per hour, even higher, in our distribution centers, in particular, in certain areas. And so we've got a lot of that in our base. Obviously, there's always pressure, and we always look at the hourly wages on a market-by-market basis, and we want to be competitive. \n Our people have been the secret sauce, if you will, especially this year. And so we are making certain that we're taking care of them from an hourly rate perspective. But since we've made these moves in the past, we -- it's not as much of a headwind for us as it might be for others. On the flip side, I think you mentioned COVID costs. We obviously expect that there will be reduced or eliminated COVID costs, which is going to help us next year because those are fairly substantial. \n And so you've got some moving parts. Labor, you've got the annualization of these hourly wages and potentially a little more pressure on the labor line. You've got the fact that we may have some more advertising spend. But on the flip side, you've got COVID costs that are coming out. So it gives us a lot of confidence, combined with our merchandise margin expansion and our occupancy leverage and with higher sales, leveraging the entire P&L that we can drive operating margin expansion next year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham: Congrats on a great quarter and year. My question is around the outlook. Very impressive in terms of the margin outlook, particularly for 2021. Just perhaps provide a little bit more color on the complexion of the margin expansion you're expecting in 2021, how much of it will be in gross margin, how much of it in SG&A. Do you expect both of those to provide expansion to your operating margins? \nJulie Whalen: Yes, this is Julie. I'll answer that question. So we expect expansion on both. It's obviously going to depend by quarter. We're not giving quarterly line item guidance. But at the end of the day, we're very confident in our merchandise margin expansion. We're very confident in our occupancy leverage. And as I just mentioned on the last question that we have the, I guess, benefit of some of these COVID costs that are going to be flipping out. And yes, we will have some increased costs, but we will be able to more than cover that as a result of the higher COVID cost that will be coming out to cover it. And so that, combined with higher sales, will allow us to leverage any of those costs that are coming through and drive operating margin expansion on the bottom line. \n And remember, a lot of the sales that we're driving now with an expectation of 70% or higher are going to be e-commerce. And e-commerce, we have historically been one of the most profitable e-commerce companies out there. And so as we shift more and more to e-commerce, that completely leverages the P&L. So that's our expectation. \nSeth Basham: Understood. Just to follow up, if you're going to be expanding your operating margins seemingly materially in 2021, your goal is 15% in 2025. It seems like you don't have that much more expansion plan for 2022 through 2025. Is that just conservatism at this point in time? \nLaura Alber: I'd say there's some conservatism, but also, we want to make sure that our value proposition stays really compelling and that our service is the best in the industry. And so we're -- it's a bit of conservatism. It's also making sure we have the money set aside to invest back into the business to stay on top. \nSeth Basham: Understood. Congrats and best of luck. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez with Telsey Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernandez: Congratulations also on a good quarter. I had 2 questions. One, when you look at your demand trends, are they broad-based? Or are you seeing any notable differences in markets that -- where restrictions have been lifted or have higher vaccination rates versus those that don't? So that's one. \n And then my second question is on fulfillment. I wanted to see if you could talk more about the ship from store and how you can roll that further and help perhaps lower some of your order -- cost to fulfill the orders. And how do you see that evolving over the next couple of years? \nLaura Alber: Yes. So thank you. This is Laura. Let me just first take the shift from store, and then I'm going to pass it to Felix to answer what we're seeing or not seeing with the correlations. \n So in terms of ship from store, ship from store is great because it leverages inventory that would otherwise be trapped in stores and helps us better fulfill customers' demand. And we're getting better and better at it, in driving it and marketing it correctly, putting on filters to our sites. They can sort for things. And it's an area that has gone up a ton more this year. But there's still a lot more room for us to do more with that, and in particular, with Buy Online Pickup In Store. \n So we've been pushing that as well, not just because of COVID but because it's another great way to service the customer who wants to get in and out quickly. So you're going to see us continue to market them better, have better site experiences and put more power behind the infrastructure. \n I'm going to pass to Felix on what we're seeing with vaccination and states opening and all that good stuff. \nFelix Carbullido: Sure. Thanks for the question. We have -- what we've seen in our data is that demand for furniture is still very strong in states where vaccination rates are high. So there's no correlation between changes in state-level vaccination rates and our data and our growth in our furniture business. So what we're seeing is it's really not a zero-sum game here. \n As more people get vaccinated, as travel starts to open up, as schools start to open up, we have a substantial gear business, a luggage business. And as vaccination rates increase, we expect people to open up their homes more. So our dining and entertaining businesses are primed for that. So early indications are no correlation. In fact, it's a negative correlation is what we're seeing. We're seeing strong rates across the board regardless of vaccination rates. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies. \nJonathan Matuszewski: Guys, great quarter. My first one was just on the Williams-Sonoma concept, another remarkable quarter there. Curious what you're seeing as far as repeat spending trends now that we're beginning to anniversary some of these cook and eat-at-home trends from last year. Any color there as far as kind of new and repeat customers would be helpful. That was my first question. \nLaura Alber: Sure. First, I'll say that, yes, Williams-Sonoma, we've made a lot of changes to that strategy, and it's paying off from the exclusives to shifting from what was predominantly a store business to an online business and really driving content again, which we're thrilled to continue to do. In terms of the Williams-Sonoma categories that are working, we are seeing great strength across the board, particularly the areas we're most dominant, cookware, cutlery, electrics. \n In terms of customer metrics, we have very favorable customer metrics. And it's interesting, we have very high orders per customer versus last year, repeat customers. And we -- when you compare it to someone like a Wayfair, you see that we have higher dollars in all those categories, particularly higher dollars per order. We have extremely productive online advertising and online profitability, as Julie mentioned earlier. \n Felix, did I miss anything there? Do you want to add anything to that? \nFelix Carbullido: No. I mean just to reiterate, we haven't -- we've seen our repeat rates be very strong. And as Laura mentioned, all those new customers we acquired during shelter-in-place are returning at record rates and actually shopping across our portfolios at record rates. So we think that our share of wallet within these new customers will continue to grow as we introduce them to not just the best of Williams-Sonoma but what our other brands have to offer and leveraging our loyalty program to encourage them to shop across our portfolio. \nJonathan Matuszewski: Great. That's super helpful. And then just a quick one, I'll squeeze in. Design Crew, I think you mentioned around half of in-store revenues. And I think you mentioned those customers are spending around 2x as much. So just curious. You've had a lot of success integrating kind of Outward with Room Planner and all that. How are you thinking about maybe capital for potentially other tech-related M&A options going forward? Any color there with your thoughts would be helpful. \nLaura Alber: I thought you're going to ask a different question. I was ready for the other one, which is I wanted to tell you that one of the most amazing things that happened during the shutdown is that the people who worked in-store who couldn't work did virtual design chat. And they have done such a phenomenal job that it's a whole new channel for us now. \n So we have the online design services where you don't need to do anything but use our tools. In fact, you can power yourself the 3D tool, which nobody has done that before. Other people allow you to pay and have their designers send you back 3D models. You can actually go on yourself as a customer and do it or you can call a store, go into the store or you can do it virtually. And so yes, we are continuing to shift capital dramatically from brick-and-mortar to online services, online e-commerce and infrastructure for supply chain and supports it all. And that shift is remarkable. \n Julie, do you want to give a few numbers? \nJulie Whalen: Yes, yes. We used to spend less than 50% basically on e-commerce spend -- e-commerce-related spend, I should say. And now we're spending about 85% or expected to this year, and we expect that will hold to be higher. So our complete shift in capital is going to e-commerce now, and that's one of the examples that we'll be spending on as well. \nLaura Alber: And as it relates to innovation, we have a lot of great stuff that we're building in-house that is as good as anything I've seen. And of course, we're always looking at the landscape to see how we can get a jump on anything that we had already planned to do anyway. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Congratulations, guys. Amazing quarter. Amazing year. And I love the way the stores look right now. Your transition to spring has been beautiful. So Laura and Julie, I guess kind of a bigger picture question here to start. The home space has become very popular, getting a little bit more crowded online. So you outlined some of your key differentiators. Would that also fit into like what are your differentiators online? What are your advantages that you have on e-commerce that differentiates you and separates you from the pack as it gets more crowded? \nLaura Alber: Great question, Marni. Thank you. So online, we really bring not just a single product to life but a lifestyle. And so we have spent a long time -- the PIP, product information page is the money shop. And everything that is on that page needs to help you make that decision, whether it's 3D or UGC, which we have really amped up online, and then different guided shopping paths, if you're interested in something. And we're seeing that really help us add on to an order, if you went on to look for one thing, to be able to show you and have you add something else and inspire you to buy things you didn't think you were looking for. \n And versus our competition, there's a lot of people selling many things, but sometimes it's about really helping the customer make a decision. And if they trust you with your quality and your sustainability and your value equation, the conversion is higher. So we know that the work that we've done to build the brands actually through our stores in a lot of cases and through our catalogs is now coming to fruition online. And so we continue to make the investments in the things that make it easier for the customer to make a decision, whether that's watches, color, accuracy, 3D modeling, in room, immersive experiences and just simply real-life photography, showing people how other customers that use something really makes a difference. \n I'd say the other thing that's really different about us is that with all these different brands run by separate people, it's such a wealth of ideas and innovation. And we can try something in one brand and then not bet the farm and push it across multiple brands once we know it works. And Yasir's team is very innovative in looking at A/B testing and always trying something new, and that's been a big part of our success with our key tech partners. \nMarni Shapiro: That actually makes a lot of sense. Can I just ask a quick follow-up to it also? I guess it's a 2-part follow-up even. The trends that you're seeing that emerge during COVID, which ones do you think will be stickiest post pandemic? And also, it sounds like in spite of the enormous growth online and all your work online, it sounds like in every turn, you're still talking about the stores, and it sounds like that's still an important part of the story. Is that how you're thinking about it going forward? \nLaura Alber: Yes. Let's talk about the trends that we see. When you think about it -- I mean first of all, we're so excited that the vaccine rollout is underway, and we're so hopeful for reopening of the economy once we reach herd immunity. The home has always been your biggest investment. Home values have gone up over time historically for Americans. They invest in their home. They know that they usually get it back. And this year, it's the centerpiece. \n Everything -- you were there too much. And you learn a lot of new things. And a lot of millennials and younger people learn to cook. Once you learn to cook, you never go back. You may go out to dinner, but you're going to cook better, and you're always going to be interested in the cooking trend. And that is key to the future of Williams-Sonoma.\n I would say secondly, entertaining. We haven't been able to entertain, right? I mean Easter, some people might actually be able to get together for Easter. July 4. Imagine the holidays. We are busy dreaming of the most inspiring Christmas parties that -- Hanukkah parties, New Year's parties that we can host in our homes and how we make that better for our customers, and we cannot wait to serve our customers. \n Also outdoor, we all got fresh air. Nobody got -- nobody even got the cold or the flu. I think you're going to stay outdoors a lot more than you did before. We are seeing -- I mentioned the strength in West Elm outdoor. Well, by the way, it's equally as good at Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma Home. And if you haven't seen the new Williams-Sonoma Home catalog, take a peek at that because it's a dominant display of luxury outdoor that I think you'll be extremely inspired by. \n The last big trend I just want to talk about is obviously hybrid work, work from home. I don't know about you, but I still haven't really accomplished the perfect work-from-home station. I still have a desk to buy. It's been so busy. You just don't get around to it. There's still a lot more room to make those work-from-home spaces better, and new home builds are going to include it. So that's a business we really play in, and we have that workspace business in West Elm. And we continue to grow it, and we have a lot on the horizon in innovation for work from home. \n So there's a lot of opportunity for us, Marni. And it's just whether it's product growth strategies or Business-to-Business or channel strategies. You take those growth strategies together and you put it with our 3 key differentiators and the macro, I'm telling you, we are going to have a great ride here, and it's a multiyear ride. \nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Laura Alber for any additional or closing remarks. \nLaura Alber: Well, thank you all for joining us, and I really wish you and your families the best. And we appreciate your interest and look forward to talking to you soon, hopefully in person. \nOperator: Well, thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",

            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. 2020 was a year of challenges and dramatic changes in the way we live. It was also a year where we were pushed to adapt and clarify what is important to us. I could not be prouder of the accomplishments of the team here at Williams-Sonoma. Their dedication was a vital part of our ability to substantially outperform the industry and gain market share. \n In Q4, despite shipping constraints and low retail traffic, we delivered another quarter of accelerating revenue and profitability with 26% comp growth, our highest quarterly comp of the year, and 85% EPS growth. This strong end to the year, combined with our outperformance throughout 2020, drove record fiscal year revenue growth, substantial operating margin expansion and EPS that was almost double that of last year. As we look forward to the year ahead and the longer-term future of our company, we are confident in our ability to drive growth and improve our profitability. We have big goals and good reasons to believe that we will achieve them.\n Today, I want to spend the bulk of our time talking about our 3 key differentiators, which set us apart and have become increasingly relevant. They are, first, our in-house design; second, our digital-first channel strategy; and third, our values.\n Let's start with our in-house design capability. Our in-house teams design our own products, create original aesthetics and work with our talented vendors to bring quality, sustainable products to market. Given that the bulk of our products cannot be found elsewhere and the design quality value equation is so strong, we have pricing power that others do not. Throughout this year, we have been very deliberate in reducing promotions in all of our brands. This is a very significant and material change to our model. We have tested into this change, replacing site-wide promotions with inspiring content. And the effectiveness of this change is clear in our results, including consecutive quarters of product margin expansion compared to last year.\n In Pottery Barn, the multiyear work to improve our value proposition is paying off. We are increasing brand relevance aesthetically with the successful launch of our proprietary rustic modern furniture collections and our famous casual lifestyle point of view. Our value-engineered products are attracting new customers. We have introduced significantly more opening price points, and our multistep finished, high-quality furniture pieces are the best value in the market. We will continue to develop assortments and proven adjacent categories to drive incremental growth.\n One example of this is bath renovation. The bath renovation market is $80 billion or 20% of the U.S. home improvement market. Through in-house product development and our new marketplace model, our bath renovation business is growing at a rate of nearly 30% per year and is projected to contribute an incremental $100 million over the next 3 years.\n In Pottery Barn Kids and Teen, we have amplified our leadership in design and sustainability in the children's home furnishings business. We are proud to say that 100% of our wooden furniture offering is now GREENGUARD Gold certified, aligned with our promise of products that are good for kids and good for the planet. In addition to strong core introductions of furniture, we have added a new modern aesthetic that is growing at over 50% and attracting new customers to our brands.\n Another example of growth is our baby business. Our baby business saw 23% growth last year, and we are actively targeting the 2 billion-plus baby registry market.\n West Elm has truly become the home furnishing brand of choice for millennials and millennial-minded people. We continue to build the business with original design and by filling out white space in underdeveloped categories. For example, this year, we materially expanded into seasonal decor, a historically small business for the brand. In the holiday season, we sold out with many of the products within the first couple of weeks of launch, which built a strong foundation for further incremental volume in the years to come.\n Another category we are aggressively going after is outdoor. Currently, West Elm's outdoor business is less than half the size of Pottery Barn's, and doubling this business will drive an incremental 6% growth for the West Elm brand.\n Now I'd like to talk about Williams-Sonoma. This year marked a dramatic change in strategy for the brand. We implemented a content-driven marketing strategy that featured exclusive products and relevant lifestyle stories instead of promotions. We also grew our exclusive products to 70% of our total business. This has been one of our key strategic initiatives to increase the mix of product only available at Williams-Sonoma, which has grown from 50% to 70% in the last 5 years. Looking ahead, we'll be even more aggressive in growing our exclusive product, which we expect to reach over 80% of our total business by the end of FY '21.\n We also see significant opportunities in categories that are underdeveloped, including the high-end luxury furniture market. Our Williams-Sonoma Home brand is significantly underrepresented in this market and represents a substantial opportunity to drive growth and gain market share for the Williams-Sonoma brand.\n In addition to growth in our brands, we also have growth in new customer segments such as Business-to-Business and the global home category. We are building our mighty Business-to-Business team, and we are accelerating in sales volume across multiple industry verticals. Last year, we drove over $350 million of revenues, and we expect this business to surpass $500 million this year.\n In our global business, our strategy for growth is through the capital-light franchise model. We plan to double our revenues globally in the next 5 years, led by the continued expansion of West Elm, growth in our franchise operations as well as in our Canada e-commerce business.\n Our second differentiator is our digital-first channel strategy. One of the key reasons we outperformed was because our e-commerce platform was able to serve our customers at scale. We are uniquely positioned to take market share as the home industry shifts online. We are already the #1 non-pure-play e-commerce retailer in home furnishing and the top 25 e-commerce retailer in the U.S. across all industries. And today, our business is over 70% e-commerce.\n In our digital channels, we have been acquiring new customers at record rates all year, and our customer retention metrics continue to improve among new customers. We have a platform, the supply chain infrastructure, the tech stack and the talent to push our growth in e-commerce even higher. We are digital-first but not digital-only. Our stores are competitive advantage that support our online business for customers who want to experience our products in person as well as for those who prefer the convenience of our omnichannel services.\n In the past quarter, we increased our total Buy Online Pickup In Store and ship from store sales by over 130% as we leverage our retail network as fulfillment hubs. This is a huge unlock for our distribution operations, and it is one of the reasons we were able to fulfill higher-than-expected volumes this holiday season despite gridlock issues that impacted the industry. \n As we look ahead, our future growth will be driven predominantly by e-commerce. One of the key advantages of having built our tech platform in-house is that we are able to implement and test new initiatives quickly and adjust based on customer feedback. We already have several initiatives planned to further enhance customer engagement and conversion online.\n You also see our 3D visualization capability come to life as we introduce new functionalities to our Design Crew Room Planner, including immersive, multiproduct AR room layouts and 360-degree experiences. These enhancements are important because this tool drives sales. We saw a significant increase in the usage of this tool by our design associates and customers this year, with total plans created up 55% compared to last year. Also, those who utilize this tool currently generate twice as many sales as non-users.\n In our supply chain, we are aggressively expanding our U.S. manufacturing and fulfillment capability by over 20% to 30% next year, including adding close to 2 million square feet of distribution space to our delivery network. This will support our elevated demand, particularly in furniture. To help mitigate industry-wide shipping constraints and higher costs, we will test and expand our in-home delivery to include small packages in addition to leveraging our omnichannel network.\n Being digital-first also enables us to explore new offerings and business models such as Marketplace. Our Marketplace assortment is of the same superior quality as the rest of our products, often exclusive and sourced from our trusted socially responsible vendor base. Marketplace also leverages our website reach and is capital light. This year, Marketplace was just over 4% of our total business, and we are planning to almost triple its size in the next 5 years.\n Our third differentiator is our values. We care deeply about sustainability, equity action and supporting our associates and the communities where we work. Our commitment to sustainability is one of the main reasons our customers choose us over our competitors. \n For example, a recent survey found that our Pottery Barn customers are 3x more likely to be in the top environmentally focused households. There's a direct correlation between the good work we are doing in the world and our increasing relevance with our customers. And we are thrilled to be recognized for the work in this area. Just last month, we were ranked at #16 on Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies, up from 32 last year. And we are continuing our recognition as the only home furnishings retailer on the entire Barron's list. \n As we look to the future, we will deepen our sustainability commitments further. Our Pottery Barn brand kicked off the new year with a commitment to plant 3 million trees in 3 years, where we will plant a tree for every piece of indoor wooden furniture we sell. Company-wide, we will meet our 100% responsibly sourced cotton and 50% responsibly sourced wood goals and grow our selection of sustainably made products. Most exciting is our upcoming announcement of an ambitious public goal for carbon reduction across our operations and throughout our entire supply chain. \n Diversity, equity, inclusion is also central to who we are as a company. We continue to lead in gender equity, and we are proud to be included in Bloomberg's Gender Equality Index this year for our gender equity achievements across talent, pay culture and workplace policies. We also lead in LGBTQ equity and continue to score 90% or higher in the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index. \n In order to improve racial equity, we have established our Equity Action Plan. And although there is still a lot more to do, we have made measurable progress. We have committed our ongoing support to over 25 national and local nonprofit organizations that advocate for racial justice and equity and have increased our Black/African American representation through hiring, partnerships and collaborations. \n And of course, we cannot overemphasize the value of our associates. Our people are at the heart of our business. In 2020, we continue to pay our associates during the initial months of COVID while our stores and offices were closed and provided several pandemic bonuses and hourly wage increases to our frontline workers throughout the year. \n To help protect the safety of our associates and our communities, we continue to provide personal protective gear and COVID testing to our store and supply chain associates. And through our Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Foundation, we have given financial assistance to over 850 associates experiencing COVID hardship this year. In addition to these COVID-related benefits, we also enhanced our parental leave policy to provide more paid time off for primary -- both primary and secondary caregivers. \n The positive impact of all these initiatives was evident in our team's unwavering dedication throughout the year, including the best holiday execution we have ever had. We will continue to follow through on our Equity Action Plan commitments to advance racial equity, both inside our company and in the communities we serve. We have set aggressive goals to further diversify our workforce, vendor partners and collaborators, and we are committed to providing transparency on our progress.\n In summary, our business excelled in 2020 despite the extremely difficult operating environment. We believe this reflects the power of our 3 key differentiators, which we'll continue to invest in to drive growth and gain market share. Looking ahead to 2021 and beyond, we are very optimistic about our runway for growth and profitability.\n But before I give our financial outlook, let me provide some insight into what we are currently seeing in our business. All of our brands are starting the year strong. We're seeing higher-than-expected e-commerce traffic and sales and continuing recovery in our retail comps. Our entertaining-related categories such as Easter and outdoor are driving very strong results for us, giving us the confidence that this entertaining lifestyle trend will accelerate post pandemic as people welcome friends and families back into their home.\n Our B2B business sales trends also continue to accelerate week after week. Growth in our global business is also building momentum, driven by strong demand from our franchise partners and our e-commerce business in Canada. In addition, our merchandise margins continue to expand as we have substantially reduced promotions. \n We will continue to chase inventory. And unfortunately, we are experiencing additional delays due to COVID-related slowdowns, foam shortage due to the inclement February weather in the South and delays due to port congestion and a shipping container shortage. We are doing all that we can to expedite inventory flow for our customers, but our in-stock recovery is now most likely pushed to Q3. And while this is a challenge, it is also one related to our very strong demand.\n We expect this strong demand to continue through 2021 and beyond based on a number of factors. First is the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and our 3 key differentiators that will continue to set us apart from the competition and allow us to take market share. Second, it is the recovery in our retail traffic and the replenishment of our inventory levels as we move throughout the year and beyond that will drive additional growth. And third, it is the favorable macro trends that we believe will continue to benefit our business. \n These include high consumer confidence, a strong housing market, a continuing shift to e-commerce, the expected continuation of working from home, hybrid work and the importance of sustainability and values to the customer. This gives us the confidence that we can deliver mid- to single high -- mid- to high single-digit revenue growth and operating margin expansion in 2021.\n Longer term, our 3 key differentiators, our in-house design, our digital-first channel strategy and our values, will drive profitable market share gains, accelerating our path to $10 billion of revenues and 15% operating margins in the next 5 years. Julie will speak to this financial outlook in more detail. \n But before I turn the call over to her, I want to express my sincere gratitude to our associates, particularly our frontline workers in manufacturing and distribution who worked tirelessly around the clock through the pandemic. Our incredible performance over the past year could not have been achieved without our team's innovation, collaboration and hard work. I could not be prouder of our associates and all that they have accomplished in taking care of each other, our customers and our communities.\n And with that, I would now like to pass the call over to Julie. Thank you. In terms of global, we recognize as we travel the world that no one else is doing what we're doing. And we've had great success in really bringing e-commerce to some of these markets, particularly the franchise partners who are very well established but didn't have a big e-commerce business. And so we have -- we partnered with great people. \n In the Middle East, we have a really sizable operation. In fact, this week, we just opened a brand-new flagship store in Dubai that is phenomenal with a Williams-Sonoma Home expression that is something you haven't ever seen before. 2 days in, we're off to a great start there. \n And that's just yet one example of the great stores that we're building together and the business we're building together with our franchise partners around the world. There's still a lot of growth there. West Elm is one that hasn't been as established in these franchise markets. And then also e-commerce continues to be a higher percent of sales in these global markets. \n We announced last year that we'd be going into India. We are still on track to do that. It's a little delayed, but it's a big market. Our forecast is that it's one of the most sizable for us, and we're very excited about that partnership. We want to do it really well. And so we put off China, and we don't have plans to enter China at this point. \n Similarly, we are in London with West Elm. We have some things in some of the department stores there. We also have a kids website, but we don't have further plans to expand other than in e-commerce. It's just -- there's a lot more easy places to go right now than Europe with the long leases and also just the difficulty of doing business there. So we're not doing a big push right now in Europe. I'd say there's some conservatism, but also, we want to make sure that our value proposition stays really compelling and that our service is the best in the industry. And so we're -- it's a bit of conservatism. It's also making sure we have the money set aside to invest back into the business to stay on top. Yes. So thank you. This is Laura. Let me just first take the shift from store, and then I'm going to pass it to Felix to answer what we're seeing or not seeing with the correlations. \n So in terms of ship from store, ship from store is great because it leverages inventory that would otherwise be trapped in stores and helps us better fulfill customers' demand. And we're getting better and better at it, in driving it and marketing it correctly, putting on filters to our sites. They can sort for things. And it's an area that has gone up a ton more this year. But there's still a lot more room for us to do more with that, and in particular, with Buy Online Pickup In Store. \n So we've been pushing that as well, not just because of COVID but because it's another great way to service the customer who wants to get in and out quickly. So you're going to see us continue to market them better, have better site experiences and put more power behind the infrastructure. \n I'm going to pass to Felix on what we're seeing with vaccination and states opening and all that good stuff. Sure. First, I'll say that, yes, Williams-Sonoma, we've made a lot of changes to that strategy, and it's paying off from the exclusives to shifting from what was predominantly a store business to an online business and really driving content again, which we're thrilled to continue to do. In terms of the Williams-Sonoma categories that are working, we are seeing great strength across the board, particularly the areas we're most dominant, cookware, cutlery, electrics. \n In terms of customer metrics, we have very favorable customer metrics. And it's interesting, we have very high orders per customer versus last year, repeat customers. And we -- when you compare it to someone like a Wayfair, you see that we have higher dollars in all those categories, particularly higher dollars per order. We have extremely productive online advertising and online profitability, as Julie mentioned earlier. \n Felix, did I miss anything there? Do you want to add anything to that? I thought you're going to ask a different question. I was ready for the other one, which is I wanted to tell you that one of the most amazing things that happened during the shutdown is that the people who worked in-store who couldn't work did virtual design chat. And they have done such a phenomenal job that it's a whole new channel for us now. \n So we have the online design services where you don't need to do anything but use our tools. In fact, you can power yourself the 3D tool, which nobody has done that before. Other people allow you to pay and have their designers send you back 3D models. You can actually go on yourself as a customer and do it or you can call a store, go into the store or you can do it virtually. And so yes, we are continuing to shift capital dramatically from brick-and-mortar to online services, online e-commerce and infrastructure for supply chain and supports it all. And that shift is remarkable. \n Julie, do you want to give a few numbers? And as it relates to innovation, we have a lot of great stuff that we're building in-house that is as good as anything I've seen. And of course, we're always looking at the landscape to see how we can get a jump on anything that we had already planned to do anyway. Great question, Marni. Thank you. So online, we really bring not just a single product to life but a lifestyle. And so we have spent a long time -- the PIP, product information page is the money shop. And everything that is on that page needs to help you make that decision, whether it's 3D or UGC, which we have really amped up online, and then different guided shopping paths, if you're interested in something. And we're seeing that really help us add on to an order, if you went on to look for one thing, to be able to show you and have you add something else and inspire you to buy things you didn't think you were looking for. \n And versus our competition, there's a lot of people selling many things, but sometimes it's about really helping the customer make a decision. And if they trust you with your quality and your sustainability and your value equation, the conversion is higher. So we know that the work that we've done to build the brands actually through our stores in a lot of cases and through our catalogs is now coming to fruition online. And so we continue to make the investments in the things that make it easier for the customer to make a decision, whether that's watches, color, accuracy, 3D modeling, in room, immersive experiences and just simply real-life photography, showing people how other customers that use something really makes a difference. \n I'd say the other thing that's really different about us is that with all these different brands run by separate people, it's such a wealth of ideas and innovation. And we can try something in one brand and then not bet the farm and push it across multiple brands once we know it works. And Yasir's team is very innovative in looking at A/B testing and always trying something new, and that's been a big part of our success with our key tech partners. Yes. Let's talk about the trends that we see. When you think about it -- I mean first of all, we're so excited that the vaccine rollout is underway, and we're so hopeful for reopening of the economy once we reach herd immunity. The home has always been your biggest investment. Home values have gone up over time historically for Americans. They invest in their home. They know that they usually get it back. And this year, it's the centerpiece. \n Everything -- you were there too much. And you learn a lot of new things. And a lot of millennials and younger people learn to cook. Once you learn to cook, you never go back. You may go out to dinner, but you're going to cook better, and you're always going to be interested in the cooking trend. And that is key to the future of Williams-Sonoma.\n I would say secondly, entertaining. We haven't been able to entertain, right? I mean Easter, some people might actually be able to get together for Easter. July 4. Imagine the holidays. We are busy dreaming of the most inspiring Christmas parties that -- Hanukkah parties, New Year's parties that we can host in our homes and how we make that better for our customers, and we cannot wait to serve our customers. \n Also outdoor, we all got fresh air. Nobody got -- nobody even got the cold or the flu. I think you're going to stay outdoors a lot more than you did before. We are seeing -- I mentioned the strength in West Elm outdoor. Well, by the way, it's equally as good at Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma Home. And if you haven't seen the new Williams-Sonoma Home catalog, take a peek at that because it's a dominant display of luxury outdoor that I think you'll be extremely inspired by. \n The last big trend I just want to talk about is obviously hybrid work, work from home. I don't know about you, but I still haven't really accomplished the perfect work-from-home station. I still have a desk to buy. It's been so busy. You just don't get around to it. There's still a lot more room to make those work-from-home spaces better, and new home builds are going to include it. So that's a business we really play in, and we have that workspace business in West Elm. And we continue to grow it, and we have a lot on the horizon in innovation for work from home. \n So there's a lot of opportunity for us, Marni. And it's just whether it's product growth strategies or Business-to-Business or channel strategies. You take those growth strategies together and you put it with our 3 key differentiators and the macro, I'm telling you, we are going to have a great ride here, and it's a multiyear ride. Well, thank you all for joining us, and I really wish you and your families the best. And we appreciate your interest and look forward to talking to you soon, hopefully in person."

            "name": "Julie Whalen",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. I also want to begin by thanking all of our associates for their resilience and hard work over the past year as we navigated an extremely challenging environment, for making operational changes at the onset of the pandemic to preserve liquidity and maintain strong financial health, to managing the impact of widespread store closures while continuing to pay our people, to fulfilling higher-than-expected online volumes as we grappled with parcel shipping caps and supply chain disruptions. We stayed relentlessly focused on taking care of all of our stakeholders, our associates, our customers and our shareholders. And it was this focus that enabled us to report record fourth quarter and fiscal year results today.\n In the fourth quarter, net revenues reached approximately $2.3 billion with net comparable brand revenue growth of 25.7% and an even higher demand comp of nearly 30%, which includes orders placed but not yet filled in the quarter. E-commerce grew at a comp of 47.9%, and our retail stores continued to improve sequentially, ending the quarter with a negative comp of 7.6%. This outperformed our expectations given the substantial COVID restrictions that were in place throughout the quarter and the overall decline in national store traffic of over 30%. \n All brands drove strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Williams-Sonoma delivered a 26.2% comp. Pottery Barn accelerated to a comp of 25.7%. West Elm accelerated to a 25.2% comp on top of last year's 13.9% comp. And Pottery Barn Kids and Teen accelerated to a comp of 25.7%. And in our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined, we delivered another quarter of over 20% growth.\n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin expanded 450 basis points to 42.1% in the fourth quarter, driven by another quarter of substantially higher merchandise margins and occupancy leverage. Higher merchandise margins resulted from a significantly reduced promotional activity as we replaced site-wide promotions with relevant content across all of our brands. Occupancy leveraged 190 basis points in the quarter, resulting from higher sales and relatively flat year-over-year occupancy dollars at approximately $181 million. \n Our efforts to renegotiate rent and to close less profitable stores have enabled us to minimize our occupancy dollar growth and to deliver this occupancy leverage. While we did incur higher shipping costs year-over-year from a higher mix of e-commerce sales and peak shipping surcharges from our third-party shippers, we are pleased to see our selling margins, which include these higher shipping costs, sequentially improve again this quarter, expanding 260 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points from the third quarter.\n SG&A in the fourth quarter was 24.2% of net revenues compared to 26.1% last year, leveraging 190 basis points year-over-year and sequentially improving 10 basis points as a rate from the third quarter. SG&A dollars grew 15.5% compared to last year, primarily driven by higher employment costs from increased incentive compensation given our fiscal year outperformance, higher hourly variable pay, particularly in our supply chain as our teams work to fulfill higher-than-expected volumes during the quarter, and incremental pandemic-related costs such as bonuses for our frontline workers, work-from-home stipend for our corporate associates and increased levels of PPE and cleaning across our facilities. Despite these incremental costs, we were able to maintain a low SG&A rate due to the strength of our sales volume and our overall strong financial discipline, which kept SG&A growth substantially below sales growth.\n As a result, we delivered another quarter of record profitability with operating income growth of 92% to $410 million and operating margin expansion of 630 basis points to 17.9%. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.95 or 85% higher than that of 2019 at $2.13. These fourth quarter results, combined with the outperformance we have seen throughout 2020, allowed us to deliver record financial performance on the year.\n Some of our fiscal year 2020 highlights include net revenues at all-time highs in 2020 at nearly $6.8 billion, including comparable brand revenue growth of 17%. Our e-commerce business grew at a comp of 44.5% this year, taking our e-commerce mix to over 70% or $4.8 billion of our total revenues. In retail, we delivered a negative 22.5% comp despite substantial COVID disruptions with our stores closed or severely limited throughout the year and an overall national decline in store traffic of about 45%. In addition, our stores this year played an integral role in supporting our online growth through virtual design and omni-fulfillment services. \n By brand, we delivered double-digit growth and significant acceleration across all brands. Across the Pottery Barn brands, comps accelerated 15.6% on top of 4.2% last year, with Pottery Barn at a 15.2% comp and our children's business, Party Barn Kids and Teen, at a 16.6% comp. Williams-Sonoma accelerated to a 23.8% comp, driven by e-comm comps well above 70%. West Elm, our largest growth initiative, delivered their 11th consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth and another year of double-digit comp at 15.2% on top of last year's 14.4% comp. Our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined, delivered another year of double-digit growth. \n Additionally, our cross-brand initiatives continue to gain scale and momentum. Most notably is our Business-to-Business division, which delivered approximately $360 million in revenues for the year, up 15% over last year and contributing an incremental 140 basis points to our total company comp.\n In our cross-brand loyalty program, The Key, we enrolled nearly 4 million customers, bringing our total membership to almost 12 million members or 23% over 2019. And our complementary Design Crew services accounted for almost 50% of our FY '20 in-store revenue. \n This top line performance, along with our strong financial discipline all year, enabled us to generate operating income of over $960 million, which was over 90% higher than 2019. This resulted in record operating margin expansion of 560 basis points to 14.2% and EPS of $9.04, almost double that of 2019. Additionally, this level of earnings growth allowed us to substantially increase our return on invested capital from 22.4% to 38.1%, with all brands substantially improving and significantly outperforming our peer set median.\n On the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance of over $1.2 billion compared to $432 million in 2019, which reflects our strong financial performance and operating cash flow of almost $1.3 billion, which is more than double last year. In addition to our strong cash balance, we also ended the year with no amount outstanding on our line of credit. This strong liquidity position allowed us to fund the operations of the business, including nearly $170 million in capital expenditures, primarily in technology and supply chain to support our e-commerce growth and to provide shareholder returns of over $300 million through dividends and share repurchases. \n While many companies suspended their dividends in 2020, we continued to pay dividends to our shareholders all year, including increasing our dividend payout by 10% this past quarter for an annual dividend payout to shareholders of $158 million. We also, after initially suspending share repurchases, repurchased shares at the same level as 2019 or approximately $150 million in the back half of 2020.\n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $1.006 billion for a decrease of 8.6% year-over-year, which was a 200 basis point improvement from the third quarter. While we are pleased to see a sequential improvement in our inventory position compared to last quarter and the gradual narrowing of the gap between demand and net cost this quarter, we are continuing to work through our high backorder levels with our vendor partners and expect to be back in stock to more normalized levels in the back half of 2021.\n Now let me turn to our expectations for the year ahead and beyond. Given the ongoing strength of our business as we enter 2021, the expected recovery in our retail business and inventory levels as we move throughout the year as well as the macro trends that will continue to benefit our business, we expect 2021 to be in line with our previously provided long-term financial outlook of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth or 5% to 9% and year-over-year operating margin expansion. \n As far as our capital allocation in 2021, we plan to first invest in the business and then return excess cash to our shareholders. We expect to invest approximately $200 million to $250 million in the business with over 85% of the capital spend prioritized on technology and supply chain initiatives that primarily support our e-commerce growth. In technology, we are focused on enhancing customer engagement and conversion online. And in the supply chain, we are planning to spend primarily on the addition of 2 new distribution centers to provide an incremental 2 million square feet in DC capacity to support our elevated growth as well as various investments in automation to drive speed and efficiency throughout our operations. \n As the consumer and our business continue to shift more online, so have our levels of e-commerce-related capital spend. Over the last 5 years alone, we have shifted from less than 50% e-commerce-related spend to now over 85% of our estimated spend in 2021. And we expect this shift to hold at these levels going forward. \n We also plan to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and increased level of share repurchases. Following the 10% quarterly dividend increase that went into effect last quarter, we announced earlier today another double-digit increase in our quarterly dividend of 11.3% or $0.06 to $0.59 per share. As far as share repurchases, we plan to increase our level of repurchases over last year. Today, we also announced that our Board has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which will supersede the remaining outstanding under our prior authorization. \n While our stock is hovering around all-time highs, we continue to believe that it remains undervalued given our projections for growth and profitability. As a result, we believe investing in our own stock will also drive long-term financial returns.\n And finally, given our strong liquidity position and our expectations for another year of robust operating cash flow generation, we paid off our $300 million term loan early and expect to let our $200 million, 364-day line of credit facility naturally expire in May 2021. All of these decisions reflect our confidence in the long-term growth and profitability outlook of our company and our unwavering commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders.\n Longer term, as Laura mentioned, given the acceleration in our business, along with the macro trends that should continue to favor our business for the long term, we see a faster path to now reach $10 billion in net revenues and 15% operating margins in the next 5 years. We estimate that Pottery Barn will expand to almost $3.5 billion in revenues, West Elm will grow double digits, almost doubling in size to over $3 billion, Williams-Sonoma will reach almost $1.6 billion in revenues, and our Pottery Barn Kids and Teen business will grow to $1.4 billion. \n This anticipated top line growth in addition to strong growth in our core business will be fueled by accelerated double-digit growth across a number of our key initiatives, including our B2B business expanding to $1 billion in revenues, our Marketplace business growing to almost 3x the size of today to over $700 million, our emerging brands expanding to a combined revenue of over $600 million and our global operations more than doubling in size to $700 million.\n From a profitability perspective, further operating margin expansion should predominantly be driven by overall sales leverage from higher sales levels and a continued shift to our more efficient and profitable e-commerce business, reduce occupancy costs from the renegotiation of our lease agreements and the expected closure of approximately 25% of our retail fleet as our leases come up for renewal, continued strength in our product margins from an ongoing focus on more content-led marketing and more value-engineered, high-quality and sustainable products as well as overall strong financial discipline, maintaining expense growth below sales growth.\n In summary, our record performance this year is a testament to the strength of our teams and the power of our 3 key differentiators: our in-house design, our digital-first channel strategy and our values. As we look into next year and beyond, we are optimistic about our business. And given the favorable long-term macro trends, including a strong housing market, the disruption of brick-and-mortar and an accelerating shift to e-commerce, the expected continuation of working from home in some capacity post pandemic and the increasing importance of sustainability and being a values-driven company, combined with our key differentiators, our growth initiatives, our double-digit growth in new customer counts and loyalty members, our strong operating cash flow and liquidity and a proven track record of strong financial discipline, we believe we are uniquely positioned to drive long-term growth and profitability, resulting in market share gains and strong financial returns for our shareholders.\n I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. So regarding occupancy and your questions there. So I think first of all, if you look back, you'll see that we have been holding occupancy dollar growth down for a while now, and we do expect that to continue. The important thing to remember is there's many things that go into occupancy, like depreciation from capital investments, also our distribution center rent. So there'll be ups and downs. \n But the reality is, as I said in my prepared remarks, if we're closing apparently about 25% of our fleet at least, that will lower our occupancy dollars and then potentially be offset by these other things that I just mentioned. But then you combine that with the higher sales volume, higher e-commerce volume, and all of that leverages that line. So I do expect both to have more muted dollar growth, but also the higher sales will drive that leverage going forward for the foreseeable future. \n As far as merchandise margins, yes, we do have some of the lowest levels of clearance inventory that we've had in the company. And at this point in time, we expect that to continue. But it's also the fact that we've made a decision to really pull off of site-wide promos and go after content-led relevant marketing. So instead of just doing a blanket e-mail where we give you 20% off, we're getting more and more fine-tuned about what we serve up to you to give you what you want. And if you want it, you can only get it from us. \n And that, combined with the fact that we are value engineering the product to get at the right price and the right quality and the right sustainability levels, and we'll never compromise on that, it puts us in a situation where if you want it, you got to buy it. It's a great price. So people are buying it. So that is -- we are going after that aggressively, and that's why we're so confident in merchandise margins continuing to expand going forward. I mean selling margins all year have been accelerating from an improvement standpoint and from an expansion standpoint. So again, we expect that to continue going forward. I don't have handy right now the exact amount on the year. But if you look back, you can see by quarter that they've continued to expand in this quarter, in particular, with the largest expansion. \n As far as puts and takes as to what could drive the selling margins, I mean, we've always said that the shipping costs are a part of selling margins. And so that obviously has become something that we've been focused on more recently, especially as our mix shifts to e-commerce, the more furniture we have. And there's been higher rates that have come through with our third-party shippers. But I think the combination of the fact that we can drive these merch margin expansion throughout and then you layer it with occupancy on top of it, is what's been able to give us this incredible gross margin expansion for the entire year. And so that is why we're confident going forward that will continue. \n We obviously also are working specifically on shipping costs and trying to minimize those increases as much as possible to help with the selling margins going forward in addition to the merch margins. And whether that's using more of our omni-fulfillment at our stores, which has been a huge win for us, obviously, during this time, and it's a differentiator of the fact that we have these stores as hubs around the country, to, obviously, trying to figure out ways to take these larger items and bring it into our own delivery network and lowering some of the costs with our third-party shippers. \n Now at the same time, we have great relationships with our third-party shippers. And so we're working with them to come to a great solution. But we are focused not only on offsetting shipping costs but also lowering them in an absolute sense to keep driving these selling margins to where they are. So our labor costs, as we spoke to during the year, have obviously gone up. You've heard that from many other retailers, especially the hourly rates. And so across the board, we have moved to a $14 per hour rate. So at least we were at $14 per hour, even higher, in our distribution centers, in particular, in certain areas. And so we've got a lot of that in our base. Obviously, there's always pressure, and we always look at the hourly wages on a market-by-market basis, and we want to be competitive. \n Our people have been the secret sauce, if you will, especially this year. And so we are making certain that we're taking care of them from an hourly rate perspective. But since we've made these moves in the past, we -- it's not as much of a headwind for us as it might be for others. On the flip side, I think you mentioned COVID costs. We obviously expect that there will be reduced or eliminated COVID costs, which is going to help us next year because those are fairly substantial. \n And so you've got some moving parts. Labor, you've got the annualization of these hourly wages and potentially a little more pressure on the labor line. You've got the fact that we may have some more advertising spend. But on the flip side, you've got COVID costs that are coming out. So it gives us a lot of confidence, combined with our merchandise margin expansion and our occupancy leverage and with higher sales, leveraging the entire P&L that we can drive operating margin expansion next year. Yes, this is Julie. I'll answer that question. So we expect expansion on both. It's obviously going to depend by quarter. We're not giving quarterly line item guidance. But at the end of the day, we're very confident in our merchandise margin expansion. We're very confident in our occupancy leverage. And as I just mentioned on the last question that we have the, I guess, benefit of some of these COVID costs that are going to be flipping out. And yes, we will have some increased costs, but we will be able to more than cover that as a result of the higher COVID cost that will be coming out to cover it. And so that, combined with higher sales, will allow us to leverage any of those costs that are coming through and drive operating margin expansion on the bottom line. \n And remember, a lot of the sales that we're driving now with an expectation of 70% or higher are going to be e-commerce. And e-commerce, we have historically been one of the most profitable e-commerce companies out there. And so as we shift more and more to e-commerce, that completely leverages the P&L. So that's our expectation. Yes, yes. We used to spend less than 50% basically on e-commerce spend -- e-commerce-related spend, I should say. And now we're spending about 85% or expected to this year, and we expect that will hold to be higher. So our complete shift in capital is going to e-commerce now, and that's one of the examples that we'll be spending on as well."

Also on the call with me today are Julie Whalen, our Chief Financial Officer; Felix Carbullido, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Yasir Anwar, Chief Technology Officer. \n On today's call, I want to talk to you about our outstanding third quarter results and more importantly, our company's distinctive positioning and long-term growth prospects. \n In the third quarter, sales, again, outperformed expectations with demand comp up nearly 31% compared to a net comp of 24%, driven by strength across all of our brands. E-commerce accelerated sequentially to a record net comp of over 49%, and we were pleased to see our store performance improved throughout the quarter to a net negative 11% comp. Even more encouraging is the retail demand comp at negative 4%. And we delivered these sales more profitably with operating margins reaching record levels, expanding to 15.7% versus last year's 7.6%. \n All of our brands outperformed. Pottery Barn delivered a net comp of 24.1%, driven by double-digit comps in all divisions. Growth initiatives, including PB Apartment and Marketplace, continue to build a momentum, growing more than 100% again this quarter to reach nearly $200 million in sales year-to-date. \n Our Pottery Barn Kids and Teen business grew at a net comp of 23.8% with accelerated growth in all areas. We also saw a longer tail in our back-to-school business, with our Gear and study-at-home solutions delivering a strong finish to the season. The Williams-Sonoma brand delivered another record quarter with a net comp of 30.4%. This is a business that has always had a smaller online percentage compared to our other brands, and this represents a big opportunity. \n Our initiatives in e-commerce and our real estate optimization strategies are driving our channel mix shift. We're also pleased to see our stores performing better than expected in the Williams-Sonoma brand. \n And finally, in our West Elm brand, we saw a significant pickup in net comp in Q3 to 21.8%, driven by strong growth in all major categories as well as the traditional retail-dominant categories of textiles and decorative accessories. \n As we enter the fourth quarter, holiday is off to a strong start across all of our brands. We are seeing earlier sales in holiday products than in years prior, and our teams are prepared and ready to meet this demand by moving up launch dates and marketing for our holiday merchandise. And we continue to see DTC's strength in retail improving despite reductions in store occupancy. \n Our supply chain team is also working diligently to meet this elevated demand. Despite industry-wide capacity and shipping constraints due to COVID-19, our teams are leveraging our scale and unique business model to do everything we can to ensure the best customer experience this holiday. Our global sourcing team has been partnering with our vendors to expand capacity, leveraging our in-country presence and long-standing vendor relationships. Our transportation team worked quickly and aggressively early this year to further diversify our carrier network, and we believe we have successfully secured parcel shipping capacity for the elevated volumes we expect to drive this holiday. \n We will also be maximizing our omni-channel capabilities such as ship from store and buy online, pick up in store to supplement our supply chain fulfillment capacity. We expect our omni services to fulfill up to 20% of our expected total DTC volume this holiday. These results demonstrate our company's ability to deliver long-term profitable growth post-pandemic. \n Our company's mission is to enhance the quality of people's lives at home. We have built our business with this mission at the forefront, investing in areas that matter most to our customers. These include high-quality, well-designed, sustainable products at a great value because of our scale and vertical supply chain; inspiring marketing; and the convenience of our high-touch digital-first omnichannel experience. And this, combined with our loved brands that serve a wide range of customers across aesthetics and price points, is our distinctive positioning and is our competitive advantage. No one else in the market is doing what we are doing. Our mission also extends to how we take care of our employees, our vendor partners, our customers and our shareholders. \n At Williams-Sonoma, Inc., and across our brands, we are good by design from managing resources responsibly, caring for our people and leading with our value. In a year marked by social, environmental and health crises on a scale not previously seen in our lifetime, these values are more important than ever. And we are proud to be leaders in our industry through our financial performance, our impactful ESG programs and how we have taken care of our people, while increasing returns to our shareholders. As we look at our business today, there are 3 key accomplishments that we believe will deliver significant growth for the future. \n First, we've been acquiring new customers in our digital channels at a rate of over 30% year-to-date, a significant acceleration compared to previous years. While we have seen this in the past, it generally foreshadow strong business in the future. This is particularly notable -- a particularly notable increase as stores have historically been the key driver of new customer growth. This overall increase, despite less store traffic, shows the effectiveness of our current digital marketing strategy in acquiring new customers. \n Second, and even more encouraging, is that we are attracting these customers while deliberately shifting away from promotions towards marketing that has inspiring content and it's brand building. This should mean that we have higher retention of these customers post-pandemic. \n And finally, all of our brands are resonating with younger generations. Over the last 3 years, this cohort has driven the majority of our new customer growth. And year-to-date, millennials represent nearly 50% of our sales from new customers. This, of course, has not been a coincidence as our value proposition and competitive strengths are highly appealing to younger generations who have a strong affinity for design, engaging content and accessible sustainably made products. In addition to these 3 internal positive indicators, industry trends also support our longer-term growth. These industry trends include the rapid shift to e-commerce, further industry consolidation, the generational shift to a younger customer, the importance of sustainability and consumer purchasing decisions and the increase in remote work and population mobility. \n We believe that we are one of the few retailers best positioned to take market share in the years to come. Not only is our value proposition relevant and compelling, our multiyear growth strategies and investments are working. We will continue to prioritize e-commerce growth and push the natural shift in our channel mix. We will also expand into product whitespace and aggressively support the growth of new businesses and opportunities within our brands and cross-brand. \n For example, our business-to-business opportunity. We believe that Williams-Sonoma, Inc. business-to-business will be our next $1 billion business within the next 5 years. The B2B market is large and highly fragmented with a market size of $80 billion in the U.S. alone. Our competitive advantage is that we have 8 unique brands, in-house product development capabilities and a sustainable supply chain, which allows us to simplify the customer experience for our B2B customers. Since the launch of this business in 2019, we have gained traction in all areas with average order size and repeat purchases both growing double digits, and major project wins in residential, commercial, education, health care and hospitality verticals.\n Our number of contract accounts are up 50% versus last year. We are aggressively pursuing this growth opportunity and are on track to drive over $300 million in sales this year, which represents strong double-digit growth compared to last year. \n Another key growth driver that we believe is underappreciated is our global opportunity. Our expansion to date has proven that we can grow profitably and with low capital investment, further supporting the viability of profitable growth in this business for us, and the estimated $450 billion global home furnishings market. \n To reiterate, our strategy for expansion is through a franchise model, and we look forward to growing our presence in our current markets, and our launch in India next year. \n In summary, our vision is to own the home. And with our distinctive positioning, we will only become more relevant. We have brands that serve a wide range of customers across aesthetics and price points. And unlike our competitors with undifferentiated marketplace models, we have always been different. We designed the vast majority of our products. And for those that we carry from third-party vendors, we ensure that they are high-quality, sustainable and the best value in the market. We offer service that is high-touch, both in-person and virtually because of our impactful stores and associates and our sophisticated e-commerce platform. And most importantly, the shift to e-commerce favors our business and provides a long runway to gain market share. \n We have the strategies, the team and the world-class platform to successfully execute on our growth opportunities. And we are confident that we will continue to drive accelerating sales growth with increasing profitability and evolve into an even more attractive business for our stakeholders during and post-pandemic. \n Before I turn the call over to Julie, I want to thank our team. We have been operating in this challenging environment for more than 8 months now, and our team has been an unwavering source of energy, creativity and determination. We are deeply appreciative of their remarkable performance. \n And with that, I'd like to pass the call over to Julie to discuss our financial results for Q3 and our outlook for Q4 and beyond. \nJulie Whalen: Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of record growth and profitability. It is clear our mission and value proposition are increasingly more relevant, and our growth strategies are continuing to gain traction. And this, combined with our world-class platform that we have been investing in overtime, the agility and strong execution from our team and a culture of strong financial discipline has enabled us to capture market share and expand profitably. We are so proud that our ongoing financial strength has allowed us to continue to take care of our stakeholders, our associates, our customers, our communities and our shareholders during this unprecedented time. \n Turning to the third quarter financial results. Net revenues grew 22.4% year-over-year to $1.765 billion, with net comp growth accelerating to 24.4%. This strong performance was driven by all of our brands and at a higher margin than we have seen as we have been materially shifting away from promotions. Our demand comp, which includes orders placed but not yet filled in the quarter, was again higher at almost 31% as sales continue to outpace our expectations. \n Our accelerated growth was driven by a 49.3% comp in e-commerce and a material improvement in our retail revenues. All brands sequentially improved to strong double digits this quarter. Williams-Sonoma delivered another record net comp of 30.4%. Pottery Barn accelerated to a net comp of 24.1%, the Pottery Barn Kids and Teens business grew at a net comp of 23.8%. West Elm delivered a comp of 21.8% on top of 14.1% last year. And our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham, delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth. \n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin expanded 400 basis points to 40% in the third quarter. This was driven by higher merchandise margins and occupancy leverage. Higher merchandise margins resulted from reduced promotional activity as we continue to shift to a content-led marketing strategy that focuses on the overall value creation of our high-quality, sustainable products. \n Occupancy leverage was driven by higher sales and an almost 3% or $5 million reduction in year-over-year occupancy costs, which includes the impact of reduced rent and operating costs from fewer stores. And this resulted in occupancy leverage of approximately 250 basis points at $174 million or 9.9% of revenues this year as compared to $179 million or 12.4% last year. This occupancy leverage, combined with our merchandise margin expansion, was partially offset by higher shipping costs year-over-year, driven by the substantial shift to e-commerce sales in the quarter as well as shipping surcharges from our third-party shippers. \n We were pleased to see that even with these higher shipping costs, our selling margins, which include our merchandise margins and shipping, expanded 150 basis points. And this, plus our occupancy leverage, allowed us to deliver our highest ever third quarter gross margin rate. \n SG&A leveraged 410 basis points to 24.3% of net revenues compared to 28.4% of net revenues last year. This was primarily driven by significant advertising leverage as we further optimize our digital spend on those initiatives that drove high returns in traffic and conversion, employment leverage and other leverage throughout SG&A from higher top line performance, lower variable store payroll and ongoing strong financial discipline. \n These results led to another quarter of record profitability with operating income growth of 152% to $277 million and operating margin expansion of 810 basis points to 15.7%. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $2.56, which grew 151% or more than double that of last year at $1.02. We are proud to achieve these levels of profitability, while continuing to take care of our associates with heightened safety protocols, such as personal protective equipment, frequent cleaning and COVID testing as well as higher employment costs from providing pandemic bonuses for our store associates and increased hourly wages for our distribution center associates. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a strong cash balance of $773 million compared to $155 million last year. This reflects the strength of our cash balance as we entered 2020 as well as the resilience of our business during this pandemic, generating positive operating cash flow of almost $727 million year-to-date. Our strong liquidity position allowed us to fund the operations of the business to invest nearly $125 million in capital expenditures in support of our future growth, and to return nearly $117 million in the form of continued quarterly dividend payments to our shareholders. Additionally, this quarter, as previously announced, we also repaid in full our short-term borrowings under our $500 million revolver, reinstated our share repurchase program, repurchasing $109 million this quarter alone, and we also committed to a quarterly dividend increase of 10% effective with our next dividend payment in the fourth quarter. \n These decisions reflect our confidence in the long-term growth and profitability trajectory of our business, and our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders. \n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $1.125 billion for a decrease of 10.6% year-over-year versus a 12.2% decline in the second quarter. As Laura said, we have been working closely with our vendor partners to manage through the COVID disruptions and to expand capacity. But given the ongoing elevated demand in our high back orders, we do not expect to be fully back in stock until the second quarter of next year. What this means is that we have 700 basis points of demand sales from Q3 that we expect to fill in future quarters when the inventory is available and delivered to the customer. We are pleased that our customers have continued to want their orders delivered even if they have slight delays. \n Turning to our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. It is clear from the latest surge in COVID infection rates across the country and globally that there is still, unfortunately, significant uncertainty related to this pandemic. As a result, we will not be providing specific sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2020. But directionally, I can tell you our business continues to be strong across all brands 3 weeks into the fourth quarter. The momentum in our business is continuing. \n From a gross margin perspective, with lower levels of planned promotions, we expect merchandise margins to continue to expand year-over-year. We also expect occupancy leverage to continue, driven by the cost savings from the leases that we have already renegotiated year-to-date as well as the closure of unprofitable stores and final rent abatement negotiations. This will be partially offset by higher shipping costs that will continue to be a headwind in Q4 given the anticipated elevated levels of e-commerce sales and peak surcharges that will come into effect during the holiday peak selling season. \n In terms of SG&A, we expect to incur incremental costs associated with keeping our people and customers safe during the pandemic as well as additional supply chain employment costs. At the same time, we will continue to exercise strong cost discipline in all areas of nonessential spend to ensure that we can remain resilient during this period of uncertainty. As a result, on the year, we remain confident in our ability to drive substantial operating margin expansion versus last year due to our strong performance to date and the likely continuation of robust e-commerce trends through the balance of the year. \n With regards to capital allocation, in addition to the increased quarterly dividend and reinstated share buyback program, we have increased our capital investments in high-returning initiatives that focus on digital to drive our long-term growth. We expect our total CapEx this year to be back relatively in line with historical levels. \n As far as our longer-term outlook, we remain confident in our ability to drive strong top line results, while continuing to deliver operating margin expansion. It was clear pre-pandemic that our strategies for growth were working with accelerated comps through 2019 and an almost 10% comp heading into March before the pandemic accelerated. And these successful growth strategies, combined with our strong new customer count and growing loyalty customer base, the fundamental shift of business online as well as our leadership in sustainability, which has become increasingly more important to the consumer, reinforces our ability to continue to drive strong top line growth post-pandemic, and we expect to deliver this growth with further operating margin expansion. \n As you know, we have a highly profitable e-commerce business with an operating margin that, over the last 10 years alone, has averaged over 21%. Unlike many retailers who are still in the process of scaling their online business, we have already made the significant investments in our e-commerce platform over many years, which enables us to drive significant leverage throughout as we further scale our e-commerce business. This is a significant competitive advantage that speaks to the earnings power of our digital-first model. \n As we continue to prioritize e-commerce growth and structurally shift the channel mix of our business, we will drive material occupancy leverage as we renegotiate more favorable leases and close unprofitable stores. We have half of our leases coming up for renewal in the next 3 years, and we'll be looking at each lease and keep only those stores where the economics of the deal makes sense and where they are brand enhancing. Our plan, currently, is to close approximately 40 stores this year. Stores continue to be a competitive advantage as people like to see merchandise in-person. \n However, we are anticipating a future with fewer, better, more profitable stores. We are also planning for merchandise margin expansion by not only continuing to deliver more relevant content-led marketing, but by also building more value into our product line, which will enable us to be less promotional. Our strong product line and loved brands gives us pricing power that others don't have because their products are undifferentiated. This is very important as we expect costs globally to increase over the next several years. \n Another important driver of long-term operating margin expansion is SG&A leverage. And while there may be some increases in some lines, our shift to digital gives us confidence that we will be able to leverage throughout SG&A and to deliver operating margin expansion post-pandemic. \n In summary, our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our distinctive position and driving strong profitable growth. Customers come to us for our in-house design products that are high quality, sustainably made and have the best value in the market. They come to us for our brands that serve a wide range of aesthetics and price points. They come to us for our inspiring content that is engaging and speaks to their needs. And they come to us for the convenience that we offer with our omnichannel model. \n These competitive advantages, combined with our long-term growth strategies and proven execution, give us the confidence that we'll continue to drive long-term strong sales and earnings growth and further returns for our shareholders, both this year and post-pandemic. \n And now I would also like to thank our associates. Without their unwavering commitment to all our stakeholders, none of this would be possible. \n I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to Oliver Wintermantel, Evercore ISI. \nOliver Wintermantel: Congratulations on this -- performance this quarter, again. I had a question, Julie, you mentioned shipping costs are staying high because of the shift to e-commerce, but then also for the rates of shippers. Do you expect that to actually increase in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? And how do you plan to offset that? \nJulie Whalen: We do because there's peak charges that come in -- surcharges that come in during the holiday selling season. But what I will say is that our supply team has done an unbelievable job of coming up with alternative carriers that we can use to help take care of the capacity constraints we have as well as the higher prices. And so it won't be a full offset, but they certainly are doing everything they can to help mitigate it. And then, of course, along with the merchandise margin expansion, the occupancy leverage, we should still see gross margin expansion regardless of the shipping costs. \nOliver Wintermantel: Got it. And in relation to that, if I may. Your COGS shipments from Asia, and I know you brought some of the production back into the U.S. Could you maybe update us how much of your sales are now coming from -- or for your COGS are coming from Asia? And how much is produced in the U.S.? \nJulie Whalen: I don't think we've ever disclosed that. I think what we've said in the past is that we've been moving goods out of China to other locations, other Southeast Asian locations. And so our goal was to get the amount that we had produced in China down by about 50% by the end of this year, and we're still on target to do that. \nOperator: Next up is Kate McShane, Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: A big question last quarter was the difference between the demand comp and the comp that you reported. And just what the demand comp would look like over time? Or what it could contribute to comp over time? So now that we are a quarter in here, I wondered if there was a way to quantify what the gap or what the demand comp, what part of it was made up, if you will, during the third quarter? Was it a big contributor to the acceleration in the comp that you saw from Q2 to Q3? And if not, just what was the unlock for the meaningful acceleration in your comp in Q3 versus Q2? \nJulie Whalen: The comp is driven by the strength across all brands. I mean the products are selling. Our performance is on fire from that perspective. When you look back to the last quarter, we had about -- I think it's an 800 basis point differential between demand and net. In this quarter, 700. So as products come in, as long as we're accelerating our performance on the top line, it's going to be a little bit of a leapfrog as we go through by each quarter. The teams have been working very aggressively on partnership with our vendors, and we have great relationships with our vendors to get back in stock as quickly as possible. But obviously, given this incredible demand that we're seeing from our customers, it's going to take a little while longer than we expected, mostly into Q2 of next year. But we haven't seen -- the customer has been \n [Audio Gap] \n we let them know of these delays. And so that's the great news that we expect this delta between demand and net to effectively come in the future quarters. \nKatharine McShane: My follow-up question to that is, is there a potential for furniture mix to be higher in Q4? Just again, with some of these delays in the order as things get pulled or pushed back, could you see more furniture mix in Q4? And would that be any kind of headwind in addition to maybe the higher surcharges you would see in the fourth quarter? \nLaura Alber: It's not a -- this is Laura. Usually, when we're talking demand comp in Q4, the nonfurniture, as a percent of total, comes up a bit as we do more gifting, and we have more Williams-Sonoma. However, you're right that we have a lot of net new furniture coming in, and hopefully, we'll fill a bunch of that. So it should not affect -- it shouldn't be a headwind. Furniture is a very profitable and great business for us. And we are just thrilled to be able to serve our customers and get the product in for them. And it doesn't matter what quarter that is. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Chuck Grom, Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Great quarter here. My question is on the margins and the outlook and the opportunity. You've got really 3 big buckets, reduced promotions, lower occupancy dollars and more efficient ad spend. So when you think ahead, and this isn't really about fourth quarter, but really more in the next couple of years. How would you rank those opportunities? What has you most excited? What categories do you think you have the most visibility on? \nJulie Whalen: Well, I mean, quite honestly, I think it's across the board. I mean the most -- the thing that we're excited about is this fundamental shift in our business going online, and I think that's a trend that's across the industry. And so as that shifts to e-commerce, and you combine that with the fact that we have many new customers in e-commerce, those 2 combined is going to allow our e-commerce business to thrive. And as that continues to happen, again, if you go back and look at our op margins from the last 10 years, they've averaged above 21%. So just that alone will drive significant op margin expansion going forward. \n Then you layer in the fact that we are feeling very good about our merchandise margins and our ability to pull back on promotions with our content-led marketing strategy, and we expect that to continue. If you layer on the occupancy leverage that we're going to have from all these leases that we're renegotiating, they're coming up for renewal over the next 3 years and the stores that we may close if they're unprofitable, or we're going to keep the great ones and make sure that they have the profitability levels that we want, which we've set a higher bar. And so occupancy leverage will continue. And then, again, with that shift to e-commerce, the rest of the SG&A just leverages beautifully. So we think it's a huge opportunity going forward to be able to drive this business profitably. And the inflection point is the fact that we've shifted significantly to e-commerce, and we don't think that's going to change. \nCharles Grom: That's helpful. And then just maybe -- I just do 1 quick follow-up. One of the pushbacks on the story is just the sustainability of some of the trends that you're seeing today. So I guess I'm curious how you'd rank them in order of staying power over the next couple of years, the trends that are driving the strong demand you're seeing? \nLaura Alber: Sure. This is Laura. I want to remind everybody that pre-pandemic, we were running close to a 10% comp. And we saw great opportunity in our business, and we're very bullish actually about what we had in front of us. And so we've benefited clearly from the stay-at-home trend. But the bigger even pre-pandemic trends that were in our favor with industry consolidation away from brick-and-mortar. Previous to the pandemic, 80% was done in retail stores, and we knew that wasn't going to stay the same. \n And so as people shift to online and younger customers have a lot more purchasing power, we knew that we would be one of the people who would pick up that big market share. And then as I keep saying, we have such a competitive advantage with our distinctive positioning. There's a lot of people online, but we serve a wide variety of customers across esthetics and price points. And our brands, as you know, are loved by our consumers, and we design our own products. And that's a big difference between us and a lot of other big players who will also, by the way, be successful. \n It's not an either/or, but people are going to come to us because we have unique products that are accessible and that are sustainable and that are designed in-house and you can't buy elsewhere. And that is very powerful as our values really resonate with the consumers and the future consumers to be. \n So we're very optimistic about consumers shopping with us. And then, of course, from a financial profile, we've talked about the pieces of our business that are leverageable and that are real and substantive. And we've been investing in e-commerce for so long that our platform is able to hold a lot more volume without these huge step-up investments that other retailers who've had only 10% to 20%, took time to invest. So we fully see ourselves in the digital-first business with great stores, more profitable stores than ever. We see us 70%, upwards to 70% e-commerce, and that is big time for the financial profile of our company. Just -- those are the things I'm excited about. \nOperator: Next from Morgan Stanley is Simeon Gutman. \nSimeon Gutman: Nice quarter. Laura, and I'll ask this in 2 parts. First, can you -- you talked about acquiring customers, and that should help you going forward. Can you talk about what you're learning now from an operating perspective, whether it's inventory management, maybe markdown management, movement of product that makes you stronger post-pandemic? And then, Julie, you mentioned, I think, the demand versus actual comp but narrowed by 1 point. Should we look at that, first of all, as a just a nonevent? Or does this mean that the supply chain is catching up or the demand is slow to tick? \nLaura Alber: What was the last thing you said? Demand has slowed, or what did you say? \nSimeon Gutman: So with the spread between the actual comp and the demand comp. If it narrowed by 1 point, it could just be a nonevent. But let's say, if we see that narrow by a few points going forward, can you attribute it more to the supply chain catching up to the demand? Or does that mean the demand slows a little? \nLaura Alber: Okay. I understand you now. Thank you. Okay. So it's always the toughest times that make you strongest, I think. And you have to really go back and look at what you're going to invest in. And what we've been doing is investing in the things that matter most to our customers and realizing the power of the people. You take care of your people and they do amazing things for you. And that's -- it's an operating principle that we know. But it's been really brought home through this, and we made those decisions early on to keep paying our people, not furlough them. And we made that decision. \n I've never seen anything as powerful as that decision for our store associates. And you go into our stores now, and there's so -- there's -- it's such a different experience than so many other places in the malls because of that relationship with them and how close we are with supporting each other. \n In terms of inventory management, we -- look, who would have called what's going to happen when it first came down. And I'm just impressed with the flexibility of the team in chasing products and getting us back in stock. And also, what we're doing now is just trying to quote the customer the best date we can the first time. So they see the delay in the beginning and it doesn't push out again. There's a big difference between if I know I'm waiting a certain amount of time for a sofa and if you push it out over and over. It's very different in how you feel about that delivering whether you, as a customer, considered on time. So we're building those delays as much as we can into our quote times now. \n I'll just, since I'm talking, take the last question. To me, the net comp has always been something we look at. It's -- we have never seen this kind of big gap between them. And that was because we had the slowed -- the stores closed and then this huge spike and inventory low. And of course, that's what happens the first time and you catch up. As we continue to accelerate sales, you can continue to see this longer because you have to build the inventory back to be in better stock. So demand could go -- net coming in certainly may cut the amount. But this will -- this is a thing that will, on the P&L, be a benefit to the future, as much as we hate it. We'd rather have it in stock for the customer. That's the way we're trying to operate the business, and that's what we're going to go for when we get the inventory back in stock. But it will give us more sales in the future because the net will come in on the previously very high demand. Thanks for the questions. \nOperator: Next up is Brian Nagel, Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: First off, congrats on a really nice quarter. Nice work. So the question I want to ask, look, with regard to the gross margin expansion, you talked about the shift in marketing to more of a content strategy away from promotions. So I mean just a couple of questions within that. One is, is there a way to kind of size the benefit of that to margins here in the quarter? \n And then more strategically, clearly here, while demand was accelerating pre-pandemic, demand has turned even better here for the Williams-Sonoma family of companies through the crisis. Are you confident that the strategy of -- this content-driven strategy will yield the same type of results as demand trends potentially normalize back to what they may have been pre-pandemic? \nLaura Alber: I have Felix on the phone. Let me start the question, and then I'll pass it over to Felix. We're -- if anything, we've learned that we have to be the most adaptable to our current situation. I think when something like this pandemic takes you off your feet, you try new things, and we really decided that we -- people needed relevancy. They needed content that was inspiring. We're all busy staring at the screen. And that's much more exciting to hear about new things to cook at home with your family than it is to hear about the next 20% offer. And so we are always testing new things. We may find something else that's even better next year. But we're using our multiple brands to test different things in different brands and then roll them out. And so we don't take a huge risk with any given strategy. \n And so we've been -- at the same time, as we've been pulling down our promotions, we have been also really working on our value. So if you go back to scripts in the past, you'll hear me talking about value, everyday value as a key part of our strategy, opening price point in Pottery Barn. That Pottery Barn apartment strategy is exactly that, to make sure that we're getting the new customers in. And of course, West Elm is a growing brand. \n So we're going to continue to push value. It's not about price increases, it's about less promotions, less markdown inventory. We've now cleared the markdown substantially from where they were a year ago. Julie, do you want -- can we give him that number? You want to go ahead with that? \nJulie Whalen: It's down 37%. \nLaura Alber: Our clearance inventory. \nJulie Whalen: Clearance inventory. \nLaura Alber: Yes. And Felix, do you want to add anything to this? \nFelix Carbullido: Yes. Sure. I think it's a great question. So a couple of proof points when we look at the business is, in terms of -- is the content-led messaging cutting through. I look at the growth in our active 12-month customers. I see growth in customers who we haven't seen in over a year and that have returned to make a purchase. And our continued double-digit growth in new customers. So we like to see growth amongst all 3 cohorts. And then in terms of what it means for the future growth, the new -- the trends in new customers are incredibly encouraging. Number we really haven't seen before. \n And I'm talking about higher retention rates for new customers and higher rates of cross-brand purchasing. So we believe those are strong indicators of their value over time. So those are some of the proof points I look at when is the message resonating. \nOperator: Our next question is Brad Thomas, KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nBradley Thomas: Let me add my congratulations on some great results here. I was hoping to follow-up on the topic of margins, and it does seem that there are some structural changes that support this breakout to new record highs for margins and a number of drivers for you going forward. I was hoping we could just talk maybe about some of the other side of the ledger here as we -- to keep us from maybe getting too far ahead of ourselves. Could you help us think about some of the dynamics like the record low clearance activity you're seeing, some of the increases in raw materials and transportation and labor costs? And maybe how we might think about factoring those in as we fine-tune our models for 2021? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I think -- I mean, as we've said before, we still expect to have strong gross margins regardless of some of those headwinds that you've laid out. Obviously, the team has been very aggressive at working through that and thinking through what those costs could be like. But obviously, because we design and engineer our product, that gives us a price point strength that we can then create the right price for any of those headwinds in the raw materials or transportation that you spoke to. \n Transportation, we do think, will continue to be a headwind. But as I mentioned earlier, the supply chain team has done a phenomenal job, sort of navigating through this. They acted quickly, aggressively to come up with alternative carriers. And so we're managing through that to see how we can mitigate the cost on that go forward. So even with those, again, the substantial tailwind we get by shifting to e-commerce and the flow-through that, that provides, as you've seen, to your point, in this quarter, we think that's going to be very helpful, along with the merchandise margins, along with the occupancy leverage to be able to drive significant op margin expansion going forward. \nOperator: Adrienne Yih from Barclays is up next. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: I will add my congratulations. Laura, I wanted to -- very well done, and the promotions, the content-led marketing is actually really coming through. It's very obvious. So kudos on that. But Laura, I wanted to ask you, as we go into -- kind of the big question of next year is how do you comp the comp? A lot of it comes from sort of new customers, new product lines, or customers -- same customers buying more of products. So one of the ones that really interested me here was your B2B comment. What is the size of that now? \n Can you give us some of the metrics of I mean -- and forgive me if I'm ignorant on this, but is it a wholesale transaction? Is it a discounted retail price point, but give us some metrics on that and how we see that unfolding over time? \n And then, Julie, on the long-term target, the mid- to high-single-digit top line, how should we think about that in EPS? And if I may, one last one. 70% e-commerce, stores will open again next year. So should we still think about that penetration as being 70%? And the ROIC aspect of it when you move to e-commerce truly is improving the cash flow. So I totally agree in that regard. \nLaura Alber: Great. Thank you for the question on B2B. So we decided for the first time to give you guys the number. So I think you probably might have missed it in the script, we're going to be over $300 million this year. And so it's been sizable. And we really are continuing to see even stronger strength. We passed our first $100 million milestone in a single quarter for the first time. And our growth was really driven by, in B2B, our internal program improvements and execution on our key strategies with a continued push to diversify our business pipeline across various industry verticals. And we're acquiring new customers. Average order size is improving at double-digit rate, and we're also seeing consistent build in sales volume each month. \n In terms of strategic initiatives, we're aggressively expanding our contract deployment. So really converting our products to be contract grade. And to build brand awareness, we have transitioned to a virtual digital marketing and engagement platform. And for example, this is fun, we partnered with Interior Design Magazine this quarter to take part in a series of live interviews as well as an Instagram takeover featuring all of our brands. We're also expanding our B2B offering with Contract in virtual events such as cooking classes, which have been sell-out for us. We are charging for these virtual events, very interesting business opportunity that we're thinking about in a big way for the future. So industry -- the industry, believe it or not, continues to show positive signs for recovery, and we're seeing the Marriott pipeline continue. And there is a lot of -- the hotel occupancy rates, believe it or not, are rebounding from the industry lows. And the renovations were heavily impacted from COVID and then I'm moving forward again. \n So we're seeing good internal indicators that the pipeline is only going to get stronger, and we've built the foundation so that we can handle these big orders. It's depending on what it is. It's a discount on retail, how big it is, and that's how we run it. So -- and as I mentioned earlier, usually, people have to go to 10 different suppliers to furnish these hotels or these projects, and they can just come to us and we can do the whole thing. And we can do -- made-to-size made-to-order products for them as well, which a lot of people can't do. \n So that's, I think -- in addition to our great sales team, I think that's why we're winning. So I'll hand it over to Julie on the comps for the future and what that means for EPS, although we're not giving you that. But I'm going to let her comment about that. \nJulie Whalen: Yes. So we haven't disclosed that. But I think, obviously, you can translate, from a mathematical perspective, if you make your assumptions as to where it will fall. On the revenue side, clearly, we're leaning towards the higher end of that. And what kind of operating margin expansion could occur when you factor in the shift to e-commerce and you factor in the merch margin expansion and you also factor in the occupancy leverage continuing. And then clearly, I mean, it's kind of a nonanswer here, but it's -- let you do the math and you can come up with EPS. The bottom line is we expect strong growth in EPS. There's no reason from a translation from the op margin down to EPS at this time, that there would be any sort of reason that would cause it to be disconnected. If anything, interest expense would probably be coming down next year, since we would be in the line and things like that. So, sorry, it's kind of a nonanswer, but hopefully it helps. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Anthony Chukumba, Loop Capital Markets. \nAnthony Chukumba: I just had a quick question. So Julie, you mentioned fourth quarter surcharges for deliveries. And I know that's a seasonal thing, but I just want to make sure I understand. Is that -- are you seeing higher surcharges than you normally would in the fourth quarter? Or are you just sort of mentioning there are these surcharges you need to be aware of from a shipping cost perspective? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. No, it definitely will be higher. I think -- I'm sure people saw the EPS release, I think it was last quarter, where they indicated that for all retailers, they're passing along the cost. So we're not alone. But I think the difference is, as I say over and over, our phenomenal supply chain team has really done a great job. They've acted quickly and aggressively. And as you know, that's sort of our company culture. And so we moved on it immediately to be able to try to mitigate that as best we can, both from a capacity standpoint and from a pricing standpoint, and they have done a phenomenal job, coupled with the tech team to make it all possible. And so it doesn't mean we're not going to have these incremental costs or surcharges. But certainly, compared to others, we're going to be in a much better spot. So... \nLaura Alber: And UPS is a great partner of ours, and they've been a good partner. But the truth is there's a lot more cost with COVID in the supply chain. \nOperator: Our next question is Steven Forbes, Guggenheim Securities. \nSteven Forbes: I wanted to follow-up on the customer cohorts, right, and maybe specifically focus on the active 12-month customer base. I'm really just curious if you can expand on how that cohort has engaged with the portfolio of brands during 2020, right, maybe relative to '19? Any context there? And whether you have seen any change in behavior, right? Whether it's opting out or any sort of behavioral change, right, as the business has migrated, right, more towards this content-led and less promotional activity, right? As we think about your conviction behind ongoing growth and market share gains. \nLaura Alber: I'm going to let Felix take that. \nFelix Carbullido: Yes. Sure. Thank you for the question. I guess I'll start with -- it's a record high number of active customers. So -- and that's driven both by the existing customer base and new customers coming in, especially in the D2C channel. So I look at that number and I say, \"okay, well, the message that we're giving is clearly resonating.\" I think about e-mail metrics, including engagement, open rates. I look at our social engagement, those are record high numbers that we've seen. So the message is clearly cutting through. In terms of the makeup of the customers, I mean, Laura mentioned, we're starting to see more millennials into our customer base at a greater rate than we ever have before. And that -- as we all know, that's a huge generation. It's the biggest generation we've seen in our lifetime. So that gives us promise for all of 2021 and further on getting those customers now as they move into household formation. \n And then I think, lastly, the majority of our customers, our new customers are now members of The Key, our cross-brand loyalty program. So we've seen Key members have higher repeat rates and higher retention rates than non-Key members. So all of that means our active customer base is well suited for growth for next year. Did that answer your question? \nSteven Forbes: Yes, it did. And I don't know -- I don't think we've got an update on The Key members in some time, and given that you mentioned. Is that something you can provide today as well? \nFelix Carbullido: Sure. Yes, we have over 11 million members, and as I mentioned, most of our new customers are now enrolled. And The Key, which is our loyalty program, as you know, it's a very cost-efficient way for us to drive incremental sales. And I'm proud to say that year-to-date, we now have more cross-brand customers than we ever had in our company. So that we know is an incremental opportunity for all of us. And clearly, much more efficient way to drive sales with existing customers than acquiring new ones. So again, gives us confidence in advertising efficiency going forward. \nOperator: Our next question is Marni Shapiro, Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Congratulations. So I'm going to move on past COVID. I'm tired are talking about it to the post-COVID world. Laura, you've talked a lot about your point of differentiation and your brands and everything that you guys do internally. You've also, for quite some time now, focused your company on sustainability and organic products. And things that, I think, millennials and Gen Z are very interested in. So can you think, in 2021 as everybody has discovered that home is a great business, how do you think about marketing sustainability and this part of the business to keep your positioning and kind of even better position you guys for the future? \nLaura Alber: Thank you so much for the question. It's so important to us, and we will continue to pursue sustainability programs that are strategic and material to our business and important to our customers. We're going to lead here. We're going to lead in ethical production, we're going to lead in worker well-being, and we'll build out our environmental commitments. We put out our report in October. And for next year, we're going to -- for climate and energy. We're going to build on this year's Scope 3 footprint and CDP disclosure to develop and set a science-based target for reduction. And responsibly materials and finishes, we're going to continue our leadership in Cottonwood and GreenGuard. And we're going to expand our commitments around lower-impact alternatives like recycled polyester. And in waste and circularity, we're going to build off of our scale and our successful circular pilots. \n And across all these ESG areas, we'll continue to disclose and measure and track our progress. For example, this year, in our corporate responsibility report, we made public our commitment to diversity inclusion with our equity action plan and our first-ever data on gender and ethnicity representation. We are committed to our mantra of good by design, and our pillars are people, planet and purpose. \nOperator: Next up is Seth Basham, Wedbush. \nSeth Basham: Congrats as well. My question is really a clarifying one. Julie, I think you mentioned that you expect operating margin expansion post-pandemic. Should we take that to mean after we get a virus, you still expect operating margins to rise from whatever trailing 12-month level they're at for the next 12 months? And after we get a vaccine, I should say? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. We do expect ongoing operating margin expansion because our expectation is that top line is going to continue to thrive, especially in e-commerce, as I mentioned. And all the things that we're doing from a margin expansion perspective and occupancy leverage, all of that will continue. And so we do expect it to expand above where we're landing on this year. \nSeth Basham: Fantastic. And then secondly, as we just think about some of the shipping dynamics one more time, what are you doing in terms of shipping fees that you're charging customers to mitigate some of the higher costs that you're incurring? \nLaura Alber: We haven't changed our model. It's the same shipping model that we have. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. I'd like to hand the conference back to Laura for any additional or closing remarks. \nLaura Alber: Sure. Thank you all for joining us today, and I really, sincerely wish you a wonderful and safe Thanksgiving with your friends or probably just your family, but maybe your friends, if I assume. So we'll be talking to you soon and look forward to it. \nOperator: Once again, everyone, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thanks, Elise. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Julie Whalen, our Chief Financial Officer; Felix Carbullido, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Yasir Anwar, Chief Technology Officer. \n On today's call, I want to talk to you about our outstanding third quarter results and more importantly, our company's distinctive positioning and long-term growth prospects. \n In the third quarter, sales, again, outperformed expectations with demand comp up nearly 31% compared to a net comp of 24%, driven by strength across all of our brands. E-commerce accelerated sequentially to a record net comp of over 49%, and we were pleased to see our store performance improved throughout the quarter to a net negative 11% comp. Even more encouraging is the retail demand comp at negative 4%. And we delivered these sales more profitably with operating margins reaching record levels, expanding to 15.7% versus last year's 7.6%. \n All of our brands outperformed. Pottery Barn delivered a net comp of 24.1%, driven by double-digit comps in all divisions. Growth initiatives, including PB Apartment and Marketplace, continue to build a momentum, growing more than 100% again this quarter to reach nearly $200 million in sales year-to-date. \n Our Pottery Barn Kids and Teen business grew at a net comp of 23.8% with accelerated growth in all areas. We also saw a longer tail in our back-to-school business, with our Gear and study-at-home solutions delivering a strong finish to the season. The Williams-Sonoma brand delivered another record quarter with a net comp of 30.4%. This is a business that has always had a smaller online percentage compared to our other brands, and this represents a big opportunity. \n Our initiatives in e-commerce and our real estate optimization strategies are driving our channel mix shift. We're also pleased to see our stores performing better than expected in the Williams-Sonoma brand. \n And finally, in our West Elm brand, we saw a significant pickup in net comp in Q3 to 21.8%, driven by strong growth in all major categories as well as the traditional retail-dominant categories of textiles and decorative accessories. \n As we enter the fourth quarter, holiday is off to a strong start across all of our brands. We are seeing earlier sales in holiday products than in years prior, and our teams are prepared and ready to meet this demand by moving up launch dates and marketing for our holiday merchandise. And we continue to see DTC's strength in retail improving despite reductions in store occupancy. \n Our supply chain team is also working diligently to meet this elevated demand. Despite industry-wide capacity and shipping constraints due to COVID-19, our teams are leveraging our scale and unique business model to do everything we can to ensure the best customer experience this holiday. Our global sourcing team has been partnering with our vendors to expand capacity, leveraging our in-country presence and long-standing vendor relationships. Our transportation team worked quickly and aggressively early this year to further diversify our carrier network, and we believe we have successfully secured parcel shipping capacity for the elevated volumes we expect to drive this holiday. \n We will also be maximizing our omni-channel capabilities such as ship from store and buy online, pick up in store to supplement our supply chain fulfillment capacity. We expect our omni services to fulfill up to 20% of our expected total DTC volume this holiday. These results demonstrate our company's ability to deliver long-term profitable growth post-pandemic. \n Our company's mission is to enhance the quality of people's lives at home. We have built our business with this mission at the forefront, investing in areas that matter most to our customers. These include high-quality, well-designed, sustainable products at a great value because of our scale and vertical supply chain; inspiring marketing; and the convenience of our high-touch digital-first omnichannel experience. And this, combined with our loved brands that serve a wide range of customers across aesthetics and price points, is our distinctive positioning and is our competitive advantage. No one else in the market is doing what we are doing. Our mission also extends to how we take care of our employees, our vendor partners, our customers and our shareholders. \n At Williams-Sonoma, Inc., and across our brands, we are good by design from managing resources responsibly, caring for our people and leading with our value. In a year marked by social, environmental and health crises on a scale not previously seen in our lifetime, these values are more important than ever. And we are proud to be leaders in our industry through our financial performance, our impactful ESG programs and how we have taken care of our people, while increasing returns to our shareholders. As we look at our business today, there are 3 key accomplishments that we believe will deliver significant growth for the future. \n First, we've been acquiring new customers in our digital channels at a rate of over 30% year-to-date, a significant acceleration compared to previous years. While we have seen this in the past, it generally foreshadow strong business in the future. This is particularly notable -- a particularly notable increase as stores have historically been the key driver of new customer growth. This overall increase, despite less store traffic, shows the effectiveness of our current digital marketing strategy in acquiring new customers. \n Second, and even more encouraging, is that we are attracting these customers while deliberately shifting away from promotions towards marketing that has inspiring content and it's brand building. This should mean that we have higher retention of these customers post-pandemic. \n And finally, all of our brands are resonating with younger generations. Over the last 3 years, this cohort has driven the majority of our new customer growth. And year-to-date, millennials represent nearly 50% of our sales from new customers. This, of course, has not been a coincidence as our value proposition and competitive strengths are highly appealing to younger generations who have a strong affinity for design, engaging content and accessible sustainably made products. In addition to these 3 internal positive indicators, industry trends also support our longer-term growth. These industry trends include the rapid shift to e-commerce, further industry consolidation, the generational shift to a younger customer, the importance of sustainability and consumer purchasing decisions and the increase in remote work and population mobility. \n We believe that we are one of the few retailers best positioned to take market share in the years to come. Not only is our value proposition relevant and compelling, our multiyear growth strategies and investments are working. We will continue to prioritize e-commerce growth and push the natural shift in our channel mix. We will also expand into product whitespace and aggressively support the growth of new businesses and opportunities within our brands and cross-brand. \n For example, our business-to-business opportunity. We believe that Williams-Sonoma, Inc. business-to-business will be our next $1 billion business within the next 5 years. The B2B market is large and highly fragmented with a market size of $80 billion in the U.S. alone. Our competitive advantage is that we have 8 unique brands, in-house product development capabilities and a sustainable supply chain, which allows us to simplify the customer experience for our B2B customers. Since the launch of this business in 2019, we have gained traction in all areas with average order size and repeat purchases both growing double digits, and major project wins in residential, commercial, education, health care and hospitality verticals.\n Our number of contract accounts are up 50% versus last year. We are aggressively pursuing this growth opportunity and are on track to drive over $300 million in sales this year, which represents strong double-digit growth compared to last year. \n Another key growth driver that we believe is underappreciated is our global opportunity. Our expansion to date has proven that we can grow profitably and with low capital investment, further supporting the viability of profitable growth in this business for us, and the estimated $450 billion global home furnishings market. \n To reiterate, our strategy for expansion is through a franchise model, and we look forward to growing our presence in our current markets, and our launch in India next year. \n In summary, our vision is to own the home. And with our distinctive positioning, we will only become more relevant. We have brands that serve a wide range of customers across aesthetics and price points. And unlike our competitors with undifferentiated marketplace models, we have always been different. We designed the vast majority of our products. And for those that we carry from third-party vendors, we ensure that they are high-quality, sustainable and the best value in the market. We offer service that is high-touch, both in-person and virtually because of our impactful stores and associates and our sophisticated e-commerce platform. And most importantly, the shift to e-commerce favors our business and provides a long runway to gain market share. \n We have the strategies, the team and the world-class platform to successfully execute on our growth opportunities. And we are confident that we will continue to drive accelerating sales growth with increasing profitability and evolve into an even more attractive business for our stakeholders during and post-pandemic. \n Before I turn the call over to Julie, I want to thank our team. We have been operating in this challenging environment for more than 8 months now, and our team has been an unwavering source of energy, creativity and determination. We are deeply appreciative of their remarkable performance. \n And with that, I'd like to pass the call over to Julie to discuss our financial results for Q3 and our outlook for Q4 and beyond. It's not a -- this is Laura. Usually, when we're talking demand comp in Q4, the nonfurniture, as a percent of total, comes up a bit as we do more gifting, and we have more Williams-Sonoma. However, you're right that we have a lot of net new furniture coming in, and hopefully, we'll fill a bunch of that. So it should not affect -- it shouldn't be a headwind. Furniture is a very profitable and great business for us. And we are just thrilled to be able to serve our customers and get the product in for them. And it doesn't matter what quarter that is. Sure. This is Laura. I want to remind everybody that pre-pandemic, we were running close to a 10% comp. And we saw great opportunity in our business, and we're very bullish actually about what we had in front of us. And so we've benefited clearly from the stay-at-home trend. But the bigger even pre-pandemic trends that were in our favor with industry consolidation away from brick-and-mortar. Previous to the pandemic, 80% was done in retail stores, and we knew that wasn't going to stay the same. \n And so as people shift to online and younger customers have a lot more purchasing power, we knew that we would be one of the people who would pick up that big market share. And then as I keep saying, we have such a competitive advantage with our distinctive positioning. There's a lot of people online, but we serve a wide variety of customers across esthetics and price points. And our brands, as you know, are loved by our consumers, and we design our own products. And that's a big difference between us and a lot of other big players who will also, by the way, be successful. \n It's not an either/or, but people are going to come to us because we have unique products that are accessible and that are sustainable and that are designed in-house and you can't buy elsewhere. And that is very powerful as our values really resonate with the consumers and the future consumers to be. \n So we're very optimistic about consumers shopping with us. And then, of course, from a financial profile, we've talked about the pieces of our business that are leverageable and that are real and substantive. And we've been investing in e-commerce for so long that our platform is able to hold a lot more volume without these huge step-up investments that other retailers who've had only 10% to 20%, took time to invest. So we fully see ourselves in the digital-first business with great stores, more profitable stores than ever. We see us 70%, upwards to 70% e-commerce, and that is big time for the financial profile of our company. Just -- those are the things I'm excited about. What was the last thing you said? Demand has slowed, or what did you say? Okay. I understand you now. Thank you. Okay. So it's always the toughest times that make you strongest, I think. And you have to really go back and look at what you're going to invest in. And what we've been doing is investing in the things that matter most to our customers and realizing the power of the people. You take care of your people and they do amazing things for you. And that's -- it's an operating principle that we know. But it's been really brought home through this, and we made those decisions early on to keep paying our people, not furlough them. And we made that decision. \n I've never seen anything as powerful as that decision for our store associates. And you go into our stores now, and there's so -- there's -- it's such a different experience than so many other places in the malls because of that relationship with them and how close we are with supporting each other. \n In terms of inventory management, we -- look, who would have called what's going to happen when it first came down. And I'm just impressed with the flexibility of the team in chasing products and getting us back in stock. And also, what we're doing now is just trying to quote the customer the best date we can the first time. So they see the delay in the beginning and it doesn't push out again. There's a big difference between if I know I'm waiting a certain amount of time for a sofa and if you push it out over and over. It's very different in how you feel about that delivering whether you, as a customer, considered on time. So we're building those delays as much as we can into our quote times now. \n I'll just, since I'm talking, take the last question. To me, the net comp has always been something we look at. It's -- we have never seen this kind of big gap between them. And that was because we had the slowed -- the stores closed and then this huge spike and inventory low. And of course, that's what happens the first time and you catch up. As we continue to accelerate sales, you can continue to see this longer because you have to build the inventory back to be in better stock. So demand could go -- net coming in certainly may cut the amount. But this will -- this is a thing that will, on the P&L, be a benefit to the future, as much as we hate it. We'd rather have it in stock for the customer. That's the way we're trying to operate the business, and that's what we're going to go for when we get the inventory back in stock. But it will give us more sales in the future because the net will come in on the previously very high demand. Thanks for the questions. I have Felix on the phone. Let me start the question, and then I'll pass it over to Felix. We're -- if anything, we've learned that we have to be the most adaptable to our current situation. I think when something like this pandemic takes you off your feet, you try new things, and we really decided that we -- people needed relevancy. They needed content that was inspiring. We're all busy staring at the screen. And that's much more exciting to hear about new things to cook at home with your family than it is to hear about the next 20% offer. And so we are always testing new things. We may find something else that's even better next year. But we're using our multiple brands to test different things in different brands and then roll them out. And so we don't take a huge risk with any given strategy. \n And so we've been -- at the same time, as we've been pulling down our promotions, we have been also really working on our value. So if you go back to scripts in the past, you'll hear me talking about value, everyday value as a key part of our strategy, opening price point in Pottery Barn. That Pottery Barn apartment strategy is exactly that, to make sure that we're getting the new customers in. And of course, West Elm is a growing brand. \n So we're going to continue to push value. It's not about price increases, it's about less promotions, less markdown inventory. We've now cleared the markdown substantially from where they were a year ago. Julie, do you want -- can we give him that number? You want to go ahead with that? Our clearance inventory. Yes. And Felix, do you want to add anything to this? Great. Thank you for the question on B2B. So we decided for the first time to give you guys the number. So I think you probably might have missed it in the script, we're going to be over $300 million this year. And so it's been sizable. And we really are continuing to see even stronger strength. We passed our first $100 million milestone in a single quarter for the first time. And our growth was really driven by, in B2B, our internal program improvements and execution on our key strategies with a continued push to diversify our business pipeline across various industry verticals. And we're acquiring new customers. Average order size is improving at double-digit rate, and we're also seeing consistent build in sales volume each month. \n In terms of strategic initiatives, we're aggressively expanding our contract deployment. So really converting our products to be contract grade. And to build brand awareness, we have transitioned to a virtual digital marketing and engagement platform. And for example, this is fun, we partnered with Interior Design Magazine this quarter to take part in a series of live interviews as well as an Instagram takeover featuring all of our brands. We're also expanding our B2B offering with Contract in virtual events such as cooking classes, which have been sell-out for us. We are charging for these virtual events, very interesting business opportunity that we're thinking about in a big way for the future. So industry -- the industry, believe it or not, continues to show positive signs for recovery, and we're seeing the Marriott pipeline continue. And there is a lot of -- the hotel occupancy rates, believe it or not, are rebounding from the industry lows. And the renovations were heavily impacted from COVID and then I'm moving forward again. \n So we're seeing good internal indicators that the pipeline is only going to get stronger, and we've built the foundation so that we can handle these big orders. It's depending on what it is. It's a discount on retail, how big it is, and that's how we run it. So -- and as I mentioned earlier, usually, people have to go to 10 different suppliers to furnish these hotels or these projects, and they can just come to us and we can do the whole thing. And we can do -- made-to-size made-to-order products for them as well, which a lot of people can't do. \n So that's, I think -- in addition to our great sales team, I think that's why we're winning. So I'll hand it over to Julie on the comps for the future and what that means for EPS, although we're not giving you that. But I'm going to let her comment about that. And UPS is a great partner of ours, and they've been a good partner. But the truth is there's a lot more cost with COVID in the supply chain. I'm going to let Felix take that. Thank you so much for the question. It's so important to us, and we will continue to pursue sustainability programs that are strategic and material to our business and important to our customers. We're going to lead here. We're going to lead in ethical production, we're going to lead in worker well-being, and we'll build out our environmental commitments. We put out our report in October. And for next year, we're going to -- for climate and energy. We're going to build on this year's Scope 3 footprint and CDP disclosure to develop and set a science-based target for reduction. And responsibly materials and finishes, we're going to continue our leadership in Cottonwood and GreenGuard. And we're going to expand our commitments around lower-impact alternatives like recycled polyester. And in waste and circularity, we're going to build off of our scale and our successful circular pilots. \n And across all these ESG areas, we'll continue to disclose and measure and track our progress. For example, this year, in our corporate responsibility report, we made public our commitment to diversity inclusion with our equity action plan and our first-ever data on gender and ethnicity representation. We are committed to our mantra of good by design, and our pillars are people, planet and purpose. We haven't changed our model. It's the same shipping model that we have. Sure. Thank you all for joining us today, and I really, sincerely wish you a wonderful and safe Thanksgiving with your friends or probably just your family, but maybe your friends, if I assume. So we'll be talking to you soon and look forward to it."

            "name": "Julie Whalen",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of record growth and profitability. It is clear our mission and value proposition are increasingly more relevant, and our growth strategies are continuing to gain traction. And this, combined with our world-class platform that we have been investing in overtime, the agility and strong execution from our team and a culture of strong financial discipline has enabled us to capture market share and expand profitably. We are so proud that our ongoing financial strength has allowed us to continue to take care of our stakeholders, our associates, our customers, our communities and our shareholders during this unprecedented time. \n Turning to the third quarter financial results. Net revenues grew 22.4% year-over-year to $1.765 billion, with net comp growth accelerating to 24.4%. This strong performance was driven by all of our brands and at a higher margin than we have seen as we have been materially shifting away from promotions. Our demand comp, which includes orders placed but not yet filled in the quarter, was again higher at almost 31% as sales continue to outpace our expectations. \n Our accelerated growth was driven by a 49.3% comp in e-commerce and a material improvement in our retail revenues. All brands sequentially improved to strong double digits this quarter. Williams-Sonoma delivered another record net comp of 30.4%. Pottery Barn accelerated to a net comp of 24.1%, the Pottery Barn Kids and Teens business grew at a net comp of 23.8%. West Elm delivered a comp of 21.8% on top of 14.1% last year. And our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham, delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth. \n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin expanded 400 basis points to 40% in the third quarter. This was driven by higher merchandise margins and occupancy leverage. Higher merchandise margins resulted from reduced promotional activity as we continue to shift to a content-led marketing strategy that focuses on the overall value creation of our high-quality, sustainable products. \n Occupancy leverage was driven by higher sales and an almost 3% or $5 million reduction in year-over-year occupancy costs, which includes the impact of reduced rent and operating costs from fewer stores. And this resulted in occupancy leverage of approximately 250 basis points at $174 million or 9.9% of revenues this year as compared to $179 million or 12.4% last year. This occupancy leverage, combined with our merchandise margin expansion, was partially offset by higher shipping costs year-over-year, driven by the substantial shift to e-commerce sales in the quarter as well as shipping surcharges from our third-party shippers. \n We were pleased to see that even with these higher shipping costs, our selling margins, which include our merchandise margins and shipping, expanded 150 basis points. And this, plus our occupancy leverage, allowed us to deliver our highest ever third quarter gross margin rate. \n SG&A leveraged 410 basis points to 24.3% of net revenues compared to 28.4% of net revenues last year. This was primarily driven by significant advertising leverage as we further optimize our digital spend on those initiatives that drove high returns in traffic and conversion, employment leverage and other leverage throughout SG&A from higher top line performance, lower variable store payroll and ongoing strong financial discipline. \n These results led to another quarter of record profitability with operating income growth of 152% to $277 million and operating margin expansion of 810 basis points to 15.7%. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $2.56, which grew 151% or more than double that of last year at $1.02. We are proud to achieve these levels of profitability, while continuing to take care of our associates with heightened safety protocols, such as personal protective equipment, frequent cleaning and COVID testing as well as higher employment costs from providing pandemic bonuses for our store associates and increased hourly wages for our distribution center associates. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a strong cash balance of $773 million compared to $155 million last year. This reflects the strength of our cash balance as we entered 2020 as well as the resilience of our business during this pandemic, generating positive operating cash flow of almost $727 million year-to-date. Our strong liquidity position allowed us to fund the operations of the business to invest nearly $125 million in capital expenditures in support of our future growth, and to return nearly $117 million in the form of continued quarterly dividend payments to our shareholders. Additionally, this quarter, as previously announced, we also repaid in full our short-term borrowings under our $500 million revolver, reinstated our share repurchase program, repurchasing $109 million this quarter alone, and we also committed to a quarterly dividend increase of 10% effective with our next dividend payment in the fourth quarter. \n These decisions reflect our confidence in the long-term growth and profitability trajectory of our business, and our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders. \n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $1.125 billion for a decrease of 10.6% year-over-year versus a 12.2% decline in the second quarter. As Laura said, we have been working closely with our vendor partners to manage through the COVID disruptions and to expand capacity. But given the ongoing elevated demand in our high back orders, we do not expect to be fully back in stock until the second quarter of next year. What this means is that we have 700 basis points of demand sales from Q3 that we expect to fill in future quarters when the inventory is available and delivered to the customer. We are pleased that our customers have continued to want their orders delivered even if they have slight delays. \n Turning to our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. It is clear from the latest surge in COVID infection rates across the country and globally that there is still, unfortunately, significant uncertainty related to this pandemic. As a result, we will not be providing specific sales and earnings guidance for fiscal 2020. But directionally, I can tell you our business continues to be strong across all brands 3 weeks into the fourth quarter. The momentum in our business is continuing. \n From a gross margin perspective, with lower levels of planned promotions, we expect merchandise margins to continue to expand year-over-year. We also expect occupancy leverage to continue, driven by the cost savings from the leases that we have already renegotiated year-to-date as well as the closure of unprofitable stores and final rent abatement negotiations. This will be partially offset by higher shipping costs that will continue to be a headwind in Q4 given the anticipated elevated levels of e-commerce sales and peak surcharges that will come into effect during the holiday peak selling season. \n In terms of SG&A, we expect to incur incremental costs associated with keeping our people and customers safe during the pandemic as well as additional supply chain employment costs. At the same time, we will continue to exercise strong cost discipline in all areas of nonessential spend to ensure that we can remain resilient during this period of uncertainty. As a result, on the year, we remain confident in our ability to drive substantial operating margin expansion versus last year due to our strong performance to date and the likely continuation of robust e-commerce trends through the balance of the year. \n With regards to capital allocation, in addition to the increased quarterly dividend and reinstated share buyback program, we have increased our capital investments in high-returning initiatives that focus on digital to drive our long-term growth. We expect our total CapEx this year to be back relatively in line with historical levels. \n As far as our longer-term outlook, we remain confident in our ability to drive strong top line results, while continuing to deliver operating margin expansion. It was clear pre-pandemic that our strategies for growth were working with accelerated comps through 2019 and an almost 10% comp heading into March before the pandemic accelerated. And these successful growth strategies, combined with our strong new customer count and growing loyalty customer base, the fundamental shift of business online as well as our leadership in sustainability, which has become increasingly more important to the consumer, reinforces our ability to continue to drive strong top line growth post-pandemic, and we expect to deliver this growth with further operating margin expansion. \n As you know, we have a highly profitable e-commerce business with an operating margin that, over the last 10 years alone, has averaged over 21%. Unlike many retailers who are still in the process of scaling their online business, we have already made the significant investments in our e-commerce platform over many years, which enables us to drive significant leverage throughout as we further scale our e-commerce business. This is a significant competitive advantage that speaks to the earnings power of our digital-first model. \n As we continue to prioritize e-commerce growth and structurally shift the channel mix of our business, we will drive material occupancy leverage as we renegotiate more favorable leases and close unprofitable stores. We have half of our leases coming up for renewal in the next 3 years, and we'll be looking at each lease and keep only those stores where the economics of the deal makes sense and where they are brand enhancing. Our plan, currently, is to close approximately 40 stores this year. Stores continue to be a competitive advantage as people like to see merchandise in-person. \n However, we are anticipating a future with fewer, better, more profitable stores. We are also planning for merchandise margin expansion by not only continuing to deliver more relevant content-led marketing, but by also building more value into our product line, which will enable us to be less promotional. Our strong product line and loved brands gives us pricing power that others don't have because their products are undifferentiated. This is very important as we expect costs globally to increase over the next several years. \n Another important driver of long-term operating margin expansion is SG&A leverage. And while there may be some increases in some lines, our shift to digital gives us confidence that we will be able to leverage throughout SG&A and to deliver operating margin expansion post-pandemic. \n In summary, our third quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our distinctive position and driving strong profitable growth. Customers come to us for our in-house design products that are high quality, sustainably made and have the best value in the market. They come to us for our brands that serve a wide range of aesthetics and price points. They come to us for our inspiring content that is engaging and speaks to their needs. And they come to us for the convenience that we offer with our omnichannel model. \n These competitive advantages, combined with our long-term growth strategies and proven execution, give us the confidence that we'll continue to drive long-term strong sales and earnings growth and further returns for our shareholders, both this year and post-pandemic. \n And now I would also like to thank our associates. Without their unwavering commitment to all our stakeholders, none of this would be possible. \n I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. We do because there's peak charges that come in -- surcharges that come in during the holiday selling season. But what I will say is that our supply team has done an unbelievable job of coming up with alternative carriers that we can use to help take care of the capacity constraints we have as well as the higher prices. And so it won't be a full offset, but they certainly are doing everything they can to help mitigate it. And then, of course, along with the merchandise margin expansion, the occupancy leverage, we should still see gross margin expansion regardless of the shipping costs. I don't think we've ever disclosed that. I think what we've said in the past is that we've been moving goods out of China to other locations, other Southeast Asian locations. And so our goal was to get the amount that we had produced in China down by about 50% by the end of this year, and we're still on target to do that. The comp is driven by the strength across all brands. I mean the products are selling. Our performance is on fire from that perspective. When you look back to the last quarter, we had about -- I think it's an 800 basis point differential between demand and net. In this quarter, 700. So as products come in, as long as we're accelerating our performance on the top line, it's going to be a little bit of a leapfrog as we go through by each quarter. The teams have been working very aggressively on partnership with our vendors, and we have great relationships with our vendors to get back in stock as quickly as possible. But obviously, given this incredible demand that we're seeing from our customers, it's going to take a little while longer than we expected, mostly into Q2 of next year. But we haven't seen -- the customer has been \n [Audio Gap] \n we let them know of these delays. And so that's the great news that we expect this delta between demand and net to effectively come in the future quarters. Well, I mean, quite honestly, I think it's across the board. I mean the most -- the thing that we're excited about is this fundamental shift in our business going online, and I think that's a trend that's across the industry. And so as that shifts to e-commerce, and you combine that with the fact that we have many new customers in e-commerce, those 2 combined is going to allow our e-commerce business to thrive. And as that continues to happen, again, if you go back and look at our op margins from the last 10 years, they've averaged above 21%. So just that alone will drive significant op margin expansion going forward. \n Then you layer in the fact that we are feeling very good about our merchandise margins and our ability to pull back on promotions with our content-led marketing strategy, and we expect that to continue. If you layer on the occupancy leverage that we're going to have from all these leases that we're renegotiating, they're coming up for renewal over the next 3 years and the stores that we may close if they're unprofitable, or we're going to keep the great ones and make sure that they have the profitability levels that we want, which we've set a higher bar. And so occupancy leverage will continue. And then, again, with that shift to e-commerce, the rest of the SG&A just leverages beautifully. So we think it's a huge opportunity going forward to be able to drive this business profitably. And the inflection point is the fact that we've shifted significantly to e-commerce, and we don't think that's going to change. It's down 37%. Clearance inventory. Yes. I think -- I mean, as we've said before, we still expect to have strong gross margins regardless of some of those headwinds that you've laid out. Obviously, the team has been very aggressive at working through that and thinking through what those costs could be like. But obviously, because we design and engineer our product, that gives us a price point strength that we can then create the right price for any of those headwinds in the raw materials or transportation that you spoke to. \n Transportation, we do think, will continue to be a headwind. But as I mentioned earlier, the supply chain team has done a phenomenal job, sort of navigating through this. They acted quickly, aggressively to come up with alternative carriers. And so we're managing through that to see how we can mitigate the cost on that go forward. So even with those, again, the substantial tailwind we get by shifting to e-commerce and the flow-through that, that provides, as you've seen, to your point, in this quarter, we think that's going to be very helpful, along with the merchandise margins, along with the occupancy leverage to be able to drive significant op margin expansion going forward. Yes. So we haven't disclosed that. But I think, obviously, you can translate, from a mathematical perspective, if you make your assumptions as to where it will fall. On the revenue side, clearly, we're leaning towards the higher end of that. And what kind of operating margin expansion could occur when you factor in the shift to e-commerce and you factor in the merch margin expansion and you also factor in the occupancy leverage continuing. And then clearly, I mean, it's kind of a nonanswer here, but it's -- let you do the math and you can come up with EPS. The bottom line is we expect strong growth in EPS. There's no reason from a translation from the op margin down to EPS at this time, that there would be any sort of reason that would cause it to be disconnected. If anything, interest expense would probably be coming down next year, since we would be in the line and things like that. So, sorry, it's kind of a nonanswer, but hopefully it helps. Yes. No, it definitely will be higher. I think -- I'm sure people saw the EPS release, I think it was last quarter, where they indicated that for all retailers, they're passing along the cost. So we're not alone. But I think the difference is, as I say over and over, our phenomenal supply chain team has really done a great job. They've acted quickly and aggressively. And as you know, that's sort of our company culture. And so we moved on it immediately to be able to try to mitigate that as best we can, both from a capacity standpoint and from a pricing standpoint, and they have done a phenomenal job, coupled with the tech team to make it all possible. And so it doesn't mean we're not going to have these incremental costs or surcharges. But certainly, compared to others, we're going to be in a much better spot. So... Yes. We do expect ongoing operating margin expansion because our expectation is that top line is going to continue to thrive, especially in e-commerce, as I mentioned. And all the things that we're doing from a margin expansion perspective and occupancy leverage, all of that will continue. And so we do expect it to expand above where we're landing on this year."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Julie Whalen, our Chief Financial Officer; Felix Carbullido, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Yasir Anwar, our Chief Technology Officer.  \n As you saw in our press release, we delivered an exceptional second quarter, with net comp growth of 10.5%, operating margin expansions nearly doubled that of last year at 13.1% and record earnings growth of over 100%. E-commerce again drove our results, growing 46% in the quarter and our stores performed better than expected, improving throughout the quarter as we reopened.  \n In a time when home is more important than ever, we have taken this opportunity to push our longer-term plans. We will do this in 3 different ways: first, we will accelerate digital growth and fundamentally shift the channel mix of our business; second, we're focusing our marketing strategy on content and building customer relationships; and third, we're stepping up our profitability and our longer-term earnings outlook.  \n Our digital-first strategy, our trusted brands, our omnichannel approach and our commitment to sustainability will continue to provide a powerful source of differentiation and a competitive advantage for our business. As always, and especially in challenging times, what makes us proud as a company goes well beyond the products we sell. In the last several months, we've witnessed not only the ongoing impact of the global pandemic, but also heartbreaking reminders of racial injustice in our country. As we continue to support COVID relief efforts in our communities, we are also taking action to help drive positive change and create a more equitable, inclusive future for all. We are committing to multiyear donations to racial justice organizations and increasing black representation internally and deepening our diversity and inclusion efforts. \n These are extraordinary times that require us to continuously evolve and rethink how we best serve all of our stakeholders. We are rising to the challenge, learning, adapting and leading with our values in everything we do. We know thoughtful actions now will shape the next phase of our growth. We are firmly focused on this opportunity and investing in long-term strategies.  \n Now let's talk about Q2 in more detail. While our net comp was at 10.5%, demand comp was substantially higher. Our e-commerce business grew at a net comp of over 46%, and includes purchases made through our omnichannel services, such as curbside pickup and ship from store. We further optimized our digital experience, adding more inspiring content and enhancing the speed and usability of our e-commerce sites.  \n As it relates to our stores, traffic was down, but conversion was up substantially, and our stores outperformed expectations, improving material -- materially from May to July, with third quarter-to-date demand comp improving to negative high single digits.  \n Another highlight of the quarter was a significant expansion in our margins. In addition to cost savings across the business, we substantially pulled back our promotions and leaned into content-led marketing. Our value equation is driving lasting, authentic connections with our customers and also attracting record-high new customers. Our e-commerce performance this quarter was a powerful example of our brand and digital strategies at work. The key drivers of our growth were innovative, sustainable products, and engaging content-rich experience and technology improvements. Our newly designed single page checkout experience, improved site speed, extensive product information page improvements, and our Outward powered Design Crew Room Planner enhancements all drove strong results.  \n Also this quarter, we continue to optimize our digital spend, high-returning investments, leveraging our in-house media capabilities and a strict test and learn agenda across the portfolio. Our content-rich online experience, coupled with our marketing strategies, drove another quarter of very strong customer growth in the e-commerce channel as well as substantial increase in organic traffic.  \n Now let's talk about our brands. Probably the most impressive was the Williams-Sonoma brand, which delivered a record quarter with a net comp of 29.4%. We maximized the shift to cooking at home during the pandemic and executed on a relevant marketing strategy. Customer growth reached over 15% and we saw an increasing number of new and returning customers turning to us for their cooking and at-home dining needs. Our marketing and relevant content strategies were driven by our food-first approach, highlighting ideas, recipes and culinary skills that revolved around eating well at home.  \n To support the vendor community across the country, we added perishable products from local restaurants and increased our assortment of foods to meet the rising demand from our customers. As we look forward, we are excited about the growing interest in cooking especially for millennials, which will not only benefit our business in the short term, but as more people learn to cook, it will become a lifelong skill that should drive our business over the longer term.  \n To continue our growth trajectory in the Williams-Sonoma brand, we are focused on innovative, exclusive products, further improving our digital experience, driving more awareness and interest in cooking at home and optimizing our channel mix.  \n Our Pottery Barn brand also had a very successful quarter, driving a net comp of 8.1%. Our product line continued to improve, with exciting new aesthetics and high-quality sustainable products at great price points. Businesses that saw a particular strength in the quarter were outdoor furniture, work-from-home solutions and products to update family living spaces. Our growth initiatives, PB Apartment and Marketplace, also grew ahead of expectations and contributed meaningfully to our comp growth.  \n The foundation of our Q2 performance was the tremendous results in our e-commerce channel, which reached over 70% of our sales. We continue to improve our site experience by adding inspiring content that drove strong organic traffic, high average order value and units per order. Our Pottery Barn children's home furnishings business was also strong in the second quarter, with a net comp of 4.8%.  \n It's clear that customers are responding to our sustainable, high-quality products. Our industry-leading assortment of GREENGUARD certified organic and fair trade products are resonating with customers more than ever, especially in our baby business, which continued to accelerate in Q2 as a key growth category.  \n One area of softness has been our backpack business as most schools are starting the academic year with distance learning. But we are seeing a surge in our study-at-home solutions, especially home study furniture across both Pottery Barn Kids and Teen as we become the destination for study from home for kids of all ages.  \n West Elm continues to deliver very strong net comps year-over-year at 7% and on a 2-year basis of 24.5%. This brand continues to have high appeal, particularly in our furniture categories where we saw substantial growth in indoor and outdoor as well as key successes in home office, dining and storage furniture this quarter. We substantially enhanced our digital experience in previously retail dominant categories like upholstery, textiles and decorative accessories, which also contributed to our growth online. Also in the quarter, we expanded our Steelcase partnership for the launch of a new furniture collection, aimed at helping our customers work from home comfortably and productively with products that provide form and function.  \n Cross-brand, our business-to-business division reaccelerated substantially to double-digit growth. As you know, this is a large, highly fragmented industry that we are disrupting. We have invested in a strong sales team and support in our infrastructure to turn this opportunity into a $2 billion business.  \n In the second quarter, as states reopened, we were there for our customers in offering a furniture resource that was immediately available for hotels, restaurants and corporate public spaces. We also continued to see significantly higher sales growth from our cross-brand loyalty key members compared to nonmembers and more customers shopping across our portfolio of brands to furnish their homes. It goes without saying that none of these results will be possible without our people. Their ongoing resilience and dedication have never been more apparent than during these difficult times. We are proud to continue to invest in our associates through several initiatives announced this quarter, including increasing the minimum wage for hourly associates and further enhancements to our [ press release ] policy. Building on our strong culture, especially in time of real adversity is not only the right thing to do, but also creates more loyalty and a better experience for our customers.  \n Looking forward to the second half of the year and beyond, we are confident in our growth trajectory. The strong trends from last quarter are continuing. Our product pipeline is one of the best we've ever seen. Our e-commerce initiatives are driving accelerating KPIs and our inventory position will continuously improve. Longer term, we believe the behavioral changes and industry shifts that have emerged from the pandemic will persist and continue to favor our business.  \n Over the past 5 months, we have seen an acceleration in online sales and with our powerful digital platform and trusted brands, we are maximizing the shift and driving e-commerce sales to new levels. We expect this trend to continue and are executing to a future where stores will be fewer in number but even better in experience. As a result, we are not only more confident in our long-term financial outlook, but in our potential to further expand our profitability. We're investing in the next phase of our growth and the opportunities that position us for accelerated market share gains. And as we look ahead, we are more optimistic than ever about our future.  \n Now I'll turn it over to Julie, who will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results. \nJulie Whalen: Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter performance demonstrated our ability to deliver strong top line growth at record profitability levels. Our top line acceleration, combined with strong financial discipline, resulted in the highest operating margin we have seen outside of a holiday fourth quarter and earnings per share of more than double last year. This performance reaffirms the resilience of our digital-first model and the enduring appeal of our innovative and sustainable products. It also speaks to the strength of our team and their agility and strong execution during these challenging times.  \n Before I discuss our financial results in more detail, I wanted to give you an update on our response strategy to the current pandemic. As COVID-19 continues to present ongoing challenges, safety and adaptability remain our guiding principles for how we are operating during this time. This has meant heightened safety measures in all of our supply chain operations in our reopened stores and across our corporate offices. From a financial perspective, given the uncertainties in the macro environment going forward, maintaining strong financial health remains a top priority. As we continue to prepare our business to the various economic scenarios that could unfold the next 6 to 12 months, we are maintaining tight expense control over all nonessential spend, including the elimination of almost all business travel and other discretionary spend. Advertising investments are limited to those initiatives with the highest returns and our capital expenditures have been prioritized for those initiatives that support our e-commerce growth and further our long-term competitive positioning, including investments in technology and our supply chain operations, while reducing our investments in store remodels and relocations. These actions and our culture of strong financial discipline have allowed us to deliver strong profitability despite the incremental operating costs associated with COVID-19.  \n Our liquidity position remains robust as our strong performance year-to-date has generated over $216 million in operating cash flow and has contributed to bringing our cash balance to almost $950 million. And as mentioned on our last call, we further improved our financial flexibility recently by adding $0.5 billion of liquidity through the extension of our $300 million term loan to January 2022 and the addition of a $200 million, 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe this level of liquidity puts us in a very strong position to continue supporting our operations while investing in the long-term accelerated growth of our business.  \n Now turning back to our second quarter performance. Net revenues in the second quarter grew 8.8% to $1.491 billion, with a net comp growth of 10.5%, the highest quarterly comp we have seen in the past 10 years. Our demand comp, which includes orders placed but not yet filled in the quarter, was substantially higher at almost 19%. This growth was driven by another quarter of incredibly strong e-commerce growth, which accelerated to a net comp of 46.4% and reached almost 76% of our total revenue in the quarter.  \n By brand, Williams-Sonoma delivered a record net comp of almost 30%, driven by triple-digit growth in its e-commerce business. Pottery Barn accelerated to its highest quarterly net comp in recent years of 8.1% and West Elm grew at a net comp of 7% on top of 17.5% last year. Our Pottery Barn children's home furnishings business drove a net comp of 4.8%, with particular strength in our Teen business. And our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham, delivered another quarter of double-digit growth.  \n Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the second quarter was 37% compared to 35.4% last year. The 160 basis points of expansion in our gross margin was driven by higher merchandise margins and occupancy leverage. Higher merchandise margins resulted from reduced promotional activity as we continued with our shift to a content-led marketing strategy that focuses on the overall value equation of our high-quality sustainable products. Occupancy leverage was driven by higher sales and an almost 6% or $11 million reduction in year-over-year occupancy costs, which includes the impact of reduced rent and operating costs from fewer stores as well as reductions from COVID-19-related rent abatements.  And this resulted in occupancy leverage of 170 basis points at $166 million or 11.2% of revenues this year as compared to $177 million or 12.9% last year. The combined impact of these 2 drivers was partially offset by higher shipping costs. Shipping costs were up in the quarter as a result of the substantial shift to e-commerce sales in the quarter as well as shipping surcharges from our third-party shippers that went into effect from the last month of the quarter. In addition, we continued to be negatively impacted by incremental China tariffs.  \n SG&A leveraged 460 basis points to 23.9% of net revenues compared to 28.5% of revenues last year. This was primarily driven by significant advertising leverage as we further optimize our digital spend on those initiatives that drove high returns in traffic and conversion employment leverage and other leverage throughout SG&A, primarily from higher top line performance, lower variable store payroll and strong financial discipline. These results led to our record profitability with operating income growth of 108% to $195 million and operating margin expansion of 620 basis points to 13.1%, the highest operating margin we have seen outside of a holiday fourth quarter. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $1.80, which was more than double that of last year at $0.87.  \n We are very pleased to be able to achieve these levels of profitability while continuing to pay all our corporate associates and store associates who are working over 12 hours per week as well as absorb the incremental cost to help keep our associates and customers safe during this pandemic, including personal protective equipment, frequent cleaning, testing and COVID bonuses for our supply chain associates. Going forward, even though our profitability is at record high, given the uncertainty in the economic environment due to the COVID pandemic, we will continue to eliminate all nonessential spend to ensure that we can continue to fund the operations of our business and to invest through this crisis and emerge as an even stronger and more resilient business, delivering sustainable, long-term profitable growth.  \n On the balance sheet, as previously mentioned, we ended the quarter with a strong cash balance of almost $950 million compared to $120 million last year. This reflects the strength of our cash balance as we enter 2020, the full drawdown on our $500 million line of credit with the support of our banking partners back in March as well as the resilience of our business during this pandemic, generating positive operating cash flow over $216 million year-to-date. This cash balance has allowed us to not only fund the operations of the business, but to also invest over $76 million in capital expenditures in support of our future growth and return over $79 million in the form of continued quarterly dividend payments to our shareholders.  \n And given the strength of our business and our current liquidity levels, we have made the decision to return our capital expenditures to pre-pandemic levels. We are also contemplating reducing the amount outstanding on our $500 million line of credit during the third quarter. Our decision process will take into account various factors, including the uncertainty that still remains in the macro environment.  \n Moving down the balance sheet, merchandise inventories were $1.042 billion for a decrease of 12.2% compared to last year. This reflects our efforts to cut and push out our inventory purchases to preserve our liquidity at the beginning of the pandemic and the impact of our subsequent substantial e-commerce outperformance in the past 2 quarters. We have been working closely with our vendor partners, the majority of whom have returned operating at full capacity, and we expect to see continuous improvement in our inventory position.  \n Turning to our outlook for the second half and our fiscal year guidance. We have made the decision not to provide specific full year guidance at this time, given the uncertainty in the economic environment due to the COVID pandemic. What we do know now is that our business continues to be very strong in the third quarter. Quarter-to-date sales remain robust across all brands and inventory will continuously improve through the balance of the year. However, as much as we expect to improve our overall profitability on the year and going forward, the Q2 level of SG&A is not sustainable. We have significantly reduced payrolls and ad cost spend as our sales expectations were lower than what we actually delivered this quarter.  \n In terms of margin, we believe they were going to continue to be able to reduce promotions as well as deliver occupancy leverage, but shipping will be a major headwind in the back half. Various surcharges have been announced by third-party shippers on all retailers, and these higher costs will affect us in Q3 and more so in Q4 as a result of peak surcharges during the holiday season. In addition, we also expect to incur incremental costs associated with keeping our people and customers safe during the pandemic.  \n Regardless, we remain confident in our ability to drive higher operating margins on the year compared to last year due to our strong performance to date, including our robust e-commerce performance, which we believe will persist through the balance of the year.  \n With regards to capital allocation, given our business has not only recovered substantially but excelled during this pandemic, we have increased our capital investments in high-returning initiatives that focus on digital to drive our long-term growth. And as it relates to our dividend, we have announced today another quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per share, which speaks to the confidence we have in our business as well as our commitment to shareholder returns.  \n Looking further ahead, as Laura mentioned, we are even more confident in our long-term financial outlook. The renewed appreciation for the home and at-home experiences, such as cooking and working from home, together with the accelerated shift to online for home furnishings, continue to favor our business on all fronts. We are executing with speed and agility to capture the unprecedented opportunity that lies ahead for our company. Our strong performance through this crisis reinforces the relevance of our design-led, sustainable products, and the power of our digital-first platform.  \n With more consolidation expected in our highly fragmented industry, we are confident that we are one of the very few retailers who are best positioned to outperform and to aggressively take share. As a result, we now believe that with the acceleration of our profitable e-commerce business, becoming a bigger part of our total growth, we can drive operating margin expansion.  \n In summary, this past quarter was another powerful display of our competitive strengths that continue to extend our leadership in the home industry. Our innovative, sustainable products, our multi-brand digital-first model and our content-rich marketing are the reasons why customers are choosing us over the competition. And this, combined with our long-term growth road map and strong execution, gives us the confidence in our ability to maintain this growth and increase profitability in the years ahead.  \n Before I turn the call over for questions, I want to thank our associates for their ongoing dedication, flexibility and resilience during these challenging times. They are at the core of our company's success and our ability to continue to serve all our stakeholders, our customers, our associates and our shareholders. \n I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our first question from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Let me say, a remarkable quarter, really truly remarkable. Laura, I was wondering if -- or actually, Laura or Julie, if you can talk about what drove the late quarter demand comp? The differential between the 19% and the 10.5%, should we assume that, that sort of a tailwind that should be recognized on top of whatever kind of momentum comp you had in the third quarter? \n And then just really quickly, are you seeing trends outside of major metropolitan suburbs, this notion of de-urbanization as a sustainable trend? How do you think about that going forward? \nLaura Alber: Adrienne, it's Laura. So we saw -- we've seen very strong demand. And as you know, when the pandemic began, we substantially cut our inventories and our business partners are so reactive that they were able to do that. And so obviously, as our demand exceeded the inventory levels, not only do you not fill it in some cases, you put it on that order, but also the demand itself is constrained. So one could say that the demand comps have actually been even higher had we had the inventory in stock. So the inventory levels were point one. \n Point two is mix. So our business is growing really across the board, but more rapidly in furniture and specifically drop ship furniture. We made a big strategic move to move a lot of our Asian upholstery, particularly for West Elm into our Sutter Street operations. And so of course, that inventory previously was stored in our distribution center and now we're making it to order. So there's a natural delay that also just happens because we're shifting into domestic upholstery. \n In terms of your second question about demographics, we have Felix here. Felix, if you want to talk about our customers and what we're seeing across the board? \nFelix Carbullido: Sure. You got it. In terms of urban and suburban, we haven't seen dramatic shifts, but I think what's noteworthy is the shift into a suddenly younger demographic, with the millennial population getting into household formation. We also are seeing a nice growth in condo and apartment dwellers, where I think we've spent a lot of time and energy focused on the size and scale of our furniture as well as our opening price points. I think that, coupled with the fact that we do offer such a great assortment that is sustainably built is part of the attraction of what millennials are finding. So I think those are 2 trends that we're starting to see from a demographic perspective. \nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird. \nPeter Benedict: So I guess, maybe, Julie, can you maybe frame the tariffs hit this quarter? And as we think about the second half year, the tariff headwind should basically be a push, I would think. But I just wanted to confirm that and when you think about that, how is the shipping cost headwind in comparison to the size of the tariff headwind -- that shipping headwind just basically replaced what's been the tariff headwind. So kind of a cost question. I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks, but can you give us maybe a little bit more detail around those so we can think about that correctly? \nJulie Whalen: Sure. So from a China tariff perspective, as we've said before, as we move throughout the year, the year-over-year impact becomes less. There's still a year-over-year impact in the back half, but it's not as big as Q1 and Q2. And so that will reduce as we move throughout the year, but we'll still have, obviously, the China tariffs. \n As far as the shipping, the shipping charges are material. I think you've heard from the third-party shippers that they are imposing surcharges on all retailers. And so that will be a headwind as we move into the back half, particularly in the fourth quarter with peak surcharges. And it will be sizable. We haven't disclosed the amount, obviously, it's confidential from a contractual perspective, we can't speak about it. But it is something that will have -- put pressure on our gross margins. But of course, with occupancy leverage and higher merch margins that are expected and ongoing SG&A leverage, we are very confident in our ability to drive off margin expansion. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: Great quarter, congratulations. So I'll stick to the one question rule. Just maybe to elaborate further, just on the trended business through the quarter. I think, Laura, you had mentioned in your comments about how stores were tracking. I'm looking at just how the business trended through the quarter, both in-store and online, in particular, as the stores open, then maybe if you could elaborate further on just what we're seeing so far into the third quarter. \nLaura Alber: Yes. I mean it's not -- there's nothing really there that would be interesting, I don't think, to you, even if you saw everything, it's very consistently strong as it is still now. Of course, the stores open and then now we have, I think, 22 currently we shut. So that doesn't help when I read you the comp, and I told you earlier where the comp is right now, that includes that. So we have just rock star store people, who are driving business, not just when the stores are open, but also driving online through design and virtual chats, which is quite amazing. \n And so they're just so dedicated. We're so proud of them. And that's a big part of, I think these results is what they're doing, and they're training. We kept them all working, and they're so valuable to us because they know how to sell furniture, they know our line of furniture and they're able to do it from home. So it wasn't great, that stores we closed. That was hard for everyone, but they're making the most of it. \n So the big question becomes, I think, as we look in the second half, is what happens. Do more stores shut, do more stores open. And that would be a benefit. I think the stores are really an add to our digital-first strategy. And they certainly bring to life our product and allow you to make even a better decision. So we're very hopeful that they'll stay open, and we'll keep everybody safe as we have been with our appointments and our safety protocol and constant cleaning. \n So we're very optimistic about the back half. We have a lot of things in our favor. And we feel very lucky at the time where I know it's not the case for everyone, and we're very cognizant of that and empathetic about what's going on in the world and doing our part to use our strength to also make a big difference in the communities and with our employees to drive both safety but also mental health and racial justice. \n So I know it's a lot of an answer to your one question, but it's important to us, and it's our true North right now, and our values are driving our business, and our business is allowing us to do more for our stakeholders. \nBrian Nagel: And so this -- so in -- through Q2, though, the business strength through the second quarter? \nLaura Alber: A strong throughout -- it's strong. It's a strong throughout. There's different things that happen when you comp different promos, you decide not to comp a promo, and that has nothing to do with demand. It's just how it flows, but there's not a lot of change there. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. \nOliver Wintermantel: Yes. Laura, you mentioned several times in the prepared remarks, like your digital-first strategy and investments in CapEx more on the e-commerce side and the IT investments. What does that mean for your store base? Is there an underlying message that we might see an accelerated store closures? Or I just want to see, in 2 years or 3 years, how would your store base look compared to today? \nLaura Alber: Yes, sure. So first of all, we have been investing in e-commerce for many years. So we have a very sophisticated platform. It's not as if we have some big hockey stick to come with the tech back. I'm going to let Yasir in a minute who's with us talk about the things we are adding that are driving significant performance, but let me answer your store question specifically. \n So we see stores as an addition to our strategy. That said, we have significant amounts of leases up for renewal. In the next 3 years, over half come up. Over half. So whether we keep them, close them, renegotiate them or relocate, we are sitting in a very strategic place in this time. And we are investing in our stores where we operate, and we are closing others so that we can be very focused on running great stores with great experiences in them. The mix will continue to shift. Obviously, because the growth in DTC is much greater and stores are contracting. And this is giving us a lot of occupancy leverage. And our landlord partners, we have some very, very good ones, really see us as a very strong partner. They want to keep us, and we're working together with them to stay in those stores and have very high profit levels. And where that doesn't work for them, we just -- we go somewhere else to re-lease entirely to market. \n I think this pandemic has shown us that we are agile and we can operate regardless. And those store people are the people who make this happen, whether they have their stores open or are talking to customers from home. And that was something that I think we're all really just -- we hope would happen, but we're so impressed, continues to be a strength. Okay. So now I'd like to pass it over to Yasir to talk about our stance on technology and investment in e-commerce. \nYasir Anwar: Great. Thanks, Laura. So I think connecting with the stores and then I'll get into the e-commerce, like stores also, like I said, we have provided -- continue to provide and invest great tools into the hands of our associates, especially of our designers, who are connected deep into the communities. The design experiences Laura just mentioned about the design tools, the virtual chat, the appointments, all of that, that has given strong tools into the hands of our designers and that have made an impact in engaging with the customers. And we have also been continuously investing in converting stores into more omni experiences, right? Whether it's buy online, pick up in stores, ship from store, ship to store, curbside pickup, especially be providing safety to the customers during the COVID times and that has worked very well for our customers and for our associates. \n And our e-commerce, which is a huge -- has been a huge business and has been a big growth engine for us, continues -- we continue to invest. In COVID time, we took understanding, we took a step back and looked at the optimized way to keep investing in tech. And right now, we are trending back towards our pre-COVID investment in technology all over, including definitely and doubling down on e-commerce. And the whole technology team, I would say at this time is I'm so proud to have such a growth mindset and everybody in my technology team, agility, commitment and willing to fight against all odds. So during these COVID times, many companies have gone through faster transformation, digital transformation, we have done the same many, many X times, and we have gone faster in implementing building things, which might have taken 6 months in a regular time period. My teams have built it in 2 months or 1.5 months. \n We have gone very fast to the market to experiment with the customers and learn the signals from the customers what they need in our sites and experiences, using our own homegrown experimentation platform, using our own homegrown recommendations platform, and the outward power, which Laura and everybody on the leadership talks about, is like we're trying to -- we're connecting out for much better than ever with our website experiences, with our store experiences and design. \n So I can go on and on, the supply chain transformation we're doing. And a lot -- one important thing to see is like the transformation in the past 2 years has been to focus and drive our decisions based on data, analytics and powered by artificial intelligence and ML, whether it's search engine, whether it's outward experiences and all. So I think we are -- we have developed a very, very strong package, talent, platform, technology, and the innovation stream is going very fast. And we believe this is like sort of the -- it's not the end, it's at the beginning, if we're going to build so much more, which is going to be very long-lasting beyond COVID and beyond 2021 and further. \nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: Very nice quarter. A couple of questions on the margin. First, in the near term, do you expect gross margin to be down in the back half, but leverage operating margin overall on the SG&A? And secondly, as you think about the SG&A, some of what happened in this quarter, what's the right baseline that we should be building off of what would you consider sort of the one cost -- onetime cost bucket, just as we think about normal seasonality of SG&A dollars? \nJulie Whalen: Chris, this is Julie. I'll take that. So from a gross margin perspective, I think what we were really excited to see was the expansion we saw this quarter, and that's both from the fact that we had higher merchandise margins and occupancy leverage. And we have every reason to believe that that's going to continue. Certainly, there'll be higher pressure on shipping costs. But we're not obviously guiding to where the gross margin is going to be, but we're really thrilled to be able to drive that gross margin expansion even with this quarter having some pressure from the shipping costs. And certainly, SG&A has been leveraging for a while now, and we expect that to continue. We've been having some, obviously, really strong cost controls, eliminating all nonessential spends and being very thoughtful about that because there's different scenarios you can model. And we got to make sure we're ready to continue to invest in this business and take market share as we come out of this even more so. \n But I will say Q2 is certainly some of the lowest levels we've seen. And so there -- as we move into the back half, with the holiday -- peak holiday season and things like that, we may have to spend a little bit more in advertising and a little bit more variable store payroll. So I wouldn't necessarily take our Q2 levels and model those out, but we do expect to have SG&A leverage, and we absolutely expect to have operating margin expansion. \nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Just a couple for me. On the spread again between net comp and demand, can you just help us think about that from a banner perspective? And I guess how that's going to impact third quarter results? Do you expect to recapture that demand comp? \n And then on the long term guide, can you provide us some guidepost on where you think operating margins can go to? Or maybe said differently, what you think the flow-through will look like going forward? \nLaura Alber: Chuck. So sorry, we're not going to give you the guidepost you're looking for. We're not ready to do that. What was changing is to say that previously, we said we -- our op margin at 8.6% would stay there, and we drive sales. Now what we're saying is we're going to drive sales, but we're also going to drive profit ahead of the 8.6%. Okay? So that's all we're willing to say at this point. \n In terms of by banner, that's an interesting question. So of course, because of the dynamic I talked about with furniture, the spread is larger with the furniture brands. Because Williams-Sonoma, although there is components that are to come and that our furniture is a much smaller percent, so the other brands have more higher demand comp versus net than the Sonoma banner. \n And then let's see. Third quarter, you asked me -- what -- remind me what you asked me about third quarter? \nCharles Grom: I guess just -- I'd like to know what the quarter-to-date account is, but I know you're not going to answer that. But I guess like when do you expect -- when would you expect this to recapture that? I mean how long does it take to recapture... \nLaura Alber: Well, I remember, you ask me where the net comes. I mean it's an interesting question. If demand continues to exceed our expectations, then the inventory constraint will just be kicked down the line because you'll run out faster. So if everything stuck to where we think it's going to be, you'd see recovery in the back half, all the way into next year, by the way. But if we beat the numbers again, then you're going to be hearing me say this next time. The numbers are within what you're seeing us hit now. There is some variation here and there, but there was in the same range of what the comp is that we just share with you for Q2. I hope that helps. \nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham: Great quarter. My question is around SG&A. Clearly, over time, you're planning to reduce your store footprint, which will produce your occupancy costs, but also take out store labor. As it relates to store labor in the interim, would you plan to reduce that even ahead of store closures because of reduced traffic levels? \nLaura Alber: No. In fact, it might be the opposite because things get more complicated. The abating factor is that we can't have that many people in our stores. So even if the demand is there, we can only have so many people. But you should not model that store labor will leverage any further. Holiday will cause us to bring more people in because the sales are higher. \nSeth Basham: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just follow-up, if you don't mind, as it relates to SG&A, thinking about the go-forward run rate. Clearly, we're talking about levels that are higher than the second quarter. Just to reframe the question that others have asked, we're thinking about it on a year-over-year basis, would you expect SG&A to be down year-over-year in the back half of the year? \nLaura Alber: SG&A down. We expect SG&A in the back half to be down to last year's SG&A in the back half. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go ahead and take our next question from Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nBradley Thomas: Congratulations from me as well. I want to ask about the dynamic of sustainability and pull forward that we're all asking of many home-related companies right now. I've been asked by investors, how many bread makers does the American need to buy? I know the belief that these trends are probably pretty sustainable. But I was hoping you could share some more data on maybe how the customer is shopping you now and what you're seeing in terms of repeat purchases and ability to cross-pollinate customers across your brands? \nLaura Alber: Yes. Our cross-brand performance has never been better. And we've been driving it. It's not a surprise. I mean we're driving it through our key rewards and our cross-brand marketing. It's interesting in the beginning. We started -- we saw the obvious bread maker trends, ice cream maker. But now the strength is broad-based. And you can just see that people are very interested in making their home more comfortable, and we are top of mind with our curated products and our trusted brands, and we're delivering it for them in a way that they can expect to get it, and we stand behind it. So there's a lot that we have going for us right now. It's very relevant to this time and a competitive advantage that will continue to drive our results. \nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. \nMichael Lasser: Laura, you probably saw some of your competitors report like 80% growth at Wayfair, Target comping up 30% in the home category. Why do you think in light of those, you might have lost share in the quarter? And also, how much demand comp was realized that was coming out of 1Q into 2Q to contribute to the comp in 2Q? \nLaura Alber: Okay. I don't -- we'll have to come back to that piece. But versus competitors, I want you to look at our profit levels versus last year, first and foremost and compare to some of these other people. You can drive sales. We could drive them higher. Frankly, we didn't have the inventory to do that. And we want to have a great customer experience. We don't want any more than we have to have on back order. We know the items they're willing to wait for that don't become excessive. But if you put too much on back order, it's a bad customer experience. So we're very focused on taking share. \n I've said before, it's not an either/or with us in Wayfair as the disruption in brick-and-mortar happens and the smaller players. There's a couple of people who are going to win, and we're one of those people, because currently, 80% has been done at retail. And that has obviously changed forever now. And so they are going to us and they're going to go to those other retailers, too. And the thing that is really the differentiator with us is that we have curated brands, you don't have to search through a ton of products. You can trust the level of quality. The products are sustainable. The value equation is fair. And those are all very important attributes to a customer. And we're able to do that because we design our own products. We make our own products. So we're giving you a great price point for what we're selling you. So it doesn't phase me to think about their growth slightly higher. \n We also obviously -- in terms of the demand question, let me try to understand what you asked. I think you're asking, did we fill -- we're always going to fill from the other quarter, we have more of a gap than we have the benefit, right? I mean we have more demand than we can fill now, and that affected the Q3 -- the Q2 net negatively. \nMichael Lasser: Okay. Understood. Could I ask one quick one on the Williams-Sonoma concept? How much of that growth came from like consumable products? There's a lot of food that, that business sells versus devices and other items that go into the support of clicking something. \nLaura Alber: All good. \nOperator: And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. \nAnthony Chukumba: Let me add my congratulations on a nice quarter as well. I guess my question is, I mean, obviously, your e-commerce penetration was -- it sounds like it was at all-time high. And it sounds like that's kind of where the business is shifting. And historically, you've been sort of like 50-50 between in-store revenues, DTC. What do you in business sort of along -- even just kind of direction, kind of a long-term kind of sustainable mix going forward? Is it more like a 60-40 e-commerce stores? Is it maybe 70-30? How do you sort of think about that? \nLaura Alber: I think the best way to think about it is how big do you think the total business could be. I mean, clearly, we're ahead of our targets with respect to e-commerce as a percent of our total. And that's where the growth is going to come from. Our results show that our digital-first platform has a lot of capacity to meet our customers' demand online. And it also depends on how many stores we close and what our landlords do with our leases in the future. But our physical stores play an important role in continuing to differentiate our offering to the customer and they are experiential, and they offer our customers the convenience of omnichannel services, too, which we haven't talked about, but that is a real benefit in getting the products closer to customer, particularly as we see the shifting battlefield. And so it's a -- we're currently at 70%. Could you say, could it go higher? Yes, but you might see better-than-expected store results through the back half as well. \nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez with Telsey Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernandez: I'd add my congratulations for the quarter. I wanted to ask about the holiday season. How are you planning it differently this year given the cadence of events and store limits? And do you think merchandise that has worked so far will continue to drive that demand through the holiday season? \nLaura Alber: Yes. Thank you for the question. Of course, yes. We always know that getting a running start in the holiday with both customers, new customers, but also products that are selling, makes for a better season and also gives us the ability to get the inventory levels right because we can chase it. So that is all good. \n In terms of the competitive posture and how we're playing the holiday season, I hesitate to go through that now because it is so competitive. But we're very optimistic and planning for a variety of different outcomes that could occur, as I mentioned earlier, in case we have a second wave of store closures, how will we handle that. And if we continue to beat demand in DTC, how we make sure that we get it to our customers on time. \nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Bobby Griffin with Raymond James. \nRobert Griffin: Let me add my congrats on a great quarter. Just real quickly, from a high-level perspective, Laura, do you think the pandemic has delayed any of the new product innovation or development that the industry typically has? Or is once the industry gets caught up kind of in this -- from this demand and kind of supply chain gets back to normal, will we be back on a typical product introduction cycle as we have been in the past? \nLaura Alber: We are not delayed in our product introductions. I don't know if maybe others are, but we are not. Our teams have been doing it virtually and approving samples via Zoom, and it's been pretty amazing, what they've been able to do. So no, we're not behind. In fact, we're probably -- it's an interesting point that I haven't thought of. We're probably gaining speed on others who aren't as agile. \nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: It's really outstanding. Could you talk -- can you give us an update on some of your smaller brands a little bit on Mark and Graham and Rejuvenation? And just an update as well on your international businesses? I don't recall hearing an update on that. \nLaura Alber: Yes. Sure. Thank you for that question. So Rejuvenation delivered a very strong quarter, strong customer engagement, big time increase in traffic. And the stores have shown vast improvement, the AOV is up substantially. And as I said, customer growth, you can imagine with customers spending more time in the home is focused on home projects. We've seen our core categories like lighting, hardware and kitchen and bath, all drive strong quarter-to-date double-digit comps. And we saw the furniture that was impacted more greatly because of the store closures, rebound later in the quarter. And we remain really focused and bullish on this strategy, accelerating our digital growth, optimizing our marketing strategy and accelerating our contract trade strategy, which is a big part of this business. \n Mark and Graham also had a very strong quarter despite the fact that they are not as focused on home, which is quite interesting. And they continue to pivot that merchandising strategy to areas that are the strongest and incremental categories like pet and baby are working. And we're really focused on optimizing the customer site experience there. We're updating [ it ] with the new creative overhaul, cleaner personalization experience, et cetera. \n In terms of global, this is a good one because we did see some weakness in Q2 due to franchise orders being down, but that quickly changed directions. And now we are shaping orders. And just to reiterate, our strategy for global is franchise. It's not company-owned. As it relates to our company-owned though, Australia is doing pretty well. U.K. is under a little pressure. And we are well positioned to continue to drive e-commerce across our franchises and our company-owned. \n The thing you didn't ask, which we did mention was B2B, which is quickly becoming a very sizable business for us and one that I think people questioned whether would stay healthy during the pandemic, and we are gaining momentum and confidence in this business with very large companies who are investing with us and our speed to market is a huge competitive advantage here. Our team is very aggressive, out hunting new deals all the time versus just waiting for them to come in, and that's a big change, frankly. And then also, people love that they can shop across brands, with a single person and have us coordinate delivery for them. So it makes it a lot easier versus going through a bunch of different purveyors. So thank you for the question, Marni. \nOperator: That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Laura Alber for any additional or closing remarks. \nLaura Alber: Well, thank you all for joining us today. Thank you for your thoughtful questions. And we look forward to seeing you and talking to you soon at the next quarter earnings results. \nOperator: Once again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you so much for your participation. You may now disconnect your phone lines.",

            "content": "Sure. You got it. In terms of urban and suburban, we haven't seen dramatic shifts, but I think what's noteworthy is the shift into a suddenly younger demographic, with the millennial population getting into household formation. We also are seeing a nice growth in condo and apartment dwellers, where I think we've spent a lot of time and energy focused on the size and scale of our furniture as well as our opening price points. I think that, coupled with the fact that we do offer such a great assortment that is sustainably built is part of the attraction of what millennials are finding. So I think those are 2 trends that we're starting to see from a demographic perspective."

            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thank you, Elise. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Julie Whalen, our Chief Financial Officer; Felix Carbullido, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Yasir Anwar, our Chief Technology Officer.  \n As you saw in our press release, we delivered an exceptional second quarter, with net comp growth of 10.5%, operating margin expansions nearly doubled that of last year at 13.1% and record earnings growth of over 100%. E-commerce again drove our results, growing 46% in the quarter and our stores performed better than expected, improving throughout the quarter as we reopened.  \n In a time when home is more important than ever, we have taken this opportunity to push our longer-term plans. We will do this in 3 different ways: first, we will accelerate digital growth and fundamentally shift the channel mix of our business; second, we're focusing our marketing strategy on content and building customer relationships; and third, we're stepping up our profitability and our longer-term earnings outlook.  \n Our digital-first strategy, our trusted brands, our omnichannel approach and our commitment to sustainability will continue to provide a powerful source of differentiation and a competitive advantage for our business. As always, and especially in challenging times, what makes us proud as a company goes well beyond the products we sell. In the last several months, we've witnessed not only the ongoing impact of the global pandemic, but also heartbreaking reminders of racial injustice in our country. As we continue to support COVID relief efforts in our communities, we are also taking action to help drive positive change and create a more equitable, inclusive future for all. We are committing to multiyear donations to racial justice organizations and increasing black representation internally and deepening our diversity and inclusion efforts. \n These are extraordinary times that require us to continuously evolve and rethink how we best serve all of our stakeholders. We are rising to the challenge, learning, adapting and leading with our values in everything we do. We know thoughtful actions now will shape the next phase of our growth. We are firmly focused on this opportunity and investing in long-term strategies.  \n Now let's talk about Q2 in more detail. While our net comp was at 10.5%, demand comp was substantially higher. Our e-commerce business grew at a net comp of over 46%, and includes purchases made through our omnichannel services, such as curbside pickup and ship from store. We further optimized our digital experience, adding more inspiring content and enhancing the speed and usability of our e-commerce sites.  \n As it relates to our stores, traffic was down, but conversion was up substantially, and our stores outperformed expectations, improving material -- materially from May to July, with third quarter-to-date demand comp improving to negative high single digits.  \n Another highlight of the quarter was a significant expansion in our margins. In addition to cost savings across the business, we substantially pulled back our promotions and leaned into content-led marketing. Our value equation is driving lasting, authentic connections with our customers and also attracting record-high new customers. Our e-commerce performance this quarter was a powerful example of our brand and digital strategies at work. The key drivers of our growth were innovative, sustainable products, and engaging content-rich experience and technology improvements. Our newly designed single page checkout experience, improved site speed, extensive product information page improvements, and our Outward powered Design Crew Room Planner enhancements all drove strong results.  \n Also this quarter, we continue to optimize our digital spend, high-returning investments, leveraging our in-house media capabilities and a strict test and learn agenda across the portfolio. Our content-rich online experience, coupled with our marketing strategies, drove another quarter of very strong customer growth in the e-commerce channel as well as substantial increase in organic traffic.  \n Now let's talk about our brands. Probably the most impressive was the Williams-Sonoma brand, which delivered a record quarter with a net comp of 29.4%. We maximized the shift to cooking at home during the pandemic and executed on a relevant marketing strategy. Customer growth reached over 15% and we saw an increasing number of new and returning customers turning to us for their cooking and at-home dining needs. Our marketing and relevant content strategies were driven by our food-first approach, highlighting ideas, recipes and culinary skills that revolved around eating well at home.  \n To support the vendor community across the country, we added perishable products from local restaurants and increased our assortment of foods to meet the rising demand from our customers. As we look forward, we are excited about the growing interest in cooking especially for millennials, which will not only benefit our business in the short term, but as more people learn to cook, it will become a lifelong skill that should drive our business over the longer term.  \n To continue our growth trajectory in the Williams-Sonoma brand, we are focused on innovative, exclusive products, further improving our digital experience, driving more awareness and interest in cooking at home and optimizing our channel mix.  \n Our Pottery Barn brand also had a very successful quarter, driving a net comp of 8.1%. Our product line continued to improve, with exciting new aesthetics and high-quality sustainable products at great price points. Businesses that saw a particular strength in the quarter were outdoor furniture, work-from-home solutions and products to update family living spaces. Our growth initiatives, PB Apartment and Marketplace, also grew ahead of expectations and contributed meaningfully to our comp growth.  \n The foundation of our Q2 performance was the tremendous results in our e-commerce channel, which reached over 70% of our sales. We continue to improve our site experience by adding inspiring content that drove strong organic traffic, high average order value and units per order. Our Pottery Barn children's home furnishings business was also strong in the second quarter, with a net comp of 4.8%.  \n It's clear that customers are responding to our sustainable, high-quality products. Our industry-leading assortment of GREENGUARD certified organic and fair trade products are resonating with customers more than ever, especially in our baby business, which continued to accelerate in Q2 as a key growth category.  \n One area of softness has been our backpack business as most schools are starting the academic year with distance learning. But we are seeing a surge in our study-at-home solutions, especially home study furniture across both Pottery Barn Kids and Teen as we become the destination for study from home for kids of all ages.  \n West Elm continues to deliver very strong net comps year-over-year at 7% and on a 2-year basis of 24.5%. This brand continues to have high appeal, particularly in our furniture categories where we saw substantial growth in indoor and outdoor as well as key successes in home office, dining and storage furniture this quarter. We substantially enhanced our digital experience in previously retail dominant categories like upholstery, textiles and decorative accessories, which also contributed to our growth online. Also in the quarter, we expanded our Steelcase partnership for the launch of a new furniture collection, aimed at helping our customers work from home comfortably and productively with products that provide form and function.  \n Cross-brand, our business-to-business division reaccelerated substantially to double-digit growth. As you know, this is a large, highly fragmented industry that we are disrupting. We have invested in a strong sales team and support in our infrastructure to turn this opportunity into a $2 billion business.  \n In the second quarter, as states reopened, we were there for our customers in offering a furniture resource that was immediately available for hotels, restaurants and corporate public spaces. We also continued to see significantly higher sales growth from our cross-brand loyalty key members compared to nonmembers and more customers shopping across our portfolio of brands to furnish their homes. It goes without saying that none of these results will be possible without our people. Their ongoing resilience and dedication have never been more apparent than during these difficult times. We are proud to continue to invest in our associates through several initiatives announced this quarter, including increasing the minimum wage for hourly associates and further enhancements to our [ press release ] policy. Building on our strong culture, especially in time of real adversity is not only the right thing to do, but also creates more loyalty and a better experience for our customers.  \n Looking forward to the second half of the year and beyond, we are confident in our growth trajectory. The strong trends from last quarter are continuing. Our product pipeline is one of the best we've ever seen. Our e-commerce initiatives are driving accelerating KPIs and our inventory position will continuously improve. Longer term, we believe the behavioral changes and industry shifts that have emerged from the pandemic will persist and continue to favor our business.  \n Over the past 5 months, we have seen an acceleration in online sales and with our powerful digital platform and trusted brands, we are maximizing the shift and driving e-commerce sales to new levels. We expect this trend to continue and are executing to a future where stores will be fewer in number but even better in experience. As a result, we are not only more confident in our long-term financial outlook, but in our potential to further expand our profitability. We're investing in the next phase of our growth and the opportunities that position us for accelerated market share gains. And as we look ahead, we are more optimistic than ever about our future.  \n Now I'll turn it over to Julie, who will provide more detail on our second quarter financial results. Adrienne, it's Laura. So we saw -- we've seen very strong demand. And as you know, when the pandemic began, we substantially cut our inventories and our business partners are so reactive that they were able to do that. And so obviously, as our demand exceeded the inventory levels, not only do you not fill it in some cases, you put it on that order, but also the demand itself is constrained. So one could say that the demand comps have actually been even higher had we had the inventory in stock. So the inventory levels were point one. \n Point two is mix. So our business is growing really across the board, but more rapidly in furniture and specifically drop ship furniture. We made a big strategic move to move a lot of our Asian upholstery, particularly for West Elm into our Sutter Street operations. And so of course, that inventory previously was stored in our distribution center and now we're making it to order. So there's a natural delay that also just happens because we're shifting into domestic upholstery. \n In terms of your second question about demographics, we have Felix here. Felix, if you want to talk about our customers and what we're seeing across the board? Yes. I mean it's not -- there's nothing really there that would be interesting, I don't think, to you, even if you saw everything, it's very consistently strong as it is still now. Of course, the stores open and then now we have, I think, 22 currently we shut. So that doesn't help when I read you the comp, and I told you earlier where the comp is right now, that includes that. So we have just rock star store people, who are driving business, not just when the stores are open, but also driving online through design and virtual chats, which is quite amazing. \n And so they're just so dedicated. We're so proud of them. And that's a big part of, I think these results is what they're doing, and they're training. We kept them all working, and they're so valuable to us because they know how to sell furniture, they know our line of furniture and they're able to do it from home. So it wasn't great, that stores we closed. That was hard for everyone, but they're making the most of it. \n So the big question becomes, I think, as we look in the second half, is what happens. Do more stores shut, do more stores open. And that would be a benefit. I think the stores are really an add to our digital-first strategy. And they certainly bring to life our product and allow you to make even a better decision. So we're very hopeful that they'll stay open, and we'll keep everybody safe as we have been with our appointments and our safety protocol and constant cleaning. \n So we're very optimistic about the back half. We have a lot of things in our favor. And we feel very lucky at the time where I know it's not the case for everyone, and we're very cognizant of that and empathetic about what's going on in the world and doing our part to use our strength to also make a big difference in the communities and with our employees to drive both safety but also mental health and racial justice. \n So I know it's a lot of an answer to your one question, but it's important to us, and it's our true North right now, and our values are driving our business, and our business is allowing us to do more for our stakeholders. A strong throughout -- it's strong. It's a strong throughout. There's different things that happen when you comp different promos, you decide not to comp a promo, and that has nothing to do with demand. It's just how it flows, but there's not a lot of change there. Yes, sure. So first of all, we have been investing in e-commerce for many years. So we have a very sophisticated platform. It's not as if we have some big hockey stick to come with the tech back. I'm going to let Yasir in a minute who's with us talk about the things we are adding that are driving significant performance, but let me answer your store question specifically. \n So we see stores as an addition to our strategy. That said, we have significant amounts of leases up for renewal. In the next 3 years, over half come up. Over half. So whether we keep them, close them, renegotiate them or relocate, we are sitting in a very strategic place in this time. And we are investing in our stores where we operate, and we are closing others so that we can be very focused on running great stores with great experiences in them. The mix will continue to shift. Obviously, because the growth in DTC is much greater and stores are contracting. And this is giving us a lot of occupancy leverage. And our landlord partners, we have some very, very good ones, really see us as a very strong partner. They want to keep us, and we're working together with them to stay in those stores and have very high profit levels. And where that doesn't work for them, we just -- we go somewhere else to re-lease entirely to market. \n I think this pandemic has shown us that we are agile and we can operate regardless. And those store people are the people who make this happen, whether they have their stores open or are talking to customers from home. And that was something that I think we're all really just -- we hope would happen, but we're so impressed, continues to be a strength. Okay. So now I'd like to pass it over to Yasir to talk about our stance on technology and investment in e-commerce. Chuck. So sorry, we're not going to give you the guidepost you're looking for. We're not ready to do that. What was changing is to say that previously, we said we -- our op margin at 8.6% would stay there, and we drive sales. Now what we're saying is we're going to drive sales, but we're also going to drive profit ahead of the 8.6%. Okay? So that's all we're willing to say at this point. \n In terms of by banner, that's an interesting question. So of course, because of the dynamic I talked about with furniture, the spread is larger with the furniture brands. Because Williams-Sonoma, although there is components that are to come and that our furniture is a much smaller percent, so the other brands have more higher demand comp versus net than the Sonoma banner. \n And then let's see. Third quarter, you asked me -- what -- remind me what you asked me about third quarter? Well, I remember, you ask me where the net comes. I mean it's an interesting question. If demand continues to exceed our expectations, then the inventory constraint will just be kicked down the line because you'll run out faster. So if everything stuck to where we think it's going to be, you'd see recovery in the back half, all the way into next year, by the way. But if we beat the numbers again, then you're going to be hearing me say this next time. The numbers are within what you're seeing us hit now. There is some variation here and there, but there was in the same range of what the comp is that we just share with you for Q2. I hope that helps. No. In fact, it might be the opposite because things get more complicated. The abating factor is that we can't have that many people in our stores. So even if the demand is there, we can only have so many people. But you should not model that store labor will leverage any further. Holiday will cause us to bring more people in because the sales are higher. SG&A down. We expect SG&A in the back half to be down to last year's SG&A in the back half. Yes. Our cross-brand performance has never been better. And we've been driving it. It's not a surprise. I mean we're driving it through our key rewards and our cross-brand marketing. It's interesting in the beginning. We started -- we saw the obvious bread maker trends, ice cream maker. But now the strength is broad-based. And you can just see that people are very interested in making their home more comfortable, and we are top of mind with our curated products and our trusted brands, and we're delivering it for them in a way that they can expect to get it, and we stand behind it. So there's a lot that we have going for us right now. It's very relevant to this time and a competitive advantage that will continue to drive our results. Okay. I don't -- we'll have to come back to that piece. But versus competitors, I want you to look at our profit levels versus last year, first and foremost and compare to some of these other people. You can drive sales. We could drive them higher. Frankly, we didn't have the inventory to do that. And we want to have a great customer experience. We don't want any more than we have to have on back order. We know the items they're willing to wait for that don't become excessive. But if you put too much on back order, it's a bad customer experience. So we're very focused on taking share. \n I've said before, it's not an either/or with us in Wayfair as the disruption in brick-and-mortar happens and the smaller players. There's a couple of people who are going to win, and we're one of those people, because currently, 80% has been done at retail. And that has obviously changed forever now. And so they are going to us and they're going to go to those other retailers, too. And the thing that is really the differentiator with us is that we have curated brands, you don't have to search through a ton of products. You can trust the level of quality. The products are sustainable. The value equation is fair. And those are all very important attributes to a customer. And we're able to do that because we design our own products. We make our own products. So we're giving you a great price point for what we're selling you. So it doesn't phase me to think about their growth slightly higher. \n We also obviously -- in terms of the demand question, let me try to understand what you asked. I think you're asking, did we fill -- we're always going to fill from the other quarter, we have more of a gap than we have the benefit, right? I mean we have more demand than we can fill now, and that affected the Q3 -- the Q2 net negatively. All good. I think the best way to think about it is how big do you think the total business could be. I mean, clearly, we're ahead of our targets with respect to e-commerce as a percent of our total. And that's where the growth is going to come from. Our results show that our digital-first platform has a lot of capacity to meet our customers' demand online. And it also depends on how many stores we close and what our landlords do with our leases in the future. But our physical stores play an important role in continuing to differentiate our offering to the customer and they are experiential, and they offer our customers the convenience of omnichannel services, too, which we haven't talked about, but that is a real benefit in getting the products closer to customer, particularly as we see the shifting battlefield. And so it's a -- we're currently at 70%. Could you say, could it go higher? Yes, but you might see better-than-expected store results through the back half as well. Yes. Thank you for the question. Of course, yes. We always know that getting a running start in the holiday with both customers, new customers, but also products that are selling, makes for a better season and also gives us the ability to get the inventory levels right because we can chase it. So that is all good. \n In terms of the competitive posture and how we're playing the holiday season, I hesitate to go through that now because it is so competitive. But we're very optimistic and planning for a variety of different outcomes that could occur, as I mentioned earlier, in case we have a second wave of store closures, how will we handle that. And if we continue to beat demand in DTC, how we make sure that we get it to our customers on time. We are not delayed in our product introductions. I don't know if maybe others are, but we are not.

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Laura. So I think connecting with the stores and then I'll get into the e-commerce, like stores also, like I said, we have provided -- continue to provide and invest great tools into the hands of our associates, especially of our designers, who are connected deep into the communities. The design experiences Laura just mentioned about the design tools, the virtual chat, the appointments, all of that, that has given strong tools into the hands of our designers and that have made an impact in engaging with the customers. And we have also been continuously investing in converting stores into more omni experiences, right? Whether it's buy online, pick up in stores, ship from store, ship to store, curbside pickup, especially be providing safety to the customers during the COVID times and that has worked very well for our customers and for our associates. \n And our e-commerce, which is a huge -- has been a huge business and has been a big growth engine for us, continues -- we continue to invest. In COVID time, we took understanding, we took a step back and looked at the optimized way to keep investing in tech. And right now, we are trending back towards our pre-COVID investment in technology all over, including definitely and doubling down on e-commerce. And the whole technology team, I would say at this time is I'm so proud to have such a growth mindset and everybody in my technology team, agility, commitment and willing to fight against all odds. So during these COVID times, many companies have gone through faster transformation, digital transformation, we have done the same many, many X times, and we have gone faster in implementing building things, which might have taken 6 months in a regular time period. My teams have built it in 2 months or 1.5 months. \n We have gone very fast to the market to experiment with the customers and learn the signals from the customers what they need in our sites and experiences, using our own homegrown experimentation platform, using our own homegrown recommendations platform, and the outward power, which Laura and everybody on the leadership talks about, is like we're trying to -- we're connecting out for much better than ever with our website experiences, with our store experiences and design. \n So I can go on and on, the supply chain transformation we're doing. And a lot -- one important thing to see is like the transformation in the past 2 years has been to focus and drive our decisions based on data, analytics and powered by artificial intelligence and ML, whether it's search engine, whether it's outward experiences and all. So I think we are -- we have developed a very, very strong package, talent, platform, technology, and the innovation stream is going very fast. And we believe this is like sort of the -- it's not the end, it's at the beginning, if we're going to build so much more, which is going to be very long-lasting beyond COVID and beyond 2021 and further."

            "name": "Julie Whalen",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter performance demonstrated our ability to deliver strong top line growth at record profitability levels. Our top line acceleration, combined with strong financial discipline, resulted in the highest operating margin we have seen outside of a holiday fourth quarter and earnings per share of more than double last year. This performance reaffirms the resilience of our digital-first model and the enduring appeal of our innovative and sustainable products. It also speaks to the strength of our team and their agility and strong execution during these challenging times.  \n Before I discuss our financial results in more detail, I wanted to give you an update on our response strategy to the current pandemic. As COVID-19 continues to present ongoing challenges, safety and adaptability remain our guiding principles for how we are operating during this time. This has meant heightened safety measures in all of our supply chain operations in our reopened stores and across our corporate offices. From a financial perspective, given the uncertainties in the macro environment going forward, maintaining strong financial health remains a top priority. As we continue to prepare our business to the various economic scenarios that could unfold the next 6 to 12 months, we are maintaining tight expense control over all nonessential spend, including the elimination of almost all business travel and other discretionary spend. Advertising investments are limited to those initiatives with the highest returns and our capital expenditures have been prioritized for those initiatives that support our e-commerce growth and further our long-term competitive positioning, including investments in technology and our supply chain operations, while reducing our investments in store remodels and relocations. These actions and our culture of strong financial discipline have allowed us to deliver strong profitability despite the incremental operating costs associated with COVID-19.  \n Our liquidity position remains robust as our strong performance year-to-date has generated over $216 million in operating cash flow and has contributed to bringing our cash balance to almost $950 million. And as mentioned on our last call, we further improved our financial flexibility recently by adding $0.5 billion of liquidity through the extension of our $300 million term loan to January 2022 and the addition of a $200 million, 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility. We believe this level of liquidity puts us in a very strong position to continue supporting our operations while investing in the long-term accelerated growth of our business.  \n Now turning back to our second quarter performance. Net revenues in the second quarter grew 8.8% to $1.491 billion, with a net comp growth of 10.5%, the highest quarterly comp we have seen in the past 10 years. Our demand comp, which includes orders placed but not yet filled in the quarter, was substantially higher at almost 19%. This growth was driven by another quarter of incredibly strong e-commerce growth, which accelerated to a net comp of 46.4% and reached almost 76% of our total revenue in the quarter.  \n By brand, Williams-Sonoma delivered a record net comp of almost 30%, driven by triple-digit growth in its e-commerce business. Pottery Barn accelerated to its highest quarterly net comp in recent years of 8.1% and West Elm grew at a net comp of 7% on top of 17.5% last year. Our Pottery Barn children's home furnishings business drove a net comp of 4.8%, with particular strength in our Teen business. And our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham, delivered another quarter of double-digit growth.  \n Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the second quarter was 37% compared to 35.4% last year. The 160 basis points of expansion in our gross margin was driven by higher merchandise margins and occupancy leverage. Higher merchandise margins resulted from reduced promotional activity as we continued with our shift to a content-led marketing strategy that focuses on the overall value equation of our high-quality sustainable products. Occupancy leverage was driven by higher sales and an almost 6% or $11 million reduction in year-over-year occupancy costs, which includes the impact of reduced rent and operating costs from fewer stores as well as reductions from COVID-19-related rent abatements.  And this resulted in occupancy leverage of 170 basis points at $166 million or 11.2% of revenues this year as compared to $177 million or 12.9% last year. The combined impact of these 2 drivers was partially offset by higher shipping costs. Shipping costs were up in the quarter as a result of the substantial shift to e-commerce sales in the quarter as well as shipping surcharges from our third-party shippers that went into effect from the last month of the quarter. In addition, we continued to be negatively impacted by incremental China tariffs.  \n SG&A leveraged 460 basis points to 23.9% of net revenues compared to 28.5% of revenues last year. This was primarily driven by significant advertising leverage as we further optimize our digital spend on those initiatives that drove high returns in traffic and conversion employment leverage and other leverage throughout SG&A, primarily from higher top line performance, lower variable store payroll and strong financial discipline. These results led to our record profitability with operating income growth of 108% to $195 million and operating margin expansion of 620 basis points to 13.1%, the highest operating margin we have seen outside of a holiday fourth quarter. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $1.80, which was more than double that of last year at $0.87.  \n We are very pleased to be able to achieve these levels of profitability while continuing to pay all our corporate associates and store associates who are working over 12 hours per week as well as absorb the incremental cost to help keep our associates and customers safe during this pandemic, including personal protective equipment, frequent cleaning, testing and COVID bonuses for our supply chain associates. Going forward, even though our profitability is at record high, given the uncertainty in the economic environment due to the COVID pandemic, we will continue to eliminate all nonessential spend to ensure that we can continue to fund the operations of our business and to invest through this crisis and emerge as an even stronger and more resilient business, delivering sustainable, long-term profitable growth.  \n On the balance sheet, as previously mentioned, we ended the quarter with a strong cash balance of almost $950 million compared to $120 million last year. This reflects the strength of our cash balance as we enter 2020, the full drawdown on our $500 million line of credit with the support of our banking partners back in March as well as the resilience of our business during this pandemic, generating positive operating cash flow over $216 million year-to-date. This cash balance has allowed us to not only fund the operations of the business, but to also invest over $76 million in capital expenditures in support of our future growth and return over $79 million in the form of continued quarterly dividend payments to our shareholders.  \n And given the strength of our business and our current liquidity levels, we have made the decision to return our capital expenditures to pre-pandemic levels. We are also contemplating reducing the amount outstanding on our $500 million line of credit during the third quarter. Our decision process will take into account various factors, including the uncertainty that still remains in the macro environment.  \n Moving down the balance sheet, merchandise inventories were $1.042 billion for a decrease of 12.2% compared to last year. This reflects our efforts to cut and push out our inventory purchases to preserve our liquidity at the beginning of the pandemic and the impact of our subsequent substantial e-commerce outperformance in the past 2 quarters. We have been working closely with our vendor partners, the majority of whom have returned operating at full capacity, and we expect to see continuous improvement in our inventory position.  \n Turning to our outlook for the second half and our fiscal year guidance. We have made the decision not to provide specific full year guidance at this time, given the uncertainty in the economic environment due to the COVID pandemic. What we do know now is that our business continues to be very strong in the third quarter. Quarter-to-date sales remain robust across all brands and inventory will continuously improve through the balance of the year. However, as much as we expect to improve our overall profitability on the year and going forward, the Q2 level of SG&A is not sustainable. We have significantly reduced payrolls and ad cost spend as our sales expectations were lower than what we actually delivered this quarter.  \n In terms of margin, we believe they were going to continue to be able to reduce promotions as well as deliver occupancy leverage, but shipping will be a major headwind in the back half. Various surcharges have been announced by third-party shippers on all retailers, and these higher costs will affect us in Q3 and more so in Q4 as a result of peak surcharges during the holiday season. In addition, we also expect to incur incremental costs associated with keeping our people and customers safe during the pandemic.  \n Regardless, we remain confident in our ability to drive higher operating margins on the year compared to last year due to our strong performance to date, including our robust e-commerce performance, which we believe will persist through the balance of the year.  \n With regards to capital allocation, given our business has not only recovered substantially but excelled during this pandemic, we have increased our capital investments in high-returning initiatives that focus on digital to drive our long-term growth. And as it relates to our dividend, we have announced today another quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per share, which speaks to the confidence we have in our business as well as our commitment to shareholder returns.  \n Looking further ahead, as Laura mentioned, we are even more confident in our long-term financial outlook. The renewed appreciation for the home and at-home experiences, such as cooking and working from home, together with the accelerated shift to online for home furnishings, continue to favor our business on all fronts. We are executing with speed and agility to capture the unprecedented opportunity that lies ahead for our company. Our strong performance through this crisis reinforces the relevance of our design-led, sustainable products, and the power of our digital-first platform.  \n With more consolidation expected in our highly fragmented industry, we are confident that we are one of the very few retailers who are best positioned to outperform and to aggressively take share. As a result, we now believe that with the acceleration of our profitable e-commerce business, becoming a bigger part of our total growth, we can drive operating margin expansion.  \n In summary, this past quarter was another powerful display of our competitive strengths that continue to extend our leadership in the home industry. Our innovative, sustainable products, our multi-brand digital-first model and our content-rich marketing are the reasons why customers are choosing us over the competition. And this, combined with our long-term growth road map and strong execution, gives us the confidence in our ability to maintain this growth and increase profitability in the years ahead.  \n Before I turn the call over for questions, I want to thank our associates for their ongoing dedication, flexibility and resilience during these challenging times. They are at the core of our company's success and our ability to continue to serve all our stakeholders, our customers, our associates and our shareholders. \n I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Sure. So from a China tariff perspective, as we've said before, as we move throughout the year, the year-over-year impact becomes less. There's still a year-over-year impact in the back half, but it's not as big as Q1 and Q2. And so that will reduce as we move throughout the year, but we'll still have, obviously, the China tariffs. \n As far as the shipping, the shipping charges are material. I think you've heard from the third-party shippers that they are imposing surcharges on all retailers. And so that will be a headwind as we move into the back half, particularly in the fourth quarter with peak surcharges. And it will be sizable. We haven't disclosed the amount, obviously, it's confidential from a contractual perspective, we can't speak about it. But it is something that will have -- put pressure on our gross margins. But of course, with occupancy leverage and higher merch margins that are expected and ongoing SG&A leverage, we are very confident in our ability to drive off margin expansion. Chris, this is Julie. I'll take that. So from a gross margin perspective, I think what we were really excited to see was the expansion we saw this quarter, and that's both from the fact that we had higher merchandise margins and occupancy leverage. And we have every reason to believe that that's going to continue. Certainly, there'll be higher pressure on shipping costs. But we're not obviously guiding to where the gross margin is going to be, but we're really thrilled to be able to drive that gross margin expansion even with this quarter having some pressure from the shipping costs. And certainly, SG&A has been leveraging for a while now, and we expect that to continue. We've been having some, obviously, really strong cost controls, eliminating all nonessential spends and being very thoughtful about that because there's different scenarios you can model. And we got to make sure we're ready to continue to invest in this business and take market share as we come out of this even more so. \n But I will say Q2 is certainly some of the lowest levels we've seen. And so there -- as we move into the back half, with the holiday -- peak holiday season and things like that, we may have to spend a little bit more in advertising and a little bit more variable store payroll. So I wouldn't necessarily take our Q2 levels and model those out, but we do expect to have SG&A leverage, and we absolutely expect to have operating margin expansion."

I would now like to turn the call over to Elise Wang, Vice President of Investor Relations, to discuss non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Julie Whalen, our Chief Financial Officer; Felix Carbullido, our Chief Marketing Officer; and Yasir Anwar, our Chief Technology Officer. \n Before we get started on our Q1 results, we hope you and your families sincerely are safe and healthy during this time, and our deep gratitude goes to all of the people who are taking care of our communities in the fight against this pandemic. I want to also thank all of our Williams-Sonoma, Inc. associates for their incredible agility, commitment and partnership in responding to this crisis. Our people are at the heart of our company, and we are inspired by how they've adapted to serve our customers in these times. \n In the first quarter, we are proud to deliver an overall company comp growth of 2.6% despite having all of our 616 stores closed for more than half the quarter. Our teams maximized demand online, leaning into new and innovative ways to engage and serve our customers virtually, driving DTC comps over 31% in the first quarter. These results reflect our powerful digital-first platform and the relevance of our high-quality, sustainable products and superior customer service. The strategic investments that we have made over the years give us a competitive advantage in this disrupted environment that favors digital. \n Nothing makes me prouder, though, than to have achieved our results while staying true to our company's core value of taking care of our people, customers and communities. From the onset of this pandemic, safety and pay continuation for our people have been key priorities. In mid-March, we acted swiftly to close our stores and institute work-from-home policies for our corporate employees. And we made the decision to provide pay and benefits to all of our store associates who've been regularly working more than 12 hours weekly for the entire time our stores have been closed. To support our local communities, we have donated food, personal care kits and surgical masks to health care workers on the frontline. We've also raised more than $800,000 across our brands for the relief efforts of No Kid Hungry. We take our responsibility to all of our stakeholders very seriously, and we feel fortunate to be in a position to take care of our people and our communities. \n We are also very focused on our financial health. In addition to maximizing e-commerce, we have made aggressive cuts across the company in expenses, inventory and capital expenditures, and we'll continue to strengthen our financial position while prioritizing investments in strategic priorities. Julie will share with you in detail the actions we've taken to bolster our balance sheet. \n As we mentioned on our last call, we entered the new fiscal year in a strong position. For the month of February through March 11, when the health crisis began to accelerate, we delivered high single-digit comp growth in line with our long-term outlook. After the outbreak escalated and the closure of our retail stores went into effect on March 17, our e-commerce business had breakout comp growth and has continued to accelerate. Total comp growth, including the impact from our closed stores, was positive across nearly all brands, with particular strength in our Pottery Barn children's business, which drove 8.5% comp, and the Williams-Sonoma brand with a comp of 5.4%. West Elm delivered a comp of 3.3%, while our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham, drove a combined comp of 2.4%. Pottery Barn's e-commerce demand was extremely strong and gained momentum throughout the quarter. We also reduced our level of promotions across our brands, which led to an improvement in our product margins for the quarter. Our ability to grow our business in this time speaks to the power of our multichannel platform and our organizational agility rooted in a long-standing culture of innovation. \n To maximize demand online, we've enhanced our digital experience even further. We've expanded our services online, including Design Chat, Virtual Design Appointment and Ask the Expert, leveraging our Outward, Inc. 3D visualization technology. And we redeployed our retail associates to serve our customer in these new ways. These virtual services leverage the knowledge and expertise of our store associates for an important source of differentiation for our brands and enables them to connect with our customers and deliver superior experience online. \n Also, a key part of our success is our omni services, including Buy Online Pickup In Store, which we launched in early 2018. We've also accelerated our speed to market in a number of digital innovations to enhance the convenience of shopping online. These innovations include improvements in product discovery, site merchandising and the search experience as well as e-mail and site personalization, and we have a faster checkout. With the pivot to digital -- excuse me, someone has their line unmuted. I'm not sure who that is, perhaps it's the operator. Sorry. Sorry, guys. I'll keep going. \n With the pivot to digital, we've also deployed more resources to digital content creation. As consumers spend increasingly more time on social media while sheltering in place, we are leaning into this trend by publishing more user-generated content and campaigns in our social channels. We are also producing more live events to engage and interact with our customers in real time. These digital initiatives have contributed to a dramatic acceleration in our online KPIs, such as traffic, conversion and customer growth across our brands. We're particularly encouraged to see our new customer counts up substantially and previously retail-only customers shopping with us online. This gives us even more confidence in our DTC growth trajectory for the balance of the year and our ability to continue to take share. The majority of our first-time online customers are now also members of The Key, our cross-brand loyalty program. We have always understood the importance of retention in cross-brand shopping and The Key is at the center of our strategy. As an indication of the power of this program in driving incremental growth, in the second half of the quarter, online sales from existing Key members nearly doubled compared to last year, while they also maintained their pre-COVID total sales growth levels despite store closures. We've also seen shopping across our brands increase as customers realize the breadth of our offering across our portfolio and are eager to earn rewards wherever they shop with us. Our efforts to optimize our digital experience during this time could not have been realized without the ingenuity and thoughtfulness of our brand and tech teams. \n In the Williams-Sonoma brand, we saw significant growth in nearly all merchandise categories, with particular strength in electrics, cookware, food and houseware. Our content strategy across our digital channels pivoted to relevant topics for more quality time at home, such as recipes, live demonstrations and family activities. Our online growth was driven by a change in our customer profile, which was dominated by new retail primary and cross-channel customers. We also achieved traffic and conversion rates that were similar to our peak holiday season. \n Growth in Pottery Barn Kids and Teen also accelerated even further this quarter. As a business that's already predominantly online, we are primed to meet the surge in demand for children's home furnishing as schools and child care centers closed nationwide and parents turned to us for study and playroom solutions. We also saw continued strength in our baby business and our offering of GREENGUARD Gold certified furniture and organic cotton bedding. At a time when health and safety is more important than ever, we are focused on further amplifying our leadership in the children's home furnishings market in offering sustainable products that are safe for kids and good for the planet. \n In West Elm, we also continue to see strong results. Furniture continued to lead our growth in the first quarter with strong demand for our expanded outdoor assortment as well as home office furniture. To meet the material acceleration in e-commerce growth, we have introduced new social engagement tools and enhanced our editorial experiences and room inspiration content in our digital channels. \n In the Pottery Barn brand, we began the quarter with positive trends in all product divisions and channels. Despite the retail closures, we saw demand accelerate materially through the quarter in our furniture offerings in home office, outdoor, bedding and functional accessories. Our DTC-oriented growth initiative, curated marketplace and apartment assortment also continue to contribute incrementally. The quarter also benefited from our continuous optimization of our digital experience, including improvements in product discovery and site merchandising. \n As we look to the rest of the year, we are optimistic that there are significant lifestyle changes that favor our business. However, there also remains considerable uncertainty. Some of the factors that we are modeling for include the prolonged economic impact this pandemic could have and the incremental cost of doing business in whatever form of reopening the economy takes for the rest of 2020 and the foreseeable future. As a result, we are not issuing full year guidance today. However, I would like to give you an update on second quarter to date. We continue to see robust trends in e-commerce and acceleration across all of our brands. Since May 1, we have reopened a total of 364 stores, consistent with government regulations. In these stores, we have in place strict safety protocols such as frequent sanitization, limitation on the number of customers and associates in store, shopping by appointment and a supply of masks and gloves for our associates. We're also fulfilling customer orders through curbside pickup, which has now been launched in 475 of our retail locations nationwide. Customer response has been strong so far in our reopened stores, driven by appointment-only shopping. However, with strict social distancing measures in place, customer limits will continue to constrain sales in our stores. For locations where retail restrictions have not been lifted, we will keep those stores closed through June 14 and continue to provide pay and benefits for this extended period of closure for associates who have been regularly working more than 12 hours weekly. \n Reflecting on the longer term, this crisis has accelerated our industry shift to e-commerce and given rise to a newfound appreciation for the home. We believe that with our differentiated value proposition of high-quality, design-led sustainable products and our large e-commerce business, we are well positioned. Our resilience during this turbulent time exemplifies the advantage of our unique multi-brand, multichannel platform and our commitment to all of our stakeholders. We will continue to invest to strengthen our digital-first model, enhancing the convenience of our online channels. We also continue to prioritize the growth initiatives that we laid out at the beginning of the year, including West Elm and our cross-brand initiatives, The Key and Business to Business. We entered this crisis in a strong financial position and with clear momentum across our brands. It's moments like these that set us apart from the competition and reinforce our ability to outperform. We are confident that we will emerge from this crisis an even stronger company. \n Thank you for your continued support. I wish you and your families the best. And now I will turn this call over to Julie for more of the financial details. \nJulie Whalen: Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a solid performance in the first quarter, highlighting the strength and adaptability of our digital-first model, the agility and strong execution of our teams and the resilience of our fortress balance sheet. Most importantly, we are proud to have achieved these results while maintaining an unwavering commitment to all of our stakeholders. \n Before I go into our financial results in more detail, I wanted to give you an update on how our team has been responding to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While our priority is always health and safety, we are also focused on maintaining our strong financial health in order to continue to support our associates and customers during this period of heightened uncertainty. From a financial perspective, we have been preparing our business for a number of possible macro scenarios. And as part of our response strategy, we have cut all nonessential business expenses, including the elimination of almost all business travel and other discretionary spend for the foreseeable future. \n In real estate, we have delayed store remodels and relocations and have negotiated various rent reductions with our landlords. And across the business, we have negotiated with our vendors various other expense reductions in technology, in our supply chain and in other professional services. In advertising, we are only investing in those initiatives that drive the highest returns in e-commerce traffic and conversion. And in technology, we are prioritizing business-critical projects that will allow us to further improve our competitive positioning and continue to take market share. These immediate steps we have taken have resulted in our ability to maintain strong profitability despite the incremental operating costs associated with COVID-19 and speaks to our culture of financial discipline.\n To further bolster our financial flexibility, we have also increased our liquidity position. We now have over $860 million in cash as a result of our strong performance and our decision to draw down on our existing revolver. With the support of our banking partners, we were also able to obtain an additional $0.5 billion of liquidity through the extension of our $300 million term loan to January 2022 and an additional $200 million in an unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility. We believe our current liquidity position will allow us to not only support the operations of our business during this global health crisis, but will also allow us to continue to invest in the business and emerge as an even stronger and more resilient business for the long term. \n Now turning back to our first quarter performance. Net revenues in the first quarter were relatively in line with last year at $1.235 billion, with total comp growth of 2.6% despite the impact of closing all of our stores for more than half of the quarter. Growth was driven by both the strength in our business prior to the acceleration of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the overall strength in our e-commerce business, which further accelerated while our stores were closed to end the quarter with a comp of 31.2%. \n By brand, Williams-Sonoma, despite having the largest number of stores across our fleet, delivered a comp growth of 5.4%. Our Pottery Barn children's home furnishings business accelerated sequentially to a comp growth of 8.5% compared to 7.9% last quarter. West Elm drove a solid comp of 3.3%. And while Pottery Barn had a negative 1.1% comp, their e-commerce business has continued to significantly accelerate, resulting in a positive comp in the second quarter to date. \n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the first quarter was 34.5% compared to 35.9% last year. The gross margin deleverage of 140 basis points was primarily driven by higher shipping costs as a result of the substantial shift to e-commerce sales in the quarter and higher furniture sales, which are more expensive to ship. \n The year-over-year impact from incremental China tariffs and occupancy deleverage from the closure of all of our stores, along with the incremental cost to board up our stores and clean our facilities that are recorded within occupancy. Their impact on gross margin was partially offset by higher merchandise margins from less promotions in the quarter, reflecting the enduring appeal of our relevant, sustainable and design-led products. Occupancy costs in the first quarter were approximately $174.9 million or 14.2% of total revenues and relatively flat to last year at $173.4 million or 14% of total revenues. \n SG&A leveraged 80 basis points to 28.1% of net revenues compared to 28.9% of revenues last year, driven by advertising leverage from the ongoing shift in our advertising spend from catalog to more efficient digital initiatives as well as stronger returns on our advertising investments due to the power of our multichannel model. It also reflects the positive impact of the aggressive cost reductions across the business in response to the impact of COVID-19. As previously mentioned, we acted early and quickly to maximize digital and to cut all nonessential spend to ensure that we self-fund our business and continue to support our associates, customers and communities through this difficult time. \n From a profitability perspective, we drove operating income of $79 million with an operating margin of 6.4% compared to $87 million or 7% last year. This resulted in bottom line diluted earnings per share of $0.74. We are pleased to be able to achieve these levels of profitability while continuing to pay our associates and incurring various incremental costs to help keep our associates and customers safe during this pandemic, including providing protective gear and increased sanitation services across our operations. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a strong cash balance of $861 million compared to $108 million last year. This includes the precautionary measures we took to boost our liquidity during the quarter with a full drawdown on our existing revolving credit facility of approximately $488 million. Excluding this drawdown, we ended the quarter with over $373 million in cash, which was over $265 million higher than last year. This reflects the strength of our cash balance as we enter 2020, along with our strong Q1 performance, resulting in positive operating cash flow of almost $54 million. In addition to funding the operations of the business, this cash balance also reflects investing $42 million in capital expenditures as well as returning over $39 million in the form of continued quarterly dividend payments to our shareholders. \n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $1.071 billion for a decrease of 7.3% compared to last year. This reflects our efforts to cut and push out our inventory purchases to preserve our liquidity in response to COVID-19 and the impact of the subsequent outperformance in our e-commerce business. \n Now turning to our fiscal year outlook. As Laura mentioned, given the uncertainty that exists regarding the impact of this global health crisis on future economic activity and customer demand, we are not providing full year guidance today. This is not a reflection of the current trends that we are seeing in our business, which continue to accelerate, but rather the lack of visibility we have on the full economic impact of this pandemic and the wide range of outcomes this could have for our business in the balance of the year. Longer term, we believe this crisis has given rise to permanent shifts in consumer behavior that will benefit our business. E-commerce adoption has accelerated in our category, and consumers are accustomed to spending more time at home leading to a likely shift in discretionary spending to the home and home-related categories such as cooking. These trends, combined with our digital-first model and unique value proposition in the home category, give us even more confidence in our ability to drive accelerated growth and gain market share in the long term. \n With regards to capital allocation, while our balanced approach remains unchanged over the long term, in the short term, we will continue to invest in strategic initiatives that fuel our future growth while suspending capital expenditures that are nonbusiness critical. We have also temporarily suspended stock buybacks until we have better visibility into the longer-term impact from COVID-19. But as a testament to the confidence we have in our business as well as our commitment to shareholder returns, we have announced today another quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per share. \n Going forward, based on the strength we continue to see in our business, we remain confident in our strategy to drive long-term accelerated growth. As a result, we are maintaining our longer-term financial outlook, with revenue growth expected to be in the mid- to high single digits and operating income growth in line with revenue growth. \n Before I turn the call over for questions, I want to express my appreciation to our associates who have risen to the challenges presented by this unprecedented crisis and have quickly adapted to serve our customers always with a commitment to health and safety. They are a key reason behind how resilient our business and financial performance has been during these challenging times. Looking ahead, we will continue to manage our business for the long term, staying focused on our competitive strengths, investing in our strategic priorities and always keeping top of mind our stakeholders, our associates, our customers, our communities and our shareholders. Our response to this crisis has demonstrated that with our multi-brand digital-first model, the agility and dedication of our teams, a proven track record of strong financial discipline and our fortress balance sheet, we will emerge as an even stronger company once this pandemic subsides. \n I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead with the first question from Seth Basham of Wedbush. \nSeth Basham: Congrats on a good quarter. My question is around recent trends. In particular, how have demand comps trended relative to sales comps? And then secondly, have you faced any supply chain fulfillment challenges? \nLaura Alber: Sure. It's Laura. So demand has been stronger than that, obviously. We are very happy to see accelerating trends, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, across all of our brands. And we're adapting to how we continue to stay very relevant and sensitive during these times to what our customers are looking for and the right tone and giving them the things that are interesting to them while they're at home. The inventory and the world supply chain is a constant challenge in that a little self-inflicted. We pulled back on some receipts when this first happened because we didn't know what the outcome would be, and we thought that was the right thing to do and better to be chasing inventory than have too much. But now with our long lead times, we are going to be chasing some inventory. And so you're going to see us continue to pull back on promotions and balance that and do the right thing. But there's -- we've gone out -- our vendors are great partners. They're doing all that they can for us, but the demand trends have been quite robust, and that will be the story. We'll have some longer lead times through the back half of the year. We, of course, are pushing the products that we have more stock on, and we're seeing really strong results by doing that, by showing what's in stock. And I've seen more willing to move into this desk versus that than I ever have in the past. I think customers really want our quality sustainable products, and so they are more flexible about which one in particular right now than I've seen them in the past. We have some areas of the world that are still really struggling to open. And of course, we're supporting them as much as we can, but there's some reality to some of these areas where they're just not fully up and running. Most of it is now, but there's some pockets. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: So I, too, want to add my congratulations on a really nice quarter in a tough environment. \nLaura Alber: Thank you. \nBrian Nagel: So the question I have, obviously, we have the comp numbers, and there was clearly a nice acceleration in your online business as your stores closed in the second half of Q1. Then Laura, you've mentioned that a further acceleration here into Q2. Can you help us understand better just the underlying trend there in the e-commerce business? And really what that sort of, say, that exit rate was coming out of Q1? And then, you mentioned opening, I guess, 364 stores so far. I recognize it's early and there's measures in place. You're not getting as many customers into those stores. But how have -- in those markets where stores have opened, how have sales begun to transition, if at all? Or is that between online and in-store? \nLaura Alber: Yes. I don't think giving you the last 2 weeks' comps is relevant because it's so such a short window, and I wouldn't want you to read too much into it. It is significantly stronger, I'd say that. It's across all brands. So that's good. In terms of stores that are reopened and the impact on e-commerce, results, really again, they vary by location and by brand so it's a little early to draw any conclusions. But we are seeing total strength -- total demand strengthening since the pandemic started. It just continues to strengthen. \nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Bobby Griffin of Raymond James. Mr. Griffin, if your line is muted, please unmute yourself. \nLaura Alber: I think let's go to the next person, if you don't mind, operator. \nOperator: Sure. We'll take Peter Benedict from Baird. \nJustin Kleber: This is Justin Kleber on for Pete. Just given how successful you were at recapturing sales with all the stores closed, I mean, does that change your view of the pace of future store closings and what may be the ultimate size of the store fleet should look like in the future? \nLaura Alber: That's such a good question. For those of you who are new to our story, newer, we regularly review our store fleet. We make adjustments all the time. We have a very high bar for profitability. And as you know, we've been careful in opening new stores. But stores do continue to be an important part of our company. Customers love to experience our brands and products in person, and our talented associates are extremely helpful in making furnishing decisions with our customers. However, as you can see from our numbers, this pandemic has accelerated the shift to digital, and we have half our fleet up for renewal over the next 3 years. So we'll be looking at each lease that comes up carefully, and we will renew where landlords have partnered with us during this crisis and where the economics make sense. In terms of this year, pre-COVID, we expected to close approximately 32 stores, and we see that number being double now. In the next 3 years, as I said, 293 stores come up for renewal. And over the next 5 years, 416 come up for renewal. So we're going to be able to make a lot of decisions based on the malls, what happens, the partnership and the 4 walls that we have in each and every store. And that is, I think, a very strong position to be in. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Oliver Wintermantel of Evercore ISI. \nOliver Wintermantel: Congratulations also on a good quarter in a tough time. I had a question regarding e-commerce as a percent of sales. How high was that at the end of the quarter? And then you mentioned you introduced curbside pickup and you had Buy Online Pickup In Store. What percent of e-commerce is now Buy Online Pickup In Store into new curbside? \nJulie Whalen: So as far as the percent of total revenues, it jumps from -- as you know, we've been trending about 54% of revenues for e-comm and it jumped to 71% in the first quarter. \nLaura Alber: And we haven't given our BOPIS numbers yet, so I'd prefer not to give that today. It's not a huge number. I'd just say it's probably lower than you think. It's a lot more than it used to be, and we think it'll continue to trend. As we open BOPIS and people get comfortable, particularly with our safety measures, we'll see BOPIS continue to grow. But it's a pretty small number still. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez of Telsey Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernandez: Congratulations in the quarter. I wanted to ask also on some of the trends you're seeing. Do you think the stimulus money -- the government stimulus is helping your business? And can you talk about performance in urban markets that have been more impacted versus perhaps suburban and other markets where there's more loosening restrictions? \nLaura Alber: Yes. I mean, certainly, the stimulus money helps everyone. I think the question really becomes how long can they continue to support so much unemployment, which I think is a concern for all of us, particularly in retail, that there's a lot of people who haven't been able to keep paying their teams. And so that has been a good thing for the whole economy. How that affects our demographic specifically, it's harder to say. We are not seeing any specific trends, urban versus suburban. That's not really -- I keep looking at it, trying to glean something, and you'd be surprised how some of the really shut down places are doing and doing very, very well. There's still a lot of demand for our goods, at least in their homes. And we feel very fortunate to be able to fulfill those orders safely. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: A nice quarter. I may have missed this in prepared remarks. Maybe for Julie first. Did you quantify the absolute merch margin change or improvement? And then just as part 2, what have you done with rents and I guess, leases during the quarter in which stores were closed? \nJulie Whalen: We did not quantify the actual pure merch margin, but we did indicate that it was higher than last year, which helped with offsetting some of the higher shipping costs and the incremental impact from the China tariffs that we had within the quarter. So we're being intentionally less promotional, and it's been a big win for us within the gross margin line. \nLaura Alber: And then in terms of how we're working with our landlord partners, we have been working with them one by each to negotiate what is a fair solution during the times that our stores have been closed. And as the crisis unfolded, we expect partnership from our landlords, the rent relief, as we generated no revenues during the closures in our stores. We're very pleased to see that many of our landlords are willing to do the right thing in sharing this financial impact. And as far as how our rent payments have played out, it really depends on the landlord negotiations. And they -- a lot of the really good ones, they realize that one party alone should not bear the burden. And we very much appreciate them. I want to thank them on this call during what's been a very difficult time for all of us. And there's no doubt that this crisis has given rise to permanent shifts in the customer behavior. And as we look at future decisions regarding openings, relocations, closures of our stores, we're going to take into account how landlords have partnered with us during this crisis as well as whether the economics of the deal makes sense. Simeon, were you -- I think I answered your question, but I want to make sure that you weren't asking a different question. \nSimeon Gutman: No. No. You answered what I asked, yes. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go ahead with Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Just a couple for me. On the SG&A line, just wondering how we should think about your advertising efficiency going forward, how big of an opportunity that could be. And then, Laura, you talked about more customer shopping across banners, utilizing The Key program. Just wondering if you could just put some numbers behind that so we can contextualize it. \nLaura Alber: Yes. I'm going to let Felix Carbullido answer that. Felix? \nFelix Carbullido: Sure. We are -- as Julie said earlier, we aggressively managed expenses throughout the organization, including our marketing spend. So that said, we still are investing where we see the greatest ROI. And that includes, as you know, we look at metrics by channel, by brand, and we adjust spend based on customer behavior. I think, while we did see leverage there, we're also incredibly pleased, as Laura said, with our new customer growth hitting an all-time high. So it's a reflection of the past 16 quarters or more than that of increasing our marketing mix towards digital, where we find the best payback. \nLaura Alber: Felix, do you want to comment about The Key? \nFelix Carbullido: Yes. I think, as Laura mentioned, The Key had some incredible results throughout the quarter. And even with stores closing, they maintained the same level of growth over LY throughout the quarter. And so another critical part of our marketing mix and the reason we can be very efficient and profitable is the number of shoppers who are purchasing across our brands. We know that's an untapped opportunity. We're just now tapping into that opportunity. The Key is at the foundation of that program. But we also have a number of events and promotions where we combined our messaging focused around a particular theme. We have our Design Crew who installs in customers with products from across our portfolio. So I think the other opportunity that we're thrilled about is to see the number of customers shopping during these times across our brands. \nJulie Whalen: And Chuck, just to answer the question about SG&A generally. I mean, certainly, we do expect to continue to see advertising efficiencies. Obviously, with these incredible cost cuts that we've done, we do expect that to continue, similar to where we've been with SG&A for a while. \nCharles Grom: Okay. And if I could just sneak one more. And you talked about the pace of business significantly stronger here so far in 2Q. Just wondering if that's been across banners. And then within PB, just anything on bigger ticket items quarter-to-date. \nLaura Alber: Yes. Sure. Yes. It is across banners. And then secondly, what was the second question? \nJulie Whalen: PB. \nLaura Alber: Big ticket. Big ticket. Yes. It's one of those categories that's been interestingly picking up. And so we're trying to judge where it's going, but it's been very strong, as I mentioned, upholstery, outdoor. Across the board, really, all of our big ticket has been incredibly strong. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And I will take our next question from Bobby Griffin of Raymond James. \nRobert Griffin: I hope you can hear me. Sorry about the issues earlier. There was a -- I don't know how to work my headset still. But congrats on a good quarter. I guess my first question I wanted to ask is when you think about the store openings, if the e-commerce demand levels you're seeing now continue at the strength that they are at, what opportunities do you have to kind of scale up slowly, maybe keep some stores dark or reduce hours or labor or whatnot just because the mix of the business would be vastly different still than full operational with store hours, assuming health and safety requirements allow all stores to open? I'm thinking more distance down the road. \nLaura Alber: Right now, we're seeing very strong results in our open stores even with appointment-only. So we have some mall areas that we scale back for different reasons here and there, and we let the stores make those decisions, but it's not to manage payroll. Remember, we're paying them anyway. So we might as well have them working, right? We've been paying them the whole time, full bill. And so it's wonderful to have them there and doing the things they're doing and really giving incredible service. It gives us time to do the sanitation really well and get -- we've been getting higher marks from our customers than ever on our service right now, which is such a proud thing to see during this time. And it's definitely -- even if we weren't paying them all, it's definitely worth having them open. I'll tell you, the stores that are doing well are phenomenal. There are a couple, as I said, that are closing. At the end of the year, there are more than a couple that are closing at the end of the year. There's a couple that we're closing early and not reopening. They were dark before the pandemic, and they were planned to close in January. Want to keep them dark. Didn't make sense to reopen those. But that's a very small population. \nRobert Griffin: Okay. That's helpful. And I guess lastly, on the B2B side of things, can you maybe give a little more detail on kind of what you're hearing from those customers and how they're approaching, I mean, coming out of the pandemic and kind of the opportunity there? It was a pretty good success story heading into this fiscal year for you guys. \nLaura Alber: Yes. So I mean, as you expect, some of our B2B industry verticals have been heavily impacted, i.e., hospitality, and our B2B sales were impacted and were down in Q1. However, we're seeing them come back now, and we're seeing the pipeline build pretty substantially. And people are using this time to get things ready and do some remodels and spruce things up so we're getting a lot of current requests. And we're also -- because we've been operating and we're able to fulfill better than a lot of our competition, we're picking up some of that volume from those who haven't been able to fulfill for whatever reason right now. So we're picking up some other people's business as well. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Michael Lasser of UBS. \nAtul Maheswari: This is Atul Maheswari on for Michael Lasser. So given consumers have probably invested a lot in furniture and home furnishings as they sheltered at home, do you think some of the strong trends that you saw in Williams-Sonoma and PB Teens and Kids is simply demand pull forward that might not necessarily repeat going forward? And if that's the case, would you expect comps to slow even as you open more stores? \nLaura Alber: I mean, look, anything can happen. We've learned that now. You can't count on anything. I'll tell you, I don't believe that. It's not out of the realm of possibilities. I think people, when they learn how to -- they learn a new skill, they generally get pretty hooked. And cooking is one of those things. It's wonderful to learn how to cook. And often, you see people, they move from a beginner chef to someone who is a -- it's a real passion for. And so it's wonderful that people have taken the cooking more at home and enjoy doing it and have been our brands along the way learning how to cook online and joining all of our different virtual places online to both entertain, but also be educated. So I don't see that -- these things don't come and go that quickly. I think people -- they have time now to think about their homes. We're seeing even -- I mentioned the high ticket, but we're also seeing people want to do small decorating projects. I think there's going to be a continued shift for a while out of travel on some of these other areas into the home. And then I think longer term, we have a very, very strong road map and runway for growth that we had before this began, and I still believe it's very, very positive future and I'd say, even more so now that many people are spending more time in their homes. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Marni Shapiro of Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Congratulations on a really great quarter. And Laura, I do think more people are cooking. I made bagels. But from now on, I'd like to buy my bagels. But they were excellent. \nLaura Alber: The bagels will be raw. They're always sold out. \nMarni Shapiro: They were amazing and everybody loved them, and then they wanted me to make them again, and I was sitting there while I was working, and they're all staring at me. Anyway, I'm curious, as the stores are opening, could you just walk us through a little bit, what does the productivity look like? I was in one of your stores yesterday, a Williams-Sonoma that was open. The mall was quiet so it was a little bit harder to judge, but it does feel like retail right now is a little bit like moving through molasses. Everything is taking a lot longer even just to check out. To do anything is taking a lot longer. So I'm curious, as the stores open, even as you start to bring more people in, is it just a slower process? And then a follow-up or a sort of adjacent question is, I'm curious what products -- like what items people feel compelled to come to your stores to buy because your online experience is very rich. And so I'm curious what the items you're seeing people come in to buy versus them buying it online. \nLaura Alber: That's a really good question. I asked that question this morning, Marni. \nMarni Shapiro: I bugged your office, by the way. \nLaura Alber: Marni, our stores are -- God, that's scary. Our stores are so -- our store associates are amazing. And they are so proud to be back, and they're working with these customers. I mean I'll tell you one little short-term thing. I'll probably get in trouble for this. Yesterday, our open stores positive comp-ed. Total comp. So that is like the power of the people. And yes, you wouldn't -- it doesn't look like it, right? It looks very quiet, but those customers who are coming in, they know what they want. What they did tell me today when we talked -- and we're having another big store call tomorrow where we get to hear all their wonderful feedback and thank them more importantly. But the thing is that people coming in, they're shorter visits and they're -- but they're very focused and the conversion is extremely high. So it's exciting. Appointment-only is working for us. I think we're at a different kind of business than other stores that -- where you need a lot more traffic. I think the question really becomes what happens during those times of the year like holiday, where traffic is really relevant for everybody. And that's why we pause on getting too excited, and we want to stay careful about our expense structure and not take anything for granted, but we're seeing some phenomenal results in our open stores. \nMarni Shapiro: Are they buying across? Like are they looking -- are they coming in to buy a couch? Or is it more the bread makers and new sheets and towels? \nLaura Alber: Well, they -- I mean, the bread makers, boy, they -- that's been as you can read in any trade journal. \nMarni Shapiro: Bad example, but yes. \nLaura Alber: It's a great category for everybody. So everybody wants a bread maker. They want an ice cream machine. There's those kinds of things. And then there's not one SKU ever that pops out for us. They come in, and depending on what they're looking for, they're -- there's a lot of variation in what they're looking for. Outdoor furniture is a big one. We all know it's safer to be outside, maybe the only way you can see someone other than your own family. And so outdoor furniture has been a big win for us. \nMarni Shapiro: Fantastic. Best of luck with the summer. \nLaura Alber: They like to see things in person. So where they can go to stores for us, they're going. \nMarni Shapiro: Yes. I saw it in the mall yesterday. People are like, \"COVID be damned, I'm going shopping.\" And people are very respectful. They're very patient when they're shopping. They will wait for somebody to finish at a display before going to the display. But they don't -- they want to be there, and every person in the mall had a shopping bag. \nLaura Alber: Yes. That's been our experience, too, that our customers are very respectful of our employees. And we hope in thanking them and it's a very proud moment. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Jonathan Matuszewski of Jefferies. \nJonathan Matuszewski: Nice quarter. You mentioned robust new customer growth in the DTC channel. Obviously, strong acceleration there. Can you just comment on the profile of some of the new and maybe reactivated customers who have been shopping with you over the past few weeks? How are they similar or different from your customer base pre-COVID? Any things you're noticing in terms of demographics or household income levels or anything like that would be helpful. \nLaura Alber: Sure. I'm going to actually let Felix take that question. \nFelix Carbullido: Okay. Sure. Great. Yes, I will say, for Q1 -- and I'll take the pre and post differences after. But in general, for the quarter, we are starting to see a younger customer shop at our brands. More millennials, more Gen Xers are becoming more familiar with our brands and our offerings. And our West Elm brands, our PB Apartment offering and Williams-Sonoma Open Kitchen, these are all initiatives that we put in place to capture the shift in the U.S. population, and we're definitely starting to see that. As it relates to store closures and the acceleration of customers online, they're very much similar to our core customer. We did see more Gen Xers than we usually see, which is not surprising because they're in the middle of household formation. We did see a slightly more affluent customer come towards the end of the quarter. And I think regionally, it looked like the West after closures performed a little stronger online, but not significant -- not anything dramatic. But those are some of the demographics that we saw pre and post store closures. Does that answer your question? \nLaura Alber: Yes. I'll just add to what you said, Felix. I'll just say that we're in a highly fragmented industry, underpenetrated online. We're taking market share digitally as the industry shifts online because of our marketing investments, our content-rich brand presentation, our exclusive products, high service value proposition, but also because of our sustainability and transparency that has become increasingly important to today's customer. And it's really -- you guys, you cannot underestimate what a key differentiator this is for us and why our customers choose us over our competition. And you can see it whether it's in our baby business, and across all of our brands, you can see how important this is becoming. And we are expanding our commitment to sustainably source materials in our supply chain programs, as you know, like fair trade and worker well-being. And so there's a lot of reasons why they're coming to us now, and it's very exciting to see it, but it's not that surprising when you break down the advantages that we've built over the years and why they would come to our brands versus going elsewhere. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will now take our next question from Adrienne Yih of Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: And let me add my congratulations. It's a tough environment and you're performing exceptionally well. Laura, I was intrigued by the commentary that you made about promotions. Obviously, merch margins up. And as you moved through the quarter, less and less need for the promotions. Obviously, a higher income customer coming to you. As we go into the back half, it sounds like you're going to be chasing that inventory. What specific categories, or is it broad-based, are you seeing that AUR increase? And is that something specific to Williams-Sonoma and your brands? Or are you seeing kind of a widespread kind - people need to be at home, they want to be at home, so they're just buying it regardless of what the pricing is? And then I have a quick one for Julie afterwards. \nLaura Alber: Sure. So I just -- the first thing is that our commitment to value remains one of our top priorities. So we have been busy building into our value categories, making sure that our price-design-quality relationship is stronger than the competition. We spend a lot of time working on this and making sure that we're in that winning position to begin. The differences are regular price sell-throughs are higher. We're not having as much clearance as we did previously, and we have more winners. So we've been working on SKU productivity for a while. I mean you've been hearing us talk about it and getting rid of those SKUs that aren't selling, and we've been more effective on that front than previously, and the depth of the promotions is changing. It's too early to call it a success yet because we've just started to do this and we're testing the waters very carefully. But we simply won't be able to drive as much demand as possibly is there because we won't have the inventory in the short term. So that's -- it's going to be an important thing for us to balance the promotions, drive the margin up and get them to buy those things that we do have in stock. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Okay. Very helpful. And Julie, a question about initial markup and I guess, kind of tied into that sourcing from China specifically. I know you were making great in reducing that. And then Asia, in general, freight, I assume, is going down, but then we're hearing of outbound freight coming out of Asia being more expensive. So can you help us with the kind of puts and takes on that cost of goods, the cost of product line, please? \nJulie Whalen: Sure. I mean from where we are with China perspective, we had said before that we were going to reduce by about 50% the production that we do in China by the end of this year. So we're on target to do that. And we're also not developing as many products into China. So nothing has changed from that standpoint. We have not seen higher shipping costs coming out of China. In fact, they're coming down. So from that perspective, obviously, so you have the lower shipping costs. But on the flip side, you still have the China tariffs, which I know is not the topic de jure, but it's still a significant amount that we absorbed in Q1. And so thankfully, we had the higher merchandise margins that we spoke to earlier to be able to offset that. But hopefully, that answers your questions. \nOperator: And this concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. We do sincerely apologize for today's technical difficulties. I'd like to now hand it back over to Laura Alber for closing remarks. Thank you. \nLaura Alber: Well, thank you all for joining us today, and I sincerely wish you and your families and friends the very best, and we look forward to giving you another update at the end of Q2. \nOperator: And this concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day, everyone. Take care.",

I want to also thank all of our Williams-Sonoma, Inc. associates for their incredible agility, commitment and partnership in responding to this crisis. Our people are at the heart of our company, and we are inspired by how they've adapted to serve our customers in these times. \n In the first quarter, we are proud to deliver an overall company comp growth of 2.6% despite having all of our 616 stores closed for more than half the quarter. Our teams maximized demand online, leaning into new and innovative ways to engage and serve our customers virtually, driving DTC comps over 31% in the first quarter. These results reflect our powerful digital-first platform and the relevance of our high-quality, sustainable products and superior customer service. The strategic investments that we have made over the years give us a competitive advantage in this disrupted environment that favors digital. \n Nothing makes me prouder, though, than to have achieved our results while staying true to our company's core value of taking care of our people, customers and communities. From the onset of this pandemic, safety and pay continuation for our people have been key priorities. In mid-March, we acted swiftly to close our stores and institute work-from-home policies for our corporate employees. And we made the decision to provide pay and benefits to all of our store associates who've been regularly working more than 12 hours weekly for the entire time our stores have been closed. To support our local communities, we have donated food, personal care kits and surgical masks to health care workers on the frontline. We've also raised more than $800,000 across our brands for the relief efforts of No Kid Hungry. We take our responsibility to all of our stakeholders very seriously, and we feel fortunate to be in a position to take care of our people and our communities. \n We are also very focused on our financial health. In addition to maximizing e-commerce, we have made aggressive cuts across the company in expenses, inventory and capital expenditures, and we'll continue to strengthen our financial position while prioritizing investments in strategic priorities. Julie will share with you in detail the actions we've taken to bolster our balance sheet. \n As we mentioned on our last call, we entered the new fiscal year in a strong position. For the month of February through March 11, when the health crisis began to accelerate, we delivered high single-digit comp growth in line with our long-term outlook. After the outbreak escalated and the closure of our retail stores went into effect on March 17, our e-commerce business had breakout comp growth and has continued to accelerate. Total comp growth, including the impact from our closed stores, was positive across nearly all brands, with particular strength in our Pottery Barn children's business, which drove 8.5% comp, and the Williams-Sonoma brand with a comp of 5.4%. West Elm delivered a comp of 3.3%, while our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham, drove a combined comp of 2.4%. Pottery Barn's e-commerce demand was extremely strong and gained momentum throughout the quarter. We also reduced our level of promotions across our brands, which led to an improvement in our product margins for the quarter. Our ability to grow our business in this time speaks to the power of our multichannel platform and our organizational agility rooted in a long-standing culture of innovation. \n To maximize demand online, we've enhanced our digital experience even further. We've expanded our services online, including Design Chat, Virtual Design Appointment and Ask the Expert, leveraging our Outward, Inc. 3D visualization technology. And we redeployed our retail associates to serve our customer in these new ways. These virtual services leverage the knowledge and expertise of our store associates for an important source of differentiation for our brands and enables them to connect with our customers and deliver superior experience online. \n Also, a key part of our success is our omni services, including Buy Online Pickup In Store, which we launched in early 2018. We've also accelerated our speed to market in a number of digital innovations to enhance the convenience of shopping online. These innovations include improvements in product discovery, site merchandising and the search experience as well as e-mail and site personalization, and we have a faster checkout. With the pivot to digital -- excuse me, someone has their line unmuted. I'm not sure who that is, perhaps it's the operator. Sorry. Sorry, guys. I'll keep going. \n With the pivot to digital, we've also deployed more resources to digital content creation. As consumers spend increasingly more time on social media while sheltering in place, we are leaning into this trend by publishing more user-generated content and campaigns in our social channels. We are also producing more live events to engage and interact with our customers in real time. These digital initiatives have contributed to a dramatic acceleration in our online KPIs, such as traffic, conversion and customer growth across our brands. We're particularly encouraged to see our new customer counts up substantially and previously retail-only customers shopping with us online. This gives us even more confidence in our DTC growth trajectory for the balance of the year and our ability to continue to take share. The majority of our first-time online customers are now also members of The Key, our cross-brand loyalty program. We have always understood the importance of retention in cross-brand shopping and The Key is at the center of our strategy. As an indication of the power of this program in driving incremental growth, in the second half of the quarter, online sales from existing Key members nearly doubled compared to last year, while they also maintained their pre-COVID total sales growth levels despite store closures. We've also seen shopping across our brands increase as customers realize the breadth of our offering across our portfolio and are eager to earn rewards wherever they shop with us. Our efforts to optimize our digital experience during this time could not have been realized without the ingenuity and thoughtfulness of our brand and tech teams. \n In the Williams-Sonoma brand, we saw significant growth in nearly all merchandise categories, with particular strength in electrics, cookware, food and houseware. Our content strategy across our digital channels pivoted to relevant topics for more quality time at home, such as recipes, live demonstrations and family activities. Our online growth was driven by a change in our customer profile, which was dominated by new retail primary and cross-channel customers. We also achieved traffic and conversion rates that were similar to our peak holiday season. \n Growth in Pottery Barn Kids and Teen also accelerated even further this quarter. As a business that's already predominantly online, we are primed to meet the surge in demand for children's home furnishing as schools and child care centers closed nationwide and parents turned to us for study and playroom solutions. We also saw continued strength in our baby business and our offering of GREENGUARD Gold certified furniture and organic cotton bedding. At a time when health and safety is more important than ever, we are focused on further amplifying our leadership in the children's home furnishings market in offering sustainable products that are safe for kids and good for the planet. \n In West Elm, we also continue to see strong results. Furniture continued to lead our growth in the first quarter with strong demand for our expanded outdoor assortment as well as home office furniture. To meet the material acceleration in e-commerce growth, we have introduced new social engagement tools and enhanced our editorial experiences and room inspiration content in our digital channels. \n In the Pottery Barn brand, we began the quarter with positive trends in all product divisions and channels. Despite the retail closures, we saw demand accelerate materially through the quarter in our furniture offerings in home office, outdoor, bedding and functional accessories. Our DTC-oriented growth initiative, curated marketplace and apartment assortment also continue to contribute incrementally. The quarter also benefited from our continuous optimization of our digital experience, including improvements in product discovery and site merchandising. \n As we look to the rest of the year, we are optimistic that there are significant lifestyle changes that favor our business. However, there also remains considerable uncertainty. Some of the factors that we are modeling for include the prolonged economic impact this pandemic could have and the incremental cost of doing business in whatever form of reopening the economy takes for the rest of 2020 and the foreseeable future. As a result, we are not issuing full year guidance today. However, I would like to give you an update on second quarter to date. We continue to see robust trends in e-commerce and acceleration across all of our brands. Since May 1, we have reopened a total of 364 stores, consistent with government regulations. In these stores, we have in place strict safety protocols such as frequent sanitization, limitation on the number of customers and associates in store, shopping by appointment and a supply of masks and gloves for our associates. We're also fulfilling customer orders through curbside pickup, which has now been launched in 475 of our retail locations nationwide. Customer response has been strong so far in our reopened stores, driven by appointment-only shopping. However, with strict social distancing measures in place, customer limits will continue to constrain sales in our stores. For locations where retail restrictions have not been lifted, we will keep those stores closed through June 14 and continue to provide pay and benefits for this extended period of closure for associates who have been regularly working more than 12 hours weekly. \n Reflecting on the longer term, this crisis has accelerated our industry shift to e-commerce and given rise to a newfound appreciation for the home. We believe that with our differentiated value proposition of high-quality, design-led sustainable products and our large e-commerce business, we are well positioned. Our resilience during this turbulent time exemplifies the advantage of our unique multi-brand, multichannel platform and our commitment to all of our stakeholders. We will continue to invest to strengthen our digital-first model, enhancing the convenience of our online channels. We also continue to prioritize the growth initiatives that we laid out at the beginning of the year, including West Elm and our cross-brand initiatives, The Key and Business to Business. We entered this crisis in a strong financial position and with clear momentum across our brands. It's moments like these that set us apart from the competition and reinforce our ability to outperform. We are confident that we will emerge from this crisis an even stronger company. \n Thank you for your continued support. I wish you and your families the best. And now I will turn this call over to Julie for more of the financial details. Sure. It's Laura. So demand has been stronger than that, obviously. We are very happy to see accelerating trends, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, across all of our brands. And we're adapting to how we continue to stay very relevant and sensitive during these times to what our customers are looking for and the right tone and giving them the things that are interesting to them while they're at home. The inventory and the world supply chain is a constant challenge in that a little self-inflicted. We pulled back on some receipts when this first happened because we didn't know what the outcome would be, and we thought that was the right thing to do and better to be chasing inventory than have too much. But now with our long lead times, we are going to be chasing some inventory. And so you're going to see us continue to pull back on promotions and balance that and do the right thing. But there's -- we've gone out -- our vendors are great partners. They're doing all that they can for us, but the demand trends have been quite robust, and that will be the story. We'll have some longer lead times through the back half of the year. We, of course, are pushing the products that we have more stock on, and we're seeing really strong results by doing that, by showing what's in stock. And I've seen more willing to move into this desk versus that than I ever have in the past. I think customers really want our quality sustainable products, and so they are more flexible about which one in particular right now than I've seen them in the past. We have some areas of the world that are still really struggling to open. And of course, we're supporting them as much as we can, but there's some reality to some of these areas where they're just not fully up and running. Most of it is now, but there's some pockets. Thank you. Yes. I don't think giving you the last 2 weeks' comps is relevant because it's so such a short window, and I wouldn't want you to read too much into it. It is significantly stronger, I'd say that. It's across all brands. So that's good. In terms of stores that are reopened and the impact on e-commerce, results, really again, they vary by location and by brand so it's a little early to draw any conclusions. But we are seeing total strength -- total demand strengthening since the pandemic started. It just continues to strengthen. I think let's go to the next person, if you don't mind, operator. That's such a good question. For those of you who are new to our story, newer, we regularly review our store fleet. We make adjustments all the time. We have a very high bar for profitability. And as you know, we've been careful in opening new stores. But stores do continue to be an important part of our company. Customers love to experience our brands and products in person, and our talented associates are extremely helpful in making furnishing decisions with our customers. However, as you can see from our numbers, this pandemic has accelerated the shift to digital, and we have half our fleet up for renewal over the next 3 years. So we'll be looking at each lease that comes up carefully, and we will renew where landlords have partnered with us during this crisis and where the economics make sense. In terms of this year, pre-COVID, we expected to close approximately 32 stores, and we see that number being double now. In the next 3 years, as I said, 293 stores come up for renewal. And over the next 5 years, 416 come up for renewal. So we're going to be able to make a lot of decisions based on the malls, what happens, the partnership and the 4 walls that we have in each and every store. And that is, I think, a very strong position to be in. And we haven't given our BOPIS numbers yet, so I'd prefer not to give that today. It's not a huge number. I'd just say it's probably lower than you think. It's a lot more than it used to be, and we think it'll continue to trend. As we open BOPIS and people get comfortable, particularly with our safety measures, we'll see BOPIS continue to grow. But it's a pretty small number still. Yes. I mean, certainly, the stimulus money helps everyone. I think the question really becomes how long can they continue to support so much unemployment, which I think is a concern for all of us, particularly in retail, that there's a lot of people who haven't been able to keep paying their teams. And so that has been a good thing for the whole economy. How that affects our demographic specifically, it's harder to say. We are not seeing any specific trends, urban versus suburban. That's not really -- I keep looking at it, trying to glean something, and you'd be surprised how some of the really shut down places are doing and doing very, very well. There's still a lot of demand for our goods, at least in their homes. And we feel very fortunate to be able to fulfill those orders safely. And then in terms of how we're working with our landlord partners, we have been working with them one by each to negotiate what is a fair solution during the times that our stores have been closed. And as the crisis unfolded, we expect partnership from our landlords, the rent relief, as we generated no revenues during the closures in our stores. We're very pleased to see that many of our landlords are willing to do the right thing in sharing this financial impact. And as far as how our rent payments have played out, it really depends on the landlord negotiations. And they -- a lot of the really good ones, they realize that one party alone should not bear the burden. And we very much appreciate them. I want to thank them on this call during what's been a very difficult time for all of us. And there's no doubt that this crisis has given rise to permanent shifts in the customer behavior. And as we look at future decisions regarding openings, relocations, closures of our stores, we're going to take into account how landlords have partnered with us during this crisis as well as whether the economics of the deal makes sense. Simeon, were you -- I think I answered your question, but I want to make sure that you weren't asking a different question. Yes. I'm going to let Felix Carbullido answer that. Felix? Felix, do you want to comment about The Key? Yes. Sure. Yes. It is across banners. And then secondly, what was the second question? Big ticket. Big ticket. Yes. It's one of those categories that's been interestingly picking up. And so we're trying to judge where it's going, but it's been very strong, as I mentioned, upholstery, outdoor. Across the board, really, all of our big ticket has been incredibly strong. Right now, we're seeing very strong results in our open stores even with appointment-only. So we have some mall areas that we scale back for different reasons here and there, and we let the stores make those decisions, but it's not to manage payroll. Remember, we're paying them anyway. So we might as well have them working, right? We've been paying them the whole time, full bill. And so it's wonderful to have them there and doing the things they're doing and really giving incredible service. It gives us time to do the sanitation really well and get -- we've been getting higher marks from our customers than ever on our service right now, which is such a proud thing to see during this time. And it's definitely -- even if we weren't paying them all, it's definitely worth having them open. I'll tell you, the stores that are doing well are phenomenal. There are a couple, as I said, that are closing. At the end of the year, there are more than a couple that are closing at the end of the year. There's a couple that we're closing early and not reopening. They were dark before the pandemic, and they were planned to close in January. Want to keep them dark. Didn't make sense to reopen those. But that's a very small population. Yes. So I mean, as you expect, some of our B2B industry verticals have been heavily impacted, i.e., hospitality, and our B2B sales were impacted and were down in Q1. However, we're seeing them come back now, and we're seeing the pipeline build pretty substantially. And people are using this time to get things ready and do some remodels and spruce things up so we're getting a lot of current requests. And we're also -- because we've been operating and we're able to fulfill better than a lot of our competition, we're picking up some of that volume from those who haven't been able to fulfill for whatever reason right now. So we're picking up some other people's business as well. I mean, look, anything can happen. We've learned that now. You can't count on anything. I'll tell you, I don't believe that. It's not out of the realm of possibilities. I think people, when they learn how to -- they learn a new skill, they generally get pretty hooked. And cooking is one of those things. It's wonderful to learn how to cook. And often, you see people, they move from a beginner chef to someone who is a -- it's a real passion for. And so it's wonderful that people have taken the cooking more at home and enjoy doing it and have been our brands along the way learning how to cook online and joining all of our different virtual places online to both entertain, but also be educated. So I don't see that -- these things don't come and go that quickly. I think people -- they have time now to think about their homes. We're seeing even -- I mentioned the high ticket, but we're also seeing people want to do small decorating projects. I think there's going to be a continued shift for a while out of travel on some of these other areas into the home. And then I think longer term, we have a very, very strong road map and runway for growth that we had before this began, and I still believe it's very, very positive future and I'd say, even more so now that many people are spending more time in their homes. The bagels will be raw. They're always sold out. That's a really good question. I asked that question this morning, Marni. Marni, our stores are -- God, that's scary. Our stores are so -- our store associates are amazing. And they are so proud to be back, and they're working with these customers. I mean I'll tell you one little short-term thing. I'll probably get in trouble for this. Yesterday, our open stores positive comp-ed. Total comp. So that is like the power of the people. And yes, you wouldn't -- it doesn't look like it, right? It looks very quiet, but those customers who are coming in, they know what they want. What they did tell me today when we talked -- and we're having another big store call tomorrow where we get to hear all their wonderful feedback and thank them more importantly. But the thing is that people coming in, they're shorter visits and they're -- but they're very focused and the conversion is extremely high. So it's exciting. Appointment-only is working for us. I think we're at a different kind of business than other stores that -- where you need a lot more traffic. I think the question really becomes what happens during those times of the year like holiday, where traffic is really relevant for everybody. And that's why we pause on getting too excited, and we want to stay careful about our expense structure and not take anything for granted, but we're seeing some phenomenal results in our open stores. Well, they -- I mean, the bread makers, boy, they -- that's been as you can read in any trade journal. It's a great category for everybody. So everybody wants a bread maker. They want an ice cream machine. There's those kinds of things. And then there's not one SKU ever that pops out for us. They come in, and depending on what they're looking for, they're -- there's a lot of variation in what they're looking for. Outdoor furniture is a big one. We all know it's safer to be outside, maybe the only way you can see someone other than your own family. And so outdoor furniture has been a big win for us. They like to see things in person. So where they can go to stores for us, they're going. Yes. That's been our experience, too, that our customers are very respectful of our employees. And we hope in thanking them and it's a very proud moment. Sure. I'm going to actually let Felix take that question. Yes. I'll just add to what you said, Felix. I'll just say that we're in a highly fragmented industry, underpenetrated online. We're taking market share digitally as the industry shifts online because of our marketing investments, our content-rich brand presentation, our exclusive products, high service value proposition, but also because of our sustainability and transparency that has become increasingly important to today's customer. And it's really -- you guys, you cannot underestimate what a key differentiator this is for us and why our customers choose us over our competition. And you can see it whether it's in our baby business, and across all of our brands, you can see how important this is becoming. And we are expanding our commitment to sustainably source materials in our supply chain programs, as you know, like fair trade and worker well-being. And so there's a lot of reasons why they're coming to us now, and it's very exciting to see it, but it's not that surprising when you break down the advantages that we've built over the years and why they would come to our brands versus going elsewhere. Sure. So I just -- the first thing is that our commitment to value remains one of our top priorities. So we have been busy building into our value categories, making sure that our price-design-quality relationship is stronger than the competition. We spend a lot of time working on this and making sure that we're in that winning position to begin. The differences are regular price sell-throughs are higher. We're not having as much clearance as we did previously, and we have more winners. So we've been working on SKU productivity for a while. I mean you've been hearing us talk about it and getting rid of those SKUs that aren't selling, and we've been more effective on that front than previously, and the depth of the promotions is changing. It's too early to call it a success yet because we've just started to do this and we're testing the waters very carefully. But we simply won't be able to drive as much demand as possibly is there because we won't have the inventory in the short term. So that's -- it's going to be an important thing for us to balance the promotions, drive the margin up and get them to buy those things that we do have in stock. Well, thank you all for joining us today, and I sincerely wish you and your families and friends the very best, and we look forward to giving you another update at the end of Q2."

            "name": "Julie Whalen",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a solid performance in the first quarter, highlighting the strength and adaptability of our digital-first model, the agility and strong execution of our teams and the resilience of our fortress balance sheet. Most importantly, we are proud to have achieved these results while maintaining an unwavering commitment to all of our stakeholders. \n Before I go into our financial results in more detail, I wanted to give you an update on how our team has been responding to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While our priority is always health and safety, we are also focused on maintaining our strong financial health in order to continue to support our associates and customers during this period of heightened uncertainty. From a financial perspective, we have been preparing our business for a number of possible macro scenarios. And as part of our response strategy, we have cut all nonessential business expenses, including the elimination of almost all business travel and other discretionary spend for the foreseeable future. \n In real estate, we have delayed store remodels and relocations and have negotiated various rent reductions with our landlords. And across the business, we have negotiated with our vendors various other expense reductions in technology, in our supply chain and in other professional services. In advertising, we are only investing in those initiatives that drive the highest returns in e-commerce traffic and conversion. And in technology, we are prioritizing business-critical projects that will allow us to further improve our competitive positioning and continue to take market share. These immediate steps we have taken have resulted in our ability to maintain strong profitability despite the incremental operating costs associated with COVID-19 and speaks to our culture of financial discipline.\n To further bolster our financial flexibility, we have also increased our liquidity position. We now have over $860 million in cash as a result of our strong performance and our decision to draw down on our existing revolver. With the support of our banking partners, we were also able to obtain an additional $0.5 billion of liquidity through the extension of our $300 million term loan to January 2022 and an additional $200 million in an unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility. We believe our current liquidity position will allow us to not only support the operations of our business during this global health crisis, but will also allow us to continue to invest in the business and emerge as an even stronger and more resilient business for the long term. \n Now turning back to our first quarter performance. Net revenues in the first quarter were relatively in line with last year at $1.235 billion, with total comp growth of 2.6% despite the impact of closing all of our stores for more than half of the quarter. Growth was driven by both the strength in our business prior to the acceleration of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the overall strength in our e-commerce business, which further accelerated while our stores were closed to end the quarter with a comp of 31.2%. \n By brand, Williams-Sonoma, despite having the largest number of stores across our fleet, delivered a comp growth of 5.4%. Our Pottery Barn children's home furnishings business accelerated sequentially to a comp growth of 8.5% compared to 7.9% last quarter. West Elm drove a solid comp of 3.3%. And while Pottery Barn had a negative 1.1% comp, their e-commerce business has continued to significantly accelerate, resulting in a positive comp in the second quarter to date. \n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the first quarter was 34.5% compared to 35.9% last year. The gross margin deleverage of 140 basis points was primarily driven by higher shipping costs as a result of the substantial shift to e-commerce sales in the quarter and higher furniture sales, which are more expensive to ship. \n The year-over-year impact from incremental China tariffs and occupancy deleverage from the closure of all of our stores, along with the incremental cost to board up our stores and clean our facilities that are recorded within occupancy. Their impact on gross margin was partially offset by higher merchandise margins from less promotions in the quarter, reflecting the enduring appeal of our relevant, sustainable and design-led products. Occupancy costs in the first quarter were approximately $174.9 million or 14.2% of total revenues and relatively flat to last year at $173.4 million or 14% of total revenues. \n SG&A leveraged 80 basis points to 28.1% of net revenues compared to 28.9% of revenues last year, driven by advertising leverage from the ongoing shift in our advertising spend from catalog to more efficient digital initiatives as well as stronger returns on our advertising investments due to the power of our multichannel model. It also reflects the positive impact of the aggressive cost reductions across the business in response to the impact of COVID-19. As previously mentioned, we acted early and quickly to maximize digital and to cut all nonessential spend to ensure that we self-fund our business and continue to support our associates, customers and communities through this difficult time. \n From a profitability perspective, we drove operating income of $79 million with an operating margin of 6.4% compared to $87 million or 7% last year. This resulted in bottom line diluted earnings per share of $0.74. We are pleased to be able to achieve these levels of profitability while continuing to pay our associates and incurring various incremental costs to help keep our associates and customers safe during this pandemic, including providing protective gear and increased sanitation services across our operations. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a strong cash balance of $861 million compared to $108 million last year. This includes the precautionary measures we took to boost our liquidity during the quarter with a full drawdown on our existing revolving credit facility of approximately $488 million. Excluding this drawdown, we ended the quarter with over $373 million in cash, which was over $265 million higher than last year. This reflects the strength of our cash balance as we enter 2020, along with our strong Q1 performance, resulting in positive operating cash flow of almost $54 million. In addition to funding the operations of the business, this cash balance also reflects investing $42 million in capital expenditures as well as returning over $39 million in the form of continued quarterly dividend payments to our shareholders. \n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $1.071 billion for a decrease of 7.3% compared to last year. This reflects our efforts to cut and push out our inventory purchases to preserve our liquidity in response to COVID-19 and the impact of the subsequent outperformance in our e-commerce business. \n Now turning to our fiscal year outlook. As Laura mentioned, given the uncertainty that exists regarding the impact of this global health crisis on future economic activity and customer demand, we are not providing full year guidance today. This is not a reflection of the current trends that we are seeing in our business, which continue to accelerate, but rather the lack of visibility we have on the full economic impact of this pandemic and the wide range of outcomes this could have for our business in the balance of the year. Longer term, we believe this crisis has given rise to permanent shifts in consumer behavior that will benefit our business. E-commerce adoption has accelerated in our category, and consumers are accustomed to spending more time at home leading to a likely shift in discretionary spending to the home and home-related categories such as cooking. These trends, combined with our digital-first model and unique value proposition in the home category, give us even more confidence in our ability to drive accelerated growth and gain market share in the long term. \n With regards to capital allocation, while our balanced approach remains unchanged over the long term, in the short term, we will continue to invest in strategic initiatives that fuel our future growth while suspending capital expenditures that are nonbusiness critical. We have also temporarily suspended stock buybacks until we have better visibility into the longer-term impact from COVID-19. But as a testament to the confidence we have in our business as well as our commitment to shareholder returns, we have announced today another quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per share. \n Going forward, based on the strength we continue to see in our business, we remain confident in our strategy to drive long-term accelerated growth. As a result, we are maintaining our longer-term financial outlook, with revenue growth expected to be in the mid- to high single digits and operating income growth in line with revenue growth. \n Before I turn the call over for questions, I want to express my appreciation to our associates who have risen to the challenges presented by this unprecedented crisis and have quickly adapted to serve our customers always with a commitment to health and safety. They are a key reason behind how resilient our business and financial performance has been during these challenging times. Looking ahead, we will continue to manage our business for the long term, staying focused on our competitive strengths, investing in our strategic priorities and always keeping top of mind our stakeholders, our associates, our customers, our communities and our shareholders. Our response to this crisis has demonstrated that with our multi-brand digital-first model, the agility and dedication of our teams, a proven track record of strong financial discipline and our fortress balance sheet, we will emerge as an even stronger company once this pandemic subsides. \n I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. So as far as the percent of total revenues, it jumps from -- as you know, we've been trending about 54% of revenues for e-comm and it jumped to 71% in the first quarter. We did not quantify the actual pure merch margin, but we did indicate that it was higher than last year, which helped with offsetting some of the higher shipping costs and the incremental impact from the China tariffs that we had within the quarter. So we're being intentionally less promotional, and it's been a big win for us within the gross margin line. And Chuck, just to answer the question about SG&A generally. I mean, certainly, we do expect to continue to see advertising efficiencies. Obviously, with these incredible cost cuts that we've done, we do expect that to continue, similar to where we've been with SG&A for a while. PB. Sure. I mean from where we are with China perspective, we had said before that we were going to reduce by about 50% the production that we do in China by the end of this year. So we're on target to do that. And we're also not developing as many products into China. So nothing has changed from that standpoint. We have not seen higher shipping costs coming out of China. In fact, they're coming down. So from that perspective, obviously, so you have the lower shipping costs. But on the flip side, you still have the China tariffs, which I know is not the topic de jure, but it's still a significant amount that we absorbed in Q1. And so thankfully, we had the higher merchandise margins that we spoke to earlier to be able to offset that. But hopefully, that answers your questions."

[Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJeremy Brooks: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and fiscal '21 earnings call. I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including guidance for fiscal '22 and our long-term outlook. Although we believe these statements reflect our best estimates and all available information, we cannot make any assurances that these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call.  \n Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures along with an explanation of how and why we use these measures appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier today. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our periodic and annual filings with the SEC. \n Finally, the call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our Investor Relations website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer. \nLaura Alber: Thank you, Jeremy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We're thrilled to deliver a strong finish to fiscal 2021, driving record results with a Q4 comp of 10.8% and operating margin expansion of 310 basis points. These results reflect the resilience in our business model as we successfully navigated unprecedented challenges within the supply chain, material and labor shortages and capacity limitations from our incredible consumer demand. This resilience, coupled with continued execution in our growth initiatives, fueled an annual comp of 22%, operating margin expansion of 350 basis points, and EPS growth of 64% to $14.85 per share.  \n Our 3 key differentiators, our in-house design, our digital-first channel strategy and our values, continue to provide the framework for execution both in our core business and in our growth areas like B2B, Marketplace, cross-brands and our global business, which excitingly have all gained traction faster than predicted and demonstrate to us that we are well positioned to continue to take share in this industry.  \n First, let's spend some time on our top line performance in the fourth quarter. Throughout fiscal 2021, we continued a deliberate reduction in our site-wide promotional cadence in all of our brands. Instead, we shifted our focus on delivering aspirational and inspirational content, and our customers clearly responded. This pricing power is entirely a function of our differentiated and sustainable product offering that our customers know and love. And further, despite the highly promotional environment in the fourth quarter, we made a conscious decision to maintain this pricing integrity and not pursue incremental top line at the cost of our merchandise margins. In fact, we delivered gross margin expansion of 290 basis points in the quarter. Further, this pricing power has allowed us the flexibility to absorb supply chain costs and aggressively fund marketing efforts.  \n Our bottom line performance in the fourth quarter speaks for itself. We drove operating margin of 21% and a 37% increase in EPS, both of which demonstrate the durability of our earnings power through execution in our core and growth initiatives, which I'm excited to update you on now. \n Our B2B business continues to outperform, building its book of business to $753 million in 2021. B2B is an underserved and fractured industry as we continue to take share in this white space, servicing businesses that need high-quality, sustainable furnishings at good price points. Furthermore, our in-house design capabilities offering the wide breadth of aesthetics across our brands, coupled with our industry-leading global sourcing and supply chain operations, allows us to take this service to the next level. Our B2B business has tremendous potential to contribute to our results. Our growth targets continue to climb as we unlock new opportunities. And not only is our B2B business model accretive to our gross margin but even more accretive to op margin as a result of the fixed operating costs. We continue to exceed our own expectations for this business. And longer term, we believe this is one of our biggest opportunities.  \n Another contributor to our success has been our global strategy. We're franchise first with strong retail and digital execution. During 2021, global achieved record revenue up 23% over last year with strong earnings growth. Core company-owned markets of Canada and U.K. achieved record results for the year and the quarter. Franchise continues to be a growth vehicle with the critical markets of the Middle East, Mexico and India providing a large diverse growth base. With our systems investment in our new digital platform and large cost reductions in warehousing, transportation and delivery, we expect to exceed our record results in 2022.  \n Marketing is another component that sets us apart and drove results in FY '21. Customers who shop across our brands generate 3 to 4x more revenue than the single brand customer. And we've seen incredible results this past year due to our continued marketing efforts. In fiscal '21, approximately 60% of our sales came from cross-brand customers, a record high in terms of percent to total. And our cross-brand customer counts grew faster than those of the single-brand customer. \n While new customer acquisition is always a priority and continues to grow, we believe we have even more upside by increasing our share of wallet with our existing customer base. Core to this strategy are 3 things. First, our cross-brand loyalty program, The Key. We continue to see record levels of customer engagement and an all-time high membership. Second, our recently launched cross-brand credit card. This card reached its 6-month anniversary, producing cardholder spend and cross-brand activity that has exceeded our expectations. And third, we are focused on personalization efforts in our digital marketing. We continue to leverage our in-house managed first-party data across our brands, which positions us for the cookieless future that is rapidly approaching. Remember, our multifaceted loyalty program generates benefits across our portfolio and is a clear competitive advantage a few of our peers offer.  \n As a digital-first company, we are in constant pursuit of incremental improvement to our customers' shopping journey online. We've improved several product finding and purchasing experiences on our website, from improved room styling, native registry applications and the removal of friction in the checkout process. Additionally, we relentlessly focus on continued optimization and automation in our DCs and logistics networks to improve our service time.  \n On the sustainability front, we take great pride in the progress we are making with our impact initiatives and ESG leadership across the home furnishings industry. Notable accomplishments in this quarter included our second annual inclusion in Bloomberg's Gender-Equality Index, being recognized as #21 on Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies, and receiving an A rating from CDP for leadership in supplier engagement and our work with suppliers on tackling climate change. These commitments are reflected in the high-quality sustainable products that we offer our customers and continue to distinguish our company and our brands.  \n Our values are both central in our actions and embedded in our products. We always want to provide our customers with transparency. And each day, we commit ourselves to maintaining the highest level of integrity and ethical standards. We are deeply saddened by the war in Ukraine, and we stand with Ukrainians and all people who oppose war and its atrocities on family and the home. Related to product and business with Russia, we have no operations in Russia. And as the situation between Russia and Ukraine escalated, our team identified a handful of products of Russian origin, which we are no longer selling.  \n And now let's turn to the performance of our brands. West Elm delivered an 18.3% comp in the fourth quarter with all categories driving strong growth. Customers responded well to new products, including bestsellers in bedroom, dining, storage and occasional categories. Additionally, new categories such as bath, kids and kitchen also contributed to incremental growth. On the full year, West Elm delivered a comp of 33.1%, building to a 48.3% on a 2-year basis and continuing to build velocity in its mission to become a $3 billion brand.  \n Pottery Barn delivered another high-performance quarter with a 16.2% comp, driven by strong core franchises in key categories. Q4 results were enhanced by a strong seasonal decorating business and inspiring seasonal bedding and entertaining. On the full year, Pottery Barn celebrated a record year with a comp of 23.9%, building to a 39.1% on a 2-year basis. Also, we're delighted to report that Pottery Barn has surpassed the halfway mark on its commitment to plant 3 million trees in 3 years to restore vulnerable forests. Our partner, Arbor Foundation, follows the best practices and the latest science to ensure maximum impact and promote biodiversity. And even better, based on the tremendous success of this program, our other brands have joined the effort, doubling our commitment to planting 6 million trees by 2023. We couple this with commitments to responsibly harvest wood and a robust sustainability story.  \n Now I'd like to talk about Pottery Barn Kids and Teen. As we indicated during our third quarter call, we were not entirely immune to the ripple effect from delays resulting from the supply chain disruption around the world. In particular, the shutdown in related backlogs from Vietnam had a larger impact on our children's home furnishings business, which ran a negative 6.1% comp for the quarter. Unfortunately, we expect to feel this impact at least through the second quarter this year. Despite the supply chain pressure, strength in the business includes our baby business, which is delivering growth through our offering of GREENGUARD Gold furniture, along with additional volume from our in-store and online baby registry. Also, we delivered record results in our seasonal trim business as customers enjoy the holidays. Pottery Barn Kids and Teen delivered a full year comp of 11.6%, building to a 28.2% on a 2-year basis. \n Our Williams-Sonoma business drove a fourth quarter comp of 4.5% on top of a 26.2% comp last year, with growth driven by demand for entertaining at home and gift-giving. We continue to focus our strategy on expanding our exclusive product and Williams-Sonoma branded product to drive growth. We are pleased with improvements in the digital experience on the website that are driving conversion, and our store optimization strategy is working. Our high-impact store remodels and our market consolidation efforts are driving improved operating margins. On the full year, Williams-Sonoma delivered a comp of 10.5%, building to a 34.3% on a 2-year basis. One of our key components of growth is our Williams-Sonoma Home business. Given the strength of the Williams-Sonoma brand name, our expertise in the furniture category and the clear opportunity in the high-end home market, we believe that Williams-Sonoma Home is one of our biggest growth opportunities.  \n In summary, we're immensely proud of our accomplishments and record results this fiscal year. I am confident that we will continue to raise the bar and extend this momentum in fiscal 2022. So far, in the first quarter, we continue to see strong sales and margins. We have a robust lineup of growth initiatives and operational improvements planned for this year. And as we look further, we are confident in our long-term outlook, driving at least mid- to high single-digit comps with top line growth to $10 billion by 2024 and operating margins relatively in line with fiscal 2021. \n Before I pass the call to Julie to go through the financials in more detail, I want to thank our entire team for never slowing down. I'm endlessly grateful for their outstanding work, their creative energy and their relentless focus. I am privileged to work alongside this talented group of people. And with that, I'd like to turn the call to Julie. \nJulie Whalen: Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter and fiscal year of outstanding financial results with revenues and profits at the highest levels we have seen. The demand for our proprietary products remains strong. Our growth strategies continue to thrive. Our operating model, which is difficult to replicate, continues to set us apart from the competition. And all of these, plus our proven ability to dynamically operate in a complex macro environment, continues to demonstrate that we are well positioned to succeed long term in this industry.  \n Moving to our fourth quarter results in more detail. Net revenues surpassed $2.5 billion with another quarter of double-digit comparable brand revenue growth at 10.8%. These strong top line results were across both channels, including retail at a 20% comp and e-commerce at a 7.2% comp on top of last year's 47.9% for a 55.1% 2-year stack.  \n By brand, West Elm delivered an 18.3% comp on top of 25.2% last year. Pottery Barn accelerated from the third quarter to a 16.2% comp. Williams-Sonoma drove a 4.5% comp on top of last year's 26.2%. And our emerging brands accelerated to a 30.3% comp. In the children's home furnishings businesses, Pottery Barn Kids and Teen, comps were a negative 6.1%. This is below their third quarter year-to-date trend of approximately 20% as these brands were the most impacted during the fourth quarter by the supply chain issues from the COVID-related closure of Vietnam.  \n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin came in at a record 45.0%, a 290 basis point expansion over last year. The strength of our merchandise margins drove almost all or 270 basis points of this expansion. Our strategic decision to preserve our pricing integrity by eliminating site-wide promotions was once again a clear success. This pricing power enabled us to absorb increased freight and product costs while still delivering strong, profitable merchandise sales.  \n Occupancy costs at 7.7% of net revenues leveraged approximately 20 basis points, resulting from another quarter of higher sales and lower occupancy dollar growth. Occupancy dollars increased 6.7% to approximately $193 million, which includes a full quarter of incremental costs from our new East Coast distribution center to further support our customer demand, partially offset by our ongoing retail optimization efforts from additional store closures and reduced rent. In fiscal year '21, we closed an additional 37 stores and are on track to close approximately 25% of our total retail fleet. \n SG&A also leveraged 20 basis points to a historical low of 24% despite absorbing higher year-over-year advertising costs from our reduced spend last year. Leverage was driven by employment and general expenses, which includes lower incentive compensation during the quarter due to timing and the year-over-year benefit from our ongoing retail recovery, various operational efficiencies during the holiday season and overall strong financial discipline throughout. \n As a result, we delivered another quarter of record profitability with operating income growth of 28% to $525 million and our highest ever operating margin at 21%, expanding 310 basis points over last year and approximately 500 basis points higher than our last 3 quarters this year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $5.42, up 37% from last year's record fourth quarter earnings per share of $3.95. These fourth quarter results, combined with our outperformance we have seen throughout 2021, allowed us to deliver another year of substantial growth and outperformance. \n On the top line, these full year highlights include an additional $1.5 billion in net revenues, growing to over $8.2 billion, including comparable brand revenue growth of 22% on top of last year's 17% or a 39% 2-year stack; e-commerce growing to a 14.3% comp and a 58.8% 2-year comp with our e-commerce mix at 66% of total revenues; retail growing at a 43.2% comp despite traffic levels at negative 16% to 2019; a second consecutive year of double-digit growth across all brands with significant acceleration across our 2 largest brands, with West Elm at a 33.1% comp, Pottery Barn at a 23.9% comp, Williams-Sonoma at a 10.5% comp on top of last year's 23.8%; our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined, delivering another year of accelerating double-digit growth; our global business growing 23% to over $425 million; and our cross-brand initiatives outperforming with our business-to-business division growing 109% to over $750 million in demand and contributing approximately 500 basis points to our total company comp. \n On the bottom line, this top line strength and strong financial discipline throughout enabled us to grow 2021 operating income to $1.5 billion, over $0.5 billion and 52% higher than last year. Operating margin at 17.7% on the year expanded 350 basis points over last year and was more than 2x higher than our 2019 and prior operating margin levels. This was driven by gross margins expanding to record levels or 500 basis points above last year to 44% despite increased costs associated with supply chain disruptions throughout the year. This operating income strength resulted in EPS of $14.85, which was $5.81 or 64% above last year and drove our return on invested capital to an all-time high at 57.9%. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the year with strong liquidity levels with a cash balance of $850 million and no debt or amounts outstanding on our line of credit. The strength of our business generated operating cash flow of almost $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2021, which has allowed us to fund the operations of the business, to invest over $225 million in capital expenditures primarily in technology and supply chain, and to return nearly $1.1 billion to shareholders in the form of $188 million in dividends and 900 million in share repurchases. These decisions reflect our confidence in the sustainability of our growth and our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders. \n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $1.246 billion, increasing 24% over last year, which includes inventory in transit. Inventory on hand increased 14.8% but was still negative 13% on a 2-year basis. Given the significant macro supply chain disruptions throughout the year and the ongoing strong customer demand, we are still below optimal levels. As a result, we expect to see elevated back order levels continue until the back half of 2022. \n Now let me turn to our expectations for the future. As Laura said, we remain very optimistic in the long-term outlook of the business. Our business remains strong as we enter Q1 with momentum in our core businesses and our growth initiatives continuing. As a result, for both fiscal year 2022 and beyond, we are reiterating our previously provided financial outlook of mid- to high single-digit comp growth with operating margins relatively in line with fiscal year 2021. We estimate revenues will reach $10 billion by fiscal year 2024, with our brands accelerating or reaching our prior committed targets faster, including Pottery Barn expanding to $3.5 billion in revenues; West Elm adding $1 billion in revenues to over $3.3 billion; Williams-Sonoma will reach almost $1.6 billion in revenues; and our Pottery Barn Kids and Teen businesses will grow to $1.4 billion. \n This expected top line growth will also be fueled by growth across our strategic initiatives, such as our B2B business doubling to $1.5 billion in revenues, our Marketplace business growing 20% annually to nearly $700 million, our emerging brands expanding to a combined revenue of over $600 million, and our global operations continuing to expand in size to $700 million. And we are confident we can drive this top line growth profitably due to leverage across the P&L from ongoing higher sales growth; additional accretion from our accelerating growth initiatives that have a higher operating margin profile; an accelerating shift online where the operating margin is higher; strong merchandise margins from the pricing power our proprietary and vertically integrated products provide; continued occupancy leverage from further store closures and reduced rents; various long-term supply chain efficiencies, such as automation and better in-stock inventory levels; and leverage from overall strong financial discipline throughout, keeping expense growth below sales growth. \n Our capital allocation plans for 2022 will continue to first prioritize investments into the business and then return excess cash to our shareholders. We expect to invest approximately $350 million in the business, with over 80% of the spend prioritized on technology and supply chain initiatives primarily to support e-commerce, including the addition of a new automated distribution center in Arizona. We also expect to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and elevated share repurchases. \n For dividends, we announced earlier today another double-digit increase in our quarterly dividend, up 10% or $0.07 to $0.78 per share. We also announced our Board has approved a new share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion, which will replace the remaining amount outstanding under our prior authorization. We continue to believe that our stock price remains undervalued given our projections for growth and profitability. This new authorization will allow us the flexibility to opportunistically invest in our own stock and drive long-term financial returns. \n As we begin our next fiscal year, our focus remains on executing against our opportunities to drive long-term elevated top and bottom line growth. We believe we are uniquely positioned to continue to take market share and profitably. Long-term macro trends should continue to favor our business, including a strong housing market driving ongoing investment in the home, an accelerating shift to e-commerce, and the increasing importance to the consumer of sustainability and being a values-driven company. And this, combined with our accelerating growth initiatives, our strong operating cash flow and liquidity and a proven track record of strong financial discipline give us the confidence to reiterate our accelerated long-term growth and profitability outlook and to drive strong financial returns for our shareholders. \n I would now like to also thank all of our associates and business partners for all that they do for our company. It is their ongoing commitment that has enabled us to deliver another year of financial outperformance and to reward all of our stakeholders. \n I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Max Rakhlenko of Cowen and Co. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: Just curious, on the new businesses, what can you share about how much higher margins those businesses are? And then as they continue to grow over time, how much do you think that they'll contribute to the business longer term and offset any normalization that we'll see otherwise? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. These businesses are incredibly accretive to op margin. We haven't disclosed the amount, but it's something that we're super excited about because as you can see, for example, with B2B and the volume that, that is driving and the bigger piece that is becoming of our comp, it has a significant benefit to the operating margin at the same time into our earnings. And so we're very excited about that growth trajectory. \nLaura Alber: And I thought, Max, that you were asking the question about some of our smaller brands. And in the case of those brands, they're still so small that there's actually runway for improvement in their profit profiles because we still aren't big enough to get the great sourcing leverage that we do in our larger brands. So they're very profitable. As you would imagine, they are today but they can be -- we see a really strong opportunity to improve these margins further as they grow. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba of Loop Capital Markets. \nAnthony Chukumba: Congrats to a strong finish to an incredibly strong year. My first question, you talked about the cross-brand and you've got The Key cross-brand loyalty program. Can you just give us an update in terms of the number of members that you have? If I recall it correctly, last time -- last number [ that I know you said was ] about 12 million members. \nFelix Carbullido: Yes. Anthony, it's Felix. I can tell you -- I don't believe we're sharing the numbers, but I can tell you that's significantly up. And as Laura said, program to date, life to date, we're at an all-time high. And with the introduction of the credit card this year, this past August, we're starting to see our dividends pay off in a big way in terms of cross-shopping. We believe this is one of our biggest opportunities as a company. It's increasing our share of wallet. And The Key, both from a multi-tender loyalty perspective and the credit card, are key drivers for that initiative. \nAnthony Chukumba: Got it. And then just if I can get one quick follow-up. Is there any way you can kind of dimensionalize the, I guess, lost sales in Kids and Teen given the global supply chain issues? I mean it's just such a stark slowdown, as you pointed out. \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I mean I think if you did the math, what I had said on -- in my script that their year-to-date run rate was about 20% and -- but for sort of these supply chain issues, we had no reason to believe that their business won't remain as strong. So if -- you can do the math on that and come up with how much immense in the fourth quarter. And certainly, had they delivered where they had come in, we would have been at the higher end of our implied guidance. So it was a decent impact to the fourth quarter, unfortunately. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Cristina Fernandez of Telsey Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernandez: I wanted to ask, when you think about mid- to high single-digit growth in 2022, how are you thinking about industry growth, if any, demand for the home furnishings industry versus market share gains? \nLaura Alber: Sure. No. We all acknowledge there's a great deal of uncertainty in the world we live in today, from rising interest rates to global conflicts. But what gives me confidence is that we operate in an industry that is really large and fragmented. And still, more than half of the sales are generated from smaller brick-and-mortar retailers. And this provides us a huge opportunity. And as we enter the endemic, 2 things are clear to us: people have reprioritized what's important to them and people love their home. And there's no doubt they're going to continue to entertain, cook and work more in their homes. And in talking to a lot of CEOs, I believe hybrid work is really here to stay. \n So whether the total industry grows or not, the macro shifts and changes in the way we live, combined with our key differentiators and our long-term growth prospects leads us to believe that we're going to have the ability to continue to take market share and grow. And honestly, I believe there is no one in a stronger position to disrupt the home furnishings industry than us. \nCristina Fernandez: And then as a follow-up but perhaps for Julie, in your -- the ability to maintain the operating margin this year, should we think about the gross margin and expenses both being in line with 2021? Or will one be better improvement year-over-year versus 2021? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I mean obviously, we're not providing guidance on the line items. We're focused on maintaining our operating margin at these incredibly elevated levels as I think, I said, they're more than 2x where we were in 2019. And so our commitment is to be able to maintain these levels. And so through all the different line items that I went through, we have that opportunity to do it. Some may go up. Some may go down. \n But at the end of the day, because we have the ability to leverage the P&L with the higher sales, we've got the accelerating growth initiatives that I just answered a question about, that as those continue to move forward like with B2B, we have the opportunity to drive that operating margin to maintain at the same levels. We've got our merchandise margins that are incredibly strong. And given our proprietary product and vertical integration, we can maintain those despite higher prices on product and freight and supply chain efficiencies and on and on. There's many things, many levers that we're using to continue to maintain these elevated op margins. And so it will depend which line it lands on. But I would say for modeling purposes, I would hold them flat at this point. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. \nGreg Sommer: This is Greg Sommer on for Chuck Grom. My first question is just if you could maybe give us some color on the cadence of demand throughout the quarter and along those lines, if you've seen any indicators of trade down or fatigue by the customer. And then I have a quick follow-up. \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I mean we did see a really strong start to the fourth quarter. We saw a little bit of a dip during the holiday selling weekend where I think that was pretty common amongst most retailers. And then we came out of that even stronger in January. And as we've entered into the first quarter, we made a strategic decision to not chase the sales. And that's the reality. We could have been much more promotional, and we didn't do any site-wide promo. And so at the end of the day, we still delivered, whatever, 10.8%, double-digit comps with incredible operating margins and earnings. And so that is what we remain committed to continue to do. And we're just excited to see that, that strength is continuing. \nGreg Sommer: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, did you guys provide a demand comp for 4Q? \nJulie Whalen: We didn't, but it's relatively in line. So -- and again, on that, that doesn't mean that we don't have elevated back orders. We still have elevated back orders. We're still encouraging -- incurring supply chain challenges, as Laura alluded to, but the reality is that we haven't been able to bring down those backwards to the level that we'd like. And so therefore, we're continuing to hold those and continue to hold demand in line with net, which obviously we're always paying attention to. We want -- the most important thing is our customer and making sure they get the product in a timely fashion. But from a financial perspective, certainly, it's opportunity as those products come in for delivery. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Kessler: This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. First question, for many retailers, because the expectation for 2022 was that transactions or units are probably not growing but you have price as an offset and a driver, we're hearing anywhere 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% year-over-year price growth. So your sales guy is quite good guiding to growth. I mean we're assuming there's maybe a potential for some real price inflation within that, which means units could be down. I guess is that the right framework? And if it is, how should we feel about that? Does it mean there's more risk or more upside to the guide? And does it mean, if that's true, that growth could slow in '23 if pricing normalizes? So I guess how does that -- what does that tell you? How is that -- how do you frame that? \nLaura Alber: Sure. Good question. So as you know, it's really important to us that we provide our customers a product that is well designed, sustainable and the best value in the market, and that's where we've won. Of course, costs have gone up. And so we -- not only did we stop site-wide promotions, but we've strategically taken price increases carefully where we could. And if prices to us come down, we would give our customers a break on some products because we always want to offer them the best value. Right now, I will tell you that I believe that we are doing that, and that's why our sales growth is higher than our industry and versus our peers. But it's something we're going to stay very humble about and we check it all the time. We're constantly checking our products and our prices versus our competition and innovating to ensure that we have products that our customers can't buy at the competitors. This is a really key part of our strategy. \n As it relates to units versus AUR growth, I expect even though we saw increase in units last year to see it -- to be more flat this year. On the unit growth, that's my expectation. That's what's implied in this guidance. But we are very confident in this guidance for all the factors that we've gone through already, both our differentiators, our growth initiatives and the reality that we have a big back order log that needs to come in sometimes. It hasn't come in yet, but it should come in. And we're thinking \u2013 unfortunately, and I hate to move the state out constantly, but the supply chain issues continue to be many and varied that we think it's going to be at the back half of this year now because you can -- everyone I know is reading the same news and there's all sorts of things that continue to go on. And so our focus continues to be to really give our customers a great service. \n And to that point, while I have the floor, I'll just also make the comment that we are seeing our customer calls to be reduced and less escalations from our customers. So I think despite these disruptions that we all know are occurring, we are still competitively offering faster lead times and we are doing a good job communicating with our customers -- or a better job, I should say, communicating with our customers about the push up. \nMichael Kessler: Okay. Great. That was all really helpful. If I could just ask one quick follow-up. This is maybe more of a technicality type of question. I think your prior language had been talking about the long-term operating margin guidance being at least levels of 2021. I think now we're just staying more relatively in line, at least for 2022. Obviously, the base is now higher than where it was a quarter ago or you guided a quarter ago. Is there anything to read into that or just kind of basic language? \nFelix Carbullido: No. \nLaura Alber: You got it. \nFelix Carbullido: Yes. You got it. \nOperator: And we can go to Jason Haas of Bank of America. \nJason Haas: The first one is just on the B2B business. I'm curious just what trends you're seeing there and how you're thinking about that in 2022. \nLaura Alber: Awesome. So as we said, B2B grew over 100%, and it just continues to go. I think I've revised my estimates every time I've gotten on this call. I decided not to give estimates anymore because I keep undershooting it. That's embarrassing as well. The market for B2B is enormous. And as I said earlier, no one is really doing a very good job. And so because we have in-house design products, which allow us to do specific product development for our clients and also our supply chain, we can deliver it together and give them a great experience and just a couple of fun, different projects, pipeline, book of business. \n So our stadium and arena work continues to build momentum. We had big projects for the San Diego Padres and the New York Mets. In hospitality, we're seeing a promising and encouraging return of our large Marriott brand standard business. In health care, we're building a strong relationship with a big account. I don't think we can say the name yet but we're excited about that. We are doing large residential -- working with large residential developers, like related companies. And a fun one that I really think is great is Churchill Downs, and we're working with Woodford Reserve on that. And then the last, which is also awesome and really relevant, is Under Canvas, which is a premier, luxury glamping company, and we're furnishing their camps across the country adjacent to the leading national parks. So that just gives you a sense of what we're doing. So there's new book of business and then there's the businesses that just continue to go because we have more units and there's also replacement. \nJason Haas: That's great color. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the inventory on the balance sheet being up. I know -- I think it's Julie who touched on it in the prepared remarks, but just curious if you could give any color in terms of how much of that is just inventory being stuck out in the ports versus what you have on hand and just sort of overall how you feel about your inventory position. \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I said in my prepared remarks that about 14.8% of the 24% increase is on-hand inventory. So the delta is what's in transit of that 24%. So a sizable portion of it is still on the water. And obviously, there's been some delays in bringing that inventory in for a myriad of reasons that certainly with our scale and sophistication, we're much better at maneuvering through that and getting it in a lot quicker, more effectively than others, but we're not immune to it. And so we're definitely working through those factors. But certainly, we're nowhere near where we want to be. We're not at optimal levels with a negative 13% of on-hand inventory on a 2-year basis. When you look at our sales growth at a 39% comp on a 2-year basis, we have a lot of room to go. And so it's a huge opportunity for the company. And hopefully, by the back half of the year, we'll be in a much better position. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Adrienne Yih of Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations to the entire team. The year was fantastic. The quarter was fantastic. So Laura, I want to go back to the competitive landscape. And I'd like to hear your thoughts on how much of the industry was in sort of small chains, independents prepandemic. Where have they gone? And then other competitors -- and I'll just name, like RH has moved higher pricing and maybe create some white space. So I really am curious. When you say competitors, can you help us understand like who is the national chain that you compete against for West Elm, for Pottery Barn? Because when I think about kind of where people would go, it really comes down to those 2 names and not a lot of others. So that's my first one. Sorry, it's so long-winded. \n And then, Julie, can you help us out with Q1 shaping? It seems like if you look at normal seasonality, there's more opportunity in Q1 from an op margin standpoint. \nLaura Alber: Thanks, Adrienne. So I wish there was better market data frankly. I mean we try to piece it together. But the -- before the pandemic, we saw even higher amount being done on the street with brick-and-mortar retailers, and it was part of, I think, an investor deck like 3 years ago that we said it's not going to be 80% done brick-and-mortar. It's going to be moving online. And so even before the pandemic happened, we were talking about the opportunity, as people move online, to be one of the clear winners online. And so that is about as much data as I have. I mean you can see it in your local towns where it's changed a lot on the street. \n Now in terms of head-to-head competition, it's really hard to find somebody who does what we do, which is great. But there's a lot of people selling pieces and parts. And the big ones that we -- people talk about the specialty people, but truly, we're thinking about the really big ones who tend to have value-priced products that are not anything like our products nor do they put the whole house together. I'm resisting the temptation to call them by name, but you know who they are. And then the specialty retailers, a lot of the specialty retailers -- first of all, they don't have the same digital capabilities. They don't have multiple brands. They don't have multiple aesthetics. And then also, they don't design their own products, which may appear that they do. They do a lot of other things, I think, well. But they don't necessarily have products that you can't find elsewhere if you try hard enough. \n And so that's really one of the most important competitive differentiators. And then add to it that there's nobody else who -- that makes that Barron's list who's in home furnishing, not one. We're the only home furnishings retailer on the Barron's list of top sustainable companies. And we know our customers care about that, and they'd rather buy from someone who is also sustainable. And frankly, they're happy to spend a little bit more because it's important to them to know how their products are made and what chemicals are used and all those things. And we -- you saw us. I hope everybody saw the new impact report that we put out and all the pieces and parts of improving our footprint. And we're certainly not done, but we're going to continue to step it up and announce even bigger goals when we get up to Earth Day, and I'm excited about those goals. So there's a lot of work to be done there, but we're ahead. We're in a leadership position already, and we intend to stay there on sustainability and high-quality, durable products. \nJulie Whalen: Adrienne, on the Q1 question. I mean obviously, you know we don't provide guidance on a quarterly basis. I'm sure you're asking from a directional standpoint. I don't think there's anything that's really noteworthy to call out that's different than sort of the normal run rate. So I don't think there's anything to highlight at that point. We're super excited, obviously, about the incredible guidance we gave on the year and the fact that we are committed to holding operating margins on the year. So I think that's our focus. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: And then, Julie, just one short follow-up. What is the criteria for closing stores? Because clearly, you are closing four-wall profitable stores, which is, for a retailer, a very, very difficult decision to make. Laura, I know you talked about this before, having a hurdle rate for profitability and that's how you keep driving the profits up. So when you're looking at that 25% of square footage, your stores, how are you making that decision each year? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I mean I think one of the first things that makes us different obviously is the size of our e-commerce business. When you look at other retailers, they don't have that choice. And so we're making decisions. One of the decisions we're looking at is the profitability on our e-commerce business and comparing that to the retail stores. And so do we want that sale in retailer? Do we want it on the e-commerce side? But that's one factor. \n We're also looking at the store. And is it brand enhancing? Is there other reasons to have the store? Because certainly, stores are incredibly important to us from a service aspect for our customers. And so -- but we haven't given out the exact metric, but I would say that's one way to think about it. You know what our operating margins have been historically in e-commerce, and I think that's sort of an interesting spot to think about. We definitely want to make sure that the sale is profitable. \nLaura Alber: And we're really happy to see that, as I said, specifically in Sonoma. But really across the board, our retail optimization strategy is really working. We're seeing the new stores, the remodeled stores beat our expectations, and we're seeing better transfer from the closed stores. And then our fantastic real estate team has -- last year, I mean we renegotiated 90% of our leases that came up for renewal. \n So there's a lot of good stuff going on with the retail profitability, and our teams at retail continue to innovate. I mean I -- we've talked about how strong they were during the pandemic in helping us do Design Chat, design services. Even though our stores were closed, we kept them employed. And they have paid us back in spades with loyalty and passion and creativity, and they continue to be really the face of our brands. And so much of our business is done with these design appointments, and we're doing it now virtually too. And that's something that -- I mean we're not just dabbling. It's a big piece of our business, and it's supported by ever-improving tech capabilities so that people can really imagine how things will look in their home when they're making the purchasing decision and eliminate mistakes that so many of us make when we do a whole room or a whole house. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: Congrats on another nice quarter. \nLaura Alber: Thank you. \nBrian Nagel: So my question -- and I know we've talked about supply chain a bunch already, but I want to just talk about it more. As you look at the supply chain dynamic that's impacting Williams-Sonoma, is it -- do you think -- again, recognizing how fluid the situation is out there, are dynamics getting worse? Or are they staying the same? And then as you think about the duration of this and we talk to you now about the issues persisting pretty far into '22, are there levers that Williams-Sonoma could pull or things that -- that you guys have not pulled yet that from an internal standpoint could help to mitigate some of these pressures? \nLaura Alber: So I mean it's so funny how dynamics are worse. We were talking about this the other day. And our perspective is that this year is going to be about the same as last year, and we thought nothing could be worse than last year. So I would say it's as bad as last year. It's a horrible comment, but I mean we're realist about this. We're expecting it to be stops and starts. We see all sorts of things, COVID stop-and-starts. We see material labor shortages. Now the terrible war will have some impact. And so these are all things that are happening to everyone in the industry in all consumer businesses. \n But the reason we are so confident is that we have an incredible team and scale. We're the 13th largest container importer. We have great relationships with our vendors and our shippers that allows us to expedite production and inventory flow. And we're going to -- we tend to be very worried about what could happen and create contingency plans for these things as much as we can. And so we're also, at the same time, looking at how do we control what we can control better, i.e., time to process an order and to get it to our customer. And that is why we're continuing to regionalize our distribution network so we're closer to our customers and we give them incredible service with even fewer damages. \n There's a lot. I think Julie gave a great summary of all the operating margin levers that we have in our company and -- as well as we've done. We believe there's still a lot of room to improve particularly in the supply chain. And I don't think that we have to -- we can do -- there's many of them that I expect to happen this year. But we also know that there are some things that we haven't predicted yet that are likely to come our way as well. \nBrian Nagel: That's helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, and I guess somewhat related to that, you talked about the, I guess, I would say, lack of promotions. Lack of widespread promotions is a driver of upside to the margins here in the quarter. And I think we've discussed this before, but how do you think about the sustainability? Is the ability of Williams-Sonoma now to drive better, say, full price sell-through more a function of internal initiatives such as the merchandising? Or are you still really benefiting from the supply chain constraints, in a way this lack of product being within the channel? \nLaura Alber: No. It's really, I'd say, more than even either one of those things. It was a mindset shift that it wasn't a good idea to have a price go up and down on a product that you're selling on a regular basis. You will see us take markdowns. We will miss on fashion. We will have things that are overstocked. I know that you've seen us take markdowns. Those are not what I'm talking about. Where we've been talking about not running site-wide promotions that you see others run, you saw many people run during the holiday season. You can still pull them up and look at them now. And really, it's a measure. Our pricing power is a measure of our merchandise and product initiatives internally and the strength of our brands. \nBrian Nagel: I appreciate it. Congrats again. \nLaura Alber: Thank you. \nJulie Whalen: Thank you. \nOperator: And we can go to Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. \nMatthew Mccartney: This is Matt McCartney on for Seth. Just real quick, just want to revisit the price volume sort of equation for this year. Is it fair to kind of think about volumes being down in the first half given the supply chain issues and then sort of picking up in the back half, maybe even growing and then kind of coming out to that flattish balance for the full year? \nJulie Whalen: Sorry. Are you talking about units? Are you talking about -- what are you talking about? I'm trying to understand your question. \nMatthew Mccartney: I'm taking about just pricing aside, just units first half versus second half given the supply chain issues. \nJulie Whalen: No. I wouldn't assume that at all. I think it's just a function of we have incredibly strong sales that we've been chasing inventory on for a long period of time. And so we're continuing to chase that inventory, which is maintaining elevated back order levels, but we're still having strong sales going forward. There will still be unit sales that occur as we move throughout the year. I don't think there's anything to tie the number of units to -- relative to inventory receipts with supply chain in the first half. \nMatthew Mccartney: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one last question here. Just wondering about your ability to sort of pass on price. You're mentioning your pricing power. Is there any sort of a differentiation on a brand level where you're seeing perhaps more pricing power or maybe even less pricing power? \nLaura Alber: I wouldn't -- no. We've been very careful, and there's a fine line. We want to make sure, as I said, that we're giving our customers great value. So it's a judgment by product category. And we're doing a lot of testing in every single brand. And we are seeing success in the pricing increases that we've had to take because cost increases have gone up as well. But we also at the same time -- remember, because we care so much about keeping our range of customers, we continue to increase the amount of opening price point products. So even though something might have to go up in price, we also are bringing in a bunch of opening price point products so we can really keep pushing our customer acquisition. And we have worked with our vendors to really value engineer and still build our same quality and sustainability profiles into these products so that we don't just become a very expensive set of brands. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that's all the time we have for questions today. I would like to hand the call back to the management team for any additional or closing remarks. \nLaura Alber: Well, thank you all. Really appreciate your questions and your enthusiasm and your engagement and can't wait to see you all in person. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We're thrilled to deliver a strong finish to fiscal 2021, driving record results with a Q4 comp of 10.8% and operating margin expansion of 310 basis points. These results reflect the resilience in our business model as we successfully navigated unprecedented challenges within the supply chain, material and labor shortages and capacity limitations from our incredible consumer demand. This resilience, coupled with continued execution in our growth initiatives, fueled an annual comp of 22%, operating margin expansion of 350 basis points, and EPS growth of 64% to $14.85 per share.  \n Our 3 key differentiators, our in-house design, our digital-first channel strategy and our values, continue to provide the framework for execution both in our core business and in our growth areas like B2B, Marketplace, cross-brands and our global business, which excitingly have all gained traction faster than predicted and demonstrate to us that we are well positioned to continue to take share in this industry.  \n First, let's spend some time on our top line performance in the fourth quarter. Throughout fiscal 2021, we continued a deliberate reduction in our site-wide promotional cadence in all of our brands. Instead, we shifted our focus on delivering aspirational and inspirational content, and our customers clearly responded. This pricing power is entirely a function of our differentiated and sustainable product offering that our customers know and love. And further, despite the highly promotional environment in the fourth quarter, we made a conscious decision to maintain this pricing integrity and not pursue incremental top line at the cost of our merchandise margins. In fact, we delivered gross margin expansion of 290 basis points in the quarter. Further, this pricing power has allowed us the flexibility to absorb supply chain costs and aggressively fund marketing efforts.  \n Our bottom line performance in the fourth quarter speaks for itself. We drove operating margin of 21% and a 37% increase in EPS, both of which demonstrate the durability of our earnings power through execution in our core and growth initiatives, which I'm excited to update you on now. \n Our B2B business continues to outperform, building its book of business to $753 million in 2021. B2B is an underserved and fractured industry as we continue to take share in this white space, servicing businesses that need high-quality, sustainable furnishings at good price points. Furthermore, our in-house design capabilities offering the wide breadth of aesthetics across our brands, coupled with our industry-leading global sourcing and supply chain operations, allows us to take this service to the next level. Our B2B business has tremendous potential to contribute to our results. Our growth targets continue to climb as we unlock new opportunities. And not only is our B2B business model accretive to our gross margin but even more accretive to op margin as a result of the fixed operating costs. We continue to exceed our own expectations for this business. And longer term, we believe this is one of our biggest opportunities.  \n Another contributor to our success has been our global strategy. We're franchise first with strong retail and digital execution. During 2021, global achieved record revenue up 23% over last year with strong earnings growth. Core company-owned markets of Canada and U.K. achieved record results for the year and the quarter. Franchise continues to be a growth vehicle with the critical markets of the Middle East, Mexico and India providing a large diverse growth base. With our systems investment in our new digital platform and large cost reductions in warehousing, transportation and delivery, we expect to exceed our record results in 2022.  \n Marketing is another component that sets us apart and drove results in FY '21. Customers who shop across our brands generate 3 to 4x more revenue than the single brand customer. And we've seen incredible results this past year due to our continued marketing efforts. In fiscal '21, approximately 60% of our sales came from cross-brand customers, a record high in terms of percent to total. And our cross-brand customer counts grew faster than those of the single-brand customer. \n While new customer acquisition is always a priority and continues to grow, we believe we have even more upside by increasing our share of wallet with our existing customer base. Core to this strategy are 3 things. First, our cross-brand loyalty program, The Key. We continue to see record levels of customer engagement and an all-time high membership. Second, our recently launched cross-brand credit card. This card reached its 6-month anniversary, producing cardholder spend and cross-brand activity that has exceeded our expectations. And third, we are focused on personalization efforts in our digital marketing. We continue to leverage our in-house managed first-party data across our brands, which positions us for the cookieless future that is rapidly approaching. Remember, our multifaceted loyalty program generates benefits across our portfolio and is a clear competitive advantage a few of our peers offer.  \n As a digital-first company, we are in constant pursuit of incremental improvement to our customers' shopping journey online. We've improved several product finding and purchasing experiences on our website, from improved room styling, native registry applications and the removal of friction in the checkout process. Additionally, we relentlessly focus on continued optimization and automation in our DCs and logistics networks to improve our service time.  \n On the sustainability front, we take great pride in the progress we are making with our impact initiatives and ESG leadership across the home furnishings industry. Notable accomplishments in this quarter included our second annual inclusion in Bloomberg's Gender-Equality Index, being recognized as #21 on Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies, and receiving an A rating from CDP for leadership in supplier engagement and our work with suppliers on tackling climate change. These commitments are reflected in the high-quality sustainable products that we offer our customers and continue to distinguish our company and our brands.  \n Our values are both central in our actions and embedded in our products. We always want to provide our customers with transparency. And each day, we commit ourselves to maintaining the highest level of integrity and ethical standards. We are deeply saddened by the war in Ukraine, and we stand with Ukrainians and all people who oppose war and its atrocities on family and the home. Related to product and business with Russia, we have no operations in Russia. And as the situation between Russia and Ukraine escalated, our team identified a handful of products of Russian origin, which we are no longer selling.  \n And now let's turn to the performance of our brands. West Elm delivered an 18.3% comp in the fourth quarter with all categories driving strong growth. Customers responded well to new products, including bestsellers in bedroom, dining, storage and occasional categories. Additionally, new categories such as bath, kids and kitchen also contributed to incremental growth. On the full year, West Elm delivered a comp of 33.1%, building to a 48.3% on a 2-year basis and continuing to build velocity in its mission to become a $3 billion brand.  \n Pottery Barn delivered another high-performance quarter with a 16.2% comp, driven by strong core franchises in key categories. Q4 results were enhanced by a strong seasonal decorating business and inspiring seasonal bedding and entertaining. On the full year, Pottery Barn celebrated a record year with a comp of 23.9%, building to a 39.1% on a 2-year basis. Also, we're delighted to report that Pottery Barn has surpassed the halfway mark on its commitment to plant 3 million trees in 3 years to restore vulnerable forests. Our partner, Arbor Foundation, follows the best practices and the latest science to ensure maximum impact and promote biodiversity. And even better, based on the tremendous success of this program, our other brands have joined the effort, doubling our commitment to planting 6 million trees by 2023. We couple this with commitments to responsibly harvest wood and a robust sustainability story.  \n Now I'd like to talk about Pottery Barn Kids and Teen. As we indicated during our third quarter call, we were not entirely immune to the ripple effect from delays resulting from the supply chain disruption around the world. In particular, the shutdown in related backlogs from Vietnam had a larger impact on our children's home furnishings business, which ran a negative 6.1% comp for the quarter. Unfortunately, we expect to feel this impact at least through the second quarter this year. Despite the supply chain pressure, strength in the business includes our baby business, which is delivering growth through our offering of GREENGUARD Gold furniture, along with additional volume from our in-store and online baby registry. Also, we delivered record results in our seasonal trim business as customers enjoy the holidays. Pottery Barn Kids and Teen delivered a full year comp of 11.6%, building to a 28.2% on a 2-year basis. \n Our Williams-Sonoma business drove a fourth quarter comp of 4.5% on top of a 26.2% comp last year, with growth driven by demand for entertaining at home and gift-giving. We continue to focus our strategy on expanding our exclusive product and Williams-Sonoma branded product to drive growth. We are pleased with improvements in the digital experience on the website that are driving conversion, and our store optimization strategy is working. Our high-impact store remodels and our market consolidation efforts are driving improved operating margins. On the full year, Williams-Sonoma delivered a comp of 10.5%, building to a 34.3% on a 2-year basis. One of our key components of growth is our Williams-Sonoma Home business. Given the strength of the Williams-Sonoma brand name, our expertise in the furniture category and the clear opportunity in the high-end home market, we believe that Williams-Sonoma Home is one of our biggest growth opportunities.  \n In summary, we're immensely proud of our accomplishments and record results this fiscal year. I am confident that we will continue to raise the bar and extend this momentum in fiscal 2022. So far, in the first quarter, we continue to see strong sales and margins. We have a robust lineup of growth initiatives and operational improvements planned for this year. And as we look further, we are confident in our long-term outlook, driving at least mid- to high single-digit comps with top line growth to $10 billion by 2024 and operating margins relatively in line with fiscal 2021. \n Before I pass the call to Julie to go through the financials in more detail, I want to thank our entire team for never slowing down. I'm endlessly grateful for their outstanding work, their creative energy and their relentless focus. I am privileged to work alongside this talented group of people. And with that, I'd like to turn the call to Julie. And I thought, Max, that you were asking the question about some of our smaller brands. And in the case of those brands, they're still so small that there's actually runway for improvement in their profit profiles because we still aren't big enough to get the great sourcing leverage that we do in our larger brands. So they're very profitable. As you would imagine, they are today but they can be -- we see a really strong opportunity to improve these margins further as they grow. Sure. No. We all acknowledge there's a great deal of uncertainty in the world we live in today, from rising interest rates to global conflicts. But what gives me confidence is that we operate in an industry that is really large and fragmented. And still, more than half of the sales are generated from smaller brick-and-mortar retailers. And this provides us a huge opportunity. And as we enter the endemic, 2 things are clear to us: people have reprioritized what's important to them and people love their home. And there's no doubt they're going to continue to entertain, cook and work more in their homes. And in talking to a lot of CEOs, I believe hybrid work is really here to stay. \n So whether the total industry grows or not, the macro shifts and changes in the way we live, combined with our key differentiators and our long-term growth prospects leads us to believe that we're going to have the ability to continue to take market share and grow. And honestly, I believe there is no one in a stronger position to disrupt the home furnishings industry than us. Sure. Good question. So as you know, it's really important to us that we provide our customers a product that is well designed, sustainable and the best value in the market, and that's where we've won. Of course, costs have gone up. And so we -- not only did we stop site-wide promotions, but we've strategically taken price increases carefully where we could. And if prices to us come down, we would give our customers a break on some products because we always want to offer them the best value. Right now, I will tell you that I believe that we are doing that, and that's why our sales growth is higher than our industry and versus our peers. But it's something we're going to stay very humble about and we check it all the time. We're constantly checking our products and our prices versus our competition and innovating to ensure that we have products that our customers can't buy at the competitors. This is a really key part of our strategy. \n As it relates to units versus AUR growth, I expect even though we saw increase in units last year to see it -- to be more flat this year. On the unit growth, that's my expectation. That's what's implied in this guidance. But we are very confident in this guidance for all the factors that we've gone through already, both our differentiators, our growth initiatives and the reality that we have a big back order log that needs to come in sometimes. It hasn't come in yet, but it should come in. And we're thinking \u2013 unfortunately, and I hate to move the state out constantly, but the supply chain issues continue to be many and varied that we think it's going to be at the back half of this year now because you can -- everyone I know is reading the same news and there's all sorts of things that continue to go on. And so our focus continues to be to really give our customers a great service. \n And to that point, while I have the floor, I'll just also make the comment that we are seeing our customer calls to be reduced and less escalations from our customers. So I think despite these disruptions that we all know are occurring, we are still competitively offering faster lead times and we are doing a good job communicating with our customers -- or a better job, I should say, communicating with our customers about the push up. You got it. Awesome. So as we said, B2B grew over 100%, and it just continues to go. I think I've revised my estimates every time I've gotten on this call. I decided not to give estimates anymore because I keep undershooting it. That's embarrassing as well. The market for B2B is enormous. And as I said earlier, no one is really doing a very good job. And so because we have in-house design products, which allow us to do specific product development for our clients and also our supply chain, we can deliver it together and give them a great experience and just a couple of fun, different projects, pipeline, book of business. \n So our stadium and arena work continues to build momentum. We had big projects for the San Diego Padres and the New York Mets. In hospitality, we're seeing a promising and encouraging return of our large Marriott brand standard business. In health care, we're building a strong relationship with a big account. I don't think we can say the name yet but we're excited about that. We are doing large residential -- working with large residential developers, like related companies. And a fun one that I really think is great is Churchill Downs, and we're working with Woodford Reserve on that. And then the last, which is also awesome and really relevant, is Under Canvas, which is a premier, luxury glamping company, and we're furnishing their camps across the country adjacent to the leading national parks. So that just gives you a sense of what we're doing. So there's new book of business and then there's the businesses that just continue to go because we have more units and there's also replacement. Thanks, Adrienne. So I wish there was better market data frankly. I mean we try to piece it together. But the -- before the pandemic, we saw even higher amount being done on the street with brick-and-mortar retailers, and it was part of, I think, an investor deck like 3 years ago that we said it's not going to be 80% done brick-and-mortar. It's going to be moving online. And so even before the pandemic happened, we were talking about the opportunity, as people move online, to be one of the clear winners online. And so that is about as much data as I have. I mean you can see it in your local towns where it's changed a lot on the street. \n Now in terms of head-to-head competition, it's really hard to find somebody who does what we do, which is great. But there's a lot of people selling pieces and parts. And the big ones that we -- people talk about the specialty people, but truly, we're thinking about the really big ones who tend to have value-priced products that are not anything like our products nor do they put the whole house together. I'm resisting the temptation to call them by name, but you know who they are. And then the specialty retailers, a lot of the specialty retailers -- first of all, they don't have the same digital capabilities. They don't have multiple brands. They don't have multiple aesthetics. And then also, they don't design their own products, which may appear that they do. They do a lot of other things, I think, well. But they don't necessarily have products that you can't find elsewhere if you try hard enough. \n And so that's really one of the most important competitive differentiators. And then add to it that there's nobody else who -- that makes that Barron's list who's in home furnishing, not one. We're the only home furnishings retailer on the Barron's list of top sustainable companies. And we know our customers care about that, and they'd rather buy from someone who is also sustainable. And frankly, they're happy to spend a little bit more because it's important to them to know how their products are made and what chemicals are used and all those things. And we -- you saw us. I hope everybody saw the new impact report that we put out and all the pieces and parts of improving our footprint. And we're certainly not done, but we're going to continue to step it up and announce even bigger goals when we get up to Earth Day, and I'm excited about those goals. So there's a lot of work to be done there, but we're ahead. We're in a leadership position already, and we intend to stay there on sustainability and high-quality, durable products. And we're really happy to see that, as I said, specifically in Sonoma. But really across the board, our retail optimization strategy is really working. We're seeing the new stores, the remodeled stores beat our expectations, and we're seeing better transfer from the closed stores. And then our fantastic real estate team has -- last year, I mean we renegotiated 90% of our leases that came up for renewal. \n So there's a lot of good stuff going on with the retail profitability, and our teams at retail continue to innovate. I mean I -- we've talked about how strong they were during the pandemic in helping us do Design Chat, design services. Even though our stores were closed, we kept them employed. And they have paid us back in spades with loyalty and passion and creativity, and they continue to be really the face of our brands. And so much of our business is done with these design appointments, and we're doing it now virtually too. And that's something that -- I mean we're not just dabbling. It's a big piece of our business, and it's supported by ever-improving tech capabilities so that people can really imagine how things will look in their home when they're making the purchasing decision and eliminate mistakes that so many of us make when we do a whole room or a whole house. Thank you. So I mean it's so funny how dynamics are worse. We were talking about this the other day. And our perspective is that this year is going to be about the same as last year, and we thought nothing could be worse than last year. So I would say it's as bad as last year. It's a horrible comment, but I mean we're realist about this. We're expecting it to be stops and starts. We see all sorts of things, COVID stop-and-starts. We see material labor shortages. Now the terrible war will have some impact. And so these are all things that are happening to everyone in the industry in all consumer businesses. \n But the reason we are so confident is that we have an incredible team and scale. We're the 13th largest container importer. We have great relationships with our vendors and our shippers that allows us to expedite production and inventory flow. And we're going to -- we tend to be very worried about what could happen and create contingency plans for these things as much as we can. And so we're also, at the same time, looking at how do we control what we can control better, i.e., time to process an order and to get it to our customer. And that is why we're continuing to regionalize our distribution network so we're closer to our customers and we give them incredible service with even fewer damages. \n There's a lot. I think Julie gave a great summary of all the operating margin levers that we have in our company and -- as well as we've done. We believe there's still a lot of room to improve particularly in the supply chain. And I don't think that we have to -- we can do -- there's many of them that I expect to happen this year. But we also know that there are some things that we haven't predicted yet that are likely to come our way as well. No. It's really, I'd say, more than even either one of those things. It was a mindset shift that it wasn't a good idea to have a price go up and down on a product that you're selling on a regular basis. You will see us take markdowns. We will miss on fashion. We will have things that are overstocked. I know that you've seen us take markdowns. Those are not what I'm talking about. Where we've been talking about not running site-wide promotions that you see others run, you saw many people run during the holiday season. You can still pull them up and look at them now. And really, it's a measure. Our pricing power is a measure of our merchandise and product initiatives internally and the strength of our brands. Thank you. I wouldn't -- no. We've been very careful, and there's a fine line. We want to make sure, as I said, that we're giving our customers great value. So it's a judgment by product category. And we're doing a lot of testing in every single brand. And we are seeing success in the pricing increases that we've had to take because cost increases have gone up as well. But we also at the same time -- remember, because we care so much about keeping our range of customers, we continue to increase the amount of opening price point products. So even though something might have to go up in price, we also are bringing in a bunch of opening price point products so we can really keep pushing our customer acquisition. And we have worked with our vendors to really value engineer and still build our same quality and sustainability profiles into these products so that we don't just become a very expensive set of brands. Well, thank you all. Really appreciate your questions and your enthusiasm and your engagement and can't wait to see you all in person."

            "name": "Julie Whalen",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter and fiscal year of outstanding financial results with revenues and profits at the highest levels we have seen. The demand for our proprietary products remains strong. Our growth strategies continue to thrive. Our operating model, which is difficult to replicate, continues to set us apart from the competition. And all of these, plus our proven ability to dynamically operate in a complex macro environment, continues to demonstrate that we are well positioned to succeed long term in this industry.  \n Moving to our fourth quarter results in more detail. Net revenues surpassed $2.5 billion with another quarter of double-digit comparable brand revenue growth at 10.8%. These strong top line results were across both channels, including retail at a 20% comp and e-commerce at a 7.2% comp on top of last year's 47.9% for a 55.1% 2-year stack.  \n By brand, West Elm delivered an 18.3% comp on top of 25.2% last year. Pottery Barn accelerated from the third quarter to a 16.2% comp. Williams-Sonoma drove a 4.5% comp on top of last year's 26.2%. And our emerging brands accelerated to a 30.3% comp. In the children's home furnishings businesses, Pottery Barn Kids and Teen, comps were a negative 6.1%. This is below their third quarter year-to-date trend of approximately 20% as these brands were the most impacted during the fourth quarter by the supply chain issues from the COVID-related closure of Vietnam.  \n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin came in at a record 45.0%, a 290 basis point expansion over last year. The strength of our merchandise margins drove almost all or 270 basis points of this expansion. Our strategic decision to preserve our pricing integrity by eliminating site-wide promotions was once again a clear success. This pricing power enabled us to absorb increased freight and product costs while still delivering strong, profitable merchandise sales.  \n Occupancy costs at 7.7% of net revenues leveraged approximately 20 basis points, resulting from another quarter of higher sales and lower occupancy dollar growth. Occupancy dollars increased 6.7% to approximately $193 million, which includes a full quarter of incremental costs from our new East Coast distribution center to further support our customer demand, partially offset by our ongoing retail optimization efforts from additional store closures and reduced rent. In fiscal year '21, we closed an additional 37 stores and are on track to close approximately 25% of our total retail fleet. \n SG&A also leveraged 20 basis points to a historical low of 24% despite absorbing higher year-over-year advertising costs from our reduced spend last year. Leverage was driven by employment and general expenses, which includes lower incentive compensation during the quarter due to timing and the year-over-year benefit from our ongoing retail recovery, various operational efficiencies during the holiday season and overall strong financial discipline throughout. \n As a result, we delivered another quarter of record profitability with operating income growth of 28% to $525 million and our highest ever operating margin at 21%, expanding 310 basis points over last year and approximately 500 basis points higher than our last 3 quarters this year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $5.42, up 37% from last year's record fourth quarter earnings per share of $3.95. These fourth quarter results, combined with our outperformance we have seen throughout 2021, allowed us to deliver another year of substantial growth and outperformance. \n On the top line, these full year highlights include an additional $1.5 billion in net revenues, growing to over $8.2 billion, including comparable brand revenue growth of 22% on top of last year's 17% or a 39% 2-year stack; e-commerce growing to a 14.3% comp and a 58.8% 2-year comp with our e-commerce mix at 66% of total revenues; retail growing at a 43.2% comp despite traffic levels at negative 16% to 2019; a second consecutive year of double-digit growth across all brands with significant acceleration across our 2 largest brands, with West Elm at a 33.1% comp, Pottery Barn at a 23.9% comp, Williams-Sonoma at a 10.5% comp on top of last year's 23.8%; our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined, delivering another year of accelerating double-digit growth; our global business growing 23% to over $425 million; and our cross-brand initiatives outperforming with our business-to-business division growing 109% to over $750 million in demand and contributing approximately 500 basis points to our total company comp. \n On the bottom line, this top line strength and strong financial discipline throughout enabled us to grow 2021 operating income to $1.5 billion, over $0.5 billion and 52% higher than last year. Operating margin at 17.7% on the year expanded 350 basis points over last year and was more than 2x higher than our 2019 and prior operating margin levels. This was driven by gross margins expanding to record levels or 500 basis points above last year to 44% despite increased costs associated with supply chain disruptions throughout the year. This operating income strength resulted in EPS of $14.85, which was $5.81 or 64% above last year and drove our return on invested capital to an all-time high at 57.9%. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the year with strong liquidity levels with a cash balance of $850 million and no debt or amounts outstanding on our line of credit. The strength of our business generated operating cash flow of almost $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2021, which has allowed us to fund the operations of the business, to invest over $225 million in capital expenditures primarily in technology and supply chain, and to return nearly $1.1 billion to shareholders in the form of $188 million in dividends and 900 million in share repurchases. These decisions reflect our confidence in the sustainability of our growth and our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders. \n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $1.246 billion, increasing 24% over last year, which includes inventory in transit. Inventory on hand increased 14.8% but was still negative 13% on a 2-year basis. Given the significant macro supply chain disruptions throughout the year and the ongoing strong customer demand, we are still below optimal levels. As a result, we expect to see elevated back order levels continue until the back half of 2022. \n Now let me turn to our expectations for the future. As Laura said, we remain very optimistic in the long-term outlook of the business. Our business remains strong as we enter Q1 with momentum in our core businesses and our growth initiatives continuing. As a result, for both fiscal year 2022 and beyond, we are reiterating our previously provided financial outlook of mid- to high single-digit comp growth with operating margins relatively in line with fiscal year 2021. We estimate revenues will reach $10 billion by fiscal year 2024, with our brands accelerating or reaching our prior committed targets faster, including Pottery Barn expanding to $3.5 billion in revenues; West Elm adding $1 billion in revenues to over $3.3 billion; Williams-Sonoma will reach almost $1.6 billion in revenues; and our Pottery Barn Kids and Teen businesses will grow to $1.4 billion. \n This expected top line growth will also be fueled by growth across our strategic initiatives, such as our B2B business doubling to $1.5 billion in revenues, our Marketplace business growing 20% annually to nearly $700 million, our emerging brands expanding to a combined revenue of over $600 million, and our global operations continuing to expand in size to $700 million. And we are confident we can drive this top line growth profitably due to leverage across the P&L from ongoing higher sales growth; additional accretion from our accelerating growth initiatives that have a higher operating margin profile; an accelerating shift online where the operating margin is higher; strong merchandise margins from the pricing power our proprietary and vertically integrated products provide; continued occupancy leverage from further store closures and reduced rents; various long-term supply chain efficiencies, such as automation and better in-stock inventory levels; and leverage from overall strong financial discipline throughout, keeping expense growth below sales growth. \n Our capital allocation plans for 2022 will continue to first prioritize investments into the business and then return excess cash to our shareholders. We expect to invest approximately $350 million in the business, with over 80% of the spend prioritized on technology and supply chain initiatives primarily to support e-commerce, including the addition of a new automated distribution center in Arizona. We also expect to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and elevated share repurchases. \n For dividends, we announced earlier today another double-digit increase in our quarterly dividend, up 10% or $0.07 to $0.78 per share. We also announced our Board has approved a new share repurchase authorization to $1.5 billion, which will replace the remaining amount outstanding under our prior authorization. We continue to believe that our stock price remains undervalued given our projections for growth and profitability. This new authorization will allow us the flexibility to opportunistically invest in our own stock and drive long-term financial returns. \n As we begin our next fiscal year, our focus remains on executing against our opportunities to drive long-term elevated top and bottom line growth. We believe we are uniquely positioned to continue to take market share and profitably. Long-term macro trends should continue to favor our business, including a strong housing market driving ongoing investment in the home, an accelerating shift to e-commerce, and the increasing importance to the consumer of sustainability and being a values-driven company. And this, combined with our accelerating growth initiatives, our strong operating cash flow and liquidity and a proven track record of strong financial discipline give us the confidence to reiterate our accelerated long-term growth and profitability outlook and to drive strong financial returns for our shareholders. \n I would now like to also thank all of our associates and business partners for all that they do for our company. It is their ongoing commitment that has enabled us to deliver another year of financial outperformance and to reward all of our stakeholders. \n I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Yes. These businesses are incredibly accretive to op margin. We haven't disclosed the amount, but it's something that we're super excited about because as you can see, for example, with B2B and the volume that, that is driving and the bigger piece that is becoming of our comp, it has a significant benefit to the operating margin at the same time into our earnings. And so we're very excited about that growth trajectory. Yes. I mean I think if you did the math, what I had said on -- in my script that their year-to-date run rate was about 20% and -- but for sort of these supply chain issues, we had no reason to believe that their business won't remain as strong. So if -- you can do the math on that and come up with how much immense in the fourth quarter. And certainly, had they delivered where they had come in, we would have been at the higher end of our implied guidance. So it was a decent impact to the fourth quarter, unfortunately. Yes. I mean obviously, we're not providing guidance on the line items. We're focused on maintaining our operating margin at these incredibly elevated levels as I think, I said, they're more than 2x where we were in 2019. And so our commitment is to be able to maintain these levels. And so through all the different line items that I went through, we have that opportunity to do it. Some may go up. Some may go down. \n But at the end of the day, because we have the ability to leverage the P&L with the higher sales, we've got the accelerating growth initiatives that I just answered a question about, that as those continue to move forward like with B2B, we have the opportunity to drive that operating margin to maintain at the same levels. We've got our merchandise margins that are incredibly strong. And given our proprietary product and vertical integration, we can maintain those despite higher prices on product and freight and supply chain efficiencies and on and on. There's many things, many levers that we're using to continue to maintain these elevated op margins. And so it will depend which line it lands on. But I would say for modeling purposes, I would hold them flat at this point. Yes. I mean we did see a really strong start to the fourth quarter. We saw a little bit of a dip during the holiday selling weekend where I think that was pretty common amongst most retailers. And then we came out of that even stronger in January. And as we've entered into the first quarter, we made a strategic decision to not chase the sales. And that's the reality. We could have been much more promotional, and we didn't do any site-wide promo. And so at the end of the day, we still delivered, whatever, 10.8%, double-digit comps with incredible operating margins and earnings. And so that is what we remain committed to continue to do. And we're just excited to see that, that strength is continuing. We didn't, but it's relatively in line. So -- and again, on that, that doesn't mean that we don't have elevated back orders. We still have elevated back orders. We're still encouraging -- incurring supply chain challenges, as Laura alluded to, but the reality is that we haven't been able to bring down those backwards to the level that we'd like. And so therefore, we're continuing to hold those and continue to hold demand in line with net, which obviously we're always paying attention to. We want -- the most important thing is our customer and making sure they get the product in a timely fashion. But from a financial perspective, certainly, it's opportunity as those products come in for delivery. Yes. I said in my prepared remarks that about 14.8% of the 24% increase is on-hand inventory. So the delta is what's in transit of that 24%. So a sizable portion of it is still on the water. And obviously, there's been some delays in bringing that inventory in for a myriad of reasons that certainly with our scale and sophistication, we're much better at maneuvering through that and getting it in a lot quicker, more effectively than others, but we're not immune to it. And so we're definitely working through those factors. But certainly, we're nowhere near where we want to be. We're not at optimal levels with a negative 13% of on-hand inventory on a 2-year basis. When you look at our sales growth at a 39% comp on a 2-year basis, we have a lot of room to go. And so it's a huge opportunity for the company. And hopefully, by the back half of the year, we'll be in a much better position. Adrienne, on the Q1 question. I mean obviously, you know we don't provide guidance on a quarterly basis. I'm sure you're asking from a directional standpoint. I don't think there's anything that's really noteworthy to call out that's different than sort of the normal run rate. So I don't think there's anything to highlight at that point. We're super excited, obviously, about the incredible guidance we gave on the year and the fact that we are committed to holding operating margins on the year. So I think that's our focus. Yes. I mean I think one of the first things that makes us different obviously is the size of our e-commerce business. When you look at other retailers, they don't have that choice. And so we're making decisions. One of the decisions we're looking at is the profitability on our e-commerce business and comparing that to the retail stores. And so do we want that sale in retailer? Do we want it on the e-commerce side? But that's one factor. \n We're also looking at the store. And is it brand enhancing? Is there other reasons to have the store? Because certainly, stores are incredibly important to us from a service aspect for our customers. And so -- but we haven't given out the exact metric, but I would say that's one way to think about it. You know what our operating margins have been historically in e-commerce, and I think that's sort of an interesting spot to think about. We definitely want to make sure that the sale is profitable. Thank you. Sorry. Are you talking about units? Are you talking about -- what are you talking about? I'm trying to understand your question. No. I wouldn't assume that at all. I think it's just a function of we have incredibly strong sales that we've been chasing inventory on for a long period of time. And so we're continuing to chase that inventory, which is maintaining elevated back order levels, but we're still having strong sales going forward. There will still be unit sales that occur as we move throughout the year. I don't think there's anything to tie the number of units to -- relative to inventory receipts with supply chain in the first half."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Williams-Sonoma Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nUnknown Executive: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021. Although we believe these statements reflect our best estimates and all available information, we cannot make any assurances that these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call.\n Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures for the most directly comparable GAAP measures, along with an explanation of how and why we use these measures, appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier today. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our periodic and annual financials with the SEC.\n Finally, the call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our IR website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer. \nLaura Alber: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We're extremely proud to deliver yet another quarter of outperformance with comps of 16.9%, building to an accelerated 2-year stack of 41.3% and operating margin expansion of 60 basis points. These results are a function of both the advantages of our distinctive positioning in the market and our successful execution against our long-term growth strategy. Furthermore, our performance demonstrates that we continue to take share in a fractured market and deliver high-quality, sustainable earnings. As a result, we are raising our full year outlook to reflect revenue growth of 22% to 23% and operating margins of 16.9% to 17.1%.\n Customers are clearly responding to our products and channel strategies, and we expect to drive an outstanding finish to the year and beyond.\n On the macro front, the industry remains large and fragmented, with more than half of its sales generated from smaller brick-and-mortar retailers. We are one of the strongest market players and have incredible opportunity to capture more of an almost $1 trillion market opportunity. We are at a pivotal point of change, both in the way we live and work, and we will intensely focus on our unique ability to capitalize on this change and, in turn, capture market share.\n The housing market continues to hold strong with purchases of larger first and second homes. Additionally, hybrid work arrangements continue to gain traction as a permanent work model. Both of these trends result in a stronger need and desire to outfit the home for working, entertaining and cooking. In addition, another large point of disruption is the shift of the consumers to make purchases online. Certain factors continue to bolster the shift in behavior, including the lasting impact of the stay-at-home dynamic of the pandemic and the entrance of the millennial generation into their home formation years, a customer segment who naturally gravitates towards digital purchasing.\n In an industry occupied by market players who have not yet made significant investment in their e-commerce capabilities and pure e-commerce players without the service element of our retail business, we believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend as a digital first, but not digital-only company. Our incredible store shopping experience satisfies our cross-channel customers who shop both online and in-store. Our customers continue to place importance on and in many instances, demand the prioritization of sustainability.\n In fact, almost 70% of consumers today want to support brands that are purpose driven and doing good in the world we share. Our company is committed to being a value led, sustainable company and is proud to be a leader in the home furnishing industry.\n In short, the fragmented industry, the strong housing market, the shift of the consumer online and the consumer demand for sustainability provides specific unique and sizable opportunities for our company to continue to grow. And these macro trends are a perfect fit with our key differentiators. Our in-house design capabilities, along with our depth ability to value engineer our products, allows us to offer exclusive, relevant and high-quality products.\n Our channel strategy provides a competitive edge in scaling the business into the future compared to both the retail and marketplace dominant players. And of course, our values, which are deeply rooted in sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion, are embedded in our products and central in our actions. These principles have been and will continue to be fundamental and nonnegotiable to the customers and communities we serve. This, combined with our growth strategies, not only provide for sizable opportunities to grow our core businesses, but also to drive momentum in reaching new customers, geographies and industries.\n This expansion and diversification of our customer base presents many exciting opportunities to deliver solutions for underserved spaces and places, from B2B which brings an exciting new customer profile, to our global business which drives expansion across new geographies, to our cross-brand and marketplace opportunities which expands the reach of our current base and the expansion of Williams-Sonoma Home, which attends to an underserved, high-end luxury market and has massive future potential for scaling. We have, in fact, many opportunities to drive our business forward into the next chapter of growth.\n Simply put, it's these macro shifts, combined with our key differentiators and our long-term growth prospects that result in us strongly believing in our ability to continue to take market share and deliver earnings well into the future.\n Before we talk about Q3, let's take a minute to review the supply chain, which I know is top of mind for all. It is no surprise that we have been intensely focused on the supply chain bottlenecks around the world. Like all companies, we are not immune to the ripple effect from these short-term and long-term delays.\n I want to share with you our status and the extraordinary accomplishments of the team. Our upholstery lead times continue to improve and are industry-leading as a result of our in-house domestic capabilities. Our immediate and decisive responsiveness, our strong long-term vendor relationships and our scale have all minimized production and delivery delays relative to our competition. And as a result, approximately 85% of our holiday receipts have already been received. And finally, when we have delays, customer service is our priority, which has resulted in declines in escalations, cancellations and calls into the care center.\n All that said, I do want to highlight some important challenges we are facing as a result of this supply chain disruption. First, as you know, we sourced a sizable amount of inventory out of Vietnam, which was recently shut down for 3 months. This country has since reopened, but is experiencing significant backlog across factories as they ramp up. As a result, we are experiencing some inventory delays, particularly in our children's home furnishings businesses. Second, given the ongoing strong demand we are seeing across our business and the impact of the Vietnam delays, we do not expect full recovery of our inventory levels until the middle of 2022. \n Now let's turn to the results of the third quarter, which clearly demonstrates the strength of our business and our ability to execute with all brands outperforming again this quarter.\n West Elm delivered a 22.5% comp, with all categories driving strong growth. The Upholstery business was very strong, and customers responded well to new products, including best sellers in bedroom, dining and occasional categories. Additionally, new categories such as Baths, Kids and Kitchens, also contributed to incremental growth. Pottery Barn delivered another high-performance quarter, with a comp of 15.9%, driven by strong growth in all product categories, including our seasonal decorating business.\n In addition, we saw strength across our core lifestyle furniture category, our design services and our furniture advantage growth initiatives such as apartment and our curated marketplace assortments. Pottery Barn Kids and Teens grew with a comp of 16.9%.\n The demand for our Green gold -- GREENGUARD Gold-certified furniture remains strong, emphasizing the importance of both our proprietary design aesthetic and our commitment to sustainability in our customers' buying decisions. Our Baby business continues to accelerate as our customers expand their families and the response to our holiday and gifting offerings was strong with Halloween products driving record results. \n The Williams-Sonoma brand accelerated to a 7.6% comp with growth across all key categories, driven by product innovation, edited and relevant assortments and high demand for Thanksgiving and holiday product. Both our exclusive products and WS branded products continued to grow, and we saw strength in key entertaining items. Operationally, an intensified focus in our key vendor partnerships has allowed us to increase inventory positions in high demand categories, despite a supply chain constrained environment. And we believe the improvements made to our online and store experience yielded momentum in the quarter.\n Finally, last week, the brand launched a new recipe app and a Reserve Membership program, both of which provide a new way for our customers to engage with the brand while supporting our ongoing strategic initiative to develop and deploy content distribution. Our Williams-Sonoma Home business is also accelerating as a result of our strategy to reposition the brand as a premium online furniture destination. We believe that with a refined curated assortment and an appealing digital presentation, Williams-Sonoma Home will be one of our biggest growth opportunities.\n Cross-brand, we're excited to share that our B2B growth initiative continues to produce record performance with our largest quarter ever, generating over $200 million of sales, nearly double that of last year. Significant accomplishments of the business include an increase of 44% in new clients over last year, an acceleration of our contract grade lineup as businesses reopen and growth and diversification in our large project pipeline. The business is also building across industries, capturing additional market share. This growth initiative continues to outperform, and we see significant opportunity for this business to contribute long term.\n In our cross-brand global business, we are focused on expansion, but through a disciplined capital-light brand-enhancing franchise model. \n This quarter, we opened our first franchise store in India and rolled out e-commerce capabilities across that country to great success. As we look forward, we see additional opportunities to lead in digital around the world.\n Additionally, our initiatives to promote selling across our brands continue to yield results. Cross-selling metrics, including total customers and percent of total of customers shopping across brands, are at record levels.\n Not surprisingly, the spend of a cross-brand customer is a multiple of that of a single-brand shopper, and increasing our share of spend with these customers will have a significant impact on incremental volume for the long term. We are excited about the many initiatives we have in place to capture this opportunity.\n Also in this quarter, we launched our new cross-brand credit card program, where customers can apply for credit, purchase and earn rewards with any of our brands. This new initiative complements our existing loyalty program for all other tenders. These 2 tiers of loyalty programs help us acquire and retain customers irrespective of their method of payment.\n The advantage of our loyalty program is twofold. First, as we previously shared, the multi-brand customers were 2 to 3x more than the single brand customer. We know we have an opportunity to increase our share of wallet with these customers. And with our portfolio of complementary brands, this is a tremendous competitive advantage few, if any, have in our industry.\n Second, our loyalty program dramatically enhances the richness of our first-party data. With almost 70% of our volume derived from e-commerce, we understand the importance of first-party data in the cookie-less future that is rapidly approaching.\n The loyalty program, along with hundreds of other attributes, in our in-house file is consolidated across our brands and channels, which allows us the ability to aggregate browsing behavior, transactions, demographics, channel preferences and many other attributes. This rich first-party data, along with our own in-house advertising expertise, allows us to be prepared and equipped as privacy rules evolve across the digital space.\n And finally, I'd like to spend a minute on our impact initiatives. We are proud to announce that in the third quarter, we raised minimum wages again to at least $15 an hour for all of our employees.\n Additionally, we also announced new goals to both expand our purchase of next ethically handcrafted products to $15 million and to nearly double our investments in fair trade certified products to $10 million by 2025.\n As the first home furnishings retailer to set significant ESG goals, we continue to lead the industry. These actions not only positively impact people and communities that make, source and distribute our products but also deliver value to our stakeholders, customers, vendors, shareholders and our communities. And our unwavering commitment to values is gaining further recognition.\n For example, our Pottery Barn renewed program was included in Fast Company's 2021 Innovation by Design Awards. We are rated top score about the Sustainability Furnishings Council for the fourth year running. And our MSCI ESG rating was upgraded to AA, driven by our strong commitment to ethical production and our newly announced climate goals, which further distinguishes our company as a leader in sustainability.\n As we enter the fourth quarter, we are seeing strong sales and margins continuing. We are thrilled with our customers' response to our holiday and gifting assortment, and we are ready to drive an outstanding finish to the year.\n Our teams are prepared to fulfill record orders leveraging our new technological capabilities and maximizing our digital-first omni advantage to meet the outsized demand we are seeing from our customers. In summary, with our strong results to date, our winning positioning in the industry and our outperforming growth strategies, we are more confident than ever in the long-term strength of our business into fiscal 2022 and beyond. We continue to be confident in our outlook of at least mid- to high single-digit comps, accelerating our revenues to $10 billion by 2024, with operating margins at least that of fiscal 2021.\n Before I pass the call to Julie, I want to thank our team for their outstanding work, creativity and relentless focus on driving the business. Their talent, energy and commitment underscores all of the success that we have had. And with that, I'd like to wish you all a happy holiday season. \nJulie Whalen: Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of record revenues and profitability. It is clear that our high-quality products and value proposition are resonating with our customers. Our growth strategies are outperforming, and our operating model is positioned well to continue to deliver revenue growth and profitability into the future.\n Our unique operating model has proven to be a competitive advantage and difficult to replicate. 95% of our products are proprietary or exclusive to our brands. We have a vertically integrated digital-first, but not digital-only, operating model that is nearly 70% e-commerce in an industry that primarily consists of brick-and-mortar or pure e-commerce players, and we are a sustainable and values-led company.\n These advantages, along with the macro trends that favor our business, a strong housing market, the permanent adoption of hybrid work, a shift to online purchasing and the demand from customers for values and sustainability in their products are clearly driving our results and will fuel our growth and profitability for the long term.\n Turning to our third quarter results in more detail. Net revenues grew 16% to $2.048 billion, with comparable brand revenue growth of 16.9%, with comps accelerating to 41.3% on a 2-year basis.\n This strong performance was broad-based across all brands and both channels. In fact, against tougher compares, our e-commerce business accelerated to over 67% of our total revenues from the second quarter and was our highest 2-year comp ever at 64%. By brand, West Elm delivered a 22.5% comp, taking year-to-date revenues for the brand to over $1.5 billion. Pottery Barn, our largest brand, drove their fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit comps with a 15.9% comp. Pottery Barn Kids and Teen grew at a comp of 16.9% and had their highest 2-year comp ever.\n Williams-Sonoma drove a 7.6% comp accelerating from the second quarter and on top of 30.4% last year. And our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined continue to drive significant growth at a 26.5% comp, and all brands grew nearly 40% or higher on a 2-year basis.\n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin expanded 370 basis points to 43.7%. Our selling margins drove 280 basis points of this expansion. And relative to 2019, our selling margins are up 430 basis points, in line with our first half results, despite higher ocean freight costs incurred during the quarter.\n These strong margin results reflect our pricing power from our proprietary design products and the advantage of our vertically integrated sourcing and production, which allows us to engineer our product for value and to best navigate through the various macro complexities. We are pleased to deliver another quarter of strong top line sales and merchandise margin expansion. Occupancy cost leverage was also a factor in our gross margin expansion, leveraging approximately 90 basis points, resulting from higher sales and low occupancy dollar growth.\n Occupancy costs were approximately $183 million, up 5.1% year-over-year and relatively in line with our second quarter growth. The year-over-year increase includes a onetime impact from rent true-ups and rent abatements last year as well as the incremental impact from our new East Coast distribution center, which gives us additional capacity to support our strong customer demand. We were pleased to see another quarter of occupancy leverage reflecting the strength of our top line and the ongoing success of our retail optimization efforts.\n SG&A in the third quarter was in line with the prior quarters at 27.5% of net revenue. Year-over-year, SG&A deleveraged 320 basis points, driven by higher advertising spend coming off of our substantially reduced costs in 2020 and our decision to incrementally invest in advertising.\n As we have said all year, given our record levels of profitability, we have been strategically and aggressively investing in high ROI advertising to drive new customer acquisition, retention and top line growth, which clearly is working. We continue to see record new customer counts and strong demand, which has benefited our business to date and will continue to drive growth well into the future.\n Furthermore, we view it as a competitive advantage to be in a position to increase spend today while the competition may need to pull back to offset incremental supply chain costs. And despite this expected deleverage, we still delivered SG&A rates near historically low pre-pandemic levels and another quarter of record profitability. Operating income grew to a record $333 million, resulting in an operating margin of 16.3%, expanding 60 basis points over last year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.32, up 30% from last year's record third quarter of $2.56 per diluted share.\n Put these results in context, we have not seen our performance weighing all year despite any shifts in the consumer wallet as the world reopens and being up against accelerating tougher year-over-year compares. In fact, year-to-date, we are tracking to a 28% comp or 41% on a 2-year basis, with 400 basis points of operating margin expansion at a 16.3% operating margin and over 85% growth in earnings.\n Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity levels and a cash balance of almost $660 million. The strength of our business has generated operating cash flow of almost $790 million year-to-date, which is approximately $60 million over last year's elevated cash flow levels.\n This cash flow strength has allowed us to fund the operations of the business, to invest over $140 million in capital expenditures and to return almost $790 million to our shareholders in the form of over $135 million in dividends and over $650 million in share repurchases. These decisions reflect our confidence in the sustainability of our growth and our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders.\n Moving down the balance sheet, merchandise inventories, which includes inventory and transit, were $1.272 billion, representing an increase of 13% over last year. Inventory on hand and available for sale was up 3% year-over-year. While that is an improvement from where we were in the second quarter, our inventory levels are still not aligned with demand and are below optimal levels. Our back order levels continue to be at record highs, driven by our strong demand and the supply chain disruptions that unfortunately continue to delay our order fulfillment, including the most recent delays out of Vietnam.\n As Laura mentioned, our phenomenal team and their aggressive actions, combined with our scale, has enabled us to navigate through these challenges better than others. And given our ongoing strong demand, we expect a return to more normalized inventory levels by mid-2022, with back order levels remaining elevated into the first half of 2022.\n Now let's turn to our expectations for the rest of the year and longer term. We are raising our 2021 outlook to reflect revenue growth from high teens to low 20s to now 22% to 23%, and operating margins from 16% to 17% to now 16.9% to 17.1%. This is our third consecutive raise this year.\n Additionally, we are also reiterating our longer-term outlook of revenues accelerating to $10 billion by 2024, with operating margins at least in line with our raised fiscal year '21 levels, which implies at least a mid- to high single-digit comp with margins at least holding over the next 3-plus years. We, of course, will revisit our 2022 and longer-term outlook next quarter in more detail. We are very confident in the fundamentals of the business and our strategies to sustain our growth into the future.\n In addition to the macro trends, our key differentiators and our successful growth initiatives, as previously mentioned, we have several other factors that give us confidence.\n First, our results to date. We saw comps accelerating even before the pandemic as a result of our growth initiatives to tie the 10% comp in February 2020. Our results during the pandemic continued to accelerate despite our retail stores being closed. And our results every quarter this year have held at a 2-year comp of approximately 40%, despite accelerating tougher year-over-year compares. And we did this while pulling back on all site-wide promotions and with low levels of available inventory for sale.\n Second, our proprietary products and vertically integrated sourcing and production, which provide us pricing power and the ability to optimize and engineer our products for value, drive strong merchandise margins in an environment with rising costs and competition.\n Third, our operating model. In addition to our pricing power, our operating model provides several opportunities to drive strong operating margins. From leverage from higher sales, including the additional accretion from our growth initiatives that have a higher operating margin to an accelerating shift online, which is more profitable. The continued occupancy leverage from the renegotiation of our lease agreements and further store closures, the various supply chain efficiencies, including automation and in-stock inventory levels and the continued emphasis on overall strong financial discipline, holding costs below sales growth.\n And finally, our liquidity. We have maintained a very strong and disciplined balance sheet with ample cash and no debt, which provides dry powder for opportunistic investments and incremental shareholder returns. All of this is what gives us the confidence in our short- and long-term outlook and our ability to deliver sustainable long-term growth and profitability with strong financial returns for our shareholders in 2022 and beyond. I would now also like to thank our associates without their unwavering commitment to driving these results, none of this would be possible.\n Happy holidays are all on the call. And now let's open the call for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham: Congrats on continued strong results. My first question is around the backlog that you mentioned. You said it's at record highs. Did it increase from the second quarter to the third quarter? And did your demand comps exceed your sales cost this quarter? \nLaura Alber: This is Laura. Thanks, Seth. Yes, unfortunately, the back orders did increase from where they were before. \nJulie Whalen: And the demand comps are relatively in line with the net comps. There's really no big story there. \nSeth Basham: All right. And my follow-up is around your customer acquisition cost. As you lean into advertising, you talked about Apple's privacy changes. Are you seeing customer acquisition costs go up, down, sideways? And how should we think about those going forward? \nFelix Carbullido: It's Felix. Thanks for the question. The digital advertising environment has always been dynamic and competitive. But what -- I guess, we have the competitive advantages, is that we have invested over the years in our in-house measurement lab, which is staffed with our own data scientists and mathematicians. And we also have our own in-house campaign managers who work side-by-side on developing the right audience. We measure results across our spend, leveraging our proprietary tool set.\n So even as the prices fluctuate, we're able to quickly identify the high ROI programs. And secondly, we've always been performance marketers, which means our spend is primarily on marketing vehicles we can measure and tie directly to our top line and our bottom line.\n And then I guess, lastly, we have the advantage is that we essentially manage our marketing budgets. And so Laura and I have the advantage to look across our portfolio. We test and learn across our brands. And when we find best practices, we can roll it out to our brands. So despite the dynamics of the marketplace, we feel we're better suited than others in our space. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih of Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Can I just say that the consistency of what you've been able to accomplish is really remarkable, so congrats. \nLaura Alber: Thank you. \nJulie Whalen: Thank you. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: You're welcome. Laura, I'm interested in the comment that you made about Williams-Sonoma Home and how that's going to be a growth vehicle for the overall business. How does that fit into the $10 billion kind of longer-term target? How much of that number represents the WS Home opportunity? Or is that upside to that?\n And then on the $15 an hour, that's also very much on the offense playing here. You're with Walmart, Target, and a lot of people are multiple dollars behind you. So is that entry level, obviously, at the stores? What does that look like at the DCs? And where was the average hourly rate before this? Kind of just curious how we should model that into the -- into our P&L? When did that get instituted? And what was it beforehand? \nLaura Alber: Okay. Let me see if I can get all that. So in our IR deck, which is online, you can see our path to $10 billion of revenues, which I think is a great thing to reference back to. And of course, we will update this next year. But my optimism in Williams-Sonoma Home is not reflected in the $10 billion. It is -- if you just look at the growth, even the Williams-Sonoma brand has from 2020 to 2024, it's $300 million. So of course, that doesn't contemplate Williams-Sonoma Home becoming a big driver.\n We see a huge gap in the marketplace for proprietary high-end products at great values and that are sustainable. And so we are working hard to do that, but to do it really well. So we're going to have patience also in what we bring in and when. But so far, it's really -- it's working. The changes we've made have already produced great results, and we're seeing momentum in that business.\n We're also very focused on improving our website so that you can really envision this product in your home without having to visit it in the store. And also using our stores to show wood samples and fabric samples and do design help in home even though we don't have stand-alone Williams-Sonoma Home store. So there's a lot of exciting things happening there.\n In terms of the hourly wage minimum, minimum is different than average, of course, right? So the minimum, we've moved it over the last couple of years from $12 to $15, most recently, it was at $14, and we made that change when Julie? \nJulie Whalen: $15 just recently... \nLaura Alber: No, the $14, when did we... \nJulie Whalen: In July 2020. \nLaura Alber: Yes. Thank you. Good memory. And so -- but our average hourly wage is higher, obviously. And we have stores all over. We have manufacturing all over the country. So we didn't have that many people in the under-15 bucket to actually begin with. We're -- our goal is to be competitive and hire the best in all these places. And so wage is one part of it, but there's a lot of other parts to the whole ecosystem of benefits and pay for our employees, and we're going to continue to really make sure we get the best and we reward them appropriately. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Cristina Fernandez of Telsey Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernandez: Congratulations also on a good quarter and the continued momentum in the business. I wanted to ask about the inventory flow, particularly with the supply chain challenges and the Vietnam disruption. How should we think about inventories over the next 6 months until they normalize? Should we expect them to be stable? Should we expect them to get worse before getting better? Some color there would be helpful. \nLaura Alber: They get better per our plan unless sales demand gets better faster. It's always a relationship, but our predictions are pretty good. They should get marginally better. But to really get back to where we want to be on back orders, we see it moving out a bit because, of course, the very unfortunate unpredictable situation that happened in Vietnam.\n Remember, Vietnam really predominantly affects our Kids business and Teen business, although it has some impact on the others, it's relatively small financially. What we care about the most is the customer, right? And getting the customer the right date and then helping them substitute if need be and being really empathetic and helping them understand every way through this.\n And so we've been doing callouts, and I'm really pleased to say that our customers have really understood, and I was worried about that, but the customers appreciate the phone calls, and we are not seeing them cancel and they're willing to wait because everybody else is in the same spot, and they want the high quality and they want the GREENGUARD Gold-certified Kids products. \nCristina Fernandez: And then my follow-up, I wanted to see if you could talk about the demographics of the new customers that are coming to the brand. With the -- with promotions being lower, are you seeing just more affluent customers and perhaps a drop in moderate income customers? Or how -- I guess, how has that changed over the past year, if any? \nFelix Carbullido: Yes. Thank you for the question. We -- our trends have been consistent. We're seeing growth across all generations and all income bands. And I know there's a lot of questions about geographic trends, too. The good news is it's positive across the board. I will tell you what is promising is that we are seeing a lot of our customers, obviously, come from the millennial generation. And wedding registries, baby registries are all up, not just over LY, but significantly over 2019.\n We also know that beyond registries, we're starting to see a lot of growth in people who have moved recently in the past 2 years. And those are some of our most valuable customers over time. And we know that they have a hyper spend curve of over 18 months. So we love that.\n And I guess lastly is that when we acquire these new customers, we are enrolling the majority of them in our 2-tier loyalty program that Laura spoke about, which is great for future sales. As you know, as Laura said, the multiple there is 2 to 3x. So we're thrilled with that performance. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Great quarter. Julie, I just wanted to see if you could speak to the pathway, the build off of the sales trajectory going from the $8.3 billion. It looks like you're going to do this year to the $10 billion in 2024. It sounds like back level -- backlog levels are strong. So would you expect that high single -- mid- to high single-digit pace to sort of be commensurate each year over the next 3 years to build that? Just wanted to think about how we get to that $10 billion? \nJulie Whalen: Sure. Chuck. Yes, so the $10 billion that we put out there that now recently we accelerated, right, last quarter to 2024, the algorithm associated with that is effectively a mid- to high single-digit growth per year. And that's what we're saying is sort of the -- where at least we think we'll be.\n Obviously, next quarter, we'll come out with more specific guidance for 2022 and see if there's any update to our longer-term outlook. But that is where the math comes into play as to where we think it will be for the $10 billion or better. \nCharles Grom: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Laura, I just wondered the $200 million in revenue for B2B is impressive. Just wanted to think about how we size up that opportunity longer term. I think you had, at one point, thrown out a $1 billion number, but it seems like that could move higher over time. Just an update there. \nLaura Alber: I think I've said 1, I think I've said two, I think I've said that the 2 is too small. I mean the market is, what, USD 80 billion B2B. Nobody is doing it from soup to nuts. They have categories where they cover rugs, but then you have to get your beddings from somewhere else. And we're -- we've gotten so much more of our furniture and our products to be contract grade so we can actually sell them into these places. And there's so many projects going, and we have such a strong team, we're building the infrastructure. I think this one is the big deal, and I see at least 2. \nJulie Whalen: And Chuck, back to the algorithm for $10 billion, it was assumed it was $1 billion in 5 years. So for a 100 comp, $700 million this year, could it be $1 billion next year? \nLaura Alber: Yes. I would think that maybe we're being a little conservative on that when you do that math. \nCharles Grom: Yes, that's what I'm getting at. Okay, great. And then just on occupancy, $183 million, you addressed the increase. Is that a good run rate to use sort of quarterly going forward? Or should we expect that to come down as you renegotiate leases, close stores, et cetera? \nLaura Alber: Yes. I mean that's always a tough one to nail with precision. I mean, yes, last quarter, it was relatively in line with this quarter. In Q4, there's a lot more variable occupancy that goes into play. And remember that we have a lot more of our capital projects that go in, and we're spending more on capital projects. So there's a depreciation play within occupancy. And we've put in place the new East Coast distribution, which is fantastic news because it supports our strong growth.\n On the flip side, which is fantastic, is that we've been really strong with our retail optimization efforts. And so we brought down the costs associated with rent on our stores. And so we're able to mute the growth of occupancy to be below sales growth, and that is what we expect to continue and why we can continue to drive leverage and occupancy.\n But to give you an exact growth rate is difficult. So because it's going to move around a little bit by quarter for those reasons. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. \nHannah Pittock: And this is actually Hannah Pittock on for Simeon. My first question, within selling margins, if we think about the year-over-year expansion, can you give us some qualitative color on how much of that was lower promotions, taking price, and to the extent that there was an offset there in higher product costs? Just some of the puts and takes within the selling margin. \nJulie Whalen: I mean, obviously, as we've been saying all year, we've been very successful with merch margin expansion, and we saw that continue. So that is the biggest driver is us pulling off of our site-wide promos. And we continued that all year, and yet we've been able to drive incredibly strong top line. So that's the biggest piece.\n Certainly, we did incur higher raw material costs like everybody else. But we've been able to navigate through it much better than everyone else, we believe, because of the fact that we design and house our product, and we can engineer it for value. And so we can make the necessary changes that we need to make to be able to still drive value for the customer and still drive profit to the company.\n The other thing I would say that is not reflective in there that you're -- that it's something new this quarter is we did incur a substantial ocean freight costs. And so I think you need to think about -- but for those, our expansion would be from a product margin perspective, would be in line with Q2. And so our merch margin expansion is still very strong.\n We have not seen that come back. We're still driving it. And in fact, if you take our selling margins and you look at them on a 2-year basis, we're in line with the first half of the year. And if you add back the ocean costs were actually is the highest a 2-year comp we've had in those selling margins. So we feel really great about the strength of our business. \nHannah Pittock: Got it. And maybe a quick follow-up. Any issues raising prices within specific banners? Are there some that the customer tends to display a little bit more elasticity? Or is it consistent across the brands? \nLaura Alber: It's Laura. The most important change that we've made is to not run site-wide promotions. And that was a change that we started to test into before the pandemic and then got more and more bold after we saw the results. And it really speaks to the pricing power that we have because we are one of the only people who design and source their own products. We're not selling other people's things to the same extent that a lot of other people in the space are, so you can't compare the price. We are not looking to change our value equation though.\n At the same time, as we have stopped the promotions, we are giving our customers better value, as Julie said, all the time, it is so important to us that the customers see our product, they love it, the quality they know is great, they know it's sustainable, and we have the best price with shipping in the market. And it's really hard for them to find it anywhere else. And that's what we're doing more than thinking about it in terms of what can they stand and what can they not stand. It's about giving them the best value out there in the entire market. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jonathan Matuszewski of Jefferies. \nJonathan Matuszewski: Nice quarter. First one is just on industry-wide promotionality. Curious what you saw this quarter. I recall last quarter, you shared an observation that peers were increasing their promotional activity while your selling margins were up and your clearance activity was down a lot. So just kind of big picture, what were you seeing across the competitive landscape? And why do you think peers feel the need to mark down their product to sell in this environment? \nLaura Alber: So remember that a large portion of our industry is still brick-and-mortar small retailers, many of whom are stuck with the wrong inventories. They have to clear, they have the cash flow. So there's a lot of liquidation going on in the streets, right? And while that's not easy to find and compare to, it's a reality.\n In terms of the big players, you've, I'm sure, read the reports and seen who's performing and what they're doing and where their margins are. And you can just -- if you sign up for their e-mails, you'll see a lot of promotions. You'll see 20 offs, you'll see couponing, you'll see site wides, you'll see all sorts of different offers that they produce. And it is coming back. You also are seeing people have all their early Black Friday deals in great quantities compared to us.\n And so those are all factors in the marketplace. And as I said, we're going to continue to offer the customer great value, and we're going to work to design products that exceeds their expectations and that they can't buy elsewhere. \nJonathan Matuszewski: Yes, that's helpful. Thanks for the color there. And then just a quick follow-up on the B2B side. You've obviously seen significant share gains on this side of the market in a fairly short time frame. Are you anticipating any incremental investment required to continue scaling this business going forward? Or is it just going to be a matter of leveraging the current infrastructure with new customer acquisition and being able to continue to own without a significant uptick in expenses? \nLaura Alber: It's a really profitable business. We've hired a lot more people to sell for us, and that's really what we're doing, but they do a ton of volume each versus when you think about other models that we have or others have. These are big accounts and their annuities and that once they start doing business with us, they need to replace things.\n And so it's -- yes, we give them a discount, but it's very accretive to our margins. And it's not a big step-up investment. We do have some things we're doing to automate the selling and make some investment there, but not like you've seen when we've done other initiatives in the past. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brad Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nBradley Thomas: Let me add my congrats as well here. My question was about the outlook here for the holiday season. And obviously, you've given very explicit guidance for how we should think about sales and margins as it's implied for 4Q. But I was a little bit more curious about how you're thinking about seasonal merchandise and how it performs versus the core business. How you're thinking about perhaps some pull forward that may have occurred if consumers are anticipating shipping delays. And how confident you are in your ability to deliver this given I believe you said inventory hands up about 3%? Congrats on the great results, and I would love to hear some color on this. \nLaura Alber: It's so exciting to be able to get together with family and friends against for the holidays. Remember, Thanksgiving last year, it was like Thanksgiving turkey for 2. And so this year, we're sold out of all the big turkeys. I mean they're gone, I'm so sorry. And that goes for a lot of other products, too, that we planned high and the exuberance of the customer to get together with their family friends has just begun. We're in the entertaining stage of the holidays, the gift giving as much as we all want to move it early, they wait, they wait until later.\n But the entertaining and decorating stage is well underway. And as I said, I'm thrilled that we got our seasonal stuff in and stacked. It's in our stores, it looks gorgeous, and it's flying, flying.\n Core business is also super strong. I said in my prepared remarks how strong our core furniture franchise business is. And so that's something that we continue to see as an opportunity, particularly as we finally get back in stock because as we get more and more in stock, the customer lead times go down, they do buy more.\n So we're doing this well with a lot less inventory than we'd like. The inventory in transit is nice and stout. So we do see some recovery on its way, and we'll see some nice back order fill coming as well. \nBradley Thomas: Great. And Laura, if I could ask a follow-up just about expansion of new brands. Obviously, the company has a history of making acquisitions and growing from within. I'd be curious if you could share any color on how you're thinking about new brands down the horizon and how you're thinking about that. \nLaura Alber: We are very focused on growth. And we've identified some very serious growth initiatives in our core brands. And within the core brands, there's very big businesses that are underserved. I think I've mentioned before, how small the outdoor business is for West Elm or how small the Christmas decor business is for West Elm. And Pottery Barn, they just started to go after bath. And we have some that we haven't announced yet that are categorical and that are big opportunities in the market. We mentioned B2B.\n We're now designing into B2B. So for example, before we were just doing contract-grade versions of our stuff, now we're designing restaurant tables and benches and banquets and all those things that restaurants and hotels want. We actually design it for them and then it goes in our line just like we did for the workspace. So there's a lot of product extensions that we are bringing in. And of course, we're always looking at the landscape and thinking about new aesthetics and possibly new brands. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Oliver Wintermantel of Evercore ISI. \nOliver Wintermantel: I had a question regarding your comp, the composition of that. If you could talk a little bit about transactions versus ticket? And maybe you can also talk a little bit about store traffic. I think that was down last quarter if that improved? And how much of the ticket was pure inflation? \nLaura Alber: I can give you some of it. So in terms of store traffic, we are actually seeing better traffic comps than the national traffic. People love our stores. We tend to be the place to go. So we're better than national, but we're still negative to 2019. So I'm so excited about that number because can you imagine when the number comes up? So we have a lot of room to go.\n Stores are experiential. We have design services, we have omni services, and we're driving higher ticket conversions, great, traffic is down.\n In terms of all the other metrics that you might think about, it depends. You can have a lot of traffic on the websites unqualified or you can have high conversions qualified.\n I mean, look, the metrics are great because we're selling a lot more in both channels. As you can see, we have really strong channel comps on both. But we are selling more units per order, and we're selling higher ticket because they're buying whole houses. And that's really a function of this cross-brand initiative that we've talked about, but also as we look to design whole houses and furnish their entire room and use our design services and our online outward 3D services, it really helps them feel more confident buying more for the room versus just maybe the bed that they set out to buy. \nOliver Wintermantel: Thanks, Laura. And Julie, I think you said on SG&A growth, it was -- did you say it was all advertising or most of it? Or if you could parse it out a little bit more, please. \nJulie Whalen: It's really all advertising, the deleverage, but it did come down from the second quarter from a deleverage perspective. And again, the point of that is that we're coming off of low levels off of 2020, and we're seeing this as a competitive advantage to invest in high ROI advertising.\n Many, many companies, as you've been reading and hearing have been pulling back because they have to be able to hit the bottom line. And we see that as an opportunity for us with our record operating margins to be able to go in and really invest in it and drive growth for the future. So that's what we're doing. \nOperator: We'll take our last question from Steven Zaccone of Citi. \nSteven Zaccone: I had a question on the supply chain. Could you talk a little about your ability to diversify the supply chain just as sourcing continues to be a pain point into next year, maybe a little bit worse than you're anticipating?\n And then I guess the other topic -- other question related to supply chain is just you've probably been dealing with some elevated container costs and some elevated transportation costs. Is there opportunity to recoup some of those costs as we get into next year? \nJulie Whalen: Thank you for the great question. We're vertically integrated. As I said earlier, we designed -- we sourced -- we have, I think, 800 people in our Asia operations. We've been at this for a while. We have strong relationships with our vendors, and we are nimble. You watched us cover the really difficult tariff that people couldn't believe we could cover. I mean that was -- that's no small situation. And so yes, there's always a new challenge around the corner. I mean you just wait for it. But the great news is our team is so strong, and they usually see it coming before anybody else and they work to mitigate it.\n We're already thinking about next year and what it might be on the horizon and how we get in front of some of those things. It's also an advantage that we have multiple distribution points in the United States, so we can bring goods into multiple ports, which a lot of people can't do without spending a lot of money on dray. And so that's something that will serve us well, I think, next year. And we're also opening up and sourcing in other parts of the world that we've never sourced in large quantity in. And so whether it's Mexico or Brazil, we're looking at those markets very strongly and see opportunity in those markets.\n So I see our supply chain as a competitive advantage that allows us to really bring in great product and to deliver great quality. In terms of next year and the cost pressure, as Julie mentioned, we did spend more money this quarter that we just announced with bringing in our goods so that they'd be ready for the holidays.\n And while we improved our operating margin better than anyone thought we would, that money was in there. And that is an opportunity for next year because we don't see that continuing even into Q4. We see that, going forward, we will not have the same amount of cost. We'll have higher costs in some cases for the general contract on transportation, but we won't see the spot rate be as big a percent of our total containers in as we did for Q3 and Q2. Do you have anything to add to that? \nSteven Zaccone: No, that's fine, if you have comments, Julie. I guess the other question I had is just given the continued top line strength in the business, would you ever consider slowing your plans to close stores? \nLaura Alber: No, we're only closing stores where we can find a better opportunity where the mall is not a proud moment or the economics really don't work. And we've been really successful in opening bigger, better stores and driving the customer to a better experience. I think it's a really important part of a brand's development to keep improving your retail footprint because that's how the customer sees the brand. And so if you're a local store is not up to date, that's not good for your online sales.\n So it's a really important part of our -- what we do. And we set pretty high numbers for our retail profitability. We're hitting them, but we will continue to consolidate where we have stores that are just lagging. And as I said, it can either be lagging in financials or lagging in the brand -- the way the brand sits with you as you go into that store.\n But I'll tell you, on the flip side, we are so proud of our beautiful stores right now. And I really invite all of you to go visit, buy some things for Thanksgiving or the holidays. And you'll see what I'm talking about those gorgeous stores are doing -- those people in those stores are doing such an amazing job, selling and helping our customers right now, and we're just so proud of them. \nOperator: At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to management for any additional or closing remarks. \nLaura Alber: Well, thank you all for joining us. It's been another great session talking to you all, and I appreciate all of your support. And I again wish you happy holidays, happy Thanksgiving and happy shopping. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Felix Carbullido",
            "content": "It's Felix. Thanks for the question. The digital advertising environment has always been dynamic and competitive. But what -- I guess, we have the competitive advantages, is that we have invested over the years in our in-house measurement lab, which is staffed with our own data scientists and mathematicians. And we also have our own in-house campaign managers who work side-by-side on developing the right audience. We measure results across our spend, leveraging our proprietary tool set.\n So even as the prices fluctuate, we're able to quickly identify the high ROI programs. And secondly, we've always been performance marketers, which means our spend is primarily on marketing vehicles we can measure and tie directly to our top line and our bottom line.\n And then I guess, lastly, we have the advantage is that we essentially manage our marketing budgets. And so Laura and I have the advantage to look across our portfolio. We test and learn across our brands. And when we find best practices, we can roll it out to our brands. So despite the dynamics of the marketplace, we feel we're better suited than others in our space. Yes. Thank you for the question. We -- our trends have been consistent. We're seeing growth across all generations and all income bands. And I know there's a lot of questions about geographic trends, too. The good news is it's positive across the board. I will tell you what is promising is that we are seeing a lot of our customers, obviously, come from the millennial generation. And wedding registries, baby registries are all up, not just over LY, but significantly over 2019.\n We also know that beyond registries, we're starting to see a lot of growth in people who have moved recently in the past 2 years. And those are some of our most valuable customers over time. And we know that they have a hyper spend curve of over 18 months. So we love that.\n And I guess lastly is that when we acquire these new customers, we are enrolling the majority of them in our 2-tier loyalty program that Laura spoke about, which is great for future sales. As you know, as Laura said, the multiple there is 2 to 3x. So we're thrilled with that performance."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We're extremely proud to deliver yet another quarter of outperformance with comps of 16.9%, building to an accelerated 2-year stack of 41.3% and operating margin expansion of 60 basis points. These results are a function of both the advantages of our distinctive positioning in the market and our successful execution against our long-term growth strategy. Furthermore, our performance demonstrates that we continue to take share in a fractured market and deliver high-quality, sustainable earnings. As a result, we are raising our full year outlook to reflect revenue growth of 22% to 23% and operating margins of 16.9% to 17.1%.\n Customers are clearly responding to our products and channel strategies, and we expect to drive an outstanding finish to the year and beyond.\n On the macro front, the industry remains large and fragmented, with more than half of its sales generated from smaller brick-and-mortar retailers. We are one of the strongest market players and have incredible opportunity to capture more of an almost $1 trillion market opportunity. We are at a pivotal point of change, both in the way we live and work, and we will intensely focus on our unique ability to capitalize on this change and, in turn, capture market share.\n The housing market continues to hold strong with purchases of larger first and second homes. Additionally, hybrid work arrangements continue to gain traction as a permanent work model. Both of these trends result in a stronger need and desire to outfit the home for working, entertaining and cooking. In addition, another large point of disruption is the shift of the consumers to make purchases online. Certain factors continue to bolster the shift in behavior, including the lasting impact of the stay-at-home dynamic of the pandemic and the entrance of the millennial generation into their home formation years, a customer segment who naturally gravitates towards digital purchasing.\n In an industry occupied by market players who have not yet made significant investment in their e-commerce capabilities and pure e-commerce players without the service element of our retail business, we believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend as a digital first, but not digital-only company. Our incredible store shopping experience satisfies our cross-channel customers who shop both online and in-store. Our customers continue to place importance on and in many instances, demand the prioritization of sustainability.\n In fact, almost 70% of consumers today want to support brands that are purpose driven and doing good in the world we share. Our company is committed to being a value led, sustainable company and is proud to be a leader in the home furnishing industry.\n In short, the fragmented industry, the strong housing market, the shift of the consumer online and the consumer demand for sustainability provides specific unique and sizable opportunities for our company to continue to grow. And these macro trends are a perfect fit with our key differentiators. Our in-house design capabilities, along with our depth ability to value engineer our products, allows us to offer exclusive, relevant and high-quality products.\n Our channel strategy provides a competitive edge in scaling the business into the future compared to both the retail and marketplace dominant players. And of course, our values, which are deeply rooted in sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion, are embedded in our products and central in our actions. These principles have been and will continue to be fundamental and nonnegotiable to the customers and communities we serve. This, combined with our growth strategies, not only provide for sizable opportunities to grow our core businesses, but also to drive momentum in reaching new customers, geographies and industries.\n This expansion and diversification of our customer base presents many exciting opportunities to deliver solutions for underserved spaces and places, from B2B which brings an exciting new customer profile, to our global business which drives expansion across new geographies, to our cross-brand and marketplace opportunities which expands the reach of our current base and the expansion of Williams-Sonoma Home, which attends to an underserved, high-end luxury market and has massive future potential for scaling. We have, in fact, many opportunities to drive our business forward into the next chapter of growth.\n Simply put, it's these macro shifts, combined with our key differentiators and our long-term growth prospects that result in us strongly believing in our ability to continue to take market share and deliver earnings well into the future.\n Before we talk about Q3, let's take a minute to review the supply chain, which I know is top of mind for all. It is no surprise that we have been intensely focused on the supply chain bottlenecks around the world. Like all companies, we are not immune to the ripple effect from these short-term and long-term delays.\n I want to share with you our status and the extraordinary accomplishments of the team. Our upholstery lead times continue to improve and are industry-leading as a result of our in-house domestic capabilities. Our immediate and decisive responsiveness, our strong long-term vendor relationships and our scale have all minimized production and delivery delays relative to our competition. And as a result, approximately 85% of our holiday receipts have already been received. And finally, when we have delays, customer service is our priority, which has resulted in declines in escalations, cancellations and calls into the care center.\n All that said, I do want to highlight some important challenges we are facing as a result of this supply chain disruption. First, as you know, we sourced a sizable amount of inventory out of Vietnam, which was recently shut down for 3 months. This country has since reopened, but is experiencing significant backlog across factories as they ramp up. As a result, we are experiencing some inventory delays, particularly in our children's home furnishings businesses. Second, given the ongoing strong demand we are seeing across our business and the impact of the Vietnam delays, we do not expect full recovery of our inventory levels until the middle of 2022. \n Now let's turn to the results of the third quarter, which clearly demonstrates the strength of our business and our ability to execute with all brands outperforming again this quarter.\n West Elm delivered a 22.5% comp, with all categories driving strong growth. The Upholstery business was very strong, and customers responded well to new products, including best sellers in bedroom, dining and occasional categories. Additionally, new categories such as Baths, Kids and Kitchens, also contributed to incremental growth. Pottery Barn delivered another high-performance quarter, with a comp of 15.9%, driven by strong growth in all product categories, including our seasonal decorating business.\n In addition, we saw strength across our core lifestyle furniture category, our design services and our furniture advantage growth initiatives such as apartment and our curated marketplace assortments. Pottery Barn Kids and Teens grew with a comp of 16.9%.\n The demand for our Green gold -- GREENGUARD Gold-certified furniture remains strong, emphasizing the importance of both our proprietary design aesthetic and our commitment to sustainability in our customers' buying decisions. Our Baby business continues to accelerate as our customers expand their families and the response to our holiday and gifting offerings was strong with Halloween products driving record results. \n The Williams-Sonoma brand accelerated to a 7.6% comp with growth across all key categories, driven by product innovation, edited and relevant assortments and high demand for Thanksgiving and holiday product. Both our exclusive products and WS branded products continued to grow, and we saw strength in key entertaining items. Operationally, an intensified focus in our key vendor partnerships has allowed us to increase inventory positions in high demand categories, despite a supply chain constrained environment. And we believe the improvements made to our online and store experience yielded momentum in the quarter.\n Finally, last week, the brand launched a new recipe app and a Reserve Membership program, both of which provide a new way for our customers to engage with the brand while supporting our ongoing strategic initiative to develop and deploy content distribution. Our Williams-Sonoma Home business is also accelerating as a result of our strategy to reposition the brand as a premium online furniture destination. We believe that with a refined curated assortment and an appealing digital presentation, Williams-Sonoma Home will be one of our biggest growth opportunities.\n Cross-brand, we're excited to share that our B2B growth initiative continues to produce record performance with our largest quarter ever, generating over $200 million of sales, nearly double that of last year. Significant accomplishments of the business include an increase of 44% in new clients over last year, an acceleration of our contract grade lineup as businesses reopen and growth and diversification in our large project pipeline. The business is also building across industries, capturing additional market share. This growth initiative continues to outperform, and we see significant opportunity for this business to contribute long term.\n In our cross-brand global business, we are focused on expansion, but through a disciplined capital-light brand-enhancing franchise model. \n This quarter, we opened our first franchise store in India and rolled out e-commerce capabilities across that country to great success. As we look forward, we see additional opportunities to lead in digital around the world.\n Additionally, our initiatives to promote selling across our brands continue to yield results. Cross-selling metrics, including total customers and percent of total of customers shopping across brands, are at record levels.\n Not surprisingly, the spend of a cross-brand customer is a multiple of that of a single-brand shopper, and increasing our share of spend with these customers will have a significant impact on incremental volume for the long term. We are excited about the many initiatives we have in place to capture this opportunity.\n Also in this quarter, we launched our new cross-brand credit card program, where customers can apply for credit, purchase and earn rewards with any of our brands. This new initiative complements our existing loyalty program for all other tenders. These 2 tiers of loyalty programs help us acquire and retain customers irrespective of their method of payment.\n The advantage of our loyalty program is twofold. First, as we previously shared, the multi-brand customers were 2 to 3x more than the single brand customer. We know we have an opportunity to increase our share of wallet with these customers. And with our portfolio of complementary brands, this is a tremendous competitive advantage few, if any, have in our industry.\n Second, our loyalty program dramatically enhances the richness of our first-party data. With almost 70% of our volume derived from e-commerce, we understand the importance of first-party data in the cookie-less future that is rapidly approaching.\n The loyalty program, along with hundreds of other attributes, in our in-house file is consolidated across our brands and channels, which allows us the ability to aggregate browsing behavior, transactions, demographics, channel preferences and many other attributes. This rich first-party data, along with our own in-house advertising expertise, allows us to be prepared and equipped as privacy rules evolve across the digital space.\n And finally, I'd like to spend a minute on our impact initiatives. We are proud to announce that in the third quarter, we raised minimum wages again to at least $15 an hour for all of our employees.\n Additionally, we also announced new goals to both expand our purchase of next ethically handcrafted products to $15 million and to nearly double our investments in fair trade certified products to $10 million by 2025.\n As the first home furnishings retailer to set significant ESG goals, we continue to lead the industry. These actions not only positively impact people and communities that make, source and distribute our products but also deliver value to our stakeholders, customers, vendors, shareholders and our communities. And our unwavering commitment to values is gaining further recognition.\n For example, our Pottery Barn renewed program was included in Fast Company's 2021 Innovation by Design Awards. We are rated top score about the Sustainability Furnishings Council for the fourth year running. And our MSCI ESG rating was upgraded to AA, driven by our strong commitment to ethical production and our newly announced climate goals, which further distinguishes our company as a leader in sustainability.\n As we enter the fourth quarter, we are seeing strong sales and margins continuing. We are thrilled with our customers' response to our holiday and gifting assortment, and we are ready to drive an outstanding finish to the year.\n Our teams are prepared to fulfill record orders leveraging our new technological capabilities and maximizing our digital-first omni advantage to meet the outsized demand we are seeing from our customers. In summary, with our strong results to date, our winning positioning in the industry and our outperforming growth strategies, we are more confident than ever in the long-term strength of our business into fiscal 2022 and beyond. We continue to be confident in our outlook of at least mid- to high single-digit comps, accelerating our revenues to $10 billion by 2024, with operating margins at least that of fiscal 2021.\n Before I pass the call to Julie, I want to thank our team for their outstanding work, creativity and relentless focus on driving the business. Their talent, energy and commitment underscores all of the success that we have had. And with that, I'd like to wish you all a happy holiday season. This is Laura. Thanks, Seth. Yes, unfortunately, the back orders did increase from where they were before. Thank you. Okay. Let me see if I can get all that. So in our IR deck, which is online, you can see our path to $10 billion of revenues, which I think is a great thing to reference back to. And of course, we will update this next year. But my optimism in Williams-Sonoma Home is not reflected in the $10 billion. It is -- if you just look at the growth, even the Williams-Sonoma brand has from 2020 to 2024, it's $300 million. So of course, that doesn't contemplate Williams-Sonoma Home becoming a big driver.\n We see a huge gap in the marketplace for proprietary high-end products at great values and that are sustainable. And so we are working hard to do that, but to do it really well. So we're going to have patience also in what we bring in and when. But so far, it's really -- it's working. The changes we've made have already produced great results, and we're seeing momentum in that business.\n We're also very focused on improving our website so that you can really envision this product in your home without having to visit it in the store. And also using our stores to show wood samples and fabric samples and do design help in home even though we don't have stand-alone Williams-Sonoma Home store. So there's a lot of exciting things happening there.\n In terms of the hourly wage minimum, minimum is different than average, of course, right? So the minimum, we've moved it over the last couple of years from $12 to $15, most recently, it was at $14, and we made that change when Julie? No, the $14, when did we... Yes. Thank you. Good memory. And so -- but our average hourly wage is higher, obviously. And we have stores all over. We have manufacturing all over the country. So we didn't have that many people in the under-15 bucket to actually begin with. We're -- our goal is to be competitive and hire the best in all these places. And so wage is one part of it, but there's a lot of other parts to the whole ecosystem of benefits and pay for our employees, and we're going to continue to really make sure we get the best and we reward them appropriately. They get better per our plan unless sales demand gets better faster. It's always a relationship, but our predictions are pretty good. They should get marginally better. But to really get back to where we want to be on back orders, we see it moving out a bit because, of course, the very unfortunate unpredictable situation that happened in Vietnam.\n Remember, Vietnam really predominantly affects our Kids business and Teen business, although it has some impact on the others, it's relatively small financially. What we care about the most is the customer, right? And getting the customer the right date and then helping them substitute if need be and being really empathetic and helping them understand every way through this.\n And so we've been doing callouts, and I'm really pleased to say that our customers have really understood, and I was worried about that, but the customers appreciate the phone calls, and we are not seeing them cancel and they're willing to wait because everybody else is in the same spot, and they want the high quality and they want the GREENGUARD Gold-certified Kids products. I think I've said 1, I think I've said two, I think I've said that the 2 is too small. I mean the market is, what, USD 80 billion B2B. Nobody is doing it from soup to nuts. They have categories where they cover rugs, but then you have to get your beddings from somewhere else. And we're -- we've gotten so much more of our furniture and our products to be contract grade so we can actually sell them into these places. And there's so many projects going, and we have such a strong team, we're building the infrastructure. I think this one is the big deal, and I see at least 2. Yes. I would think that maybe we're being a little conservative on that when you do that math. Yes. I mean that's always a tough one to nail with precision. I mean, yes, last quarter, it was relatively in line with this quarter. In Q4, there's a lot more variable occupancy that goes into play. And remember that we have a lot more of our capital projects that go in, and we're spending more on capital projects. So there's a depreciation play within occupancy. And we've put in place the new East Coast distribution, which is fantastic news because it supports our strong growth.\n On the flip side, which is fantastic, is that we've been really strong with our retail optimization efforts. And so we brought down the costs associated with rent on our stores. And so we're able to mute the growth of occupancy to be below sales growth, and that is what we expect to continue and why we can continue to drive leverage and occupancy.\n But to give you an exact growth rate is difficult. So because it's going to move around a little bit by quarter for those reasons. It's Laura. The most important change that we've made is to not run site-wide promotions. And that was a change that we started to test into before the pandemic and then got more and more bold after we saw the results. And it really speaks to the pricing power that we have because we are one of the only people who design and source their own products. We're not selling other people's things to the same extent that a lot of other people in the space are, so you can't compare the price. We are not looking to change our value equation though.\n At the same time, as we have stopped the promotions, we are giving our customers better value, as Julie said, all the time, it is so important to us that the customers see our product, they love it, the quality they know is great, they know it's sustainable, and we have the best price with shipping in the market. And it's really hard for them to find it anywhere else. And that's what we're doing more than thinking about it in terms of what can they stand and what can they not stand. It's about giving them the best value out there in the entire market. So remember that a large portion of our industry is still brick-and-mortar small retailers, many of whom are stuck with the wrong inventories. They have to clear, they have the cash flow. So there's a lot of liquidation going on in the streets, right? And while that's not easy to find and compare to, it's a reality.\n In terms of the big players, you've, I'm sure, read the reports and seen who's performing and what they're doing and where their margins are. And you can just -- if you sign up for their e-mails, you'll see a lot of promotions. You'll see 20 offs, you'll see couponing, you'll see site wides, you'll see all sorts of different offers that they produce. And it is coming back. You also are seeing people have all their early Black Friday deals in great quantities compared to us.\n And so those are all factors in the marketplace. And as I said, we're going to continue to offer the customer great value, and we're going to work to design products that exceeds their expectations and that they can't buy elsewhere. It's a really profitable business. We've hired a lot more people to sell for us, and that's really what we're doing, but they do a ton of volume each versus when you think about other models that we have or others have. These are big accounts and their annuities and that once they start doing business with us, they need to replace things.\n And so it's -- yes, we give them a discount, but it's very accretive to our margins. And it's not a big step-up investment. We do have some things we're doing to automate the selling and make some investment there, but not like you've seen when we've done other initiatives in the past. It's so exciting to be able to get together with family and friends against for the holidays. Remember, Thanksgiving last year, it was like Thanksgiving turkey for 2. And so this year, we're sold out of all the big turkeys. I mean they're gone, I'm so sorry. And that goes for a lot of other products, too, that we planned high and the exuberance of the customer to get together with their family friends has just begun. We're in the entertaining stage of the holidays, the gift giving as much as we all want to move it early, they wait, they wait until later.\n But the entertaining and decorating stage is well underway. And as I said, I'm thrilled that we got our seasonal stuff in and stacked. It's in our stores, it looks gorgeous, and it's flying, flying.\n Core business is also super strong. I said in my prepared remarks how strong our core furniture franchise business is. And so that's something that we continue to see as an opportunity, particularly as we finally get back in stock because as we get more and more in stock, the customer lead times go down, they do buy more.\n So we're doing this well with a lot less inventory than we'd like. The inventory in transit is nice and stout. So we do see some recovery on its way, and we'll see some nice back order fill coming as well. We are very focused on growth. And we've identified some very serious growth initiatives in our core brands. And within the core brands, there's very big businesses that are underserved. I think I've mentioned before, how small the outdoor business is for West Elm or how small the Christmas decor business is for West Elm. And Pottery Barn, they just started to go after bath. And we have some that we haven't announced yet that are categorical and that are big opportunities in the market. We mentioned B2B.\n We're now designing into B2B. So for example, before we were just doing contract-grade versions of our stuff, now we're designing restaurant tables and benches and banquets and all those things that restaurants and hotels want. We actually design it for them and then it goes in our line just like we did for the workspace. So there's a lot of product extensions that we are bringing in. And of course, we're always looking at the landscape and thinking about new aesthetics and possibly new brands. I can give you some of it. So in terms of store traffic, we are actually seeing better traffic comps than the national traffic. People love our stores. We tend to be the place to go. So we're better than national, but we're still negative to 2019. So I'm so excited about that number because can you imagine when the number comes up? So we have a lot of room to go.\n Stores are experiential. We have design services, we have omni services, and we're driving higher ticket conversions, great, traffic is down.\n In terms of all the other metrics that you might think about, it depends. You can have a lot of traffic on the websites unqualified or you can have high conversions qualified.\n I mean, look, the metrics are great because we're selling a lot more in both channels. As you can see, we have really strong channel comps on both. But we are selling more units per order, and we're selling higher ticket because they're buying whole houses. And that's really a function of this cross-brand initiative that we've talked about, but also as we look to design whole houses and furnish their entire room and use our design services and our online outward 3D services, it really helps them feel more confident buying more for the room versus just maybe the bed that they set out to buy. No, we're only closing stores where we can find a better opportunity where the mall is not a proud moment or the economics really don't work. And we've been really successful in opening bigger, better stores and driving the customer to a better experience. I think it's a really important part of a brand's development to keep improving your retail footprint because that's how the customer sees the brand. And so if you're a local store is not up to date, that's not good for your online sales.\n So it's a really important part of our -- what we do. And we set pretty high numbers for our retail profitability. We're hitting them, but we will continue to consolidate where we have stores that are just lagging. And as I said, it can either be lagging in financials or lagging in the brand -- the way the brand sits with you as you go into that store.\n But I'll tell you, on the flip side, we are so proud of our beautiful stores right now. And I really invite all of you to go visit, buy some things for Thanksgiving or the holidays. And you'll see what I'm talking about those gorgeous stores are doing -- those people in those stores are doing such an amazing job, selling and helping our customers right now, and we're just so proud of them. Well, thank you all for joining us. It's been another great session talking to you all, and I appreciate all of your support. And I again wish you happy holidays, happy Thanksgiving and happy shopping."

            "name": "Julie Whalen",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of record revenues and profitability. It is clear that our high-quality products and value proposition are resonating with our customers. Our growth strategies are outperforming, and our operating model is positioned well to continue to deliver revenue growth and profitability into the future.\n Our unique operating model has proven to be a competitive advantage and difficult to replicate. 95% of our products are proprietary or exclusive to our brands. We have a vertically integrated digital-first, but not digital-only, operating model that is nearly 70% e-commerce in an industry that primarily consists of brick-and-mortar or pure e-commerce players, and we are a sustainable and values-led company.\n These advantages, along with the macro trends that favor our business, a strong housing market, the permanent adoption of hybrid work, a shift to online purchasing and the demand from customers for values and sustainability in their products are clearly driving our results and will fuel our growth and profitability for the long term.\n Turning to our third quarter results in more detail. Net revenues grew 16% to $2.048 billion, with comparable brand revenue growth of 16.9%, with comps accelerating to 41.3% on a 2-year basis.\n This strong performance was broad-based across all brands and both channels. In fact, against tougher compares, our e-commerce business accelerated to over 67% of our total revenues from the second quarter and was our highest 2-year comp ever at 64%. By brand, West Elm delivered a 22.5% comp, taking year-to-date revenues for the brand to over $1.5 billion. Pottery Barn, our largest brand, drove their fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit comps with a 15.9% comp. Pottery Barn Kids and Teen grew at a comp of 16.9% and had their highest 2-year comp ever.\n Williams-Sonoma drove a 7.6% comp accelerating from the second quarter and on top of 30.4% last year. And our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined continue to drive significant growth at a 26.5% comp, and all brands grew nearly 40% or higher on a 2-year basis.\n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin expanded 370 basis points to 43.7%. Our selling margins drove 280 basis points of this expansion. And relative to 2019, our selling margins are up 430 basis points, in line with our first half results, despite higher ocean freight costs incurred during the quarter.\n These strong margin results reflect our pricing power from our proprietary design products and the advantage of our vertically integrated sourcing and production, which allows us to engineer our product for value and to best navigate through the various macro complexities. We are pleased to deliver another quarter of strong top line sales and merchandise margin expansion. Occupancy cost leverage was also a factor in our gross margin expansion, leveraging approximately 90 basis points, resulting from higher sales and low occupancy dollar growth.\n Occupancy costs were approximately $183 million, up 5.1% year-over-year and relatively in line with our second quarter growth. The year-over-year increase includes a onetime impact from rent true-ups and rent abatements last year as well as the incremental impact from our new East Coast distribution center, which gives us additional capacity to support our strong customer demand. We were pleased to see another quarter of occupancy leverage reflecting the strength of our top line and the ongoing success of our retail optimization efforts.\n SG&A in the third quarter was in line with the prior quarters at 27.5% of net revenue. Year-over-year, SG&A deleveraged 320 basis points, driven by higher advertising spend coming off of our substantially reduced costs in 2020 and our decision to incrementally invest in advertising.\n As we have said all year, given our record levels of profitability, we have been strategically and aggressively investing in high ROI advertising to drive new customer acquisition, retention and top line growth, which clearly is working. We continue to see record new customer counts and strong demand, which has benefited our business to date and will continue to drive growth well into the future.\n Furthermore, we view it as a competitive advantage to be in a position to increase spend today while the competition may need to pull back to offset incremental supply chain costs. And despite this expected deleverage, we still delivered SG&A rates near historically low pre-pandemic levels and another quarter of record profitability. Operating income grew to a record $333 million, resulting in an operating margin of 16.3%, expanding 60 basis points over last year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.32, up 30% from last year's record third quarter of $2.56 per diluted share.\n Put these results in context, we have not seen our performance weighing all year despite any shifts in the consumer wallet as the world reopens and being up against accelerating tougher year-over-year compares. In fact, year-to-date, we are tracking to a 28% comp or 41% on a 2-year basis, with 400 basis points of operating margin expansion at a 16.3% operating margin and over 85% growth in earnings.\n Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity levels and a cash balance of almost $660 million. The strength of our business has generated operating cash flow of almost $790 million year-to-date, which is approximately $60 million over last year's elevated cash flow levels.\n This cash flow strength has allowed us to fund the operations of the business, to invest over $140 million in capital expenditures and to return almost $790 million to our shareholders in the form of over $135 million in dividends and over $650 million in share repurchases. These decisions reflect our confidence in the sustainability of our growth and our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders.\n Moving down the balance sheet, merchandise inventories, which includes inventory and transit, were $1.272 billion, representing an increase of 13% over last year. Inventory on hand and available for sale was up 3% year-over-year. While that is an improvement from where we were in the second quarter, our inventory levels are still not aligned with demand and are below optimal levels. Our back order levels continue to be at record highs, driven by our strong demand and the supply chain disruptions that unfortunately continue to delay our order fulfillment, including the most recent delays out of Vietnam.\n As Laura mentioned, our phenomenal team and their aggressive actions, combined with our scale, has enabled us to navigate through these challenges better than others. And given our ongoing strong demand, we expect a return to more normalized inventory levels by mid-2022, with back order levels remaining elevated into the first half of 2022.\n Now let's turn to our expectations for the rest of the year and longer term. We are raising our 2021 outlook to reflect revenue growth from high teens to low 20s to now 22% to 23%, and operating margins from 16% to 17% to now 16.9% to 17.1%. This is our third consecutive raise this year.\n Additionally, we are also reiterating our longer-term outlook of revenues accelerating to $10 billion by 2024, with operating margins at least in line with our raised fiscal year '21 levels, which implies at least a mid- to high single-digit comp with margins at least holding over the next 3-plus years. We, of course, will revisit our 2022 and longer-term outlook next quarter in more detail. We are very confident in the fundamentals of the business and our strategies to sustain our growth into the future.\n In addition to the macro trends, our key differentiators and our successful growth initiatives, as previously mentioned, we have several other factors that give us confidence.\n First, our results to date. We saw comps accelerating even before the pandemic as a result of our growth initiatives to tie the 10% comp in February 2020. Our results during the pandemic continued to accelerate despite our retail stores being closed. And our results every quarter this year have held at a 2-year comp of approximately 40%, despite accelerating tougher year-over-year compares. And we did this while pulling back on all site-wide promotions and with low levels of available inventory for sale.\n Second, our proprietary products and vertically integrated sourcing and production, which provide us pricing power and the ability to optimize and engineer our products for value, drive strong merchandise margins in an environment with rising costs and competition.\n Third, our operating model. In addition to our pricing power, our operating model provides several opportunities to drive strong operating margins. From leverage from higher sales, including the additional accretion from our growth initiatives that have a higher operating margin to an accelerating shift online, which is more profitable. The continued occupancy leverage from the renegotiation of our lease agreements and further store closures, the various supply chain efficiencies, including automation and in-stock inventory levels and the continued emphasis on overall strong financial discipline, holding costs below sales growth.\n And finally, our liquidity. We have maintained a very strong and disciplined balance sheet with ample cash and no debt, which provides dry powder for opportunistic investments and incremental shareholder returns. All of this is what gives us the confidence in our short- and long-term outlook and our ability to deliver sustainable long-term growth and profitability with strong financial returns for our shareholders in 2022 and beyond. I would now also like to thank our associates without their unwavering commitment to driving these results, none of this would be possible.\n Happy holidays are all on the call. And now let's open the call for questions. Thank you. And the demand comps are relatively in line with the net comps. There's really no big story there. Thank you. $15 just recently... In July 2020. Sure. Chuck. Yes, so the $10 billion that we put out there that now recently we accelerated, right, last quarter to 2024, the algorithm associated with that is effectively a mid- to high single-digit growth per year. And that's what we're saying is sort of the -- where at least we think we'll be.\n Obviously, next quarter, we'll come out with more specific guidance for 2022 and see if there's any update to our longer-term outlook. But that is where the math comes into play as to where we think it will be for the $10 billion or better. And Chuck, back to the algorithm for $10 billion, it was assumed it was $1 billion in 5 years. So for a 100 comp, $700 million this year, could it be $1 billion next year? I mean, obviously, as we've been saying all year, we've been very successful with merch margin expansion, and we saw that continue. So that is the biggest driver is us pulling off of our site-wide promos. And we continued that all year, and yet we've been able to drive incredibly strong top line. So that's the biggest piece.\n Certainly, we did incur higher raw material costs like everybody else. But we've been able to navigate through it much better than everyone else, we believe, because of the fact that we design and house our product, and we can engineer it for value. And so we can make the necessary changes that we need to make to be able to still drive value for the customer and still drive profit to the company.\n The other thing I would say that is not reflective in there that you're -- that it's something new this quarter is we did incur a substantial ocean freight costs. And so I think you need to think about -- but for those, our expansion would be from a product margin perspective, would be in line with Q2. And so our merch margin expansion is still very strong.\n We have not seen that come back. We're still driving it. And in fact, if you take our selling margins and you look at them on a 2-year basis, we're in line with the first half of the year. And if you add back the ocean costs were actually is the highest a 2-year comp we've had in those selling margins. So we feel really great about the strength of our business. It's really all advertising, the deleverage, but it did come down from the second quarter from a deleverage perspective. And again, the point of that is that we're coming off of low levels off of 2020, and we're seeing this as a competitive advantage to invest in high ROI advertising.\n Many, many companies, as you've been reading and hearing have been pulling back because they have to be able to hit the bottom line. And we see that as an opportunity for us with our record operating margins to be able to go in and really invest in it and drive growth for the future. So that's what we're doing. Thank you for the great question. We're vertically integrated. As I said earlier, we designed -- we sourced -- we have, I think, 800 people in our Asia operations. We've been at this for a while. We have strong relationships with our vendors, and we are nimble. You watched us cover the really difficult tariff that people couldn't believe we could cover. I mean that was -- that's no small situation. And so yes, there's always a new challenge around the corner. I mean you just wait for it. But the great news is our team is so strong, and they usually see it coming before anybody else and they work to mitigate it.\n We're already thinking about next year and what it might be on the horizon and how we get in front of some of those things. It's also an advantage that we have multiple distribution points in the United States, so we can bring goods into multiple ports, which a lot of people can't do without spending a lot of money on dray. And so that's something that will serve us well, I think, next year. And we're also opening up and sourcing in other parts of the world that we've never sourced in large quantity in. And so whether it's Mexico or Brazil, we're looking at those markets very strongly and see opportunity in those markets.\n So I see our supply chain as a competitive advantage that allows us to really bring in great product and to deliver great quality. In terms of next year and the cost pressure, as Julie mentioned, we did spend more money this quarter that we just announced with bringing in our goods so that they'd be ready for the holidays.\n And while we improved our operating margin better than anyone thought we would, that money was in there. And that is an opportunity for next year because we don't see that continuing even into Q4. We see that, going forward, we will not have the same amount of cost. We'll have higher costs in some cases for the general contract on transportation, but we won't see the spot rate be as big a percent of our total containers in as we did for Q3 and Q2. Do you have anything to add to that?"

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brian Yee, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance and Treasury to discuss non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements. Please go ahead, sir. \nBrian Yee: Thank you. Good afternoon. This call should be considered in conjunction with the press release that we issued earlier today. Unless indicated otherwise, our discussion today will relate to results and guidance based on certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and our explanation of why the non-GAAP financial measures may be useful are discussed in Exhibit 1 of our press release.\n This call also contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which address the financial condition, results of operations, business initiatives, trends, growth plans and prospects of the company in 2021 and beyond and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.\n Please refer to the company's current press release and SEC filings, including the most recent 10-K for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.\n I will now turn the conference call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer. \nLaura Alber: Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. We are proud to report another quarter of outperformance with a 30% comp, strong growth across all brands and channels and 360 basis points of operating margin expansion.\n These second quarter results demonstrate the success of our growth strategies and the earnings power of our company. We have an advantage in our industry due to our exclusive in-house design capability, our channel strategy, which is digital-first, but not digital only, and our values with sustainability and equity underlying all that we do. Our teams have proven their ability to move with agility and to execute against macro complexities while building for the future and improving the environment for our customers, our communities and our associates.\n The momentum we are seeing in our business and our winning positioning set us up to continue to take share in a fractured market. We do not see any evidence that growth trends are waning. And in fact, we see favorability in the macro environment as more people prioritize their homes and home decor. We believe we are at the intersection of a transformative change that will accelerate the growth of our industry and our market share within the industry.\n Home sales in 2021 are expected to grow more than 20%, the most sales recorded since 2005. The acceptance of remote work is gaining traction with a number of remote hybrid workers expected to nearly double in 5 years from pre-COVID metrics. In addition, our growth strategies are gaining traction faster than we predicted, and our key differentiators are further distancing us from our competition. Therefore, we see a clear path to beating our previous revenue and profitability targets, and we are raising our full year revenue outlook again with revenue growth now expected to be in the high teens to low 20s and operating margins now expected to be in the range of 16% to 17%.\n Given our increased optimism, we now expect to achieve our long-term goal of $10 billion in revenues in 2024, 1 year faster than previously expected and with higher profitability, which will now be at or above our increased FY '21 operating margins.\n Now I'd like to talk in more detail about why our model stands out from the competition. First, our positioning. Our customers shop with us because we design high-quality and sustainable products that are engineered for value. Our platform of loved brands allows us to serve customers who are looking for quality and sustainable products at a great value across a wide range of aesthetics and scale.\n The home furnishings market is extremely fragmented. Our addressable market is $780 billion, and we currently only own approximately 1%. As the disruption from brick-and-mortar to online continues, our digital-first advantage built from decades of investments into our technology, supply chain and digital marketing infrastructure will only further distinguish us from competition and competitors that are retail dominant. And relative to the other strong online players in the market, our model is the only one with an exclusive product line and a high service model.\n Second, our growth strategies are working. And the new opportunities generated from these initiatives are incremental to our business today. From our existing brands, we have a long runway to expand our reach with existing and new customers. In West Elm, we are expanding into product white space and accelerating our presence both online and through new stores to drive our brand awareness from 20% to 60%. These growth initiatives will fuel our goal of growing this brand to $3 billion in revenues by 2024.\n In the Pottery Barn brands, we expect to reach nearly $5 billion by 2024 by driving incremental growth in categories such as upholstery, bath, baby and dorm. And our new updated aesthetic is resonating with both existing customers and a younger demographic of customers that are in the household formation mode.\n Williams-Sonoma is transforming their model to reach new customers with a higher penetration of e-commerce and a winning new store model supported with more product, exclusive products. And we have a substantial growth opportunity to take share in the high-end market with Williams-Sonoma Home.\n Rejuvenation, and Mark and Graham, with both having aggressive and profitable e-commerce growth in underserved categories, will further drive market share gains as they scale. Additionally, we have accelerators to our core business such as B2B, which is positioned to disrupt an underserved industry and further diversify our customer profile. B2B is now on track to reach almost $700 million by this year's end, which is well ahead of our growth goals to grow this business to at least $2 billion.\n Our global business, which is led by our capital-light franchise model, allows us to move into markets faster and more profitably and is targeted to become at least a $700 million business by 2024. Our cross-brand initiatives, which are supported by our best-in-class marketing effectiveness teams and loyalty programs like our new cross-brand credit card and growing key programs, are driving incremental growth within our brands.\n And finally, our design services, both online and in stores, we have built an ecosystem of design tools, which allow us to help furnish our customer spaces with 3D renderings created with our talented design staff or in a self-serve model online with virtual help. We already see the investments we have made in this technology paying off as large ticket orders and cross-brand orders continue to grow and as return rates continue to come down. The competitive advantage we are creating with our service model and tools will continue to grow into the future, led by our technology talent and digital-first and service mindset.\n In summary, the amplified power of all these factors, i.e., the macro, our winning positioning and our growth drivers, provides an overwhelming case for outsized returns into the future. Now as it relates to Q2, I would like to give you a few highlights, which foretell the opportunity I outlined above. Our growth this quarter was driven across all brands and channels. E-commerce grew at 12% and retail drove a 98% comp with both channels growing at a 2-year comp of over 50%. We delivered these sales more profitably with operating margins expanding another 360 basis points to 16.7% versus last year at 13.1%.\n In Pottery Barn, we drove an almost 30% comp in the second quarter. All categories are outperforming with notable strength in our indoor rustic modern casual point of view and in our outdoor business. We're also building momentum in our brand partnerships and our new business initiatives, including marketplace, apartment and bath renovation, which are all growing above 30%. Our early fall results are strong with inspiring collections across categories.\n In Pottery Barn Kids and Teen, we drove another quarter of double-digit comps at 18%, with strength across our proprietary 100% GREENGUARD Gold furniture, record-setting results in our back-to-school business and over 30% growth in our baby business.\n We saw an exceptional customer response to our expansion of personalized backpacks, new recycled fabrications and reusable eco-friendly food storage and water bottles as well as our new baby registry app. We are also seeing a very strong response to our Halloween launch, which should indicate a strong back half of the year with all the seasonal celebrations and gifting to come.\n In West Elm, our momentum continues to build with a 51% comp for the second quarter, which have strength across all categories with triple-digit growth in our upholstery and outdoor furniture businesses. We've expanded our year-round outdoor assortment and our new product collections and line extensions.\n New categories such as bath, kitchen and West Elm Kids are also fueling incremental growth for the brand. Our fall season is off to a strong start with continued strength across all categories and an exceptional response to our new opening price points, line extensions and new introductions.\n In the Williams-Sonoma brand, we drove another strong quarter with a 6.4% comp on top of last year's 29.4% comp, powered by our content-led marketing and a higher percentage of exclusive and Williams-Sonoma branded products, while at the same time, substantially reducing promotional activity. We see strength across key categories and follows off to a strong start.\n We're also very excited to share that our new store model is working. In Q2, we opened 3 new stores with our newly designed inspiring store design. These stores are lighter and brighter with clear destinations, improving the shopping experience. These stores are exceeding our forecast, and they represent a material opportunity for us to strengthen the brand and drive more profitable retail results.\n As a reminder, we have nearly 50 of our Williams-Sonoma stores up for renewal this year, which provides us the opportunity to materially improve profitability or close. Our Williams-Sonoma Home business continues to scale with our strategic reposition of the brand as a premium online furniture destination.\n Our high-end sustainable casual aesthetic is resonating with our high-end customers in an underserved market. We saw triple-digit demand comp in outdoor furniture, further validating our belief with the right assortment and digital presentation that WS Home brand will be one of our biggest growth opportunities.\n Cross-brand, our B2B division, continues to accelerate with another record breaking quarter, up nearly 125% to over $100 million (sic) [ $180 million ] in revenue. We continue to expand our portfolio of customers, which range from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses. Year-to-date, 71% of our sales have come from repeat customers and 50% of the B2B customers have shopped from more than one brand in our portfolio.\n We are a go-to resource for our clients across a range of their purchasing needs from furniture to corporate gifting. In addition to the sales growth, we are continuing to make notable progress on our strategic initiatives to further accelerate the growth of this business. We continue to believe that our differentiators and our ability to tailor to our customers' unique needs will allow us to further disrupt this industry and gain market share.\n In addition to B2B, we are making progress migrating our customers across our brands. As a reminder, cross-brand customers spend over 2x more than those who shop only one brand. And only 30% of our customers shop cross-brand today. We believe our brands offer an assortment that fulfills all rooms of the home with a product offering that is designed in-house, made from sustainable materials and of the highest quality.\n At the core of the cross-brand loyalty program is the key, our free loyalty program that incents and rewards customers for shopping across our portfolio. We also recently announced our partnership with Capital One with a new cross-brand credit card, which just launched and should further incentivize this cross-shopping behavior.\n Now I'd like to discuss the power of our digital-first advantage. E-commerce continues to drive our growth and profitability. Our in-house tech platform and rapid experimentation program continue to differentiate our customer shopping experience by improving speed, visibility to orders, site personalization and selling capabilities.\n For example, as we mentioned last quarter, more customers are using our 3D design tool, the Design Crew Room Planner, where we typically see 2x as many sales as we do with our average customer. In the second quarter, we saw even more usage. Plans created grew 35% over last year. This engagement with our customers extends with great service and presentation in our stores and omni services, which complement our digital platform.\n This operating model allowed us to generate strong e-commerce growth, maintaining at 65% of our revenue mix, while delivering some of the highest retail growth we have seen on both a 1-year and 2-year basis. The cohesiveness of our websites, stores and storytelling brings our products to life, improving our customers' ability to visualize and imagine our products in their home. And with the evolving nature of shopping behaviors, this synergy from our digital-first omni models have never felt more relevant.\n We are also proud to see quantifiable progress in our commitment to values, which is our third key differentiator. This quarter, we released our 2020 Impact Report, detailing progress on our ESG goals. We are proud to have already exceeded many of our goals, including our use of responsibly sourced wood, our commitment to pay fair trade premiums to our workers and our goal to invest in education and empowerment for workers.\n By the end of 2021, we intend to keep 75% of our waste from stores, distribution centers and offices out of landfill. This year, we have also set new long-term commitments, which includes selling 75% of our products with labels aligning with our social or environmental initiatives, significantly reducing our carbon footprint and sourcing 75% of our product purchases from suppliers with worker well-being programs. We believe our values of prioritizing the health of our planet, the well-being of our people and a shared sense of purpose to foster long-term sustainability, resonate with our customers and will drive positive change in our industry.\n As we look forward to the second half of the year, we remain confident in our ability to continue taking market share. Our upcoming product pipeline is strong, and we anticipate continued momentum across our entertaining and gifting-related categories as we move into the holiday seasons. Quarter to date, we continue to see strong top line growth and strong margins.\n As we look beyond this year, we have a clear path to drive top line and bottom line growth. Our operating models and our pricing power, resulting from our key differentiators, our in-house design, our digital-first channel, and our values, will set us apart from our competition and allow us to drive long-term growth and profitability. And this is why we have raised our full year and long-term outlook and have announced another quarterly dividend increase and a new increased share buyback program.\n Before I pass the call to Julie, I want to thank our team for their incredible commitment and hard work. Their energy, creativity and integrity are the pillars for the outstanding performance we continue to achieve.\n And with that, I would now like to pass the call over to Julie to discuss our financial results in more detail. \nJulie Whalen: Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. The continuation of our strong top line growth at record profitability levels was validated again with another quarter of outperformance on top of elevated growth last year.\n Our second quarter results reflect the power of our operating model and our 3 key differentiators. We are one of the only companies with an exclusive in-house design capability combined with a channel strategy that is digital-first, but not digital only, and that leads with sustainability and values across our business and in the communities where we work. All of this is becoming increasingly more important to the consumer as evidenced by our strong second quarter results.\n Turning to our second quarter results in more detail. Net revenues grew over 30% to approximately $1.95 billion with comparable brand revenue growth of 29.8% and 40.3% on a 2-year stack. Growth was broad-based starting with West Elm, with a record comp of 51.1%, which was an acceleration from the first quarter and an over 58% comp on a 2-year basis.\n Pottery Barn, our largest brand, delivered almost $750 million of revenue with a 29.6% comp and an almost 38% 2-year comp. Pottery Barn Kids and Teen drove another quarter of double-digit comps at 18% and an almost 23% comp on a 2-year basis. In the Williams-Sonoma brand, comps were 6.4% on top of the highest prior year compare of a 29.4% comp, resulting in an almost 36% 2-year comp. Our emerging brands, Rejuvenation, and Mark and Graham combined, accelerated to a 42.3% comp and an almost 58% comp on a 2-year basis. And our global business grew almost 50% to approximately $116 million.\n Moving down the income statement. We saw another quarter of substantial gross margin expansion of 710 basis points to 44%. Our selling margins drove 500 basis points of this expansion, which was an acceleration from the first quarter. It is evident our strategic decision to materially pull back on promotions is proving to be viable even with tougher compares. The fact that the products we sell are proprietary, high-quality and sustainable and are engineered for value enables us the pricing power to provide product at an initial great value in lieu of site-wide promotions.\n Occupancy costs also leveraged approximately 210 basis points, resulting from higher sales and low occupancy dollar growth. Occupancy costs were approximately $176 million or flat to the first quarter. Year-over-year occupancy costs grew 5.9%, primarily due to several rent abatements that were recorded last year during the second quarter. The occupancy benefits we are seeing from our rent renegotiations and the net closure of 33 stores at the end of 2020 has enabled us to minimize occupancy dollar growth and deliver this leverage. And we expect this benefit to continue based on our plan to close approximately 25% of our fleet over the next 5 years.\n SG&A in the second quarter was 27.3% of net revenues compared to 23.9% last year, deleveraging 340 basis points year-over-year. This rates held relatively in line with the first quarter and reflects the lowest second quarter SG&A rate we have had outside of last year, where we have substantially reduced our spend across the business in response to COVID and particularly in advertising. As a result, the year-over-year deleverage is primarily in advertising, where we have made incremental investments to drive our profitable top line growth and market share gains.\n Given the strength in our business, we have made a strategic decision to incrementally invest in high ROI advertising to drive new customer acquisition and to drive our growth in the back half and beyond. We see this as a competitive advantage as we are able to make these investments and still drive record profitability levels at a time where this may not be possible for others. And it is paying off with record new customer counts, including e-commerce customers growing almost 30% on a 2-year basis, the highest growth we have seen.\n We are pleased to see that despite these incremental costs, our overall cost discipline throughout SG&A allowed us to hold our rates at a pre-COVID historically low level helping to deliver another quarter of record profitability.\n Operating income grew to a record $326 million, resulting in an operating margin of 16.7%, expanding 360 basis points over last year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.24, up 80% from last year's record second quarter earnings per share of $1.80.\n On the balance sheet, liquidity levels remain strong. With $476 million year-to-date in operating cash flow or more than double last year, we ended the quarter with $655 million in cash after funding the operations of the business, paying off our term loan of $300 million earlier this year and maximizing shareholder returns.\n During the second quarter, we invested another $36 million in capital expenditures and returned over $180 million to shareholders in the form of $45 million in dividends and $135 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have repurchased over $450 million of our shares or approximately 3x our full year typical share buyback level which reflects our confidence in the sustainability of our strong growth and profitability and our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders.\n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories, including inventory in transits, were $1.171 billion for an increase of 12% over last year. However, our inventory on hand and available for sale is still down to last year with a 2.5% decline. Our inventory levels have sequentially improved. However, they are not at the levels we had expected at this time. We continue to be impacted by our stronger-than-expected demand across all brands as well as various supply chain disruptions, including industry-wide container shortages coming out of Asia, delays due to COVID surges in Vietnam and Indonesia, and a recent port closure in China. And it's hard to predict with certainty when these supply chain challenges will be fully resolved. As a result, at this point, we expect back order levels to remain elevated with moderate improvements in our inventory levels through the balance of the year.\n Now let me turn to our expectations for the rest of the year and longer term. As Laura said, we are raising our 2021 outlook from low double digit to mid-teen revenue growth to high teens to low 20s revenue growth, with operating margins now projected to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We are confident in our ability to deliver this higher outlook given the strength of our business year-to-date, the accelerating momentum in our growth initiatives and the macro trends that will fuel our business for years to come.\n As a result of our strong expectations for 2021 and beyond, we see an accelerated path to growth and profitability longer term. We now believe we will hit our target of $10 billion in revenues by 2024 or 1 year earlier and with higher profitability holding at least at our further raised fiscal year '21 operating margin.\n I would now like to tell you why we are so confident in maintaining these operating margin levels. We believe we are best positioned to continue to deliver record level operating margins despite increased raw materials, freight costs and distribution center labor for the following reasons: ongoing overall sales leverage, including the additional accretion from our growth initiatives that have a higher operating margin. An accelerating shift online where the operating margin profile is higher. Continued occupancy leverage from the renegotiation of our lease agreements and further store closures. The pricing power and our merchandise margins due to our differentiated product positioning with design-led, value-engineered and sustainable products. Various supply chain efficiencies, including automation and in-stock inventory levels and from a continued emphasis on overall strong financial discipline.\n As far as our capital allocation in 2021, we are maintaining our balanced approach of first investing in the business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. We are on track to invest towards the higher end of our range at approximately $250 million in the business this year, with spend prioritized on technology and supply chain initiatives that primarily support our e-commerce growth. Given the strength of our business and liquidity, we are taking this opportunity to aggressively pursue incremental investments in the business to support our long-term elevated growth.\n We also plan to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of further increased quarterly dividend payouts and an increased level of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have paid $91 million in dividends, a 15% increase and over $450 million in share repurchases compared to no repurchases last year. And today, given the strength in our business and our liquidity, we announced an additional quarterly dividend increase of 20% and a new share repurchase authorization to $1.025 billion, a $700 million increase to what is remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.\n We are committed to maximizing shareholder returns and given our long-term growth and profitability outlook, we continue to believe that our stock is undervalued. As a result, we believe investing even more in our own stock will drive long-term financial returns for our shareholders.\n In summary, our results in the second quarter further validate our ability to deliver sustainable strong growth and profitability. We believe we are uniquely positioned with the favorable long-term macro trends, including a strong housing market driving ongoing investment in the home, the disruption of brick-and-mortar and an accelerating shift to e-commerce, the increasing importance of sustainability and being a values-driven company, combined with our key differentiators, our accelerating growth initiatives, our strong operating cash flow and liquidity and a proven track record of strong financial discipline. All of this will enable us to drive long-term growth and profitability and strong financial returns for our shareholders for years to come.\n I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Adrienne Yih from Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Well, another stunning quarter. So congratulations to the entire team. \nJulie Whalen: Thank you. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: You're welcome. So I guess, Julie, I'll start with you about this second quarter of 43% gross margin, last quarter 44% gross margin externally reported this quarter. If you can, can you help us -- how does that kind of roll back up into merchandise margins relative to history? And how much more room is there to the upside on pure merch margins? And then secondarily, wanted to see AUC, right? So the average unit cost. Any color on what that's up maybe this quarter? And did that get worse in the third and fourth quarters as we've heard from many people? \nJulie Whalen: Thanks, Adrienne. As far as merchandise margin, I think, first of all, I want to remind everybody that we saw merch margin expansion back even in 2018. So this is something we've been working on. Obviously, not to this degree. We've had a fundamental shift in the company to substantially pull back on site-wide promotions. And the reason we can do that is because of our pricing power because of what we sell that it's in-house design, it's proprietary and it's designed for value, engineered for value.\n And so we can then come out with initial price that is relevant to the customer and a good value and allow us to not do as many site-wide promotions. And so that's a fundamental shift that we have now been pursuing pretty aggressively for a while now. And so we think this can continue. Will it continue at the same degree? Probably not. I would model that to the same degree. We're very pleased to see continuing strong selling margin expansion from, I think, it was $400 million last quarter to $500 million this quarter.\n Obviously, we also are going to have some raw material price increases and freight cost increases, so that's going to put pressure on that line. But I think the team has done an incredible job of managing through that and mitigating those costs. And because we're vertically integrated, we're better positioned than most to be able to do that. So we do think this is sustainable, but maybe not to the same level. \nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez from the Telsey Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernandez: Congratulations also on a strong quarter. Can you think about how demand progressed through the quarter and any additional color that you can give us about the third quarter so far? \nJulie Whalen: The demand was incredibly strong, but it's pretty much all quarter long. I mean, obviously, with these kinds of results that we've just had phenomenal top line performance. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we have not seen that wane. So we are very optimistic, clearly and confident about the future of our business. And it's just -- even on top of these elevated compares, we're seeing strong growth with 40% comps, both demand and net and Q1 and Q2 holding and strong growth as we enter the third quarter. \nCristina Fernandez: And if I could ask a second question, thinking about the 16% to 17% operating margin longer term, what does that imply for the mix of the business between e-commerce and retail? Does it need to stay at the current level? \nJulie Whalen: Well, we have assumed that e-commerce will continue to grow. Obviously, we're pleased we're able to hold 65% despite the fact that we have the retail recovery this year, and so that makes it a little bit volatile, so to speak. But we're still holding at 65%. We've said before, we plan to at least grow it to 70%. And so that's assumed within our numbers. But we have many opportunities to drive operating margin expansion and to be able to at least hold where we plan to come out in 2021.\n First, we'll have the ongoing sales leverage with additional accretion by the way from our growth initiatives, which I think is really important to understand that in B2B, in marketplace and in franchise, for example, they may have some pressure on the gross margin line, but they are incredibly accretive to the total company operating margin. So as those have an outsized growth potential, as we've seen, they will, by themselves, help with the operating margin expansion going forward.\n And then you have an accelerating shift to online, which has always been more profitable. As you may recall, back for years, we used to report that it was above a 20% operating margin, and it's even higher today, obviously, with the top line sales flow through. So as that shifts more and more online, we expect that to drive operating margin expansion. Continued occupancy leverage will drive that. Given the fact that we're still optimizing our retail fleet, and we're renegotiating leases, and we're closing less profitable stores, I think we've demonstrated that we've been able to do that and hold our operating costs down while we're driving top line.\n And then it's back to our pricing power. The fact that we design our own product and engineer it for value that gives us a lot of leverage on the operating margin line, plus everything else from supply chain efficiencies and all kinds of things. So all of that gives us the confidence to believe that we at least can hold the 16% to 17% for this year and then going forward as accelerated pace on the top line. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. \nCurtis Nagle: So 2 quick ones. One just kind of out of curiosity thinking about -- I'm not asking any questions on sort of the cadence or growth of 3Q. But you guys have been working on registry rates, both for baby and weddings, those businesses probably weren't in great shape last year. Thinking about it, these are kind of opening up how much has, I guess, wedding in particular started to help? Or I guess, is it helping just given we finally are starting to see people get married again and actually celebrate? That's the first one.\n And then just second, just could you give any clarity in terms of July? I think you'd mentioned that some investments or more investments were being made in marketing or advertising dollars. How should we think about that relative to 1Q? Or kind of, I guess, quarter year-over-year in Q2. \nLaura Alber: Yes. Thanks. Let me start. It's Laura. With the question, I'm so glad you brought up wedding registry. I probably should have said it in my prepared remarks, it is phenomenal. As you can imagine, I mean, there weren't any wedding, now there are weddings. And we've -- I just asked Julie, if I could tell you, we're up 98% in wedding registry. I mean that's the sales. That's a big number. And baby's been up the whole time. We have a new baby app, which is very successful. We're learning across all of our brands, the more time we spend on mobile, the better because it drives conversion, it's really the choice for our customers.\n So you're going to see us do even more things with mobile and make it really help the selling proposition. But in those 2 very important life-stage buying opportunities, we're seeing tremendous growth, and we're continuing to support it with technology. Likewise, these trends, as I said, hybrid work and then the reality of people learn how to cook and they're still cooking and they love cooking, and so we're continuing to see those businesses in Williams-Sonoma that support those, whether it be coffee or food at home, those businesses are quite strong for us today, even though we had the big surge last year.\n And then the back-to-school, I mentioned in terms of going back to school, those backpacks are a big part of that tradition. And so of course, that's a business that we've seen really strong growth in. And as we craft into the season of holidays, Halloween is tremendous. If anybody on the call needs to buy anything, you should buy it now because we're seeing a very strong fast curve. And I imagine that we'll see the same with Thanksgiving and Christmas, which was a tough time for everybody last year and should be, hopefully, one where you can at least have small gatherings, if not more. So I think there's a lot of natural upside in life-stage trends that we are going to be right there with our customers on appropriately to help them make the most of those. So thanks for that question. I'm going to pass it over to Julie to answer the marketing advertising question. \nJulie Whalen: Yes. So as far as the advertising, we have said before that certainly, we're going to be incrementally investing in advertising year-over-year. Last year, certainly, that was a big lever for us to pull back on Q2 was some of the lowest spend in SG&A period, which advertising was a big piece of it until we could read the business and make sure that we were okay going forward. And so you're going to see year-over-year pressure on that line on SG&A because of it. But I think the key takeaway for you guys is to realize that it's a competitive advantage right now.\n I mean most companies don't have the same kind of margin expansion, whether it's merch margin, gross margin or operating margin expansion that we have that where we can take that and reinvest back into advertising when others may not be able to do so right now. They may have to pull back because they're trying to pay for freight or they're trying to pay for raw material increases or whatever it may be, and we don't have to do that right now. And so we're taking that opportunity and investing to drive new customer acquisition and to fuel future growth. And we think that's a real big competitive advantage. \nOperator: We'll hear next from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham: Congrats on the strong results. I have one bigger picture question and one specific question. Bigger picture, I am very intrigued by your thoughts on this transformational investment in the home and the drivers behind that. When you think about the trend towards hybrid work environment, is that the primary thing that you're considering if you think about higher investment levels in the home furnishing, home furniture, et cetera, going forward? Or are there bigger things that you're thinking about? \nLaura Alber: Yes. I think it's the time we've all spent more at home has made us realize the importance of home. It has always been people's primary investment. And so that hasn't -- that's not a new piece, but the amount of time and the ability for you to improve that space is so real and the happiness that, that gives you and the productivity. And so it's not just hybrid work, it's everything. It's learning how to cook. You see trends of families having their kids come back and live with them or bringing in their parents to live with them and all those moves.\n At the same time, supply of houses is still too low. And there's a lot of people who are out looking for second homes and even if they can't afford it themselves, pulling the resources together with friends to complete that fantasy of buying get away home. And those are the things when you talk to people about what they're thinking about now and what's important to them, this is what you hear. You hear about their kitchen remodel. You hear about the second home they wish they could buy. I mean I'm sure you're hearing it with your friends and family.\n And this is a really, really important trend that I don't think is going to be transient. I think it's one that will continue to last for a long time and one that puts us in a very good position to not only take advantage of the trend but also gain share because, as I said earlier, there's just nobody really has much share in this world, and nobody is doing what we're doing. \nSeth Basham: Got it. That's helpful perspective. And then secondly, thinking about the outlook for the balance of the year, obviously, your guidance rate is impressive, but it does imply a material deceleration in comparable store sales on a 2-year basis from the first half of the year despite the fact that you guys mentioned that you see a very strong start and you expect strong holiday outlook. Is that just due to conservatism? Or is there something else that we should be thinking about? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I wouldn't read anything more into that. As we've said, we've had very strong success year-to-date. We've said for quite a few quarters now, and we've seen it strong going into the third quarter. On the high end, we're guiding to low 20s, which is still very high on a 2-year basis. Certainly, we are taking into consideration like everybody else, the impacts from the supply chain challenges that are out there. But I think with our incredible supply chain team, we're best positioned to maneuver through that better than anybody, but we're being thoughtful of that, and that's why we have the range that we have. But with that said, there's absolutely no fundamental difference in our outlook for our business. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Congrats on an awesome quarter. Laura, you talked about not seeing any signs of a slowdown, but I'm actually curious if you're seeing an acceleration in your business with back-to-school here, some are ending et cetera? And I guess if so, what banner? And then at the same time, you've sized up B2B as, I think, a $700 million long-term opportunity. Can you just remind us what you think Williams-Sonoma Home could be long term? \nLaura Alber: Yes. Sure. I may need Julie's help on this. First of all, the obvious business that gets the most bang from back-to-school is our kids and teen businesses because that is we really address that. If you go to home pages, right now, you'll see that. And so of course, that would imply that those have the most upside relative to back-to-school.\n In terms of B2B, first of all, let me make sure that I didn't misspeak earlier as Julie wrote me a note and said, she thought I said $100 million when I meant to say $180 million for the quarter. So I'm going to take this opportunity with your question to correct myself if I misspoke, I apologize. So B2B, it is a really good question on how big this can be and when -- it's certainly faster than we ever expected. And we keep making jokes about how much bigger could it be. But we're certainly on track to we said $1 billion in what, Julie? \nJulie Whalen: Originally 5 years. \nLaura Alber: In 5 years. \nJulie Whalen: Now we're at $700 million this year, which is... \nLaura Alber: Yes, $700 million this year. So the reason I didn't put a number out there is because I don't want to be too small-minded about it. I can say a number, and then that is not even close to what our opportunity is. It's a monster opportunity. \nCharles Grom: Got you. And what about Williams-Sonoma Home? \nLaura Alber: Williams-Sonoma Home, I don't think we've put that number out there. We just -- we've really changed our strategy from doing parts of the stores being online focused, which we think is a huge advantage in the market. And we just brought a new leader in, and it's too early for us to put a number around it, but so far, so good. And I do see it as a big growth driver in a large underserved market. \nCharles Grom: Got it. And then one for Julie, just in order to get to that 16% to 17% EBIT margin here in '21 on a, let's say, a 20% revenue growth implies less flow-through in the second half of the year. It sounds like there's going to be some incremental ad spend. But can you just help us think about the puts and takes and any variability between the third and the fourth quarter that you want us to think about? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I mean, certainly, ad spend will come into play in the SG&A line, but also we still believe we're going to have gross margin expansion both from merch margin expansion and from occupancy leverage. I wouldn't focus too much on that. I mean, the reality is if you look at the 16% to 17%, it's almost 2x where we were in 2019. So we're just being thoughtful of that. And certainly, we're also keeping in mind the increase of raw material costs and freight costs that everyone is maneuvering through. But could it be higher? Sure. But right now, we think this is the right target, given we've got a big back half to go, and we'll update you as we move through the year. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Nice quarter. Two quick questions. I missed prepared remarks. I didn't know what you talked about regarding freight, how you're navigating the environment, how your inventory position looks and then even into next year? And then the second part is on the advertising spend. I did catch some of that. Can you talk about the time frame in terms of return? Are you spending because you're seeing the immediate return? Or is this medium longer term branding? \nJulie Whalen: From an inventory perspective, what we said is you'll see sequential improvement. I think last quarter, it was 1.7% or something like that, and we moved to a 12% increase. But if you look at our inventory that's on hand available for sale, it's still a decline of 2.5%. So we're not where we expected to be. And that's just, quite frankly, because, one, where our demand just hasn't stopped. So it's constantly really high demand. So to get back in stock is really challenging.\n And you combine that with the supply chain challenges that all are facing, we are better positioned than most. I guarantee that given our scale and long-term relationships and our credible supply chain team and who always jumps ahead of this, way ahead of anybody to think about the tariffs and everything else that we did. And so certainly, that is impacting us. We're not immune to it. And so that will cause us to have higher back order levels and throughout the balance of the year, but we do expect inventory to improve moderately as we move throughout the year. \nLaura Alber: And there's things that I'm really proud of. I want to make sure we mentioned that are very competitive. So for example, right now, in our upholstery business, where we make our own -- a large percent of our own upholstery, we were previously quoting about 100 days, which is when you look at a lot of people's sites still better than most, but we are now down to 80 days. And looking at dropping that further as our incredible upholster teams are really producing more than anyone else. And so we're thrilled about that. And that's the kind of thing you gave us a good challenge.\n And I think most times, you're going to see we're going to outperform and take that challenge and make it into an opportunity for us because it's all about vis-a-vis custom furniture from anyone else. So Felix, would you like to answer the question about advertising without being too competitive about telling everybody how we do it, but answer that how we think about? \nFelix Carbullido: Yes, you got it. Simeon, so short term or long term, I guess, what we focus mostly on is return on investment, and then we really focus on customers who are in market. So in market for furniture, we're very focused on people looking to are either moving. As Laura mentioned, wedding, having a baby, those are high, high-value customers. And so our acquisition strategies around there are very strong and are prevalent throughout all of our banners.\n From a long-term perspective, again, when we see this uptick in furniture, that's always a good signal for us in terms of what it means from lifetime value. So I would say, without presenting it out,  we're focused on end market in the short term and then high-value customers in the long term. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. \nDavid Lantz: This is David Lantz on for Zach. To start within merchandise margins, we were wondering if you could unpack that a little bit in terms of price increases, mix and the absence of promotions and clearance. And then a follow-up would be, how did traffic and ticket trend in the quarter? And what was the impact of inflation? \nLaura Alber: Boy, impact of inflation. I mean, that's a hard one to tease out. But in terms of promos, our strategy is to offer the customer great value in our products, but not to run a promotional business. And this quarter reflects that strategy. It's interesting, the broader competitive set I think is actually getting more promotional based on our research. And yet, we were able to outperform top line and bottom line without running promotions. We are aggressive about our inventory turns and about slow movers and interesting fact is that our clearance inventory is down 34% year-over-year because of our aggressiveness in clearing some of the slow movers, which is really, really important for us to continue to do with our large cube furniture.\n Traffic is another really interesting story because in our retail stores, believe it or not, as much as traffic has improved, it's still down to 2019, and we're running these crazy good comps. They're doing such a good job in our stores selling, and our product is so appealing to our customers. But imagine when the traffic comps, how much better it could even be. So yes, we are not back to 2019 level of traffic in our stores, but it is an opportunity.\n We're seeing customers buy more from us. They're buying more furniture and they're buying more pieces as they look at decorating their whole homes with us. And also, as I said earlier, online, they're shopping across brand. And we're pushing that. It's not just luck. It's that we are pushing cross-brand sales. And we just launched this week the new credit card. I think it might be before we run out of time, the opportunity to hand it over to Felix to talk about what makes this credit card different from our PLCC and Williams-Sonoma card before, Felix? \nFelix Carbullido: Yes. I mean we -- this week, Monday, in fact, we launched our new cross-brand credit card in partnership with Capital One as part of our ever-expanding loyalty program. And so when you shop with any of our brands online or in-store, you get 5% back in rewards. You get 10% back in your first 30 days. When you shop at what's incremental to our past programs is when you shop at grocery stores and restaurants, you receive 4% back. And when you shop anywhere else, you get 1% back in rewards.\n All cardholders, regardless of which brand they sign up for -- with get free shipping at Williams-Sonoma as well. So the card is designed to drive an increased retention in each individual brand, but it's also to incent and reward customers shopping across our brands. So as Laura said, that average sale per customer is one of our key weapons in terms of growth, and we continue to believe that we can increase our share of wallet by introducing our sister brands across our portfolios to our customer. \nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. \nLaura Alber: I just want to say thank you to you all for joining us and for your support, and I look forward to hopefully seeing you in person, and if not, talking to you again at the next quarter. Happy shopping. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you all for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes, you got it. Simeon, so short term or long term, I guess, what we focus mostly on is return on investment, and then we really focus on customers who are in market. So in market for furniture, we're very focused on people looking to are either moving. As Laura mentioned, wedding, having a baby, those are high, high-value customers. And so our acquisition strategies around there are very strong and are prevalent throughout all of our banners.\n From a long-term perspective, again, when we see this uptick in furniture, that's always a good signal for us in terms of what it means from lifetime value. So I would say, without presenting it out,  we're focused on end market in the short term and then high-value customers in the long term. Yes. I mean we -- this week, Monday, in fact, we launched our new cross-brand credit card in partnership with Capital One as part of our ever-expanding loyalty program. And so when you shop with any of our brands online or in-store, you get 5% back in rewards. You get 10% back in your first 30 days. When you shop at what's incremental to our past programs is when you shop at grocery stores and restaurants, you receive 4% back. And when you shop anywhere else, you get 1% back in rewards.\n All cardholders, regardless of which brand they sign up for -- with get free shipping at Williams-Sonoma as well. So the card is designed to drive an increased retention in each individual brand, but it's also to incent and reward customers shopping across our brands. So as Laura said, that average sale per customer is one of our key weapons in terms of growth, and we continue to believe that we can increase our share of wallet by introducing our sister brands across our portfolios to our customer."

            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. We are proud to report another quarter of outperformance with a 30% comp, strong growth across all brands and channels and 360 basis points of operating margin expansion.\n These second quarter results demonstrate the success of our growth strategies and the earnings power of our company. We have an advantage in our industry due to our exclusive in-house design capability, our channel strategy, which is digital-first, but not digital only, and our values with sustainability and equity underlying all that we do. Our teams have proven their ability to move with agility and to execute against macro complexities while building for the future and improving the environment for our customers, our communities and our associates.\n The momentum we are seeing in our business and our winning positioning set us up to continue to take share in a fractured market. We do not see any evidence that growth trends are waning. And in fact, we see favorability in the macro environment as more people prioritize their homes and home decor. We believe we are at the intersection of a transformative change that will accelerate the growth of our industry and our market share within the industry.\n Home sales in 2021 are expected to grow more than 20%, the most sales recorded since 2005. The acceptance of remote work is gaining traction with a number of remote hybrid workers expected to nearly double in 5 years from pre-COVID metrics. In addition, our growth strategies are gaining traction faster than we predicted, and our key differentiators are further distancing us from our competition. Therefore, we see a clear path to beating our previous revenue and profitability targets, and we are raising our full year revenue outlook again with revenue growth now expected to be in the high teens to low 20s and operating margins now expected to be in the range of 16% to 17%.\n Given our increased optimism, we now expect to achieve our long-term goal of $10 billion in revenues in 2024, 1 year faster than previously expected and with higher profitability, which will now be at or above our increased FY '21 operating margins.\n Now I'd like to talk in more detail about why our model stands out from the competition. First, our positioning. Our customers shop with us because we design high-quality and sustainable products that are engineered for value. Our platform of loved brands allows us to serve customers who are looking for quality and sustainable products at a great value across a wide range of aesthetics and scale.\n The home furnishings market is extremely fragmented. Our addressable market is $780 billion, and we currently only own approximately 1%. As the disruption from brick-and-mortar to online continues, our digital-first advantage built from decades of investments into our technology, supply chain and digital marketing infrastructure will only further distinguish us from competition and competitors that are retail dominant. And relative to the other strong online players in the market, our model is the only one with an exclusive product line and a high service model.\n Second, our growth strategies are working. And the new opportunities generated from these initiatives are incremental to our business today. From our existing brands, we have a long runway to expand our reach with existing and new customers. In West Elm, we are expanding into product white space and accelerating our presence both online and through new stores to drive our brand awareness from 20% to 60%. These growth initiatives will fuel our goal of growing this brand to $3 billion in revenues by 2024.\n In the Pottery Barn brands, we expect to reach nearly $5 billion by 2024 by driving incremental growth in categories such as upholstery, bath, baby and dorm. And our new updated aesthetic is resonating with both existing customers and a younger demographic of customers that are in the household formation mode.\n Williams-Sonoma is transforming their model to reach new customers with a higher penetration of e-commerce and a winning new store model supported with more product, exclusive products. And we have a substantial growth opportunity to take share in the high-end market with Williams-Sonoma Home.\n Rejuvenation, and Mark and Graham, with both having aggressive and profitable e-commerce growth in underserved categories, will further drive market share gains as they scale. Additionally, we have accelerators to our core business such as B2B, which is positioned to disrupt an underserved industry and further diversify our customer profile. B2B is now on track to reach almost $700 million by this year's end, which is well ahead of our growth goals to grow this business to at least $2 billion.\n Our global business, which is led by our capital-light franchise model, allows us to move into markets faster and more profitably and is targeted to become at least a $700 million business by 2024. Our cross-brand initiatives, which are supported by our best-in-class marketing effectiveness teams and loyalty programs like our new cross-brand credit card and growing key programs, are driving incremental growth within our brands.\n And finally, our design services, both online and in stores, we have built an ecosystem of design tools, which allow us to help furnish our customer spaces with 3D renderings created with our talented design staff or in a self-serve model online with virtual help. We already see the investments we have made in this technology paying off as large ticket orders and cross-brand orders continue to grow and as return rates continue to come down. The competitive advantage we are creating with our service model and tools will continue to grow into the future, led by our technology talent and digital-first and service mindset.\n In summary, the amplified power of all these factors, i.e., the macro, our winning positioning and our growth drivers, provides an overwhelming case for outsized returns into the future. Now as it relates to Q2, I would like to give you a few highlights, which foretell the opportunity I outlined above. Our growth this quarter was driven across all brands and channels. E-commerce grew at 12% and retail drove a 98% comp with both channels growing at a 2-year comp of over 50%. We delivered these sales more profitably with operating margins expanding another 360 basis points to 16.7% versus last year at 13.1%.\n In Pottery Barn, we drove an almost 30% comp in the second quarter. All categories are outperforming with notable strength in our indoor rustic modern casual point of view and in our outdoor business. We're also building momentum in our brand partnerships and our new business initiatives, including marketplace, apartment and bath renovation, which are all growing above 30%. Our early fall results are strong with inspiring collections across categories.\n In Pottery Barn Kids and Teen, we drove another quarter of double-digit comps at 18%, with strength across our proprietary 100% GREENGUARD Gold furniture, record-setting results in our back-to-school business and over 30% growth in our baby business.\n We saw an exceptional customer response to our expansion of personalized backpacks, new recycled fabrications and reusable eco-friendly food storage and water bottles as well as our new baby registry app. We are also seeing a very strong response to our Halloween launch, which should indicate a strong back half of the year with all the seasonal celebrations and gifting to come.\n In West Elm, our momentum continues to build with a 51% comp for the second quarter, which have strength across all categories with triple-digit growth in our upholstery and outdoor furniture businesses. We've expanded our year-round outdoor assortment and our new product collections and line extensions.\n New categories such as bath, kitchen and West Elm Kids are also fueling incremental growth for the brand. Our fall season is off to a strong start with continued strength across all categories and an exceptional response to our new opening price points, line extensions and new introductions.\n In the Williams-Sonoma brand, we drove another strong quarter with a 6.4% comp on top of last year's 29.4% comp, powered by our content-led marketing and a higher percentage of exclusive and Williams-Sonoma branded products, while at the same time, substantially reducing promotional activity. We see strength across key categories and follows off to a strong start.\n We're also very excited to share that our new store model is working. In Q2, we opened 3 new stores with our newly designed inspiring store design. These stores are lighter and brighter with clear destinations, improving the shopping experience. These stores are exceeding our forecast, and they represent a material opportunity for us to strengthen the brand and drive more profitable retail results.\n As a reminder, we have nearly 50 of our Williams-Sonoma stores up for renewal this year, which provides us the opportunity to materially improve profitability or close. Our Williams-Sonoma Home business continues to scale with our strategic reposition of the brand as a premium online furniture destination.\n Our high-end sustainable casual aesthetic is resonating with our high-end customers in an underserved market. We saw triple-digit demand comp in outdoor furniture, further validating our belief with the right assortment and digital presentation that WS Home brand will be one of our biggest growth opportunities.\n Cross-brand, our B2B division, continues to accelerate with another record breaking quarter, up nearly 125% to over $100 million (sic) [ $180 million ] in revenue. We continue to expand our portfolio of customers, which range from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses. Year-to-date, 71% of our sales have come from repeat customers and 50% of the B2B customers have shopped from more than one brand in our portfolio.\n We are a go-to resource for our clients across a range of their purchasing needs from furniture to corporate gifting. In addition to the sales growth, we are continuing to make notable progress on our strategic initiatives to further accelerate the growth of this business. We continue to believe that our differentiators and our ability to tailor to our customers' unique needs will allow us to further disrupt this industry and gain market share.\n In addition to B2B, we are making progress migrating our customers across our brands. As a reminder, cross-brand customers spend over 2x more than those who shop only one brand. And only 30% of our customers shop cross-brand today. We believe our brands offer an assortment that fulfills all rooms of the home with a product offering that is designed in-house, made from sustainable materials and of the highest quality.\n At the core of the cross-brand loyalty program is the key, our free loyalty program that incents and rewards customers for shopping across our portfolio. We also recently announced our partnership with Capital One with a new cross-brand credit card, which just launched and should further incentivize this cross-shopping behavior.\n Now I'd like to discuss the power of our digital-first advantage. E-commerce continues to drive our growth and profitability. Our in-house tech platform and rapid experimentation program continue to differentiate our customer shopping experience by improving speed, visibility to orders, site personalization and selling capabilities.\n For example, as we mentioned last quarter, more customers are using our 3D design tool, the Design Crew Room Planner, where we typically see 2x as many sales as we do with our average customer. In the second quarter, we saw even more usage. Plans created grew 35% over last year. This engagement with our customers extends with great service and presentation in our stores and omni services, which complement our digital platform.\n This operating model allowed us to generate strong e-commerce growth, maintaining at 65% of our revenue mix, while delivering some of the highest retail growth we have seen on both a 1-year and 2-year basis. The cohesiveness of our websites, stores and storytelling brings our products to life, improving our customers' ability to visualize and imagine our products in their home. And with the evolving nature of shopping behaviors, this synergy from our digital-first omni models have never felt more relevant.\n We are also proud to see quantifiable progress in our commitment to values, which is our third key differentiator. This quarter, we released our 2020 Impact Report, detailing progress on our ESG goals. We are proud to have already exceeded many of our goals, including our use of responsibly sourced wood, our commitment to pay fair trade premiums to our workers and our goal to invest in education and empowerment for workers.\n By the end of 2021, we intend to keep 75% of our waste from stores, distribution centers and offices out of landfill. This year, we have also set new long-term commitments, which includes selling 75% of our products with labels aligning with our social or environmental initiatives, significantly reducing our carbon footprint and sourcing 75% of our product purchases from suppliers with worker well-being programs. We believe our values of prioritizing the health of our planet, the well-being of our people and a shared sense of purpose to foster long-term sustainability, resonate with our customers and will drive positive change in our industry.\n As we look forward to the second half of the year, we remain confident in our ability to continue taking market share. Our upcoming product pipeline is strong, and we anticipate continued momentum across our entertaining and gifting-related categories as we move into the holiday seasons. Quarter to date, we continue to see strong top line growth and strong margins.\n As we look beyond this year, we have a clear path to drive top line and bottom line growth. Our operating models and our pricing power, resulting from our key differentiators, our in-house design, our digital-first channel, and our values, will set us apart from our competition and allow us to drive long-term growth and profitability. And this is why we have raised our full year and long-term outlook and have announced another quarterly dividend increase and a new increased share buyback program.\n Before I pass the call to Julie, I want to thank our team for their incredible commitment and hard work. Their energy, creativity and integrity are the pillars for the outstanding performance we continue to achieve.\n And with that, I would now like to pass the call over to Julie to discuss our financial results in more detail. Yes. Thanks. Let me start. It's Laura. With the question, I'm so glad you brought up wedding registry. I probably should have said it in my prepared remarks, it is phenomenal. As you can imagine, I mean, there weren't any wedding, now there are weddings. And we've -- I just asked Julie, if I could tell you, we're up 98% in wedding registry. I mean that's the sales. That's a big number. And baby's been up the whole time. We have a new baby app, which is very successful. We're learning across all of our brands, the more time we spend on mobile, the better because it drives conversion, it's really the choice for our customers.\n So you're going to see us do even more things with mobile and make it really help the selling proposition. But in those 2 very important life-stage buying opportunities, we're seeing tremendous growth, and we're continuing to support it with technology. Likewise, these trends, as I said, hybrid work and then the reality of people learn how to cook and they're still cooking and they love cooking, and so we're continuing to see those businesses in Williams-Sonoma that support those, whether it be coffee or food at home, those businesses are quite strong for us today, even though we had the big surge last year.\n And then the back-to-school, I mentioned in terms of going back to school, those backpacks are a big part of that tradition. And so of course, that's a business that we've seen really strong growth in. And as we craft into the season of holidays, Halloween is tremendous. If anybody on the call needs to buy anything, you should buy it now because we're seeing a very strong fast curve. And I imagine that we'll see the same with Thanksgiving and Christmas, which was a tough time for everybody last year and should be, hopefully, one where you can at least have small gatherings, if not more. So I think there's a lot of natural upside in life-stage trends that we are going to be right there with our customers on appropriately to help them make the most of those. So thanks for that question. I'm going to pass it over to Julie to answer the marketing advertising question. Yes. I think it's the time we've all spent more at home has made us realize the importance of home. It has always been people's primary investment. And so that hasn't -- that's not a new piece, but the amount of time and the ability for you to improve that space is so real and the happiness that, that gives you and the productivity. And so it's not just hybrid work, it's everything. It's learning how to cook. You see trends of families having their kids come back and live with them or bringing in their parents to live with them and all those moves.\n At the same time, supply of houses is still too low. And there's a lot of people who are out looking for second homes and even if they can't afford it themselves, pulling the resources together with friends to complete that fantasy of buying get away home. And those are the things when you talk to people about what they're thinking about now and what's important to them, this is what you hear. You hear about their kitchen remodel. You hear about the second home they wish they could buy. I mean I'm sure you're hearing it with your friends and family.\n And this is a really, really important trend that I don't think is going to be transient. I think it's one that will continue to last for a long time and one that puts us in a very good position to not only take advantage of the trend but also gain share because, as I said earlier, there's just nobody really has much share in this world, and nobody is doing what we're doing. Yes. Sure. I may need Julie's help on this. First of all, the obvious business that gets the most bang from back-to-school is our kids and teen businesses because that is we really address that. If you go to home pages, right now, you'll see that. And so of course, that would imply that those have the most upside relative to back-to-school.\n In terms of B2B, first of all, let me make sure that I didn't misspeak earlier as Julie wrote me a note and said, she thought I said $100 million when I meant to say $180 million for the quarter. So I'm going to take this opportunity with your question to correct myself if I misspoke, I apologize. So B2B, it is a really good question on how big this can be and when -- it's certainly faster than we ever expected. And we keep making jokes about how much bigger could it be. But we're certainly on track to we said $1 billion in what, Julie? In 5 years. Yes, $700 million this year. So the reason I didn't put a number out there is because I don't want to be too small-minded about it. I can say a number, and then that is not even close to what our opportunity is. It's a monster opportunity. Williams-Sonoma Home, I don't think we've put that number out there. We just -- we've really changed our strategy from doing parts of the stores being online focused, which we think is a huge advantage in the market. And we just brought a new leader in, and it's too early for us to put a number around it, but so far, so good. And I do see it as a big growth driver in a large underserved market. And there's things that I'm really proud of. I want to make sure we mentioned that are very competitive. So for example, right now, in our upholstery business, where we make our own -- a large percent of our own upholstery, we were previously quoting about 100 days, which is when you look at a lot of people's sites still better than most, but we are now down to 80 days. And looking at dropping that further as our incredible upholster teams are really producing more than anyone else. And so we're thrilled about that. And that's the kind of thing you gave us a good challenge.\n And I think most times, you're going to see we're going to outperform and take that challenge and make it into an opportunity for us because it's all about vis-a-vis custom furniture from anyone else. So Felix, would you like to answer the question about advertising without being too competitive about telling everybody how we do it, but answer that how we think about? Boy, impact of inflation. I mean, that's a hard one to tease out. But in terms of promos, our strategy is to offer the customer great value in our products, but not to run a promotional business. And this quarter reflects that strategy. It's interesting, the broader competitive set I think is actually getting more promotional based on our research. And yet, we were able to outperform top line and bottom line without running promotions. We are aggressive about our inventory turns and about slow movers and interesting fact is that our clearance inventory is down 34% year-over-year because of our aggressiveness in clearing some of the slow movers, which is really, really important for us to continue to do with our large cube furniture.\n Traffic is another really interesting story because in our retail stores, believe it or not, as much as traffic has improved, it's still down to 2019, and we're running these crazy good comps. They're doing such a good job in our stores selling, and our product is so appealing to our customers. But imagine when the traffic comps, how much better it could even be. So yes, we are not back to 2019 level of traffic in our stores, but it is an opportunity.\n We're seeing customers buy more from us. They're buying more furniture and they're buying more pieces as they look at decorating their whole homes with us. And also, as I said earlier, online, they're shopping across brand. And we're pushing that. It's not just luck. It's that we are pushing cross-brand sales. And we just launched this week the new credit card. I think it might be before we run out of time, the opportunity to hand it over to Felix to talk about what makes this credit card different from our PLCC and Williams-Sonoma card before, Felix? I just want to say thank you to you all for joining us and for your support, and I look forward to hopefully seeing you in person, and if not, talking to you again at the next quarter. Happy shopping."

            "name": "Julie Whalen",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. The continuation of our strong top line growth at record profitability levels was validated again with another quarter of outperformance on top of elevated growth last year.\n Our second quarter results reflect the power of our operating model and our 3 key differentiators. We are one of the only companies with an exclusive in-house design capability combined with a channel strategy that is digital-first, but not digital only, and that leads with sustainability and values across our business and in the communities where we work. All of this is becoming increasingly more important to the consumer as evidenced by our strong second quarter results.\n Turning to our second quarter results in more detail. Net revenues grew over 30% to approximately $1.95 billion with comparable brand revenue growth of 29.8% and 40.3% on a 2-year stack. Growth was broad-based starting with West Elm, with a record comp of 51.1%, which was an acceleration from the first quarter and an over 58% comp on a 2-year basis.\n Pottery Barn, our largest brand, delivered almost $750 million of revenue with a 29.6% comp and an almost 38% 2-year comp. Pottery Barn Kids and Teen drove another quarter of double-digit comps at 18% and an almost 23% comp on a 2-year basis. In the Williams-Sonoma brand, comps were 6.4% on top of the highest prior year compare of a 29.4% comp, resulting in an almost 36% 2-year comp. Our emerging brands, Rejuvenation, and Mark and Graham combined, accelerated to a 42.3% comp and an almost 58% comp on a 2-year basis. And our global business grew almost 50% to approximately $116 million.\n Moving down the income statement. We saw another quarter of substantial gross margin expansion of 710 basis points to 44%. Our selling margins drove 500 basis points of this expansion, which was an acceleration from the first quarter. It is evident our strategic decision to materially pull back on promotions is proving to be viable even with tougher compares. The fact that the products we sell are proprietary, high-quality and sustainable and are engineered for value enables us the pricing power to provide product at an initial great value in lieu of site-wide promotions.\n Occupancy costs also leveraged approximately 210 basis points, resulting from higher sales and low occupancy dollar growth. Occupancy costs were approximately $176 million or flat to the first quarter. Year-over-year occupancy costs grew 5.9%, primarily due to several rent abatements that were recorded last year during the second quarter. The occupancy benefits we are seeing from our rent renegotiations and the net closure of 33 stores at the end of 2020 has enabled us to minimize occupancy dollar growth and deliver this leverage. And we expect this benefit to continue based on our plan to close approximately 25% of our fleet over the next 5 years.\n SG&A in the second quarter was 27.3% of net revenues compared to 23.9% last year, deleveraging 340 basis points year-over-year. This rates held relatively in line with the first quarter and reflects the lowest second quarter SG&A rate we have had outside of last year, where we have substantially reduced our spend across the business in response to COVID and particularly in advertising. As a result, the year-over-year deleverage is primarily in advertising, where we have made incremental investments to drive our profitable top line growth and market share gains.\n Given the strength in our business, we have made a strategic decision to incrementally invest in high ROI advertising to drive new customer acquisition and to drive our growth in the back half and beyond. We see this as a competitive advantage as we are able to make these investments and still drive record profitability levels at a time where this may not be possible for others. And it is paying off with record new customer counts, including e-commerce customers growing almost 30% on a 2-year basis, the highest growth we have seen.\n We are pleased to see that despite these incremental costs, our overall cost discipline throughout SG&A allowed us to hold our rates at a pre-COVID historically low level helping to deliver another quarter of record profitability.\n Operating income grew to a record $326 million, resulting in an operating margin of 16.7%, expanding 360 basis points over last year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.24, up 80% from last year's record second quarter earnings per share of $1.80.\n On the balance sheet, liquidity levels remain strong. With $476 million year-to-date in operating cash flow or more than double last year, we ended the quarter with $655 million in cash after funding the operations of the business, paying off our term loan of $300 million earlier this year and maximizing shareholder returns.\n During the second quarter, we invested another $36 million in capital expenditures and returned over $180 million to shareholders in the form of $45 million in dividends and $135 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have repurchased over $450 million of our shares or approximately 3x our full year typical share buyback level which reflects our confidence in the sustainability of our strong growth and profitability and our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders.\n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories, including inventory in transits, were $1.171 billion for an increase of 12% over last year. However, our inventory on hand and available for sale is still down to last year with a 2.5% decline. Our inventory levels have sequentially improved. However, they are not at the levels we had expected at this time. We continue to be impacted by our stronger-than-expected demand across all brands as well as various supply chain disruptions, including industry-wide container shortages coming out of Asia, delays due to COVID surges in Vietnam and Indonesia, and a recent port closure in China. And it's hard to predict with certainty when these supply chain challenges will be fully resolved. As a result, at this point, we expect back order levels to remain elevated with moderate improvements in our inventory levels through the balance of the year.\n Now let me turn to our expectations for the rest of the year and longer term. As Laura said, we are raising our 2021 outlook from low double digit to mid-teen revenue growth to high teens to low 20s revenue growth, with operating margins now projected to be in the range of 16% to 17%. We are confident in our ability to deliver this higher outlook given the strength of our business year-to-date, the accelerating momentum in our growth initiatives and the macro trends that will fuel our business for years to come.\n As a result of our strong expectations for 2021 and beyond, we see an accelerated path to growth and profitability longer term. We now believe we will hit our target of $10 billion in revenues by 2024 or 1 year earlier and with higher profitability holding at least at our further raised fiscal year '21 operating margin.\n I would now like to tell you why we are so confident in maintaining these operating margin levels. We believe we are best positioned to continue to deliver record level operating margins despite increased raw materials, freight costs and distribution center labor for the following reasons: ongoing overall sales leverage, including the additional accretion from our growth initiatives that have a higher operating margin. An accelerating shift online where the operating margin profile is higher. Continued occupancy leverage from the renegotiation of our lease agreements and further store closures. The pricing power and our merchandise margins due to our differentiated product positioning with design-led, value-engineered and sustainable products. Various supply chain efficiencies, including automation and in-stock inventory levels and from a continued emphasis on overall strong financial discipline.\n As far as our capital allocation in 2021, we are maintaining our balanced approach of first investing in the business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. We are on track to invest towards the higher end of our range at approximately $250 million in the business this year, with spend prioritized on technology and supply chain initiatives that primarily support our e-commerce growth. Given the strength of our business and liquidity, we are taking this opportunity to aggressively pursue incremental investments in the business to support our long-term elevated growth.\n We also plan to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of further increased quarterly dividend payouts and an increased level of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we have paid $91 million in dividends, a 15% increase and over $450 million in share repurchases compared to no repurchases last year. And today, given the strength in our business and our liquidity, we announced an additional quarterly dividend increase of 20% and a new share repurchase authorization to $1.025 billion, a $700 million increase to what is remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.\n We are committed to maximizing shareholder returns and given our long-term growth and profitability outlook, we continue to believe that our stock is undervalued. As a result, we believe investing even more in our own stock will drive long-term financial returns for our shareholders.\n In summary, our results in the second quarter further validate our ability to deliver sustainable strong growth and profitability. We believe we are uniquely positioned with the favorable long-term macro trends, including a strong housing market driving ongoing investment in the home, the disruption of brick-and-mortar and an accelerating shift to e-commerce, the increasing importance of sustainability and being a values-driven company, combined with our key differentiators, our accelerating growth initiatives, our strong operating cash flow and liquidity and a proven track record of strong financial discipline. All of this will enable us to drive long-term growth and profitability and strong financial returns for our shareholders for years to come.\n I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, Adrienne. As far as merchandise margin, I think, first of all, I want to remind everybody that we saw merch margin expansion back even in 2018. So this is something we've been working on. Obviously, not to this degree. We've had a fundamental shift in the company to substantially pull back on site-wide promotions. And the reason we can do that is because of our pricing power because of what we sell that it's in-house design, it's proprietary and it's designed for value, engineered for value.\n And so we can then come out with initial price that is relevant to the customer and a good value and allow us to not do as many site-wide promotions. And so that's a fundamental shift that we have now been pursuing pretty aggressively for a while now. And so we think this can continue. Will it continue at the same degree? Probably not. I would model that to the same degree. We're very pleased to see continuing strong selling margin expansion from, I think, it was $400 million last quarter to $500 million this quarter.\n Obviously, we also are going to have some raw material price increases and freight cost increases, so that's going to put pressure on that line. But I think the team has done an incredible job of managing through that and mitigating those costs. And because we're vertically integrated, we're better positioned than most to be able to do that. So we do think this is sustainable, but maybe not to the same level. The demand was incredibly strong, but it's pretty much all quarter long. I mean, obviously, with these kinds of results that we've just had phenomenal top line performance. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we have not seen that wane. So we are very optimistic, clearly and confident about the future of our business. And it's just -- even on top of these elevated compares, we're seeing strong growth with 40% comps, both demand and net and Q1 and Q2 holding and strong growth as we enter the third quarter. Well, we have assumed that e-commerce will continue to grow. Obviously, we're pleased we're able to hold 65% despite the fact that we have the retail recovery this year, and so that makes it a little bit volatile, so to speak. But we're still holding at 65%. We've said before, we plan to at least grow it to 70%. And so that's assumed within our numbers. But we have many opportunities to drive operating margin expansion and to be able to at least hold where we plan to come out in 2021.\n First, we'll have the ongoing sales leverage with additional accretion by the way from our growth initiatives, which I think is really important to understand that in B2B, in marketplace and in franchise, for example, they may have some pressure on the gross margin line, but they are incredibly accretive to the total company operating margin. So as those have an outsized growth potential, as we've seen, they will, by themselves, help with the operating margin expansion going forward.\n And then you have an accelerating shift to online, which has always been more profitable. As you may recall, back for years, we used to report that it was above a 20% operating margin, and it's even higher today, obviously, with the top line sales flow through. So as that shifts more and more online, we expect that to drive operating margin expansion. Continued occupancy leverage will drive that. Given the fact that we're still optimizing our retail fleet, and we're renegotiating leases, and we're closing less profitable stores, I think we've demonstrated that we've been able to do that and hold our operating costs down while we're driving top line.\n And then it's back to our pricing power. The fact that we design our own product and engineer it for value that gives us a lot of leverage on the operating margin line, plus everything else from supply chain efficiencies and all kinds of things. So all of that gives us the confidence to believe that we at least can hold the 16% to 17% for this year and then going forward as accelerated pace on the top line. Yes. So as far as the advertising, we have said before that certainly, we're going to be incrementally investing in advertising year-over-year. Last year, certainly, that was a big lever for us to pull back on Q2 was some of the lowest spend in SG&A period, which advertising was a big piece of it until we could read the business and make sure that we were okay going forward. And so you're going to see year-over-year pressure on that line on SG&A because of it. But I think the key takeaway for you guys is to realize that it's a competitive advantage right now.\n I mean most companies don't have the same kind of margin expansion, whether it's merch margin, gross margin or operating margin expansion that we have that where we can take that and reinvest back into advertising when others may not be able to do so right now. They may have to pull back because they're trying to pay for freight or they're trying to pay for raw material increases or whatever it may be, and we don't have to do that right now. And so we're taking that opportunity and investing to drive new customer acquisition and to fuel future growth. And we think that's a real big competitive advantage. Yes. I wouldn't read anything more into that. As we've said, we've had very strong success year-to-date. We've said for quite a few quarters now, and we've seen it strong going into the third quarter. On the high end, we're guiding to low 20s, which is still very high on a 2-year basis. Certainly, we are taking into consideration like everybody else, the impacts from the supply chain challenges that are out there. But I think with our incredible supply chain team, we're best positioned to maneuver through that better than anybody, but we're being thoughtful of that, and that's why we have the range that we have. But with that said, there's absolutely no fundamental difference in our outlook for our business. Originally 5 years. Now we're at $700 million this year, which is... Yes. I mean, certainly, ad spend will come into play in the SG&A line, but also we still believe we're going to have gross margin expansion both from merch margin expansion and from occupancy leverage. I wouldn't focus too much on that. I mean, the reality is if you look at the 16% to 17%, it's almost 2x where we were in 2019. So we're just being thoughtful of that. And certainly, we're also keeping in mind the increase of raw material costs and freight costs that everyone is maneuvering through. But could it be higher? Sure. But right now, we think this is the right target, given we've got a big back half to go, and we'll update you as we move through the year. From an inventory perspective, what we said is you'll see sequential improvement. I think last quarter, it was 1.7% or something like that, and we moved to a 12% increase. But if you look at our inventory that's on hand available for sale, it's still a decline of 2.5%. So we're not where we expected to be. And that's just, quite frankly, because, one, where our demand just hasn't stopped. So it's constantly really high demand. So to get back in stock is really challenging.\n And you combine that with the supply chain challenges that all are facing, we are better positioned than most. I guarantee that given our scale and long-term relationships and our credible supply chain team and who always jumps ahead of this, way ahead of anybody to think about the tariffs and everything else that we did. And so certainly, that is impacting us. We're not immune to it. And so that will cause us to have higher back order levels and throughout the balance of the year, but we do expect inventory to improve moderately as we move throughout the year."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We are proud to report another record quarter of accelerating revenue and profitability with over 40% comp growth and a 950 basis point expansion in our operating margin. These results were driven by strength across all of our brands. We are seeing strength in our core businesses and our new growth initiatives have outperformed.  \n As reopenings accelerate across the country, a record number of customers continue to shop with us as they invest in their homes. We are honored to be our customers' destination for their entertaining and home furnishing needs as they welcome friends and family back. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance from mid- to high single-digit revenue growth to low double-digit to mid-teen revenue growth and year-over-year operating margin expansion.  \n We believe our business is uniquely positioned to gain market share given our growth strategies and our 3 key differentiators, which are: one, our in-house design; two, our digital-first channel strategy; and three, our values. These differentiators are more relevant than ever with our customers and are setting us further apart from our competition.  \n Starting with our in-house design capability. We know that ultimately, everything starts and ends with product. Our in-house designers, combined with our vendor partners, create proprietary products that are high quality, sustainable and aesthetically unique. The strength of our value proposition has given us the opportunity to pull back on promotions. We see this as a sustainable change in our model and a game changer for the longer-term strength of our margins. In addition, our world-class design capabilities are driving new product launches across our brands.  \n In Q1, we saw strong indicators of growth in these new initiatives. For example, in Pottery Barn, our rustic modern casual point of view in furniture, home furnishings and decorating are driving double-digit growth in all categories. Growth in our bath renovation business accelerated to nearly 50% in the quarter, and our marketplace business gained momentum, growing over 70% in the quarter and reaching over 6% of our total Pottery Barn brand sales.  \n In Pottery Barn Kids and Teen, we continue to amplify our leadership in the children's home furnishings market with our emphasis on design and sustainability. We are proud that 100% of our children's furniture is GREENGUARD Gold certified and our in-house design furniture collections are distinctive in the market.  \n Furniture continues to be a key growth driver for the brand. We also saw outsized growth in key initiatives such as baby, which grew over 30% and our aesthetic expansion into modern, which comped nearly 70% over last year.  \n In West Elm, in addition to broad-based strength, our aggressive expansion in the outdoor category has been successful and incremental. This quarter, our outdoor furniture business grew at a comp of nearly 140%, driven by line extensions and our top-performing collections and new product introductions. We've expanded our year-round assortment and plan to introduce several new collections over the next year that will nearly double our outdoor business.  \n Another exciting growth initiative is the expansion of our West Elm Kids business, including the launch of a dedicated e-commerce site. In the Williams-Sonoma brand, cooking-at-home and now entertaining-at-home are driving our customers' purchases. This quarter, we saw significant growth in all areas of entertaining, particularly outdoors, and Easter gatherings.  \n As the momentum builds with people coming back together and celebrating, we are well positioned to meet their cooking and entertaining needs as we head into the back half of the year. Additionally, in our Williams-Sonoma Home business, we delivered a 40% comp for the quarter. Our decision to reposition the brand as a furniture destination is paying off and customers responding very favorably to our high-end sustainable casual aesthetic.  \n Our outdoor collections, for example, are delivering over 200% growth. We continue to believe that Williams-Sonoma Home is one of our biggest growth opportunities as the high-end luxury furniture market remains significantly underserved, especially online.  \n Our cross-brand growth initiative, B2B delivered another record-breaking quarter, up nearly 165% or $100 million in revenues and is on track to reach over $0.5 billion by year-end. The momentum in our contract business accelerated throughout the quarter as the businesses started to reopen, and our win rates on large projects continue to improve.  \n One example of a high-profile project is with the Austin Football Club. Over the past 16 months, we have been furnishing the club state-of-the-art Q2 stadium that's set to host its first international game next month. We are also thrilled that we continue to see repeat business from some of our key customers like Salesforce, and we have a growing number of new projects currently underway. \n Now I'd like to discuss our digital-first positioning as a key differentiator. E-commerce is and will continue to power our growth, demonstrated by our sustained step-ups in top and bottom line results. We have built our e-commerce platform over decades of investment, including a supply chain custom built to ship directly to customers, industry-leading in-house digital marketing capabilities, a digital-first house file and a sophisticated tech stack.  \n This quarter, our in-house tech platform and rapid experimentation program continued to deliver strong results. We introduced new features and improvements across the digital experience in site navigation and personalization, PIP experiences and in our proprietary product recommendations platform, all of which drove double-digit growth in engagement and a significant lift in revenue per visitor.  \n More of our customers are also utilizing our 3D design tool, the Design Crew Room Planner, with total plans created in Q1, up nearly 50% compared to last year. As a reminder, customers who utilize this tool continue to generate twice as many sales as the average customer.  \n We also have the advantage of being digital-first, but not digital-only. Our stores helped drive our online growth and our key competitive advantage. They give our customers the ability to experience our products in person, to access our convenient omni services and to take advantage of our free in-store or in-home design services. This operating model allowed us to generate strong e-commerce growth, maintaining over 65% of our revenue mix, while delivering some of the highest retail growth we have seen on both a 1-year and a 2-year basis. As a reminder, on our channel performance, we are up against store shutdowns from March 18 through the end of June last year and limited retail traffic due to COVID restrictions through the balance of the year. We are thrilled to see both our retail and DTC channels outperforming expectations.  \n Our results this quarter also demonstrate the effectiveness of our digital marketing investments. We continue to focus on high ROI advertising vehicles. We manage our advertising spend in-house and have developed a robust test-and-learn agenda across our portfolio of brands, allowing us to find efficiencies and to reinvest. And the margin upside we have seen from less promotions also enables us to invest more in incremental high ROI marketing initiatives to drive the top line.  \n We've also identified a large growth opportunity in cross-brand migration. We've seen a significant change in behavior since we launched The Key, our free loyalty program that allows customers to earn points across our brands and to use their rewards to any one of our brands. New customers are increasing their cross-brand spend at record levels, and we have just begun to tap into this opportunity. This year, we'll be implementing new cross-brand programs, messaging and events that will further accelerate this cross-brand shopping behavior. We believe this is one of our key incremental growth opportunities, and we look forward to sharing more with you as we have some very exciting launches coming this fall.  \n We are also proud to have made progress in the area of values, which is our third key differentiator. Last month, we became one of the first in our industry to commit to a science-based target for emissions reduction by 2030, including the goal of carbon neutrality across our own operations by 2025. We underwent an extensive year-long data gathering process using third-party experts and independent research alongside our company data to measure our carbon footprint and to arrive at this carbon reduction target.  \n We are also proud to be gaining traction on our goal to plant 3 million trees in 3 years with 1 million trees already planted since the campaign's inception at the beginning of 2021. In addition, we have recently included the top 100 companies of Forbes' Best Employers for Diversity, which honors our progress in creating a diverse and inclusive workplace for associates.  \n We also continue to build on our relationships with our Black Equity Action Partners, the NAACP, The Jackie Robinson Foundation and The National Urban League. And we have just established our new partnership with Asian Americans, Advancing Justice, Asian Law of Caucus. Hate-motivated attacks against the Asian community are simply unacceptable. We stand with the Asian community and our Asian associates, and we will continue to use our collective power to fight against hate, racism and inequity in all forms.  \n I would now like to discuss our outlook for the balance of the year and provide some insight into what we are currently seeing in our business. Quarter-to-date, our business remains strong. We are seeing top line growth and strong margin continue. This is particularly important because we are now comping a substantial spike in home category demand last year as a result of the pandemic lockdown. And this trend further confirms our confidence in our growth outlook in a more normalized environment. \n From a supply chain perspective, although backorders remained high, we are working to restore our in-stock levels. We continue to do all that we can to expedite inventory flow, and we are proactively extending our product lead times where necessary and reaching out to customers with timely updates as we work through these delays. The situation, however, remains difficult, especially with the heartbreaking COVID crisis in India, which, of course, is impacting production. Our current estimate is that we should be back in stock during the third quarter. As it relates to cost increases that continue to pressure the industry, i.e., shipping costs and raw material increases, we are confident that we can achieve our profitability goals due to our strong product margin expansion and occupancy leverage.  \n From a macro perspective, we believe trends will continue in our favor. High consumer confidence, spending shift to e-commerce, the continuation of remote hybrid work and a robust housing market provides a strong backdrop to our strategies. Also as kids return to school, we've seen a significant recovery in our gear and dorm businesses and expect this will continue and be material as we move into the fall. In addition, the outsized growth across all of our entertaining-related categories, such as outdoor, dining and tabletop gives us confidence that the entertaining trend will further accelerate as we move throughout the year and as people welcome friends and family back into their homes, especially for the holidays. \n We also see a big opportunity in gift-giving this year as people gather and reconnect to give gifts in person this holiday. As far as other parts of our business, our B2B sales are accelerating week after week as our project pipeline continues to expand with the reopening of businesses across the country. And our global operations are also gaining momentum with the reopening of our company-owned stores and strong franchise business across the world. \n As we look ahead, we are confident in our runway for growth and profitability. The goals we have set are driving incremental growth faster than anticipated. Our brand differentiators continue to accelerate and favorable macro trends should continue to benefit our business for the long term. We are the only home furnishings retailer that's able to serve customers at scale online and provide the experience and convenience of physical retail with exclusive sustainable products, giving us the unique advantage to gain share for many years to come. \n Before I pass the call to Julie, I want to thank our associates for their ongoing hard work and dedication. Their resilience and innovation are a key part of our success and our ability to continue to deliver profitable market share gains for the long term. \nJulie Whalen: Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another outstanding quarter of financial results. Revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings per share all accelerated and exceeded expectations, demonstrating the power of our 3 key differentiators and the great execution by our team. The strength we saw across all of our brands reinforces that the consumer has a continued appreciation for the home, resulting in a shift in consumer spending to our category which should continue to benefit our business for years to come. \n Let's now review our first quarter results in more detail. Our net revenues reached approximately $1.75 billion with comparable brand revenue growth accelerating to 40.4%. We saw strong sequential acceleration across all brands, starting with West Elm at a comp of 50.9%, Pottery Barn at a 41.3%, Williams-Sonoma at 35.3% and Pottery Barn Kids and Teen at 27.6%. Our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined, delivered comp growth of over 35%, and our global business grew over 81% to approximately $100 million. \n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin expanded a record 850 basis points to 43%, driven by substantially higher selling margins and occupancy leverage. Selling margins expanded for another consecutive quarter, up over 440 basis points year-over-year and 310 basis points from the fourth quarter, driven by higher merchandise margins and ship cost leverage, which reflects the higher mix of retail sales versus last year. \n Higher merchandise margins were driven by a significant pullback in promotions. Our continued focus on marketing our proprietary design, sustainability and value in lieu of site-wide promotions allowed us to deliver another quarter of strong merchandise margins. Occupancy leverage of approximately 410 basis points in the quarter resulted from higher sales in another quarter of relatively flat year-over-year occupancy dollars at approximately $176 million as compared to $175 million last year. \n Our ongoing efforts to optimize our retail fleet by either renegotiating rent or closing less profitable stores has enabled us to minimize our occupancy dollar growth and to deliver this occupancy leverage. As a reminder, we closed a total of net 33 stores last year and expect to close 25% of our total retail fleet in the next 5 years. \n SG&A in the first quarter was 27.1% of net revenues compared to 28.1% last year, leveraging 100 basis points year-over-year. This was primarily driven by leverage in employment and other general expenses resulting from higher sales and overall cost discipline, partially offset by higher advertising as compared to our significantly reduced ad spend last year. As you may recall, as part of our initial financial response to COVID, we substantially reduced our spend across the business, particularly in advertising at this time last year. \n Since then, we have been incrementally investing back into advertising to drive our profitable top line growth and we expect this to continue as we move throughout the year. Given the strength of our business, including our record profitability levels, we are pleased that we are able to incrementally invest in high ROI advertising to drive top line growth and market share gains while still delivering another quarter of SG&A leverage and substantial operating margin expansion. Operating income grew over 250% to $278 million and resulted in operating margin expansion of 950 basis points to 15.9%, a record high first quarter operating margin. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $2.93 or nearly 4x higher than that of last year at $0.74. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with almost $640 million in cash and over $238 million in operating cash flow, a significant increase over last year. This strong liquidity position allowed us to fund the operations of the business, including $42 million in capital expenditures and to provide accelerated shareholder returns of over $361 million, consisting of increased quarterly dividends of over $45 million and a substantial increase in share repurchases of over $315 million. These accelerated returns, combined with a full paydown of our $300 million term loan during the quarter, along with the recent expiration of our 364-day $200 million line of credit facility, reflect our confidence in the long-term strength of our business and our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders. \n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $1.088 billion, for an increase of 1.6% over last year. While our inventory levels have sequentially improved, they continue to be impacted by our stronger-than-expected demand across all brands, as well as supply chain disruptions such as the West Coast ports congestion and Suez Canal blockage earlier in the quarter, the container shortage out of Asia and the COVID-related delays coming out of India. As a result of these challenges, we expect backorder levels to remain elevated until at least the third quarter of this year. We are also experiencing delays in our upholstery furniture production from the recent foam shortage which is currently causing our upholstered furniture quote times to be longer than usual. \n Now let me turn to our expectations for the rest of the year. As Laura mentioned, we are raising our 2021 outlook from mid- to high single-digit revenue growth to low double-digit to mid-teen revenue growth, along with year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin expansion. \n We are confident in our ability to deliver this higher revenue outlook given the strength of our business year-to-date, the strong housing environment and people's deeper appreciation for the home, the accelerating momentum in our growth initiatives, B2B marketplace and our global operations, and a planned sequential improvement in our inventory, enabling us to fill our significant backorders as we move throughout the year. \n Now I would like to talk about profitability. Although there are ongoing cost pressures from freight and raw materials, as Laura mentioned, we believe our operating margin expansion will be driven by overall sales leverage, continued occupancy leverage from the renegotiation of our lease agreements and store closures, continued expansion in our merchandise margins due to our differentiated positioning with design-led value-engineered and sustainable products as well as from overall strong financial discipline. \n As far as our capital allocation in 2021, we are maintaining our balanced approach to first investing in the business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. We are on track to invest approximately $200 million to $250 million in the business this year, with spend prioritized on technology and supply chain initiatives that primarily support our e-commerce growth. We also plan to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of quarterly dividend payouts and increased levels of share repurchases compared to last year. \n Our total share repurchase of over $315 million in the first quarter reflects our continued belief that our stock is undervalued, given our growth and profitability outlook. As a result, we believe investing more in our own stock will also drive long-term financial returns. Longer term, we remain well on track to reach $10 billion in net revenues and maintain at least 15% operating margins in the next 5 years. \n In summary, our results in the first quarter and the progress we have made across our key growth initiatives reinforce our ability to drive long-term sustainable growth and increase profitability. We believe we are in the best position to take market share, especially in an environment where consumers are investing more in their homes, shifting increasingly online and are prioritizing design, value and sustainability in their purchases more than ever before. All of these gives us the confidence to deliver on our long-term outlook and to drive strong financial returns for our shareholders for years to come. I would now like to open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Oliver Wintermantel of Evercore ISI. \nOliver Wintermantel: Laura, I'm looking -- you said the strength continued into the second quarter in revenues and margins while lapping the spike from last year. Does that -- if you could give a little bit more details on that? \n And then secondly, the raise of the guidance that you provided today, if I look at the really strong outperformance in the first quarter versus expectations would probably get you there without touching the rest of the year. So is there anything that you learned during the first quarter that applies to the second half or the last 3 months of the year? \nLaura Alber: Sure. Thanks, Oliver. In terms of -- I mean the quarter to date, I mean, it's early in the quarter, but we are seeing strength and the stores are amazing. Traffic is still under where it was in '19. And that just shows you how much more room there is as traffic really comes back, as people feel even more comfortable shopping in our stores, and e-commerce continues to be a strong driver. And we are running a really regular priced business. That said, we are running -- we will run markdowns where we have seasonal issues. But there's substantial upside with the margin throughout the back half of the year, as I said earlier, and it's a -- it's an important change for us. It allows us to do a lot of other things that create that virtuous cycle where you can invest in other things that drive top line like the ad costs, which is very effective. \n So in terms of the guidance, Julie, do you want to talk a little bit about that? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I would say, Oliver, I wouldn't read too much into that. We are very confident in where we are today, both obviously because of our Q1 performance, which is phenomenal, but also where we are quarter-to-date. And if you look at it on the high end, basically, we are guiding to a mid-teen level on top of the 17 last year with operating margin expansion on top of last year's outperform that was above 560 over the year before. So We feel very confident in the future of our business, both on this year and to reaching our 5-year $10 billion targets, so I wouldn't read anything into that at all. It's just work early in the year. I mean that's the reality we gave the previous outlook 2 months ago. And now we've completed 1 quarter, and we've got 3 big quarters to go. And so obviously, as they move through the year, we will update you accordingly, but we feel very confident in our business. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Adrienne Yih of Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Good. Another great quarter, so congratulations. Laura, my question is on something that you had just said earlier in the Q&A session. It was about ad spend. And when we look at last year, the ad spend as a percent of the much higher sales, obviously fell to 5%, but it's historically been at 7%. As you move more and more to a pure-play e-commerce model, how do you look at that line item? And where do you think the right number should be? \nLaura Alber: Sure. It's an interesting question and one that I think you need to remain flexible on as we see different things happen in our business. We have Felix here. Felix, do you want to make some comments about our ad cost approach? \nFelix Carbullido: Yes. Absolutely. Thank you for the question. We continue to invest in advertising where we see the ROI. And as Laura mentioned, we've taken all of our online media buying in-house. We manage a cross-brand learning agenda across our 7 brands, which allows us to test and learn on one brand and roll it to the other. Our legacy and performance marketing dating back to our catalog days gives us that competitive advantage when it comes to just identifying top ROI tactics. So to answer your question, yes, we continue to see investment in online. It's paying back. We are still dedicated to the op margin goals for the company. But we are passionate about investing where we see the ROI. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Yes. And then, Julie, one quick one for you. So with the total store closures of 25% over the horizon, I mean that sort of implies that you will be closing decently four-wall positive stores. So how do you think about that? And I guess the question is, is that the case? Are you okay closing four-wall stores that other people might look at it and actually want that four-wall contribution, but because the e-commerce is so much more accretive, it's the right move? \nLaura Alber: Adrienne, it's Laura. I'd love to take that one. You're right. We are closing less profitable stores, but I think under anybody else's framework, they would like the four-wall. The difference is we would like to have the stores rival our e-commerce and profitability. And we think that's possible. We also know that there are some malls that we don't want to be in anymore. They're just not -- they're not good for the brand. \n We also have some markets where there are too many stores. We never overstored, but there's still room for consolidation and room to have bigger, greater stores versus so many because we are a destination and people will drive to us. \n In some cases, we're moving from one place to the next. We just opened a few great Williams-Sonoma stores and Pottery Barn stores in some new centers, lifestyle centers, and I'm thrilled with the results. So you're going to see us do great things for the retail and prune the bottom and take the total profitability of the company up. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Maksim Rakhlenko of Cowen and Company. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: Congrats on a very strong quarter. So first, can you maybe discuss a framework for what EBIT margin could look like this year? Maybe the lower end to the higher end of what's achievable? And really the most pertinent factors that could get you there? And then separately, longer term, as we think about your $10 billion revenue outlook, how do you think that could shake out in the core versus some of the newer businesses? And ultimately, when we sit in '25, what would it take for the core to be at the lower or the higher end of what is feasible? \nJulie Whalen: So from an EBIT perspective, I think the most important thing is that we are very bullish on our ability to drive profitability. We have not seen this level of merchandise margin expansion to this degree for a while now. And though we've been driving it from 2018 because of our change in our operating model and our perspective as to how to pull back on promotions, and that's a fundamental shift that we've made. \n To this level, it's been incredible. And then you combine that with our occupancy leverage and, of course, the SG&A leverage that we've been able to drive, it gives us a lot of confidence in a very profitable operating margin like we delivered last year. I mean I think everyone was surprised by 14.2%, which is 560 over the prior year. And then they were surprised that we said we expand on top of that this year, and we are committed to doing that into driving at least 15% in 5 years. \n And I think it could be higher. But for right now, obviously, we've got puts and takes, like everybody who else is out there, we've got raw material increases, and we've got freight increases and things like that, but we are best positioned to be able to offset that and drive very strong profitability that we're committed to doing for the foreseeable future. \n On the revenue side, we are very confident as well about our $10 billion in the 5 years to come. Obviously, the core is a big base, and so that's a big driver of that growth. But really, our growth initiatives, I think you can underestimate. I mean one of my favorite that I always speak to is B2B. I mean it is on fire, and we have committed to well over $500 million for this year, and I think it's going to go even higher, much quicker than we thought. And so I think our growth initiatives, whether it's B2B, whether it's marketplace, whether it's our global operations, all of that or smaller businesses, Williams-Sonoma Home is a huge opportunity for a luxury market that's clearly underpenetrated. And we really have just gotten started on a lot of these. And so that's what gives us the confidence and the excitement to drive to that $10 billion number. \nOperator: And we'll go to our next question from Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez of Telsey Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernandez: My congratulations on the quarter. I had a follow-up on the operating margin as well. If you look at this quarter, a much higher gross margin but also higher expenses, are these levels sort of sustainable for the rest of the year? Should we think about opting -- gross margin in that 40-plus percent in SG&A at this level? And then also specific, I wanted to ask about the merchandise margin. It's been increasing for the past couple of quarters. Is this a peak level or you think it can go higher even still from here? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I mean, again, first, as I said a minute ago, I mean, we're very confident in our ability to drive operating margin expansion and to be a profitable company from that perspective. We're very confident in our ability to continue to drive merch margin expansion where that will actually play out on each quarter and whether it's above 40% or not, we're not going to be providing that kind of level of disclosure at this time. But we have no reason to believe that that's going to discontinue. \n And so I think you can't model out. Obviously, we had 950 basis points of expansion and 850 in gross margin. I would model that out by quarter for the rest of the year. But I do believe that we've got a lot of strength left to come because of our fundamental shift in our pullback on promotions. And the reason we can do that is because of our differentiators. It's the fact that we design our product in-house and we engineer our product for value and sustainability while still being of high quality. And so because of that, we are able to then lead with content-led marketing and get the product that people want to them at a very good price. And so we don't see that changing anytime soon. And we're unique in that perspective because others are not able to do that. And so I think that's what gives us the confidence that we'll be able to maintain these strong margins going forward. \nOperator: And we will move to our next question from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. \nSteven Forbes: And congrats on a great quarter as well. I wanted to try to focus on the cross-banner or cross-brand migration strategy. It's the best we can, right? It sounds like we've got some exciting stuff coming up here in the future. But curious if you can update us on just a number of cross-brand customers and how that's evolved, right, from the last data point that we got, which I think is probably 2 years ago or so? And then just any color, right, on their behaviors relative to the average, their spending trends, their frequency trends? And really just any color on what gets you so excited right, about the potential to continue to lean into that strategy? \nLaura Alber: Great. I'm going to let Felix take that one. \nFelix Carbullido: Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes, we are crazy excited about the cross-brand opportunity. We think it's one of our biggest opportunities in the company. And I know we get compared to the pure-play question about spending, spending, spending, but it's not just about customer acquisition. It's also about the share of wallet you have with each customer, right? And so we believe that our sales per customer can increase dramatically when we start to migrate customers from one brand to another. \n And the key is really the foundation of that. And we've seen a record number of customers migrate across our brands. I think what's particularly exciting is that our new customers are migrating or participating in 1 or 2 or more brands at record levels since we launched The Key. And now almost 80% of our customers are enrolled in The Key. So that bodes incredibly well for our future state. It also bodes well for our lifetime value proposition when we look at customer retention and customer profitability. We will increase the number. I don't want to give away our total playbook, but you're going to be seeing a lot more cross-brand awareness throughout a customer shopping journey from the homepage to in-store, from shopping by category to looking for inspirational ideas. \n We think it's the key to owning share of wallet for existing customers, and we're very focused on that. We do have some announcements coming out in the fall we're thrilled about. But at the end of the day, the excitement drives from the KPIs we are seeing from customers who have migrated across our brands. \nSteven Forbes: And maybe just a quick follow-up, if I can, on that. Because I think, Laura, you mentioned before, right, on the question about stores and consolidation in regions and locations, is part of that going to come in the form of larger stores that merchandise across the banners? Or I think you mentioned larger stores in one of the questions. Any sort of thought on just the evolution of the footprint? The potential evolution of the footprint in terms of true migration right or consolidation of the banners within 1 store? \nLaura Alber: There's a wide range of sizes that we currently run in our fleet. And it's not that we're going to open stores that are larger than our largest stores now. It's that we're not going to have -- we have a bunch of smaller stores that are pretty dated that we would trade up to be more of a standard for each brand. There's a standard that we feel we've optimized, and we don't have plans to change that at this point. \n I'll just mention also while we're talking about the flexibility and resilience of our operating model and how important the channels are to each other. We are seeing really outsized growth also in our omni services, particularly BOPUS and BOPIS, we're seeing a 2-year comp of almost 90%, just showing the importance and the relevancy of these stores to the online business. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will go next to Curtis Nagle of Bank of America. \nCurtis Nagle: So I guess not to belabor a point here, but just trying to think out the promotional cadence and sort of what's going on in the industry. I totally get what you're saying in terms of what you're doing with your marketing and not having to rely on discounting, obviously, to drive sales. But I guess just -- what do you think happens when at some point, whether that's, I don't know, next year and to this year, kind of who knows when things settle down a little bit more? And backlog is clear and the -- we're in a period right now where you just don't need to promote, right, for all sorts of obvious reasons. Do you think that you may have to step back in a little bit? Or just how should we think about that? Kind of outside of what's still kind of unprecedented operating environment is crazy good sales sort of across the board? \nLaura Alber: Yes, sure. I mean I think the way to think about it is really about our 3 key differentiators and our growth drivers. And we have really incremental and real growth drivers that we're showing you right now that were only in the first couple of innings of. So those things are going to continue to help us drive growth at regular price. \n And the key part of our pricing strategy, which is important is that we want to give the customer a great value. So we continue to bring in new products, opening price points and products that can't be rivaled by anybody for the quality and design that is. And we are relentless in our pursuit of gorgeous sustainable design. And that's what we're going to continue to do. That's our focus. And it's one where customers understand that if they want something from us, they're not going to buy it elsewhere. And if we give them a fair price, and not overprice our products, and we give them great quality, they will come to us over and over. And that's why we see very high average order size. We see customers coming back at greater rates than other brands out there as we compare our numbers. And I don't see any reason why this should abate, especially given what I know we have in the pipeline for growth initiatives. \nOperator: And we'll go next to Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham: Congratulations on great results. My first question is thinking about the sales outlook for this year by brand. Based on your growth initiatives, which brands do you expect to outperform in terms of comparable store sales growth for the balance of the year? \nLaura Alber: Julie, how would you like to hit that? \nJulie Whalen: I mean, first of all, comparable store sales growth, and we haven't been giving that number truly out. But if you're saying comps in general, I mean, quite honestly, we're seeing broad-based strength. So I mean we're not going to be disclosing by brand where we think the comps will be, but we haven't seen anything that in our business, obviously, look at the results in Q1, we're phenomenally strong. And we're seeing strong results in events in the second quarter. So whether it's kids returning to school and you've got gear and backpacks and dorm rooms to fill and across our kids business, whether it's Williams-Sonoma business and your entertaining outdoors with food and cooking or whether it's all of our other brands with our home furnishings offerings for outdoors and for entertaining. And as we move through the back half of the year, and we have gift giving. I mean they all have something incredible to offer for the quarters that come. So I really think it's going to be broad-based. \nLaura Alber: And they're quite competitive with each other. So it will be interesting to see. They have their plans, and they have great -- all of them incremental growth strategies as well as core growth strategies. But I think we have a strong year across the board. \nSeth Basham: Got it. And when you think about the cadence of the growth through the year, obviously, you're facing tough comparisons as the year goes on. Are you expecting growth in each quarter in terms of revenue? \nLaura Alber: Yes. \nOperator: And we'll go to Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I'm going to stick with margins for a second. First, have you talked about the assumptions related to promotion or this merchandise margin environment for the back half of the year? And Laura, I think you probably did cover it. You mentioned in your script, the game changer for margins, and I think a lot of the answers you provided, probably applies to this question, but how do you balance the structural improvement some of the perception improvements around the brand versus a promotional cycle that is almost likely to come back at some point? \nJulie Whalen: I mean we haven't highlighted per se with the back half merch margins or gross margins will be, except to say that we continue to believe that we can drive merch margin expansion and occupancy leverage. And so we're very confident in our ability to drive gross margin expansion. \n Obviously, you can't model exactly what we've done this quarter or make those sort of assumptions as we move throughout the year because to your point, we certainly will have a -- more pressure as we move through the year. And of course, we'll have raw material costs and freight costs that are going up like everybody else. But we are best positioned to be able to handle those given our scale and given our unique offering and still be able to deliver merch margin expansion and gross margin expansion. So that's sort of what we've called out on that front. \nSimeon Gutman: Is there anything you could provide on the marketplace in terms of margin structure? How to think about it? \nJulie Whalen: On the gross margin line, technically, they are lower than our regular retail price, but they also offer breadth and new customer counts and the ability to give the customer what they want. And ultimately, with that volume, they're operating margin accretive. So you want us to deliver those every day of the week. \nLaura Alber: I'll just add to what Julie just said to make sure it's clear that we really are applying our same standards for sustainability and design and quality to our marketplace product. And we are offering a pretty additive assortment compared to other people oftentimes exclusive only offered with us. And that's an important factor in what we're doing. A lot of the categories we've brought in are categories that we don't offer. So for example, ceiling fans. We never have them before the marketplace allows us to be in that business, which is really important for the home in a lot of areas, and it allows us to go in there and be in that business and do it in a capital-light way. \nOperator: And we'll go to our next question from Chuck Grom of Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: On occupancy dollars, Julie, $176 million, down about $5 million sequentially. Just wondering how we should be modeling that line item in the coming quarters. I know it can be a little bit lumpy. But do you think this is a good run rate? Or do you think it could continue to drop? And then follow-up question unrelated would be B2B. I think it was $400 million last year. You said earlier, $500 million this year. I know the long term is $1 billion. I guess does it make sense to the backfill of that opportunity now, invest more in it to grow? It seems like it's coming in a lot stronger and with the economy reopening, it seems like there could be some pretty nice sales ahead. \nJulie Whalen: So on the occupancy dollars, I wouldn't necessarily make that assumption going forward. Certainly, because we shut a net 33 stores, mostly towards the end of last year, we're getting the benefit from that rent that's come out of the equation. But we also have our distribution centers that are layering in. As we've mentioned, we're adding 2 million square feet to support our significant e-commerce growth. And so that goes in there. There's also the timing and the size of the capital expenditures that hit depreciation, and that's what makes it be lumpy. So I don't think you can just take this current quarter's run rate and assume that throughout the back of the year. But certainly, we will still be driving occupancy leverage given our high sales and our ability to mute that cost because of the lower rents from the stores. And so we are committed to doing that throughout the rest of the year. \n On the B2B front, we -- I think it was closer to $300 million, a little lower than that. But yes, very strong business, very bullish on it. We think we've got a huge opportunity. That's an $80 billion business, and we are coming in at $500 million this year, so to speak. So -- and the trajectory that we've seen, the week-after-week acceleration in that business has been phenomenal, and we're really just getting started. We've been building the infrastructure from a people perspective, from a system perspective, from a supply chain perspective and it's really gaining momentum. And so trust me that we are investing everything we need to in that business to drive it because we do believe it's a significant growth opportunity for us. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will hear next from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So my first -- I have 2 questions. So can you talk about the sequential improvement in gross margin relative to the fourth quarter? How much of that was perhaps the shipping volume surcharges fading, how much of that was perhaps taking some price increases on existing inventory as raw material costs have accelerated and some of the shipping costs have accelerated. And then just to clarify on the guidance raise, you talked about strength quarter-to-date being the part of the driver. So is the top line raise just related the fourth -- to the first quarter beat? Or is it also your expectations around the second quarter? \nJulie Whalen: Sure. So as far as relative to the fourth quarter, the outperformance on the gross margin line was relatively broad-based. It was -- merch margin expansion was significant. And we did see shipping cost leverage, and that is both because you're coming out of the peak rates, but more so because we also had a pretty sizable shift to retail and the strength of retail even on a 2-year basis was phenomenal. And so when you have that, and there's more POS sales, so to speak, there's less shipping costs just generally for the sales that you drive on the top line. And so we had that benefit as well. \n And then we have the factor that we shut net 33 stores towards the end of last year where we started to get the benefit on the lower occupancy, particularly in the first quarter. And so that plus the significant sales growth we had really delivered off 3 of those. \n And second question, I'm trying to remember what that was. What was your second question, Chris? \nChristopher Horvers: It would be 2Q and 1Q... \nJulie Whalen: Yes. It has taken all of it in consideration, to be honest with you. Again, on the high end, it's a mid-teens revenue outlook on top of 17 last year And it's taking into consideration what we are able to see to date. And so it's both Q1 and our performance coming into the second quarter. And then it's also just realizing the benefits that we have ahead of us, in particular, in relation to the strong housing market, which tends to, if you look back in time, bode well for us for years to come. \n So that is a very strong scenario for us that's going to help us, plus we have the fact that you have the acceleration of folks buying our category online. You have also got the fact that there is a much more interest in companies that stand for values and sustainability, and we've seen that. And we think that's going to continue. And then, of course, you layer in the fact that we've got higher backorders and all of that, we expect to come back in the back half of the year gives us a lot of confidence in our ability. But as we said earlier, it's the first quarter. And we gave outlook 2 months ago, and we've raised it, call it, 600-plus basis points in 2 months. So we feel like this is a good spot to be, given we were 1 quarter in, but we are absolutely confident in our ability to deliver strong performance this year. \nOperator: And we'll move to our next question from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: Another great quarter, congratulations. So I have 2 questions, they're short, I'm going to merge them together. Just with regard to sales trends, are you seeing through the quarter? And then, I guess, into Q2, are you seeing any divergence in trends in markets that may have opened or reopened sooner than others? \n And then the second question I have, I don't think this is relevant for you, but every retailer is out there talking about the benefits of stimulus. So I think it's worth asking. Did you see any type of acceleration in your business across your brands as a stimulus checks hit? \nLaura Alber: Okay. So in terms of markets, I'm going to give us to the data guy, Felix, in terms of open, closed markets. Go ahead, Felix. \nFelix Carbullido: Sure. Our data guys said, we looked at 100 different points, whether people are by state, by vaccination, mask requirements, but there is no correlation. I mean it depends on last year when they were open. When you look at the 2 year, which I think is more important, the great news is that we're seeing strength across all the states, in all the areas, regardless of their vaccination rate. So that, too, gives us confidence about the balance of the year.\n And then from a shift perspective, there's no major change in demographic shift perspective. The younger customers continue to -- we see a nice bump there. That's not just driven by stimulus, but that's also driven by just the growth of the millennial and Gen Z base. And we're seeing there now the majority of our growth in new customers. We think that's due to our opening price point positioning in PB Apartment. Obviously, the West Elm brand aesthetic and value plays well to that. And of course, our kids and baby business driven by the younger generation is benefiting from that and plans for expansion as well. So that's what I can answer for that. \nOperator: And we'll move on to our next question from Steven Zaccone of Citi Research. \nSteven Zaccone: Congrats on the strong results. I had a question on the SG&A outlook for the balance of the year. So the amount of leverage you saw in the 40% comp seemed to moderate versus what you've seen in the past few quarters. As sales growth moderates through the balance of the year and you continue to prioritize advertising expenses, how should we think about the cadence of SG&A spending? Or maybe the ability to drive leverage? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I mean I think what you have to look at is that this time last year, we substantially pulled back like just about everybody when everything was shutting down and the equity markets were coming down. And so we dramatically pulled back our spend. And so given our performance, we've been continuing to invest in that. And so this quarter reflects a higher investment of advertising. which, by the way, also drives future sales. And so we think it's really important to continue to make these investments as Felix alluded to earlier, it's a competitive benefit that we can do this. \n Most people don't have the merch margin expansion that we have. They don't have the occupancy leverage even if they have the top line, and they can't afford the cost of advertising right now and we can. And so we're going to make that investment and be competitive about it and go after market share gains that will benefit us for future quarters and years, quite frankly. And so yes, you will see pressure on the SG&A line, mostly from advertising. There's some higher hourly wages that we're lapping, so to speak. But the reality is there's a lot of COVID expenses that we're in within SG&A as well last year that we hopefully won't be comping again based on what we know today. And so that will also provide us benefits in the back half to be able to offset that. Regardless, we are very confident in our ability to deliver merch margin expansion and occupancy leverage. And so we're -- our commitment is on the bottom line of operating margin expansion, which we feel very confident about being able to deliver. \nLaura Alber: And I think to add to what Julie just said, and you can see this in our results over not just this quarter but over the last year. And even when you look back to 2018, '19, we've had acceleration in our comps and we are now looking at a growth company again, and we are very confident in that. And that means that we're going to improve our op margin, but we are going to reinvest to drive those top line sales because we have that opportunity. We're still very small in comparison to how good our brands are and people love our brands. And with our differentiators and our growth drivers, there is no doubt in our minds that we're going to reach that $10 billion faster than people expect and to do it more profitably than I think probably anybody else in our space. \nOperator: And at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Laura Alber for any additional or closing comments. \nLaura Alber: Well, thank you. Good questions. I really appreciate your interest, and I look forward to talking to you again after the next quarter. \nOperator: And so ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call. We would like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Felix Carbullido",
            "content": "Yes. Absolutely. Thank you for the question. We continue to invest in advertising where we see the ROI. And as Laura mentioned, we've taken all of our online media buying in-house. We manage a cross-brand learning agenda across our 7 brands, which allows us to test and learn on one brand and roll it to the other. Our legacy and performance marketing dating back to our catalog days gives us that competitive advantage when it comes to just identifying top ROI tactics. So to answer your question, yes, we continue to see investment in online. It's paying back. We are still dedicated to the op margin goals for the company. But we are passionate about investing where we see the ROI. Yes. Thank you for the question. Yes, we are crazy excited about the cross-brand opportunity. We think it's one of our biggest opportunities in the company. And I know we get compared to the pure-play question about spending, spending, spending, but it's not just about customer acquisition.

            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. We are proud to report another record quarter of accelerating revenue and profitability with over 40% comp growth and a 950 basis point expansion in our operating margin. These results were driven by strength across all of our brands. We are seeing strength in our core businesses and our new growth initiatives have outperformed.  \n As reopenings accelerate across the country, a record number of customers continue to shop with us as they invest in their homes. We are honored to be our customers' destination for their entertaining and home furnishing needs as they welcome friends and family back. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance from mid- to high single-digit revenue growth to low double-digit to mid-teen revenue growth and year-over-year operating margin expansion.  \n We believe our business is uniquely positioned to gain market share given our growth strategies and our 3 key differentiators, which are: one, our in-house design; two, our digital-first channel strategy; and three, our values. These differentiators are more relevant than ever with our customers and are setting us further apart from our competition.  \n Starting with our in-house design capability. We know that ultimately, everything starts and ends with product. Our in-house designers, combined with our vendor partners, create proprietary products that are high quality, sustainable and aesthetically unique. The strength of our value proposition has given us the opportunity to pull back on promotions. We see this as a sustainable change in our model and a game changer for the longer-term strength of our margins. In addition, our world-class design capabilities are driving new product launches across our brands.  \n In Q1, we saw strong indicators of growth in these new initiatives. For example, in Pottery Barn, our rustic modern casual point of view in furniture, home furnishings and decorating are driving double-digit growth in all categories. Growth in our bath renovation business accelerated to nearly 50% in the quarter, and our marketplace business gained momentum, growing over 70% in the quarter and reaching over 6% of our total Pottery Barn brand sales.  \n In Pottery Barn Kids and Teen, we continue to amplify our leadership in the children's home furnishings market with our emphasis on design and sustainability. We are proud that 100% of our children's furniture is GREENGUARD Gold certified and our in-house design furniture collections are distinctive in the market.  \n Furniture continues to be a key growth driver for the brand. We also saw outsized growth in key initiatives such as baby, which grew over 30% and our aesthetic expansion into modern, which comped nearly 70% over last year.  \n In West Elm, in addition to broad-based strength, our aggressive expansion in the outdoor category has been successful and incremental. This quarter, our outdoor furniture business grew at a comp of nearly 140%, driven by line extensions and our top-performing collections and new product introductions. We've expanded our year-round assortment and plan to introduce several new collections over the next year that will nearly double our outdoor business.  \n Another exciting growth initiative is the expansion of our West Elm Kids business, including the launch of a dedicated e-commerce site. In the Williams-Sonoma brand, cooking-at-home and now entertaining-at-home are driving our customers' purchases. This quarter, we saw significant growth in all areas of entertaining, particularly outdoors, and Easter gatherings.  \n As the momentum builds with people coming back together and celebrating, we are well positioned to meet their cooking and entertaining needs as we head into the back half of the year. Additionally, in our Williams-Sonoma Home business, we delivered a 40% comp for the quarter. Our decision to reposition the brand as a furniture destination is paying off and customers responding very favorably to our high-end sustainable casual aesthetic.  \n Our outdoor collections, for example, are delivering over 200% growth. We continue to believe that Williams-Sonoma Home is one of our biggest growth opportunities as the high-end luxury furniture market remains significantly underserved, especially online.  \n Our cross-brand growth initiative, B2B delivered another record-breaking quarter, up nearly 165% or $100 million in revenues and is on track to reach over $0.5 billion by year-end. The momentum in our contract business accelerated throughout the quarter as the businesses started to reopen, and our win rates on large projects continue to improve.  \n One example of a high-profile project is with the Austin Football Club. Over the past 16 months, we have been furnishing the club state-of-the-art Q2 stadium that's set to host its first international game next month. We are also thrilled that we continue to see repeat business from some of our key customers like Salesforce, and we have a growing number of new projects currently underway. \n Now I'd like to discuss our digital-first positioning as a key differentiator. E-commerce is and will continue to power our growth, demonstrated by our sustained step-ups in top and bottom line results. We have built our e-commerce platform over decades of investment, including a supply chain custom built to ship directly to customers, industry-leading in-house digital marketing capabilities, a digital-first house file and a sophisticated tech stack.  \n This quarter, our in-house tech platform and rapid experimentation program continued to deliver strong results. We introduced new features and improvements across the digital experience in site navigation and personalization, PIP experiences and in our proprietary product recommendations platform, all of which drove double-digit growth in engagement and a significant lift in revenue per visitor.  \n More of our customers are also utilizing our 3D design tool, the Design Crew Room Planner, with total plans created in Q1, up nearly 50% compared to last year. As a reminder, customers who utilize this tool continue to generate twice as many sales as the average customer.  \n We also have the advantage of being digital-first, but not digital-only. Our stores helped drive our online growth and our key competitive advantage. They give our customers the ability to experience our products in person, to access our convenient omni services and to take advantage of our free in-store or in-home design services. This operating model allowed us to generate strong e-commerce growth, maintaining over 65% of our revenue mix, while delivering some of the highest retail growth we have seen on both a 1-year and a 2-year basis. As a reminder, on our channel performance, we are up against store shutdowns from March 18 through the end of June last year and limited retail traffic due to COVID restrictions through the balance of the year. We are thrilled to see both our retail and DTC channels outperforming expectations.  \n Our results this quarter also demonstrate the effectiveness of our digital marketing investments. We continue to focus on high ROI advertising vehicles. We manage our advertising spend in-house and have developed a robust test-and-learn agenda across our portfolio of brands, allowing us to find efficiencies and to reinvest. And the margin upside we have seen from less promotions also enables us to invest more in incremental high ROI marketing initiatives to drive the top line.  \n We've also identified a large growth opportunity in cross-brand migration. We've seen a significant change in behavior since we launched The Key, our free loyalty program that allows customers to earn points across our brands and to use their rewards to any one of our brands. New customers are increasing their cross-brand spend at record levels, and we have just begun to tap into this opportunity. This year, we'll be implementing new cross-brand programs, messaging and events that will further accelerate this cross-brand shopping behavior. We believe this is one of our key incremental growth opportunities, and we look forward to sharing more with you as we have some very exciting launches coming this fall.  \n We are also proud to have made progress in the area of values, which is our third key differentiator. Last month, we became one of the first in our industry to commit to a science-based target for emissions reduction by 2030, including the goal of carbon neutrality across our own operations by 2025. We underwent an extensive year-long data gathering process using third-party experts and independent research alongside our company data to measure our carbon footprint and to arrive at this carbon reduction target.  \n We are also proud to be gaining traction on our goal to plant 3 million trees in 3 years with 1 million trees already planted since the campaign's inception at the beginning of 2021. In addition, we have recently included the top 100 companies of Forbes' Best Employers for Diversity, which honors our progress in creating a diverse and inclusive workplace for associates.  \n We also continue to build on our relationships with our Black Equity Action Partners, the NAACP, The Jackie Robinson Foundation and The National Urban League. And we have just established our new partnership with Asian Americans, Advancing Justice, Asian Law of Caucus. Hate-motivated attacks against the Asian community are simply unacceptable. We stand with the Asian community and our Asian associates, and we will continue to use our collective power to fight against hate, racism and inequity in all forms.  \n I would now like to discuss our outlook for the balance of the year and provide some insight into what we are currently seeing in our business. Quarter-to-date, our business remains strong. We are seeing top line growth and strong margin continue. This is particularly important because we are now comping a substantial spike in home category demand last year as a result of the pandemic lockdown. And this trend further confirms our confidence in our growth outlook in a more normalized environment. \n From a supply chain perspective, although backorders remained high, we are working to restore our in-stock levels. We continue to do all that we can to expedite inventory flow, and we are proactively extending our product lead times where necessary and reaching out to customers with timely updates as we work through these delays. The situation, however, remains difficult, especially with the heartbreaking COVID crisis in India, which, of course, is impacting production. Our current estimate is that we should be back in stock during the third quarter. As it relates to cost increases that continue to pressure the industry, i.e., shipping costs and raw material increases, we are confident that we can achieve our profitability goals due to our strong product margin expansion and occupancy leverage.  \n From a macro perspective, we believe trends will continue in our favor. High consumer confidence, spending shift to e-commerce, the continuation of remote hybrid work and a robust housing market provides a strong backdrop to our strategies. Also as kids return to school, we've seen a significant recovery in our gear and dorm businesses and expect this will continue and be material as we move into the fall. In addition, the outsized growth across all of our entertaining-related categories, such as outdoor, dining and tabletop gives us confidence that the entertaining trend will further accelerate as we move throughout the year and as people welcome friends and family back into their homes, especially for the holidays. \n We also see a big opportunity in gift-giving this year as people gather and reconnect to give gifts in person this holiday. As far as other parts of our business, our B2B sales are accelerating week after week as our project pipeline continues to expand with the reopening of businesses across the country. And our global operations are also gaining momentum with the reopening of our company-owned stores and strong franchise business across the world. \n As we look ahead, we are confident in our runway for growth and profitability. The goals we have set are driving incremental growth faster than anticipated. Our brand differentiators continue to accelerate and favorable macro trends should continue to benefit our business for the long term. We are the only home furnishings retailer that's able to serve customers at scale online and provide the experience and convenience of physical retail with exclusive sustainable products, giving us the unique advantage to gain share for many years to come. \n Before I pass the call to Julie, I want to thank our associates for their ongoing hard work and dedication. Their resilience and innovation are a key part of our success and our ability to continue to deliver profitable market share gains for the long term. Sure. Thanks, Oliver. In terms of -- I mean the quarter to date, I mean, it's early in the quarter, but we are seeing strength and the stores are amazing. Traffic is still under where it was in '19. And that just shows you how much more room there is as traffic really comes back, as people feel even more comfortable shopping in our stores, and e-commerce continues to be a strong driver. And we are running a really regular priced business. That said, we are running -- we will run markdowns where we have seasonal issues. But there's substantial upside with the margin throughout the back half of the year, as I said earlier, and it's a -- it's an important change for us. It allows us to do a lot of other things that create that virtuous cycle where you can invest in other things that drive top line like the ad costs, which is very effective. \n So in terms of the guidance, Julie, do you want to talk a little bit about that? Sure. It's an interesting question and one that I think you need to remain flexible on as we see different things happen in our business. We have Felix here. Felix, do you want to make some comments about our ad cost approach? Adrienne, it's Laura. I'd love to take that one. You're right. We are closing less profitable stores, but I think under anybody else's framework, they would like the four-wall. The difference is we would like to have the stores rival our e-commerce and profitability. And we think that's possible. We also know that there are some malls that we don't want to be in anymore. They're just not -- they're not good for the brand. \n We also have some markets where there are too many stores. We never overstored, but there's still room for consolidation and room to have bigger, greater stores versus so many because we are a destination and people will drive to us. \n In some cases, we're moving from one place to the next. We just opened a few great Williams-Sonoma stores and Pottery Barn stores in some new centers, lifestyle centers, and I'm thrilled with the results. So you're going to see us do great things for the retail and prune the bottom and take the total profitability of the company up. Great. I'm going to let Felix take that one. There's a wide range of sizes that we currently run in our fleet. And it's not that we're going to open stores that are larger than our largest stores now. It's that we're not going to have -- we have a bunch of smaller stores that are pretty dated that we would trade up to be more of a standard for each brand. There's a standard that we feel we've optimized, and we don't have plans to change that at this point. \n I'll just mention also while we're talking about the flexibility and resilience of our operating model and how important the channels are to each other. We are seeing really outsized growth also in our omni services, particularly BOPUS and BOPIS, we're seeing a 2-year comp of almost 90%, just showing the importance and the relevancy of these stores to the online business. Yes, sure. I mean I think the way to think about it is really about our 3 key differentiators and our growth drivers. And we have really incremental and real growth drivers that we're showing you right now that were only in the first couple of innings of. So those things are going to continue to help us drive growth at regular price. \n And the key part of our pricing strategy, which is important is that we want to give the customer a great value. So we continue to bring in new products, opening price points and products that can't be rivaled by anybody for the quality and design that is. And we are relentless in our pursuit of gorgeous sustainable design. And that's what we're going to continue to do. That's our focus. And it's one where customers understand that if they want something from us, they're not going to buy it elsewhere. And if we give them a fair price, and not overprice our products, and we give them great quality, they will come to us over and over. And that's why we see very high average order size. We see customers coming back at greater rates than other brands out there as we compare our numbers. And I don't see any reason why this should abate, especially given what I know we have in the pipeline for growth initiatives. Julie, how would you like to hit that? And they're quite competitive with each other. So it will be interesting to see. They have their plans, and they have great -- all of them incremental growth strategies as well as core growth strategies. But I think we have a strong year across the board. Yes. I'll just add to what Julie just said to make sure it's clear that we really are applying our same standards for sustainability and design and quality to our marketplace product. And we are offering a pretty additive assortment compared to other people oftentimes exclusive only offered with us. And that's an important factor in what we're doing. A lot of the categories we've brought in are categories that we don't offer. So for example, ceiling fans. We never have them before the marketplace allows us to be in that business, which is really important for the home in a lot of areas, and it allows us to go in there and be in that business and do it in a capital-light way. Okay. So in terms of markets, I'm going to give us to the data guy, Felix, in terms of open, closed markets. Go ahead, Felix. And I think to add to what Julie just said, and you can see this in our results over not just this quarter but over the last year. And even when you look back to 2018, '19, we've had acceleration in our comps and we are now looking at a growth company again, and we are very confident in that. And that means that we're going to improve our op margin, but we are going to reinvest to drive those top line sales because we have that opportunity. We're still very small in comparison to how good our brands are and people love our brands. And with our differentiators and our growth drivers, there is no doubt in our minds that we're going to reach that $10 billion faster than people expect and to do it more profitably than I think probably anybody else in our space. Well, thank you. Good questions. I really appreciate your interest, and I look forward to talking to you again after the next quarter."

            "name": "Julie Whalen",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report another outstanding quarter of financial results. Revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings per share all accelerated and exceeded expectations, demonstrating the power of our 3 key differentiators and the great execution by our team. The strength we saw across all of our brands reinforces that the consumer has a continued appreciation for the home, resulting in a shift in consumer spending to our category which should continue to benefit our business for years to come. \n Let's now review our first quarter results in more detail. Our net revenues reached approximately $1.75 billion with comparable brand revenue growth accelerating to 40.4%. We saw strong sequential acceleration across all brands, starting with West Elm at a comp of 50.9%, Pottery Barn at a 41.3%, Williams-Sonoma at 35.3% and Pottery Barn Kids and Teen at 27.6%. Our emerging brands, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham combined, delivered comp growth of over 35%, and our global business grew over 81% to approximately $100 million. \n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin expanded a record 850 basis points to 43%, driven by substantially higher selling margins and occupancy leverage. Selling margins expanded for another consecutive quarter, up over 440 basis points year-over-year and 310 basis points from the fourth quarter, driven by higher merchandise margins and ship cost leverage, which reflects the higher mix of retail sales versus last year. \n Higher merchandise margins were driven by a significant pullback in promotions. Our continued focus on marketing our proprietary design, sustainability and value in lieu of site-wide promotions allowed us to deliver another quarter of strong merchandise margins. Occupancy leverage of approximately 410 basis points in the quarter resulted from higher sales in another quarter of relatively flat year-over-year occupancy dollars at approximately $176 million as compared to $175 million last year. \n Our ongoing efforts to optimize our retail fleet by either renegotiating rent or closing less profitable stores has enabled us to minimize our occupancy dollar growth and to deliver this occupancy leverage. As a reminder, we closed a total of net 33 stores last year and expect to close 25% of our total retail fleet in the next 5 years. \n SG&A in the first quarter was 27.1% of net revenues compared to 28.1% last year, leveraging 100 basis points year-over-year. This was primarily driven by leverage in employment and other general expenses resulting from higher sales and overall cost discipline, partially offset by higher advertising as compared to our significantly reduced ad spend last year. As you may recall, as part of our initial financial response to COVID, we substantially reduced our spend across the business, particularly in advertising at this time last year. \n Since then, we have been incrementally investing back into advertising to drive our profitable top line growth and we expect this to continue as we move throughout the year. Given the strength of our business, including our record profitability levels, we are pleased that we are able to incrementally invest in high ROI advertising to drive top line growth and market share gains while still delivering another quarter of SG&A leverage and substantial operating margin expansion. Operating income grew over 250% to $278 million and resulted in operating margin expansion of 950 basis points to 15.9%, a record high first quarter operating margin. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $2.93 or nearly 4x higher than that of last year at $0.74. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with almost $640 million in cash and over $238 million in operating cash flow, a significant increase over last year. This strong liquidity position allowed us to fund the operations of the business, including $42 million in capital expenditures and to provide accelerated shareholder returns of over $361 million, consisting of increased quarterly dividends of over $45 million and a substantial increase in share repurchases of over $315 million. These accelerated returns, combined with a full paydown of our $300 million term loan during the quarter, along with the recent expiration of our 364-day $200 million line of credit facility, reflect our confidence in the long-term strength of our business and our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders. \n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories were $1.088 billion, for an increase of 1.6% over last year. While our inventory levels have sequentially improved, they continue to be impacted by our stronger-than-expected demand across all brands, as well as supply chain disruptions such as the West Coast ports congestion and Suez Canal blockage earlier in the quarter, the container shortage out of Asia and the COVID-related delays coming out of India. As a result of these challenges, we expect backorder levels to remain elevated until at least the third quarter of this year. We are also experiencing delays in our upholstery furniture production from the recent foam shortage which is currently causing our upholstered furniture quote times to be longer than usual. \n Now let me turn to our expectations for the rest of the year. As Laura mentioned, we are raising our 2021 outlook from mid- to high single-digit revenue growth to low double-digit to mid-teen revenue growth, along with year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin expansion. \n We are confident in our ability to deliver this higher revenue outlook given the strength of our business year-to-date, the strong housing environment and people's deeper appreciation for the home, the accelerating momentum in our growth initiatives, B2B marketplace and our global operations, and a planned sequential improvement in our inventory, enabling us to fill our significant backorders as we move throughout the year. \n Now I would like to talk about profitability. Although there are ongoing cost pressures from freight and raw materials, as Laura mentioned, we believe our operating margin expansion will be driven by overall sales leverage, continued occupancy leverage from the renegotiation of our lease agreements and store closures, continued expansion in our merchandise margins due to our differentiated positioning with design-led value-engineered and sustainable products as well as from overall strong financial discipline. \n As far as our capital allocation in 2021, we are maintaining our balanced approach to first investing in the business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. We are on track to invest approximately $200 million to $250 million in the business this year, with spend prioritized on technology and supply chain initiatives that primarily support our e-commerce growth. We also plan to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of quarterly dividend payouts and increased levels of share repurchases compared to last year. \n Our total share repurchase of over $315 million in the first quarter reflects our continued belief that our stock is undervalued, given our growth and profitability outlook. As a result, we believe investing more in our own stock will also drive long-term financial returns. Longer term, we remain well on track to reach $10 billion in net revenues and maintain at least 15% operating margins in the next 5 years. \n In summary, our results in the first quarter and the progress we have made across our key growth initiatives reinforce our ability to drive long-term sustainable growth and increase profitability. We believe we are in the best position to take market share, especially in an environment where consumers are investing more in their homes, shifting increasingly online and are prioritizing design, value and sustainability in their purchases more than ever before. All of these gives us the confidence to deliver on our long-term outlook and to drive strong financial returns for our shareholders for years to come. I would now like to open the call for questions. Yes. I would say, Oliver, I wouldn't read too much into that. We are very confident in where we are today, both obviously because of our Q1 performance, which is phenomenal, but also where we are quarter-to-date. And if you look at it on the high end, basically, we are guiding to a mid-teen level on top of the 17 last year with operating margin expansion on top of last year's outperform that was above 560 over the year before. So We feel very confident in the future of our business, both on this year and to reaching our 5-year $10 billion targets, so I wouldn't read anything into that at all. It's just work early in the year. I mean that's the reality we gave the previous outlook 2 months ago. And now we've completed 1 quarter, and we've got 3 big quarters to go. And so obviously, as they move through the year, we will update you accordingly, but we feel very confident in our business. So from an EBIT perspective, I think the most important thing is that we are very bullish on our ability to drive profitability. We have not seen this level of merchandise margin expansion to this degree for a while now. And though we've been driving it from 2018 because of our change in our operating model and our perspective as to how to pull back on promotions, and that's a fundamental shift that we've made. \n To this level, it's been incredible. And then you combine that with our occupancy leverage and, of course, the SG&A leverage that we've been able to drive, it gives us a lot of confidence in a very profitable operating margin like we delivered last year. I mean I think everyone was surprised by 14.2%, which is 560 over the prior year. And then they were surprised that we said we expand on top of that this year, and we are committed to doing that into driving at least 15% in 5 years. \n And I think it could be higher. But for right now, obviously, we've got puts and takes, like everybody who else is out there, we've got raw material increases, and we've got freight increases and things like that, but we are best positioned to be able to offset that and drive very strong profitability that we're committed to doing for the foreseeable future. \n On the revenue side, we are very confident as well about our $10 billion in the 5 years to come. Obviously, the core is a big base, and so that's a big driver of that growth. But really, our growth initiatives, I think you can underestimate. I mean one of my favorite that I always speak to is B2B. I mean it is on fire, and we have committed to well over $500 million for this year, and I think it's going to go even higher, much quicker than we thought. And so I think our growth initiatives, whether it's B2B, whether it's marketplace, whether it's our global operations, all of that or smaller businesses, Williams-Sonoma Home is a huge opportunity for a luxury market that's clearly underpenetrated. And we really have just gotten started on a lot of these. And so that's what gives us the confidence and the excitement to drive to that $10 billion number. Yes. I mean, again, first, as I said a minute ago, I mean, we're very confident in our ability to drive operating margin expansion and to be a profitable company from that perspective. We're very confident in our ability to continue to drive merch margin expansion where that will actually play out on each quarter and whether it's above 40% or not, we're not going to be providing that kind of level of disclosure at this time. But we have no reason to believe that that's going to discontinue. \n And so I think you can't model out. Obviously, we had 950 basis points of expansion and 850 in gross margin. I would model that out by quarter for the rest of the year. But I do believe that we've got a lot of strength left to come because of our fundamental shift in our pullback on promotions. And the reason we can do that is because of our differentiators. It's the fact that we design our product in-house and we engineer our product for value and sustainability while still being of high quality. And so because of that, we are able to then lead with content-led marketing and get the product that people want to them at a very good price. And so we don't see that changing anytime soon. And we're unique in that perspective because others are not able to do that. And so I think that's what gives us the confidence that we'll be able to maintain these strong margins going forward. I mean, first of all, comparable store sales growth, and we haven't been giving that number truly out. But if you're saying comps in general, I mean, quite honestly, we're seeing broad-based strength. So I mean we're not going to be disclosing by brand where we think the comps will be, but we haven't seen anything that in our business, obviously, look at the results in Q1, we're phenomenally strong. And we're seeing strong results in events in the second quarter. So whether it's kids returning to school and you've got gear and backpacks and dorm rooms to fill and across our kids business, whether it's Williams-Sonoma business and your entertaining outdoors with food and cooking or whether it's all of our other brands with our home furnishings offerings for outdoors and for entertaining. And as we move through the back half of the year, and we have gift giving. I mean they all have something incredible to offer for the quarters that come. So I really think it's going to be broad-based. I mean we haven't highlighted per se with the back half merch margins or gross margins will be, except to say that we continue to believe that we can drive merch margin expansion and occupancy leverage. And so we're very confident in our ability to drive gross margin expansion. \n Obviously, you can't model exactly what we've done this quarter or make those sort of assumptions as we move throughout the year because to your point, we certainly will have a -- more pressure as we move through the year. And of course, we'll have raw material costs and freight costs that are going up like everybody else. But we are best positioned to be able to handle those given our scale and given our unique offering and still be able to deliver merch margin expansion and gross margin expansion. So that's sort of what we've called out on that front. On the gross margin line, technically, they are lower than our regular retail price, but they also offer breadth and new customer counts and the ability to give the customer what they want. And ultimately, with that volume, they're operating margin accretive. So you want us to deliver those every day of the week. So on the occupancy dollars, I wouldn't necessarily make that assumption going forward. Certainly, because we shut a net 33 stores, mostly towards the end of last year, we're getting the benefit from that rent that's come out of the equation. But we also have our distribution centers that are layering in. As we've mentioned, we're adding 2 million square feet to support our significant e-commerce growth. And so that goes in there. There's also the timing and the size of the capital expenditures that hit depreciation, and that's what makes it be lumpy. So I don't think you can just take this current quarter's run rate and assume that throughout the back of the year. But certainly, we will still be driving occupancy leverage given our high sales and our ability to mute that cost because of the lower rents from the stores. And so we are committed to doing that throughout the rest of the year. \n On the B2B front, we -- I think it was closer to $300 million, a little lower than that. But yes, very strong business, very bullish on it. We think we've got a huge opportunity. That's an $80 billion business, and we are coming in at $500 million this year, so to speak. So -- and the trajectory that we've seen, the week-after-week acceleration in that business has been phenomenal, and we're really just getting started. We've been building the infrastructure from a people perspective, from a system perspective, from a supply chain perspective and it's really gaining momentum. And so trust me that we are investing everything we need to in that business to drive it because we do believe it's a significant growth opportunity for us. Sure. So as far as relative to the fourth quarter, the outperformance on the gross margin line was relatively broad-based. It was -- merch margin expansion was significant. And we did see shipping cost leverage, and that is both because you're coming out of the peak rates, but more so because we also had a pretty sizable shift to retail and the strength of retail even on a 2-year basis was phenomenal. And so when you have that, and there's more POS sales, so to speak, there's less shipping costs just generally for the sales that you drive on the top line. And so we had that benefit as well. \n And then we have the factor that we shut net 33 stores towards the end of last year where we started to get the benefit on the lower occupancy, particularly in the first quarter. And so that plus the significant sales growth we had really delivered off 3 of those. \n And second question, I'm trying to remember what that was. What was your second question, Chris? Yes. It has taken all of it in consideration, to be honest with you. Again, on the high end, it's a mid-teens revenue outlook on top of 17 last year And it's taking into consideration what we are able to see to date. And so it's both Q1 and our performance coming into the second quarter. And then it's also just realizing the benefits that we have ahead of us, in particular, in relation to the strong housing market, which tends to, if you look back in time, bode well for us for years to come. \n So that is a very strong scenario for us that's going to help us, plus we have the fact that you have the acceleration of folks buying our category online. You have also got the fact that there is a much more interest in companies that stand for values and sustainability, and we've seen that. And we think that's going to continue. And then, of course, you layer in the fact that we've got higher backorders and all of that, we expect to come back in the back half of the year gives us a lot of confidence in our ability. But as we said earlier, it's the first quarter. And we gave outlook 2 months ago, and we've raised it, call it, 600-plus basis points in 2 months. So we feel like this is a good spot to be, given we were 1 quarter in, but we are absolutely confident in our ability to deliver strong performance this year. Yes. I mean I think what you have to look at is that this time last year, we substantially pulled back like just about everybody when everything was shutting down and the equity markets were coming down. And so we dramatically pulled back our spend. And so given our performance, we've been continuing to invest in that. And so this quarter reflects a higher investment of advertising. which, by the way, also drives future sales. And so we think it's really important to continue to make these investments as Felix alluded to earlier, it's a competitive benefit that we can do this. \n Most people don't have the merch margin expansion that we have. They don't have the occupancy leverage even if they have the top line, and they can't afford the cost of advertising right now and we can. And so we're going to make that investment and be competitive about it and go after market share gains that will benefit us for future quarters and years, quite frankly. And so yes, you will see pressure on the SG&A line, mostly from advertising. There's some higher hourly wages that we're lapping, so to speak. But the reality is there's a lot of COVID expenses that we're in within SG&A as well last year that we hopefully won't be comping again based on what we know today. And so that will also provide us benefits in the back half to be able to offset that. Regardless, we are very confident in our ability to deliver merch margin expansion and occupancy leverage. And so we're -- our commitment is on the bottom line of operating margin expansion, which we feel very confident about being able to deliver."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJeremy Brooks: Good morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including guidance for fiscal '23 and our long-term outlook. We believe these statements reflect our best estimates. However, we cannot make any assurances these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations.\n The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. Specifically, we recorded an impairment charge of $17.7 million in the fourth quarter to write off certain software and hardware costs and goodwill associated with Aperture, a division of our Outward subsidiary. This impairment charge does not affect our ongoing use or strategy of the Outward Technology in our portfolio of brands and in our design and room planning functionality.\n Accordingly, our non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year '22 have been adjusted for this impairment charge. A full reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier this morning. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our filings with the SEC.\n Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our Investor Relations website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer. \nLaura Alber: Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. At Williams-Sonoma, Inc., we're proud that despite the declining macro environment, we delivered another year of record revenue and record earnings. With our relentless focus on compelling products, customer service and profitable growth, we continue to outperform our peers. We continue to gain market share, and we continue to distinguish ourselves as the world's largest digital-first, design-led sustainable home retailer. And what are these things that distinguish us? No other home furnishings company offers our in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated sourcing organization.  \n It allows us to deliver high-quality, sustainable products at the best value to market that cannot be found anywhere else. No other home furnishings company offers our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy that's transforming the customer experience. With our proprietary e-commerce platform, we are one of the largest e-commerce players in the United States. Our in-house CRM and data analytic teams optimize our digital spend and customer connections.  \n And our great stores not only deliver an outstanding customer experience, but also in 2022, we expanded our services with ship to store as we transition our stores to also service design centers in omni fulfillment hubs. And no other home furnishings company has our strong record on value that many consumers want today. In Q4, we are proud to be named to Newsweek's list of America's most responsible companies. The Morgan Stanley Capital International ESG assessment gave us a AAA rating, the highest possible. And we were included on the 2022 S&P Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America, the only new retailer added to the North America list in 2022.\n Along with our key differentiators, our success and profitability has been driven by our new growth initiatives that are cross brand and/or outside of our core brands. Our largest cross-brand growth driver is business to business. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. is no longer just a home furnishings company. We furnish our customers everywhere from restaurants to hotels, from football stadiums to office spaces. We set the ambitious goal this year to reach $1 billion in demand in our B2B business, and we came very close, driving 27% year-over-year growth and 166% on a 2-year basis.\n And we continue to win B2B accounts due to our design capabilities and a wide range of products offered in our multi-brand portfolio. Another successful growth initiative is our expansion into global markets. In the massive market of India, our new partnership with the Reliance Group is off to a very strong start. With our exclusive and differentiated product line, our 3 stores and websites in India are outperforming our expectations in a market where we see tremendous opportunity. And in Canada, we relaunched our website and saw improvements in conversion and AUR across brands.\n In our new businesses, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham have also provided incremental growth. Together, in fiscal 2022, they represented nearly $270 million in revenues and drove nearly a 10% comp on the year. These 2 brands service white space needs of customers. At Rejuvenation, we're expanding into remodel categories related to kitchen and bathroom, including vanities, cabinet hardware and custom wall lighting. And at Mark and Graham, our high-quality gift and personalization business is resonating with our customers, and we see outsized growth in the travel space, including luggage and accessories.\n Our core brands, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, Pottery Barn Teen, West Elm and Williams-Sonoma are also key contributors to our strong fiscal 2022, together growing at 6.4%. Put it all together, our key differentiators and our growth initiatives, and you see the results that we are reporting today. We're proud that we achieved our fiscal '22 annual guidance and delivered a 6.5% comp on the top line and an operating margin of 17.5%.\n At the same time, we drove EPS growth of over 11% to $16.54 per share from $14.85 last year. As I said at the top, we continue to outperform our peers in a year where the industry grew 1%, we grew more than 5%. All of this is particularly impressive given the declining macro backdrop in Q3 and Q4 of 2022 and the record demand that we are up against in 2021. Stepping back for a moment and looking at the last 12 years,  it's clear that we've consistently delivered. And more recently, since 2019, we've grown our revenues more than 47%, adding $2.8 billion to the top line.\n We've also more than doubled our operating margin from 8.6% to 17.5%. Now let's talk specifically about Q4. Our Q4 results were achieved while the macro backdrop weakened. Our demand comps were in the negative mid-single-digit comp range and were inconsistent across our portfolio of brands leading to a net revenue comp of negative 0.6% total company. In addition, although supply chain cost increases pressured our margins, we were able to offset these headwinds with SG&A cost savings producing an operating margin of 19.9% and earnings per share of $5.50 in Q4.\n Now let's talk about our brands for Q4 and for the full year. Pottery Barn ran a positive 5.8% comp in Q4 and a 14.9% on the full year. On a 3-year basis, Pottery Barn generated a 54% comp. Pottery Barn's inspirational product offering and successful execution of its growth initiatives like the Accessible Home, Apartment and Marketplace drove the performance. Also, our holiday offering was successful. As we look to the year ahead, the brand has a strong lineup of product offerings, including new products with great design and sharp price points.\n The Pottery Barn Children's business ran a positive 4% comp in Q4 and a positive 0.4% on the year. On a 3-year basis, the Children's business generated a 28.6% comp. Growth continued to be driven from Baby and Dorm. And another highlight is our successful introduction of our exclusive collaboration with the trending fashion brand, LoveShackFancy, which is outperforming our expectations. Also, in both Pottery Barn Kids and Pottery Barn Teen, we're excited to have launched a new native shopping app, which brings enhanced functionality and provides customers with an easy-to-use interface. We've only been live with the app for a short time, but we are seeing positive response, and we'll continue to read the results to determine if we should launch apps for our other brands.\n In Q4, the Children's business benefited from an improved in-stock position, which is critical to this life stage business and will continue to benefit us this year. The West Elm brand was most affected by the tough macro environment. In Q4, West Elm ran a negative 10.7%, coming off very strong multiyear comps. On a full year basis, West Elm ran a 2.5% comp and very strong operating margins. On a 3-year basis, the West Elm brand generated a 50.8% comp.  \n Looking ahead, we're very excited about the recent announcement of Day Kornbluth as the new brand president effective April 3. Day has a proven track record and previous success growing home furnishings brands. To lead West Elm through its next chapter of growth with a focus on 4 areas: industry-leading design and value; increased brand awareness and customer acquisition; expanding into product white space; and leveraging channel growth opportunity.\n Given the cautious consumer, we continue to see short-term softness. But with Day Kornbluth leading this brand, the total addressable market opportunity and the focus on those 4 areas, we continue to be very optimistic about the long-term growth trajectory of West Elm. Finally, the Williams-Sonoma brand had a successful holiday season, but ran a negative 2.5% comp in Q4, largely driven by softness in January.\n On the full year, the brand ran a negative 1.7% comp. On a 3-year basis, Williams-Sonoma generated a 32.6% comp. And while the housewares market has become extremely promotional, the Williams-Sonoma team remains focused on increasing product exclusivity, innovation, relevant content and full price selling. We have a pipeline of innovative product launches and chef collaborations planned throughout the year, and we see new opportunities from the integration of the Williams-Sonoma Home Furnishing's assortment into our kitchen business.  \n Looking ahead, we recognize that with the weak housing market, layoffs and a possible recession, there's a lot of uncertainty with the consumer. Nevertheless, we remain confident with our key differentiators and our growth initiatives, we're confident in our top line. With our focus on reducing costs and managing inventory levels, we're confident on our bottom line. And with the home furnishings market remaining large and fragmented, including the B2B market at an estimated $80 billion TAM, we're confident that we will continue to gain market share.\n With our relentless focus on compelling products, customer service and profitable growth and its inflation and costs, including shipping come down,  we're confident that will drive operating margins of more than 14%, as Jeff will discuss in more detail. Looking even further out, we remain confident in our long-term growth algorithm. I believe we're going to get through the coming environment better than any of our peers. We are going to keep delivering profitable growth, and we believe we can deliver a mid- to high single-digit top line growth and sustain our operating margin of at least 15% once the external environment improves.  \n This is a great company with great brands and with our culture of innovation and talent, our values and the strength of our team, we're moving ahead with our vision to furnish our customers everywhere. As we do, we're confident that we will continue to outperform our peers and deliver for all of our customers, employees and shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff. \nJeff Howie: Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. As Laura said, because of our key differentiators and growth initiatives, 2022 was another record year of revenue and earnings with our relentless focus on compelling products, customer service and profitable growth. We have outperformed our peers, and we continue to gain market share. Now I will walk you through our fiscal 2022 results, our Q4 results and then 2023 guidance.  \n More specifically, full year 2022 net revenues grew in line with our guidance of mid- to high single-digit growth, finishing at $8.674 billion, a 6.5% comp on top of the 22% comp in 2021 and a 17% comp in 2020. With our digital first but not digital-only platform, we saw growth across both channels, with e-commerce growing 4.5% comp and retail 11.1%. E-commerce now represents 66% of our total revenues. Gross margin at 42.4% of net revenues, deleveraged 160 basis points from last year. That happened as we absorb the ongoing impact of COVID supply chain disruption and global inflationary pressure.  \n With our strong financial discipline and cost control, we were able to materially offset these headwinds in gross margin as SG&A at 24.9% of net revenue, leveraged 140 basis points from last year. Operating margin of 17.5% was consistent with our full year guidance of being materially in line with our fiscal year '21 results and demonstrates the resiliency and profitability of our operating models.  \n Diluted earnings per share of $16.54, grew 11% over last year's $14.85, another record year of earnings for our shareholders. In fact, we're proud that 2022 constitutes the fourth consecutive year of EPS growth for our shareholders, another example of how we've consistently delivered. Likewise, our fortress balance sheet and consistent ability to generate free cash flow allowed us to fund our business operations, increase our capital investments to $354 million to support our long-term growth, and returned over $1 billion in excess cash to our shareholders.\n Dividend payouts were approximately $217 million or $3.12 per share, represented the 13th consecutive year we have increased our dividend. Coupled with our share repurchases of $880 million, this shows our strong commitment to maximizing total returns for our shareholders. And here's another example of our financial discipline and commitment to driving long-term growth for our shareholders. Our 49% return on invested capital, inclusive of our higher capital investments and increased inventory levels, our ROIC is among the best in the retail industry.  \n December 2022 results, we're proud to have delivered another year of record revenues and earnings. I want to thank all our associates for their hard work and dedication in driving these great results. Turning to our Q4 results. As Laura said, we continue to outperform our peers. This was despite the quarter's ongoing demand choppiness and declining macroeconomic backdrop. With our ability to gain market share through the strength of our proprietary in-house design and our family of strong and stable brands, our top line outperformed the industry.  \n Our resilient operating margin demonstrates the power of our operating model to sustain profitability. Net revenues came in at $2.453 billion, with comparable brand revenue growth at negative 0.6%. Demand on the quarter was in the mid-single-digit negative comp range, decelerating from Q3's demand trends. We saw a strong holiday season book ended by a soft early November and a soft January. Our net revenues were driven by strong order fulfillment, ongoing momentum in our growth initiatives and our continued ability to take market share even as we continue to experience inconsistent demand.\n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin of 41.2%, was in line with our expectations.  Coming in 380 basis points below last year, it reflects the impact of the higher input costs flowing through our income statement, including higher product costs, ocean freight, detention and demurrage as well as our efforts to meet our customer service expectations. Merchandise margins decreased from last year as we started to absorb the capitalized costs from higher product costs, ocean freight, detention and demerge into our income statement. This was partially offset by the higher pricing power, our proprietary products command and by our ongoing commitment to forgo site-wide promotions.\n The gross margin decline was also attributable to higher outbound customer shipping costs. We continue to incur these higher costs to best serve our customers by shipping from out-of-market distribution centers, and, in some cases, shipping multiple times for multiunit orders, which typically would have been fulfilled in a single shipment. We're working hard to rebalance our inventory composition and regional inventory location to improve our customer service.\n We expect customer service to gradually improve over the next few quarters.  Occupancy costs at 8.3% of net revenues were 60 basis points above last year, with occupancy dollars increasing 5% to approximately $204 million. Our ongoing retail store optimization initiatives partially offset incremental costs from our new distribution centers on both the East and West Coast. These new distribution centers will support our long-term growth, improve service time for our customers and drive cost efficiencies over time.  \n Our SG&A rate continues to be at a historic low at 21.3%, leveraging 270 basis points over last year, showcasing our financial discipline and ability to control costs. Employment leverage to last year as we manage variable employment costs in accordance with our top line trends and adjusted incentive compensation with business performance. Our advertising leverage reflects the agile, performance-driven proficiency of our marketing team.  \n Our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform are an underappreciated competitive advantage that allows us to drive efficient advertising spend in near real time as we see trends evolve in the business. SG&A also includes recoveries from insurance in the fourth quarter. With regard to the bottom line, we delivered another solid quarter of earnings in a challenging environment.\n Q4 operating income of $487 million and operating margin at 19.9%, which is only 110 basis points below last year, reflects the durability of our profitability, despite significant macroeconomic headwinds and inflationary cost pressures. Our record diluted earnings per share of $5.50, was $0.08 or 1.5% above last year's record fourth quarter earnings per share of $5.42. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $367 million and no debt outstanding. This is inclusive of consistently paying our quarterly dividend and opportunistically repurchasing shares congruent with our commitment to maximizing shareholder value.\n Merchandise inventories, which include in-transit inventory, at $1.456 billion, increased 17% over last year, while inventory on hand increased 40% over last year. There are 3 important points to emphasize here. First,  our inventory on hand increase is skewed by last year's pandemic-related supply chain disruption, creating an artificially low base. An apples-to-apples comparison versus 2019 highlights how we've improved our inventory turnover as our on-hand inventory levels have increased only 21% against revenue growth of over 47% during that time.\n Second, supply chain congestion eased earlier than anticipated in Q4. Like many retailers, we adjusted our transit times during the pandemic and received receipts substantially earlier than we expected in Q4 as transit times normalize. While this contributed to our increased inventory levels, it enabled us to substantially reduce our backlog to normalized levels.\n Third, our lower balance sheet inventory growth reflects a 40% reduction in merchandise in transit, as we've aligned our future on order with cautious forward-looking demand given the macroeconomic outlook. To sum up our Q4 results, we've outperformed our industry. Our top line proves our ability to take market share. Our operating margin demonstrates the resiliency of our profitability, and our record earnings per share is testimony to our commitment to maximize shareholder returns.\n Now let's look ahead to 2023. Due to the macroeconomic uncertainty, we are providing a wide range of guidance for '23. 2023 net revenues are expected to be in the range of down 3 comp to positive 3 comp, with operating margins between 14% and 15%. We expect the first half of the year will be materially tougher. On the top line, our year-over-year demand comparisons and last year's high back order fill, coupled with the declining macro will likely yield negative comps.\n On the bottom line, we continue to foresee gross margin pressure, as we saw in Q4. The higher input costs sitting on our balance sheet will continue to amortize into our income statement as well as ongoing incremental shipping costs to service our customers. In the back half of the year,  these headwinds should turn into tailwinds as our top line year-over-year comparisons get easier and our gross margin pressures become tailwinds that support our profitability.\n Our capital allocation plans for 2023 prioritize funding our business operations and investing in our long-term growth. We expect to spend $250 million in capital expenditures to invest in the long-term growth of our business. This constitutes a 30% decrease from 2022, with 80% of the spend dedicated to driving our e-commerce leadership through technology enhancements and supply chain efficiency initiatives. We expect to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and ongoing share repurchases.\n For dividends, today, we announced another double-digit increase in our quarterly dividend payout of 15% or $0.12 to $0.90 per share. Again, fiscal year '23 will be the 14th consecutive year of increased dividend payout, which we are both proud of and committed to. For share repurchases, today, we also announced our Board has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization, under which we will opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns for our shareholders.\n Combined, our dividend increase and new share repurchase authorization continue our commitment to returning excess cash to our shareholders. In fact, we returned over $3.2 billion to our shareholders over the last 5 years, which is yet another example of how we've consistently delivered. As Laura said, we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals of our business as we look beyond 2023.\n Our long-term growth algorithm will continue to drive mid- to high single-digit top line growth, with operating margins exceeding a floor of 15%. As the world's largest digital-first, design-led sustainable home retailer, we're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver profitable growth for these reasons. Our ability to gain market share in the fractured home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, the strength of our growth initiatives, our ability to control costs, the durability of our profitability and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet.  \n With that, I'll open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. \nAnthony Chukumba: So my question is on the divergence between, I guess, the Pottery Barn brands and the West Elm comps because even on a 2-year stack basis, Pottery Barn in particular really outperformed West Elm and you said that West Elm was impacted by the macro. I guess I'm just trying to understand why West Elm was much more impacted by the macro than Pottery Barn was in the fourth quarter? \n Hello, can you hear me? \nLaura Alber: [Indiscernible] hear me? \nAnthony Chukumba: Sorry, did you guys not get my question? \nLaura Alber: Yes, sorry, I'm answering it. Can you hear me? \nAnthony Chukumba: Okay. I can hear you now. Sorry, I couldn't hear you before. \nLaura Alber: Okay. No problem. I was saying that the stack on the 2 compares. Actually, West Elm stack is a little greater than the Pottery Barn stack. That being said, Pottery Barn has a wider range of products than West Elm does, and they had a very, very successful seasonal assortment. So that was one area of variation. But also, there are some nuances in the psychographic and demographic of the West Elm customer. And we keep looking at all of this customer data to understand it because any change creates opportunity for us. And we keep looking at how do we better position ourselves for this inflection point where consumers are more uncertain.  \n And there's not a lot of great things to hang on to in terms of the demos themselves other than income. The income levels of the consumers seem to really matter in terms of what they're buying. And then also, of course, the new mover section of our business is very different than it was a year ago, of course, when housing was much more robust. And so that has an outsized impact. As we look at the future, the same fundamentals exist as have existed for the opportunity for West Elm.\n And we're very excited about our new leader who is coming, who I mentioned in my prepared remarks, her experience and her strong leadership. And we also know that we've seen cycles before where you get some retraction and you come out stronger on the other side. And the design value equation that West Elm has is really hard to compete with anywhere else, that coupled with their omni experience in store and the very fresh and exciting stores.  \n And the reality is we've got our head down. We're working on our initiatives, and we're also working on making sure that we're positioning our marketing to be as relevant now as it was in the pandemic. And things have shifted. I just think it's important that we remember that at this time last year, we were not dealing with the high interest rates, we were not seeing the wave of layoffs and we didn't have the events of last week, which are now weighing heavily on the customer.\n And even though there are, Anthony, there's many negatives out there, honestly, this creates opportunity. It creates opportunity for West Elm and all of our brands; opportunity to reduce cost, be more efficient and leapfrog our peers on service. It also gives us the opportunity to take market share as weaker peers struggle. And as I said, our opportunity to come out stronger than anyone else and drive profitable growth. \nAnthony Chukumba: Got it. Very helpful. And then just one real quick follow-up. B2B sales continue to grow like a weed. Would love just your thoughts in terms of expectation for B2B sales growth in 2023? \nJeff Howie: Good morning, Anthony. B2B is one of our most exciting growth initiatives, as you know, and we finished this year just shy of $1 billion, growing 27% in the 1 year and 166% on a 2-year. In terms of where we see next year, it should continue to be accretive to our comps, probably in the neighborhood of about 100 basis points to our comps in '23. There's some really exciting things going on in B2B.\n And as you know, we're not always at liberty to talk about our clients. But in Q4, we saw some notable wins we can talk about. In office space, we outfitted Carl's Jr.'s corporate office. And unfortunately, there was no free food, that was not part of the deal. We also outfitted Google's midpoint office. In stadium space, we furnished the Golden Guardians' esports facility in Los Angeles. And in the hotel space, we saw a large number of hotel projects complete with Marriott SpringHill.  \n Now one thing to remember with B2B is there's 2 customer groups, trade and contract. While trade is more volume, contract is a source of growth. Trade maybe more sense of the B2C trends, but contract continues to drive the growth in B2B. We're not seeing a slowdown in the commercial side as there's a backlog of projects coming out of the pandemic, and we have a steady pipeline of RFPs we've gone out of. In fact, Q4 was the largest quarter of contract to date. The key point here is B2B continues to be a winning strategy for us, and we continue to capture market share in the $80 billion fragmented B2B market. It leverages our portfolio of brands, in-house design and global sourcing capabilities and our digital first but not digital-only strategy means that we can service the B2B customer in multiple ways. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Maks Rakhlenko with TD Cowen. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: So first, can you walk us through the scenarios and market dynamics that get you to both the low end versus the high end of both the comps as well as EBIT margin guidance for '23? And how should we think about the strong comp guide versus demand running down mid-singles in 4Q, including softer January? \nJeff Howie: Maks, well, here's what we're seeing as we anticipate continued choppiness in demand and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Certainly, the events of the past week don't help. And all of this is reflected in our guidance, which contemplates a wide range of outcomes. As we said in our prepared remarks, the first half of the year will be materially tougher. On the top line, our year-over-year demand comps and last year's high back order fill, coupled with the declining macro, is likely going to yield negative comps, as we will see our toughest headwinds on the top line. And we'll also see headwinds on the bottom line as we continue to see gross margin pressure as we did in Q4 from the higher input costs, we've all talked about sitting on our balance sheet and as they amortize in our P&L as well as our ongoing incremental shipping costs to service our customer.\n But here's the back half is a different story. Our top line year-over-year demand comparisons get easier, especially as we started to see demand decelerate after Labor Day last year. And as we've mentioned before, our gross margin headwinds become tailwinds in the back half. So here's the key point I'd like to make. We're uniquely positioned to take market share in any environment. Our key differentiators and growth initiatives position to take -- positions us to take market share in any environment. And our fortress balance sheet enables us to withstand pressures that many of our competitors will not. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: Got it. That's very helpful. And then -- so both your 2023 as well as your long-term EBIT margin outlooks lock in a significant step-up from 2019 levels. Can you walk us through the factors that give you confidence that this is achievable as well as the embedded expectations of meaningfully lower promotions? \nJeff Howie: Sure. Look, we've expanded our op margin by almost 900 basis points since 2019 as a result of our growth initiatives, our channel strategy and our cost discipline. In the near term, as we've guided and I just talked about, we have some short-term cost pressures that will be a headwind through the first half of '23, but then become a significant tailwind in the back half of '23 and into '24 that gives us confidence in the sustainability of our margins.\n As we look beyond '23 and the current macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals of our business. Our growth algorithm will continue to drive mid- to high single-digit top line growth, which -- with operating margins exceeding a floor of 15%.  We see 6 key drivers underpinning this 15% operating margin floor. First is our supply chain efficiency. But again I have been talking to, our first half headwinds will become tailwinds that will sustain our gross margin over the long term.  \n Second is our ad cost optimization. Our in-house model with first-party data and our own hands on the keyboard allows us to continue to optimize ad spend. Second is our -- third is our pricing power. Our in-house design, proprietary products, demand a higher price point in the market and enable us to forgo site-wide promotions. And I'll mention that we remain committed foregoing site-wide promotions as an ongoing basis.\n Fourth, our cost and inventory reductions. Our results speak to our financial discipline and cost controls. Next is our e-commerce sales mix where we continue to drive growth in the higher contribution channel of the e-commerce. And finally is our retail optimization strategy, which we've spoken to, where we're targeting fewer and more profitable stores. The key point here is our operating margin is sustainable at 15% and could even go higher with more leverage from higher revenues. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore. \nOliver Wintermantel: You mentioned the soft January, but now we are already 1.5 months into the first quarter. So you pretty good outlook for the quarter. How did the first quarter performed so far? You said it's -- the first half is meaningfully lower than the second half, but maybe some details on how the quarter started would be helpful? \nJeff Howie: Oli, so our recent performance continues to be choppy and inconsistent much like it was in Q4, and the macro environment is not helping, especially with the events in the past week. All of this is reflected in our guidance, which contemplates a wide range of outcomes. Here's the thing we know. Our 3 key differentiators uniquely position us to capitalize on opportunities to take market share in any environment. So for us, it's not so much about the macro. It's about what we can do to take market share and drive profitable growth in our business. \nOliver Wintermantel: Got it. And as a follow-up, you've done a really good job in the cost-cutting areas. How sustainable is that longer term? And what comp would you have to achieve to leverage SG&A? \nJeff Howie: Thank you. Yes, we've been very successful in managing our SG&A. I think it speaks to our operating model and our commitment to financial discipline and cost controls. We believe we can sustain our SG&A and continue to perform and manage those costs effectively. And our leverage comes from a mix of employment and ad costs. The majority of our employment is in our stores, distribution centers and call centers. So we have the ability to flex the sales. And our advertising leverage reflects the agile performance-driven proficiency of our in-house capabilities. which, again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think is an underappreciated competitive advantage.\n So our SG&A leverage shows the flexibility of our operating model, our commitment to financial discipline, and our ability to control costs in any environment, which we're confident we can continue to do so in the future. \nLaura Alber: Let me just add to that. We've been here for a while, Jeff and I, and through the pandemic and also the 2008 recession and with many levers we can pull, as he said, we certainly don't want to be in this situation, but we're one of the best positioned companies to weather any storm and come out stronger, and we've proven this time and time again.  \n First and foremost, we have a tenured management team who's been through it before. They know how to navigate this better than most. You know about our strong balance sheet that puts us in a much better situation than most. And then we are not waiting to see a full-blown recession. We are cost-cutting aggressively as we speak and pulling the levers that we have to set us up for more efficient operations, which, by the way, drives better service.\n So as Jeff mentioned, our supply chain costs have been under tremendous pressure and will continue to be because of the higher inbound and transportation costs of last year. And we do continue to incur additional costs resulting from servicing our customers, but these costs will come down, and they will serve as large tailwinds.  Our service has improved. We've normalized service. We've normalized back orders, but it is not where we want it to be. Our standard is much higher. It's a level we've never seen before.\n And we've been investing in our supply chain so we can reach that level, and that will yield a lot of improvements in margin for us. Also, remember, inflation affects vendor costs. And we have been seeing higher costs across the board from our vendors and suppliers from higher raw material costs, higher labor costs, higher fuel. But the reality is it's changing. And we are starting to mitigate these expenses and seeing the costs come down from our vendors. And then also, we mentioned our channels and how -- what our competitive advantages is. I mean you see people with large e-commerce businesses, but now stores. You see people who have enormous stores, but they really don't invest much in e-commerce. And we know that the multichannel shopper shops more and it's the experience they're looking for us, they can research online and go sit in the sofa in the store.\n And as I said earlier, we're expanding what we do in these stores and using them differently. And this is a big advantage for us. We're actually able to better turn our inventory because we can ship it from the store and people can pick it up in store. And we've also been, as we said, looking at our ad costs and looking at how we can ramp down with immediacy. And we're able to do this because, as Jeff said, we have first-party data, we have hands on keyboards, and we are constantly investing in tech that helps us improve our ad costs.\n On labor, it's important to note that we, unlike others, have been extremely cautious on backfilling positions when people leave. We did this in Q3 and Q4, and that has positioned us well in regard to labor cuts. However, we have restructured and rationalized some of our organizations to drive more efficiency because of the uncertain macro environment. And we know that this gives us a little head space as we go through the year and see -- if we see continued choppiness through the first half. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez with the Tesley Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernandez: I had a question on demand. I wanted to see if you could provide some color on what -- I guess, what is the consumer responding to what is doing better and what is worse? And I was particularly interested in categories like furniture which is just the core. I know furniture has been very strong over the past couple of years, but how does that typically perform in an environment of lower existing home sales and home price depreciation? \nLaura Alber: Sure. It's so early in the year to make any conclusions, and high ticket is very mixed from espresso machines to high end selling really well and then some softness in furniture. So I don't want to go too far into reading into this for the year because we see these things move around all the time. I mean the good news is that with our portfolio of brands that serve both life stage and price points and aesthetics and scale, we have more durability than others who may not have that exciting Easter assortment that brings people into their stores or a baby assortment on gear. \n The trends on registry continue to be very strong. And as I said, seasonal -- people are still going to celebrate the holidays and they're still going to give gifts. And I think there's really not a lot of people set up better from a gift-giving perspective than Williams-Sonoma brands. On the -- I know housing's top of mind for all of us and especially the people on this call know that home sales have decreased 37%, but home values have increased 40%. \n And for most of our customers, home is their greatest asset. People love their homes. They learned how to cook in the pandemic. And now as they continue to cut back spending elsewhere, they realize that going out to dinner is really expensive. So the dinner party is back in full force, and it's an area that we're really focusing on. The other dynamic just to remind everybody is, if you can't move, what do you do? Eventually, you remodel. \n When you remodel, you buy new furniture. So those are some of the things that we are able to because of our portfolio of brands, think about market to and build as we look at what we think is another inflection point with our consumer. \nCristina Fernandez: That's helpful. And then the second question I had, more probably for Jeff. But in the 2023 outlook, just thinking about the gross margin versus SG&A how to get to the decline for the year. It looks like you're controlling costs. So should we expect most of the decline to be due to the gross margin and those headwinds you mentioned in the first half? Or would it be a combination of deleveraging both? \nJeff Howie: Thank you, Cristina. I'm glad you brought that up. So we don't guide to specific line items as I think everyone knows. But I will say, as I said in my prepared remarks, our pressure will be on the gross margin line. And especially in the first half, as the capitalized cost of all the higher ocean freight and product cost, detention and demurrage continue to amortize into our P&L. Those will become a tailwind in the back half of '23 and into '24. So that's where we'll see the pressure from a P&L standpoint in '23.\n From an SG&A standpoint, as we've said, we continue to believe that we -- our financial discipline and cost control will allow us to continue to manage that line effectively. So we're not going to guide the specifics, but I think that will give you a flavor of how we're thinking about it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. \nJeff Howie: Hello, Marni, good morning. \nMarni Shapiro: I'm here. Hello? Hello? Hello? \nJeff Howie: Yes, we can hear you. \nMarni Shapiro: Okay. I don't know why it's not connecting nicely, but congrats on actually making it through what's been a very tough environment for you guys. Laura, I just wanted to focus a little bit big picture and step away from the housing market interest rates and banks for the moment. You've had some really good collaborations, most recently LoveShackFancy.\n Could you talk a little bit, I guess, bigger picture about these collaborations? Are they bringing in new customers? Are they driving traffic to the stores? And then I wanted to follow up on a comment you said about stores that you're one of the few that actually people could come in and sit down on couches and I witness this on a regular basis. \n So can you talk a little bit about what you're thinking about the stores going forward, I guess, more in the sense of servicing these stores? It seems to me from spending a lot of time on new stores that people come in kind of prepared to buy as opposed to browsing, they've done their work online and they just want to now sit in the couch or touch the sheets or see how that kitchen -- the dining chair feels. So how has that changed kind of the staffing and how you approach sales and the store model? \nLaura Alber: Thank you, Marni. So let's begin with collaboration. It's interesting. As much as we have our own in-house design team, we know that there are so many incredible designers out in the world doing adjacent things, sometimes in different categories. And our Kids -- our Children's business actually taught us the importance of collaborations as we recognize that children love Star Wars and Harry Potter and all those things and to not give them that when they're young seems like a little miss. So we had for years been working on all of those kids collaborations and then started to bring in other collaborations in our adult brands.\n And we've seen success, things that are sort of historic designs like William Morris has been phenomenal for us and then turning to a trending design group, LoveShackFancy, that is the hottest thing for young women now and bringing that to betting for children has been better than we even expected. And we thought it would be good, and it really is dynamite. \n Chef collaborations are another category that you don't want to forget about how important the Chef community is to us and it's mutually symbiotic. And we are not -- we work with Chef to not just have them talk about our products but also to develop products because oftentimes who knows better than what the best pan would be than a chef. And you've seen all these chefs that have come in, and we've done exclusive collaborations with -- in our brands. So this does have the impact of driving sales, but also bringing new customers in because sometimes these collaborators have a very different set of consumers that don't know our brands.\n And so that helps us bring in new people and these people are very, very loyal to these collaborators. Julia B in Pottery Barn is a really good example of that. So we're going to continue to feed that pipeline. We have some very exciting competitive confidential ones coming up this year. That's great.\n And then in terms of storage, we operate world-class retail business. And as I said earlier, our stores, they're not flagships. They're billboards for our brand and they're profit centers, and they're beautifully designed and curated with aspirational assortments. And we believe -- we continue to believe that these serve as competitive advantages. This is possible because we invest in them. We keep them relevant and attractive with fresh new store formats, but we do it through testing.\n We don't just change everything at once. You might have seen a couple of years back, we put together a new Williams-Sonoma. And we tested it right in our backyard here in Corte Madera, and we were thrilled with it. And that format is really outperforming. And so as things come up for renewal, we are carefully making the investment to freshen up those stores. And it doesn't -- it means that we're able to do more in the same or less space.\n And so you're right that people come in prepared to buy. We're destinations. We like to have parking because we want to make it comfortable. But when you come in and you prepare it to buy, you also might come in and be inspired to buy something you don't need. And that is why we think that our mix of furniture, but also decorative accessories and dinnerware and tabletop and all those other things that we sell in Williams-Sonoma food create more visits to stores than some of the traditional home furnishings and furniture-based retailers. \nMarni Shapiro: That's very helpful. And can I follow up also just on the B2B because you guys have seen really extraordinary growth. And I think you mentioned that there's still a backlog due to COVID, people are rethinking, I guess, the way their offices are just -- some of them are downsizing and moving, which necessitates the same renovation. Do you -- are you growing this team? Or are you still able to keep it really kind of small and nimble at this point? \nJeff Howie: Fortunately, what B2B does is it leverages all of the resources we have as a company, our in-house design team, our global sourcing organization, our supply chain team as well as our merchandising and inventory team. So we're able to keep this team pretty tight. There is a dedicated team that works with the contract space and customer service to make sure the larger orders are taken care of.\n But overall, we're able to really leverage our existing resources without much incremental investment to drive the B2B business. It's really more about what we have as our advantages in terms of our portfolio of brands, our in-house design, our global sourcing organic capability and then our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy means we can service the customer in multiple ways.\n So for us, it continues to be a winning strategy, and we continue to capture market share in a fragmented marketplace. \nOperator: At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. \nLaura Alber: Yes. Thank you all for joining us and look forward to talking to you next time. Goodbye. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. At Williams-Sonoma, Inc., we're proud that despite the declining macro environment, we delivered another year of record revenue and record earnings. With our relentless focus on compelling products, customer service and profitable growth, we continue to outperform our peers. We continue to gain market share, and we continue to distinguish ourselves as the world's largest digital-first, design-led sustainable home retailer. And what are these things that distinguish us? No other home furnishings company offers our in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated sourcing organization.  \n It allows us to deliver high-quality, sustainable products at the best value to market that cannot be found anywhere else. No other home furnishings company offers our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy that's transforming the customer experience. With our proprietary e-commerce platform, we are one of the largest e-commerce players in the United States. Our in-house CRM and data analytic teams optimize our digital spend and customer connections.  \n And our great stores not only deliver an outstanding customer experience, but also in 2022, we expanded our services with ship to store as we transition our stores to also service design centers in omni fulfillment hubs. And no other home furnishings company has our strong record on value that many consumers want today. In Q4, we are proud to be named to Newsweek's list of America's most responsible companies. The Morgan Stanley Capital International ESG assessment gave us a AAA rating, the highest possible. And we were included on the 2022 S&P Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America, the only new retailer added to the North America list in 2022.\n Along with our key differentiators, our success and profitability has been driven by our new growth initiatives that are cross brand and/or outside of our core brands. Our largest cross-brand growth driver is business to business. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. is no longer just a home furnishings company. We furnish our customers everywhere from restaurants to hotels, from football stadiums to office spaces. We set the ambitious goal this year to reach $1 billion in demand in our B2B business, and we came very close, driving 27% year-over-year growth and 166% on a 2-year basis.\n And we continue to win B2B accounts due to our design capabilities and a wide range of products offered in our multi-brand portfolio. Another successful growth initiative is our expansion into global markets. In the massive market of India, our new partnership with the Reliance Group is off to a very strong start. With our exclusive and differentiated product line, our 3 stores and websites in India are outperforming our expectations in a market where we see tremendous opportunity. And in Canada, we relaunched our website and saw improvements in conversion and AUR across brands.\n In our new businesses, Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham have also provided incremental growth. Together, in fiscal 2022, they represented nearly $270 million in revenues and drove nearly a 10% comp on the year. These 2 brands service white space needs of customers. At Rejuvenation, we're expanding into remodel categories related to kitchen and bathroom, including vanities, cabinet hardware and custom wall lighting. And at Mark and Graham, our high-quality gift and personalization business is resonating with our customers, and we see outsized growth in the travel space, including luggage and accessories.\n Our core brands, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, Pottery Barn Teen, West Elm and Williams-Sonoma are also key contributors to our strong fiscal 2022, together growing at 6.4%. Put it all together, our key differentiators and our growth initiatives, and you see the results that we are reporting today. We're proud that we achieved our fiscal '22 annual guidance and delivered a 6.5% comp on the top line and an operating margin of 17.5%.\n At the same time, we drove EPS growth of over 11% to $16.54 per share from $14.85 last year. As I said at the top, we continue to outperform our peers in a year where the industry grew 1%, we grew more than 5%. All of this is particularly impressive given the declining macro backdrop in Q3 and Q4 of 2022 and the record demand that we are up against in 2021. Stepping back for a moment and looking at the last 12 years,  it's clear that we've consistently delivered. And more recently, since 2019, we've grown our revenues more than 47%, adding $2.8 billion to the top line.\n We've also more than doubled our operating margin from 8.6% to 17.5%. Now let's talk specifically about Q4. Our Q4 results were achieved while the macro backdrop weakened. Our demand comps were in the negative mid-single-digit comp range and were inconsistent across our portfolio of brands leading to a net revenue comp of negative 0.6% total company. In addition, although supply chain cost increases pressured our margins, we were able to offset these headwinds with SG&A cost savings producing an operating margin of 19.9% and earnings per share of $5.50 in Q4.\n Now let's talk about our brands for Q4 and for the full year. Pottery Barn ran a positive 5.8% comp in Q4 and a 14.9% on the full year. On a 3-year basis, Pottery Barn generated a 54% comp. Pottery Barn's inspirational product offering and successful execution of its growth initiatives like the Accessible Home, Apartment and Marketplace drove the performance. Also, our holiday offering was successful. As we look to the year ahead, the brand has a strong lineup of product offerings, including new products with great design and sharp price points.\n The Pottery Barn Children's business ran a positive 4% comp in Q4 and a positive 0.4% on the year. On a 3-year basis, the Children's business generated a 28.6% comp. Growth continued to be driven from Baby and Dorm. And another highlight is our successful introduction of our exclusive collaboration with the trending fashion brand, LoveShackFancy, which is outperforming our expectations. Also, in both Pottery Barn Kids and Pottery Barn Teen, we're excited to have launched a new native shopping app, which brings enhanced functionality and provides customers with an easy-to-use interface. We've only been live with the app for a short time, but we are seeing positive response, and we'll continue to read the results to determine if we should launch apps for our other brands.\n In Q4, the Children's business benefited from an improved in-stock position, which is critical to this life stage business and will continue to benefit us this year. The West Elm brand was most affected by the tough macro environment. In Q4, West Elm ran a negative 10.7%, coming off very strong multiyear comps. On a full year basis, West Elm ran a 2.5% comp and very strong operating margins. On a 3-year basis, the West Elm brand generated a 50.8% comp.  \n Looking ahead, we're very excited about the recent announcement of Day Kornbluth as the new brand president effective April 3. Day has a proven track record and previous success growing home furnishings brands. To lead West Elm through its next chapter of growth with a focus on 4 areas: industry-leading design and value; increased brand awareness and customer acquisition; expanding into product white space; and leveraging channel growth opportunity.\n Given the cautious consumer, we continue to see short-term softness. But with Day Kornbluth leading this brand, the total addressable market opportunity and the focus on those 4 areas, we continue to be very optimistic about the long-term growth trajectory of West Elm. Finally, the Williams-Sonoma brand had a successful holiday season, but ran a negative 2.5% comp in Q4, largely driven by softness in January.\n On the full year, the brand ran a negative 1.7% comp. On a 3-year basis, Williams-Sonoma generated a 32.6% comp. And while the housewares market has become extremely promotional, the Williams-Sonoma team remains focused on increasing product exclusivity, innovation, relevant content and full price selling. We have a pipeline of innovative product launches and chef collaborations planned throughout the year, and we see new opportunities from the integration of the Williams-Sonoma Home Furnishing's assortment into our kitchen business.  \n Looking ahead, we recognize that with the weak housing market, layoffs and a possible recession, there's a lot of uncertainty with the consumer. Nevertheless, we remain confident with our key differentiators and our growth initiatives, we're confident in our top line. With our focus on reducing costs and managing inventory levels, we're confident on our bottom line. And with the home furnishings market remaining large and fragmented, including the B2B market at an estimated $80 billion TAM, we're confident that we will continue to gain market share.\n With our relentless focus on compelling products, customer service and profitable growth and its inflation and costs, including shipping come down,  we're confident that will drive operating margins of more than 14%, as Jeff will discuss in more detail. Looking even further out, we remain confident in our long-term growth algorithm. I believe we're going to get through the coming environment better than any of our peers. We are going to keep delivering profitable growth, and we believe we can deliver a mid- to high single-digit top line growth and sustain our operating margin of at least 15% once the external environment improves.  \n This is a great company with great brands and with our culture of innovation and talent, our values and the strength of our team, we're moving ahead with our vision to furnish our customers everywhere. As we do, we're confident that we will continue to outperform our peers and deliver for all of our customers, employees and shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff. [Indiscernible] hear me? Yes, sorry, I'm answering it. Can you hear me? Okay. No problem. I was saying that the stack on the 2 compares. Actually, West Elm stack is a little greater than the Pottery Barn stack. That being said, Pottery Barn has a wider range of products than West Elm does, and they had a very, very successful seasonal assortment. So that was one area of variation. But also, there are some nuances in the psychographic and demographic of the West Elm customer. And we keep looking at all of this customer data to understand it because any change creates opportunity for us. And we keep looking at how do we better position ourselves for this inflection point where consumers are more uncertain.  \n And there's not a lot of great things to hang on to in terms of the demos themselves other than income. The income levels of the consumers seem to really matter in terms of what they're buying. And then also, of course, the new mover section of our business is very different than it was a year ago, of course, when housing was much more robust. And so that has an outsized impact. As we look at the future, the same fundamentals exist as have existed for the opportunity for West Elm.\n And we're very excited about our new leader who is coming, who I mentioned in my prepared remarks, her experience and her strong leadership. And we also know that we've seen cycles before where you get some retraction and you come out stronger on the other side. And the design value equation that West Elm has is really hard to compete with anywhere else, that coupled with their omni experience in store and the very fresh and exciting stores.  \n And the reality is we've got our head down. We're working on our initiatives, and we're also working on making sure that we're positioning our marketing to be as relevant now as it was in the pandemic. And things have shifted. I just think it's important that we remember that at this time last year, we were not dealing with the high interest rates, we were not seeing the wave of layoffs and we didn't have the events of last week, which are now weighing heavily on the customer.\n And even though there are, Anthony, there's many negatives out there, honestly, this creates opportunity. It creates opportunity for West Elm and all of our brands; opportunity to reduce cost, be more efficient and leapfrog our peers on service. It also gives us the opportunity to take market share as weaker peers struggle. And as I said, our opportunity to come out stronger than anyone else and drive profitable growth. Let me just add to that. We've been here for a while, Jeff and I, and through the pandemic and also the 2008 recession and with many levers we can pull, as he said, we certainly don't want to be in this situation, but we're one of the best positioned companies to weather any storm and come out stronger, and we've proven this time and time again.  \n First and foremost, we have a tenured management team who's been through it before. They know how to navigate this better than most. You know about our strong balance sheet that puts us in a much better situation than most. And then we are not waiting to see a full-blown recession. We are cost-cutting aggressively as we speak and pulling the levers that we have to set us up for more efficient operations, which, by the way, drives better service.\n So as Jeff mentioned, our supply chain costs have been under tremendous pressure and will continue to be because of the higher inbound and transportation costs of last year. And we do continue to incur additional costs resulting from servicing our customers, but these costs will come down, and they will serve as large tailwinds.  Our service has improved. We've normalized service. We've normalized back orders, but it is not where we want it to be. Our standard is much higher. It's a level we've never seen before.\n And we've been investing in our supply chain so we can reach that level, and that will yield a lot of improvements in margin for us. Also, remember, inflation affects vendor costs. And we have been seeing higher costs across the board from our vendors and suppliers from higher raw material costs, higher labor costs, higher fuel. But the reality is it's changing. And we are starting to mitigate these expenses and seeing the costs come down from our vendors. And then also, we mentioned our channels and how -- what our competitive advantages is. I mean you see people with large e-commerce businesses, but now stores. You see people who have enormous stores, but they really don't invest much in e-commerce. And we know that the multichannel shopper shops more and it's the experience they're looking for us, they can research online and go sit in the sofa in the store.\n And as I said earlier, we're expanding what we do in these stores and using them differently. And this is a big advantage for us. We're actually able to better turn our inventory because we can ship it from the store and people can pick it up in store. And we've also been, as we said, looking at our ad costs and looking at how we can ramp down with immediacy. And we're able to do this because, as Jeff said, we have first-party data, we have hands on keyboards, and we are constantly investing in tech that helps us improve our ad costs.\n On labor, it's important to note that we, unlike others, have been extremely cautious on backfilling positions when people leave. We did this in Q3 and Q4, and that has positioned us well in regard to labor cuts. However, we have restructured and rationalized some of our organizations to drive more efficiency because of the uncertain macro environment.

            "name": "Jeff Howie",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. As Laura said, because of our key differentiators and growth initiatives, 2022 was another record year of revenue and earnings with our relentless focus on compelling products, customer service and profitable growth. We have outperformed our peers, and we continue to gain market share. Now I will walk you through our fiscal 2022 results, our Q4 results and then 2023 guidance.  \n More specifically, full year 2022 net revenues grew in line with our guidance of mid- to high single-digit growth, finishing at $8.674 billion, a 6.5% comp on top of the 22% comp in 2021 and a 17% comp in 2020. With our digital first but not digital-only platform, we saw growth across both channels, with e-commerce growing 4.5% comp and retail 11.1%. E-commerce now represents 66% of our total revenues. Gross margin at 42.4% of net revenues, deleveraged 160 basis points from last year. That happened as we absorb the ongoing impact of COVID supply chain disruption and global inflationary pressure.  \n With our strong financial discipline and cost control, we were able to materially offset these headwinds in gross margin as SG&A at 24.9% of net revenue, leveraged 140 basis points from last year. Operating margin of 17.5% was consistent with our full year guidance of being materially in line with our fiscal year '21 results and demonstrates the resiliency and profitability of our operating models.  \n Diluted earnings per share of $16.54, grew 11% over last year's $14.85, another record year of earnings for our shareholders. In fact, we're proud that 2022 constitutes the fourth consecutive year of EPS growth for our shareholders, another example of how we've consistently delivered. Likewise, our fortress balance sheet and consistent ability to generate free cash flow allowed us to fund our business operations, increase our capital investments to $354 million to support our long-term growth, and returned over $1 billion in excess cash to our shareholders.\n Dividend payouts were approximately $217 million or $3.12 per share, represented the 13th consecutive year we have increased our dividend. Coupled with our share repurchases of $880 million, this shows our strong commitment to maximizing total returns for our shareholders. And here's another example of our financial discipline and commitment to driving long-term growth for our shareholders. Our 49% return on invested capital, inclusive of our higher capital investments and increased inventory levels, our ROIC is among the best in the retail industry.  \n December 2022 results, we're proud to have delivered another year of record revenues and earnings. I want to thank all our associates for their hard work and dedication in driving these great results. Turning to our Q4 results. As Laura said, we continue to outperform our peers. This was despite the quarter's ongoing demand choppiness and declining macroeconomic backdrop. With our ability to gain market share through the strength of our proprietary in-house design and our family of strong and stable brands, our top line outperformed the industry.  \n Our resilient operating margin demonstrates the power of our operating model to sustain profitability. Net revenues came in at $2.453 billion, with comparable brand revenue growth at negative 0.6%. Demand on the quarter was in the mid-single-digit negative comp range, decelerating from Q3's demand trends. We saw a strong holiday season book ended by a soft early November and a soft January. Our net revenues were driven by strong order fulfillment, ongoing momentum in our growth initiatives and our continued ability to take market share even as we continue to experience inconsistent demand.\n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin of 41.2%, was in line with our expectations.  Coming in 380 basis points below last year, it reflects the impact of the higher input costs flowing through our income statement, including higher product costs, ocean freight, detention and demurrage as well as our efforts to meet our customer service expectations. Merchandise margins decreased from last year as we started to absorb the capitalized costs from higher product costs, ocean freight, detention and demerge into our income statement. This was partially offset by the higher pricing power, our proprietary products command and by our ongoing commitment to forgo site-wide promotions.\n The gross margin decline was also attributable to higher outbound customer shipping costs. We continue to incur these higher costs to best serve our customers by shipping from out-of-market distribution centers, and, in some cases, shipping multiple times for multiunit orders, which typically would have been fulfilled in a single shipment. We're working hard to rebalance our inventory composition and regional inventory location to improve our customer service.\n We expect customer service to gradually improve over the next few quarters.  Occupancy costs at 8.3% of net revenues were 60 basis points above last year, with occupancy dollars increasing 5% to approximately $204 million. Our ongoing retail store optimization initiatives partially offset incremental costs from our new distribution centers on both the East and West Coast. These new distribution centers will support our long-term growth, improve service time for our customers and drive cost efficiencies over time.  \n Our SG&A rate continues to be at a historic low at 21.3%, leveraging 270 basis points over last year, showcasing our financial discipline and ability to control costs. Employment leverage to last year as we manage variable employment costs in accordance with our top line trends and adjusted incentive compensation with business performance. Our advertising leverage reflects the agile, performance-driven proficiency of our marketing team.  \n Our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform are an underappreciated competitive advantage that allows us to drive efficient advertising spend in near real time as we see trends evolve in the business. SG&A also includes recoveries from insurance in the fourth quarter. With regard to the bottom line, we delivered another solid quarter of earnings in a challenging environment.\n Q4 operating income of $487 million and operating margin at 19.9%, which is only 110 basis points below last year, reflects the durability of our profitability, despite significant macroeconomic headwinds and inflationary cost pressures. Our record diluted earnings per share of $5.50, was $0.08 or 1.5% above last year's record fourth quarter earnings per share of $5.42. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $367 million and no debt outstanding. This is inclusive of consistently paying our quarterly dividend and opportunistically repurchasing shares congruent with our commitment to maximizing shareholder value.\n Merchandise inventories, which include in-transit inventory, at $1.456 billion, increased 17% over last year, while inventory on hand increased 40% over last year. There are 3 important points to emphasize here. First,  our inventory on hand increase is skewed by last year's pandemic-related supply chain disruption, creating an artificially low base. An apples-to-apples comparison versus 2019 highlights how we've improved our inventory turnover as our on-hand inventory levels have increased only 21% against revenue growth of over 47% during that time.\n Second, supply chain congestion eased earlier than anticipated in Q4. Like many retailers, we adjusted our transit times during the pandemic and received receipts substantially earlier than we expected in Q4 as transit times normalize. While this contributed to our increased inventory levels, it enabled us to substantially reduce our backlog to normalized levels.\n Third, our lower balance sheet inventory growth reflects a 40% reduction in merchandise in transit, as we've aligned our future on order with cautious forward-looking demand given the macroeconomic outlook. To sum up our Q4 results, we've outperformed our industry. Our top line proves our ability to take market share. Our operating margin demonstrates the resiliency of our profitability, and our record earnings per share is testimony to our commitment to maximize shareholder returns.\n Now let's look ahead to 2023. Due to the macroeconomic uncertainty, we are providing a wide range of guidance for '23. 2023 net revenues are expected to be in the range of down 3 comp to positive 3 comp, with operating margins between 14% and 15%. We expect the first half of the year will be materially tougher. On the top line, our year-over-year demand comparisons and last year's high back order fill, coupled with the declining macro will likely yield negative comps.\n On the bottom line, we continue to foresee gross margin pressure, as we saw in Q4. The higher input costs sitting on our balance sheet will continue to amortize into our income statement as well as ongoing incremental shipping costs to service our customers. In the back half of the year,  these headwinds should turn into tailwinds as our top line year-over-year comparisons get easier and our gross margin pressures become tailwinds that support our profitability.\n Our capital allocation plans for 2023 prioritize funding our business operations and investing in our long-term growth. We expect to spend $250 million in capital expenditures to invest in the long-term growth of our business. This constitutes a 30% decrease from 2022, with 80% of the spend dedicated to driving our e-commerce leadership through technology enhancements and supply chain efficiency initiatives. We expect to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and ongoing share repurchases.\n For dividends, today, we announced another double-digit increase in our quarterly dividend payout of 15% or $0.12 to $0.90 per share. Again, fiscal year '23 will be the 14th consecutive year of increased dividend payout, which we are both proud of and committed to. For share repurchases, today, we also announced our Board has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization, under which we will opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns for our shareholders.\n Combined, our dividend increase and new share repurchase authorization continue our commitment to returning excess cash to our shareholders. In fact, we returned over $3.2 billion to our shareholders over the last 5 years, which is yet another example of how we've consistently delivered. As Laura said, we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals of our business as we look beyond 2023.\n Our long-term growth algorithm will continue to drive mid- to high single-digit top line growth, with operating margins exceeding a floor of 15%. As the world's largest digital-first, design-led sustainable home retailer, we're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver profitable growth for these reasons. Our ability to gain market share in the fractured home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, the strength of our growth initiatives, our ability to control costs, the durability of our profitability and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet.  \n With that, I'll open the call for questions. Good morning, Anthony. B2B is one of our most exciting growth initiatives, as you know, and we finished this year just shy of $1 billion, growing 27% in the 1 year and 166% on a 2-year. In terms of where we see next year, it should continue to be accretive to our comps, probably in the neighborhood of about 100 basis points to our comps in '23. There's some really exciting things going on in B2B.\n And as you know, we're not always at liberty to talk about our clients. But in Q4, we saw some notable wins we can talk about. In office space, we outfitted Carl's Jr.'s corporate office. And unfortunately, there was no free food, that was not part of the deal. We also outfitted Google's midpoint office. In stadium space, we furnished the Golden Guardians' esports facility in Los Angeles. And in the hotel space, we saw a large number of hotel projects complete with Marriott SpringHill.  \n Now one thing to remember with B2B is there's 2 customer groups, trade and contract. While trade is more volume, contract is a source of growth. Trade maybe more sense of the B2C trends, but contract continues to drive the growth in B2B. We're not seeing a slowdown in the commercial side as there's a backlog of projects coming out of the pandemic, and we have a steady pipeline of RFPs we've gone out of. In fact, Q4 was the largest quarter of contract to date. The key point here is B2B continues to be a winning strategy for us, and we continue to capture market share in the $80 billion fragmented B2B market. It leverages our portfolio of brands, in-house design and global sourcing capabilities and our digital first but not digital-only strategy means that we can service the B2B customer in multiple ways. Maks, well, here's what we're seeing as we anticipate continued choppiness in demand and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Certainly, the events of the past week don't help. And all of this is reflected in our guidance, which contemplates a wide range of outcomes. As we said in our prepared remarks, the first half of the year will be materially tougher. On the top line, our year-over-year demand comps and last year's high back order fill, coupled with the declining macro, is likely going to yield negative comps, as we will see our toughest headwinds on the top line. And we'll also see headwinds on the bottom line as we continue to see gross margin pressure as we did in Q4 from the higher input costs, we've all talked about sitting on our balance sheet and as they amortize in our P&L as well as our ongoing incremental shipping costs to service our customer.\n But here's the back half is a different story. Our top line year-over-year demand comparisons get easier, especially as we started to see demand decelerate after Labor Day last year. And as we've mentioned before, our gross margin headwinds become tailwinds in the back half. So here's the key point I'd like to make. We're uniquely positioned to take market share in any environment. Our key differentiators and growth initiatives position to take -- positions us to take market share in any environment. And our fortress balance sheet enables us to withstand pressures that many of our competitors will not. Sure. Look, we've expanded our op margin by almost 900 basis points since 2019 as a result of our growth initiatives, our channel strategy and our cost discipline. In the near term, as we've guided and I just talked about, we have some short-term cost pressures that will be a headwind through the first half of '23, but then become a significant tailwind in the back half of '23 and into '24 that gives us confidence in the sustainability of our margins.\n As we look beyond '23 and the current macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals of our business. Our growth algorithm will continue to drive mid- to high single-digit top line growth, which -- with operating margins exceeding a floor of 15%.  We see 6 key drivers underpinning this 15% operating margin floor. First is our supply chain efficiency. But again I have been talking to, our first half headwinds will become tailwinds that will sustain our gross margin over the long term.  \n Second is our ad cost optimization. Our in-house model with first-party data and our own hands on the keyboard allows us to continue to optimize ad spend. Second is our -- third is our pricing power. Our in-house design, proprietary products, demand a higher price point in the market and enable us to forgo site-wide promotions. And I'll mention that we remain committed foregoing site-wide promotions as an ongoing basis.\n Fourth, our cost and inventory reductions. Our results speak to our financial discipline and cost controls. Next is our e-commerce sales mix where we continue to drive growth in the higher contribution channel of the e-commerce. And finally is our retail optimization strategy, which we've spoken to, where we're targeting fewer and more profitable stores. The key point here is our operating margin is sustainable at 15% and could even go higher with more leverage from higher revenues. Oli, so our recent performance continues to be choppy and inconsistent much like it was in Q4, and the macro environment is not helping, especially with the events in the past week. All of this is reflected in our guidance, which contemplates a wide range of outcomes. Here's the thing we know. Our 3 key differentiators uniquely position us to capitalize on opportunities to take market share in any environment. So for us, it's not so much about the macro. It's about what we can do to take market share and drive profitable growth in our business. Thank you. Yes, we've been very successful in managing our SG&A. I think it speaks to our operating model and our commitment to financial discipline and cost controls. We believe we can sustain our SG&A and continue to perform and manage those costs effectively. And our leverage comes from a mix of employment and ad costs. The majority of our employment is in our stores, distribution centers and call centers. So we have the ability to flex the sales. And our advertising leverage reflects the agile performance-driven proficiency of our in-house capabilities. which, again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think is an underappreciated competitive advantage.\n So our SG&A leverage shows the flexibility of our operating model, our commitment to financial discipline, and our ability to control costs in any environment, which we're confident we can continue to do so in the future. Thank you, Cristina. I'm glad you brought that up. So we don't guide to specific line items as I think everyone knows. But I will say, as I said in my prepared remarks, our pressure will be on the gross margin line. And especially in the first half, as the capitalized cost of all the higher ocean freight and product cost, detention and demurrage continue to amortize into our P&L. Those will become a tailwind in the back half of '23 and into '24. So that's where we'll see the pressure from a P&L standpoint in '23.\n From an SG&A standpoint, as we've said, we continue to believe that we -- our financial discipline and cost control will allow us to continue to manage that line effectively. So we're not going to guide the specifics, but I think that will give you a flavor of how we're thinking about it. Hello, Marni, good morning. Yes, we can hear you. Fortunately, what B2B does is it leverages all of the resources we have as a company, our in-house design team, our global sourcing organization, our supply chain team as well as our merchandising and inventory team. So we're able to keep this team pretty tight. There is a dedicated team that works with the contract space and customer service to make sure the larger orders are taken care of.\n But overall, we're able to really leverage our existing resources without much incremental investment to drive the B2B business. It's really more about what we have as our advantages in terms of our portfolio of brands, our in-house design, our global sourcing organic capability and then our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy means we can service the customer in multiple ways.\n So for us, it continues to be a winning strategy, and we continue to capture market share in a fragmented marketplace."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the Williams-Sonoma Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJeremy Brooks: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you that during the call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including guidance for fiscal '22. \n We believe these statements reflect our best estimates. However, we cannot make any assurances that these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call.  \n Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure appears on exhibit one to the press release we issued earlier today. The call should also be considered in conjunction with our filings with the SEC.  \n Finally, a replay will be available on our Investor Relations website.  \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer. \nLaura Alber: Thank you, Jeremy, and good afternoon, everyone. We are proud of another strong quarter, generating an 8.1% comp or 25% on a 2-year basis and 50% comp growth on a 3-year basis, with record EPS growth of 12% over last year to $3.72 per share. These results reflect the continuation of backlog order fulfillment, strong product margins and disciplined cost control.  \n Demand comps for the quarter were slightly negative. This continued outperformance reflects the unique strength of our multi-brand portfolio, our growth initiatives and ongoing execution of our talented team. Since we last spoke, the macro backdrop has become more uncertain. However, what has not changed is the large and fragmented space in which we operate, where no one player owns significant market share.  \n We believe we have an ability to capture more of this market in any environment. We have and will continue to deliver results, leveraging our key differentiators, our in-house design, our digital first but not digital-only capabilities and our value. These competitive advantages in combination with our growth strategies give us many opportunities for the future. As we talked about before, one of our largest is B2B, which had another excellent quarter, driving over $30 million in demand, a 17% increase to last year. \n We continue to believe our B2B business presents a sizable growth driver for us as it disrupts an underserved estimated $80 billion total addressable market. B2B is building velocity with large and repeat projects from commercial and hospitality partners like Marriott and Hilton. We are also focused on diversifying into new industry verticals, including the healthcare space through multiproperty partnerships with national accounts. In September, we successfully launched our improved corporate gifting and custom merchandise services, and we are encouraged by the early success leading into the holiday season.  \n A key B2B customer of ours for over 3 years now in Starbucks. We are thrilled to publicly announce that our team was able to assist Starbucks with the build-out of the gorgeous 3-story flagship reserve store in the Empire State Building. In addition to incorporating furniture from Brooklyn-based West Elm, our B2B team had the opportunity to work with Starbucks to create custom furniture solutions to meet their unique needs. We look forward to growing our existing relationship with Starbucks.  \n And now I'd like to talk about our global business where we continue to expand in key markets and grow our multichannel presence. In Q3, we saw strength in both franchise and company-owned. In the franchise business, we believe that one of our biggest opportunities is in India. And after launching our website earlier this year, we opened our first Pottery Barn store in New Delhi, joining our West Elm stores in New Delhi and Mumbai. We plan to continue to focus on in India and in early 2023, will be adding stores across our brands and continuing to improve our online experience with our great partner, the Reliance Group. In our company-owned business, I want to highlight Canada where we successfully relaunched our website this year across all the brands, driving order fulfillment and improved omni experience. Another important initiative is sustainability for which we continue to be recognized for our impact initiatives and ESG leadership across the home furnishing industry. In Q3, we were named a top score on sustainable furnishings counsel wood furniture scorecard for the fifth consecutive year, and West Elm received the Ford Stewardship Council Leadership Award for its use of FSC certified wood.  \n We recognize there is much more work to do in this space, and we are committed to continuing to be a leader in planet, people and purpose. One of our sustainability initiatives is our goal to plant 6 million trees across our family of brands in partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation. We are excited to report that we have planted over 2 million trees to date.  \n Now let's turn to the performance of our brands. Pottery Barn delivered yet another very strong quarter with a 19.6% comp or 35.5% on a 2-year stack and almost 60% on a 3-year stack. Pottery Barn continues to perform, offering exclusive high-quality inspirational products and strategic growth areas like apartment, marketplace and bath reno are driving results.  \n We're particularly proud of our accessible home collection, which launched in late July and has quickly scaled. West Elm delivered a 4.2% comp in the third quarter or 26.6% on a 2-year stack and 48.4% on a 3-year basis. During the quarter, we improved our in-stock inventory position, and we expect to continue to make improvements in our service levels into Q4 and next year. We are also very focused on improving our e-commerce experience and customer-facing conversion-driving initiatives.  \n I've had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with West Elm this quarter, and I am very impressed with the talented and passionate team running the brand. Our greatest opportunity at West Elm is doubling down on what has made this brand great, our commitment to design innovation and value price points.  \n Now I'd like to update you on the Pottery Barn children's home furnishings business, which ran a negative 4.8% comp in Q3 but a positive 12.1% on a 2-year basis and a positive 35.9% on a 3-year basis. We continue to see ongoing recovery in our in-stocks. And looking to the future, we have a strong pipeline of products at compelling values. The Williams-Sonoma brand ran a negative 1.5% comp in Q3, but a positive 6.1% on a 2-year and a positive 36.5% on a 3-year basis.  \n We continue to see that people are hosting and entertaining at home. And as such, we saw strength in entertaining areas. In Q3, we successfully kicked off the holiday season with our exclusive collaboration with celebrity chefs and author, Ina Garten. As part of this collaboration, Ina shared Thanksgiving tips for cooking and hosting the ultimate Thanksgiving dinner party. We also announced the exciting launch of a collaboration with renowned British heritage textile brand, William Morrison Company. Williams-Sonoma Home delivered another double-digit comp in Q3. We continue to see this business as an opportunity to deliver outsized growth by picking up market share from the limited luxury high-end home market. We're excited to launch an expanded furnishing line for the kitchen in Q4. As we look to the holiday season, we are prepared to meet the needs of our gift giving customers with compelling product offerings. \n Our stores are a competitive advantage, and they are stocked and our associates are ready to serve our customers. And finally, our emerging brands, including Rejuv and Mark and Graham, together, they ran a 7.8% comp this quarter. At Rejuvenation, we saw success in remodel categories related to kitchen and bathroom, including vanities, cabinet hardware and wall widening. And at Mark and Graham, wins were from the travel category, including luggage and travel accessories. We are proud of our third quarter results. but we are also aware that economic uncertainty is on the minds of consumers and investors alike.  \n During the third quarter, we experienced deceleration and choppiness in our demand, and it is hard to know where the economy is going or how long the uncertainty will last. Nonetheless, we are controlling what we can control and looking at opportunities to reduce costs without an impact to the customer experience. In fact, we believe that protecting service and innovation is key to outperforming our peers. \n As it relates to pricing, we continue to be committed to not running site-wide promotions as we did before the pandemic, but we will continue to mark down and clear overstocks. We are working with our vendors to reduce costs and pass on that value strategically to our customers. As for additional expenses, out of market and redundant shipping expenses and transportation costs have negatively impacted our gross margin. We continue to focus on these pressures and mitigation of these costs will be a significant benefit for us in the future, particularly in the second half of next year.  \n In summary, we are conscious that the home furnishings market may contract due to macro factors. If this happens, we believe we are uniquely positioned to take market share even if there is a downturn, and here's why. We built a company of loved brands with a shared platform of competitive differentiators that leads the industry, in-house design, digital first but not digital-only platform and our value. We have identified opportunities for growth through strategic initiatives like B2B, global end marketplace where we have the opportunity to disrupt. And finally, we have a culture of innovation and an experienced team who knows how to increase operational efficiencies and control costs while protecting service and driving new growth opportunities. \n Now I will turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the results in more detail in his first earnings call as CFO. \nJeff Howie: Thank you, Laura, and hello, everyone. I am so pleased to join you today for my first earnings call in my new role as Chief Financial Officer. While I'm relatively new to this particular role, I'm a 20-year member of the Williams-Sonoma leadership team. I come into this role with deep knowledge and experience across our brands, operations and financials. I look forward to applying my breadth and depth of experience to drive continued strong results. \n Diving into our third quarter results. We delivered another quarter of record revenues and earnings in a challenging environment. Our top line results illustrate our ability to gain market share. Our bottom line results demonstrate the power of our operating model to sustain merchandise margins and control SG&A expenses.  \n Net revenues grew to $2.2 billion, with comparable brand revenue growth at 8.1% for a 2-year comp of 25% and a 3-year comp of almost 50%. Our revenue growth was driven by strong order fulfillment, ongoing momentum in our growth initiatives and our continued ability to take market share, even as we experienced inconsistent demand within our portfolio of brands and across the quarter. Both channels continued to experience strong growth, with retail at a 16.9% comp and e-commerce at a 4.4% comp.  \n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin was 41.5%, 220 basis points below last year and in line with our expectations. We sustained strong merchandise margins that were flat year-over-year. We remain committed to our decision to no longer offer site-wide promotions and preserve the pricing integrity our proprietary, differentiated product commands. \n The strength of these merchandise margins is particularly impressive given we absorbed significant cost increases from our vendors and ocean carriers, including higher demurrage and detention charges. As expected, the gross margin decline was driven by higher outbound shipping costs. This is due to our increased furniture mix, higher back order fulfillment and incremental freight costs. We also incurred higher costs to best serve our customers by shipping from out-of-market distribution centers and in some cases, shipping multiple times for multiunit orders, which typically would have been fulfilled in a single shipment.  \n Occupancy costs at 9.2% of net revenues were 30 basis points above last year, with occupancy dollars increasing 10.5% to approximately $202 million. Our ongoing retail store optimization initiative partially offset incremental costs from our new distribution centers on both the East and West Coast. These new distribution centers will support our long-term growth, improve service time for our customers and drive cost efficiencies over time. \n Our SG&A rate continues to be at historic lows at 26%, leveraging 150 basis points over last year, driven by advertising and employment leverage. Our advertising leverage reflects the agile, performance-driven proficiency of our marketing team, our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform allow us to test, learn and scale, which is a unique competitive advantage.  \n Our SG&A leverage also reflects our culture of financial discipline, where we consistently challenge all expenses for return on investment and drive operational efficiency throughout the company. On the bottom line, we delivered another record quarter of earnings. Q3 operating income grew 2% to $340 million, and we delivered strong operating margin at 15.5%, only 80 basis points below last year despite significant headwinds and cost pressures. Our diluted earnings per share of $3.72, was up 12% from last year's record third quarter earnings per share of $3.32.  \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $113 million, with no debt outstanding and year-to-date operating cash flow of $588 million. That enabled us to fund the operations of the business and expand our capital investments to support our long-term growth. In addition, year-to-date, we have returned excess cash of over $1 billion to shareholders through $165 million in dividends and $840 million in share repurchases.  \n These decisions reflect our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders. And with our strong and disciplined balance sheet, combined with our expected free cash flow, we have flexibility to continue to invest in the growth of the business and opportunistically invest in our own stock and drive long-term shareholder returns.  \n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories, which include in transit, were $1.688 billion, increasing 33% over our reduced level of last year. Inventory on hand increased 34% over last year, but was up only 11% to 2019 versus sales up 52% over the same time. In the quarter, back order levels decreased but remained well above historical levels. We are working hard to get these goods in to fulfill our customer orders but continue to anticipate our backorder levels will remain elevated in the first half of '23. \n Summarizing our Q3 results, we are proud to have delivered another quarter of record revenues and earnings. I would like to thank all our associates for their hard work and dedication in driving these great results. Now turning to our expectations for the remainder of the year and beyond. We acknowledge that the near-term macroeconomic picture remains uncertain, with conflicting economic signals surrounding consumer spending trends, decade high inflation and Federal Reserve monetary policy, intentionally moderating economic demand.  \n Additionally, our trends have been increasingly inconsistent and less predictable. This combination of conflicting economic signals and inconsistent trends makes our guidance unusually difficult to predict. However, we remain confident in our ability to operate in any environment, and are, therefore, reiterating our fiscal year '22 guidance of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth with operating margins relatively in line with fiscal year '21.  \n Our outlook is grounded in 3 factors. First, we are currently in the early stages of our upcoming holiday seasonal rent with the biggest weeks yet to come. Second, our Q3 quarter demand trends support a wide range of outcomes. And third, the ongoing improvement we see in fulfillment of our customer order backlog. From a profitability perspective, as we said in our last call,  we continue to expect cost pressures to persist for the balance of fiscal year '22 and into the first half of '23, primarily across our supply chain. \n These headwinds include our incremental distribution centers, higher product and freight costs and our efforts to best serve our customers by delivering products as timely as possible. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. In fiscal year '22, we expect capital expenditures will be approximately $350 million. We plan to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders through quarterly dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. \n While the near term may be uncertain, the current management team has successfully navigated challenging environments before, including the 2008 great financial crisis and the 2020 global pandemic. We know the levers to pull, and we have already taken steps to reduce cost and inventory to mitigate downside risk. \n Given the increased macro uncertainty, we will not be reiterating or updating our fiscal year '24 guidance at this time. We will be providing guidance for fiscal year '23 and beyond at our next call. We remain confident in the long-term fundamentals of our business. Our confidence remains rooted in our ability to take market share in the fractured home furnishings industry. The strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet.  \n And having been here before, we see opportunity to take an offensive stance in a challenging macro environment. In summary, we are very proud of our results. We continue to deliver for our customers, our associates and our shareholders. And now I'd like to open the call for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. \nPeter Benedict: First one is on inventory. Just wanted -- maybe you could give us a little more color, your comfort with the current makeup furniture versus non-furniture. It sounds like you've adjusted some receipts, I guess, in response to the slower -- or the softer macro. But how should we think about the level of inventory that you'd be comfortable operating with? I think you're about 120 day currently. I think you used to run like 100 days pre-COVID. I don't know. Like any benchmark to help us think about as we move through next year, how inventory might look depending on different sales scenarios. That's my first question. \nLaura Alber: Thanks, Peter. I'm going to let Jeff take that one. \nJeff Howie: Peter, when you think about inventory, I really think it's tough to look at it on a 1-year basis. I know we're up 33%. But if you think about this time last year, we're at our most aggressive inventory levels because if you think back to last year, that's when Southeast Asia was really closed, and we were still seeing the residual impacts of the COVID closures from India and China. So we're at our lowest inventory level at that point. \n We really like to look at it on a 3-year basis, where our 3-year on-hand inventory is up 12% versus our sales up 52% over the same time period. How we're thinking about it is we're making progress, but there's still a lot more work to do. Our backlog remains at historically high levels, and we're working hard to get our composition right as well as our location of our inventory to service our customer best. We anticipate our inventory levels and our back orders to gradually improve through Q4 and in the first half of '23. \nPeter Benedict: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then my second question. I know it's an unpredictable environment, but you did -- you have some line of sight here, I think, in terms of the out-of-market shipments and the other items that you said would provide some saving. Any way you can maybe help frame the size of those opportunities as we think about the back half of '23 as those start to come into the P&L? \nJeff Howie: Thanks, Peter. I think that's a great question, and it's really how we're looking at it. So we have tremendous headwinds right now, particularly on our gross margin from higher product costs, higher inbound ocean costs. And as you mentioned, higher out-of-market costs as well as shipping multiple shipments to the same customer for the same order when we should really be shipping it once. That right now for the Q4 and into the first half of '23 is a headwind, and it will be impacting our margin. But we're pretty optimistic as we look to the back half of '23 and into '24. This is going to be a substantial tailwind and give us a lot of room to sustain our margins. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Shemesh with RBC Capital Markets. \nSteven Shemesh: First one is on the slightly negative demand comp in the quarter. Can you share any additional perspective on how demand trended throughout the quarter and, I guess, where we stand in the first few weeks of November? And then as a follow-up on the backlog. I mean, it seems like the supply chain lead times improved pretty meaningfully throughout the quarter. Just curious if that materially changes your view on when you'll clear the backlog. I know you still said first half '23, but to the extent that's true, just curious why that wouldn't clear sooner. \nJeff Howie: Steve, let's take your demand question first. So in terms of the cadence across Q3, it was incredibly inconsistent and choppy as we described, and that's both across our portfolio of brands in the quarter. We started the quarter off relatively strong, mid-single-digit comps, as we talked about in the Q2 call. And then we saw it really trail off after Labor Day once the Fed announced our fourth rate hike. And even if you look at it, whether it's 1 year, 2 year or 3 years, it was just inconsistent. One year decelerated across the quarter, 2 year was up and down and 3 year actually accelerated across the quarter. So it's tough to get a read on it, and then we just described it as inconsistent and choppy. But what we're pretty confident about is even in this choppy environment, we continue to take market share.  \n Regarding the backlog, your second question. We still have more work to do, like I mentioned in the previous question. There's a lot of work left to do to deliver to our customers. The backlog remains sizable. And for us, some of the challenges are getting it in the right location and in the right composition so we can complete a multiline order for a customer. So we -- again, we think it's going to take us through Q4 and in the first half to really normalize that level of activity. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Cristina Fernandez with Telsey Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernandez: I wanted to ask also on demand, but a different way. It seems like performance by brand is diverging. I assume that's the same on the demand level. Any insights you have into customer age or income that you see changes in how the different cohorts are responding to your products? \nLaura Alber: Sure. Thanks, Cristina, for the question. So you can clearly see, even by looking at the net comps, how strong Pottery Barn was. They've really been outperforming. The rest of the brands are kind of in a similar range. But remember, you got to look at more than just a 1 year. So when you look at West Elm on a 3-year, it's really, really strong and not as far off as you might think. \n So in terms of what we see in the demos, it's really -- I'm careful not to draw any big conclusions from it because the data is very sensitive. \n It looks like the only thing we can see is lower income being more affected. We don't see necessarily an age issue. We just see lower income being more hurt than higher income, which is consistent with what you'd probably expect out there. The good news is, in total, our core customer is pretty affluent. And we also know that a lot of this is just uncertainty because there's really nothing that's happened. They still have a lot of home appreciation, and we have more savings than they did before the pandemic. \n And so depending on what happens with the macro, this could be short. But if the macro gets worse and wage loss happens and the Fed continues to do what they are tasked to do, which is to stop growth, it could impact those customers more than it even has already. And so that's the reason we've been hesitant to give guidance out into '24. It's not that we're not confident in our business. It's that it's really hard to tell what's going to happen in the macro. If that was even just going to be as it is today, we would predict it. But it's changing so rapidly. And frankly, none of us are economists. \n But we do know that we have a lot of levers to pull. We have a lot of growth strategies that are working. We talked to you about B2B, marketplace, global. You can see in our brands when you go through them, some really exciting initiatives that are not just interesting, but they're really producing great results, big one being accessible home for Pottery Barn is something that we think we can do across all brands, frankly. \n So despite what could be an uncertain environment, we see ourselves in a really good place like we were, if it's going to be '08 or if it's even because it's going to be the pandemic, I think people are always worried about what happens. And we tend to come out much better than most. So that's my insight to what's happening out there and how it affects our customer and what our opportunities are. Thanks for the question. \nCristina Fernandez: And then as a follow-up. If demand were to slow further, can you give some examples of the levers you can pull on the cost side to preserve as much of the operating margin, if you can? \nLaura Alber: Go ahead, Jeff. \nJeff Howie: Sure, Cristina, we have quite a few levers, particularly on our SG&A line, where advertising, we can definitely adjust as we go. And the nice thing here is we have our own hands on the keyboards with our in-house marketing team who's really agile and performance driven. We also have opportunities on employment, which, of course, leverage with sales with most of our employment in our distribution centers and stores and call centers. And then there's a number of other cost efficiencies we can drive throughout our operations to continue to leverage our SG&A to help our operating margin. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: I'm sorry if I missed this, but could you -- Jeff, could you just give me the digital penetration or growth where we're sitting at kind of for the quarter? And then, Laura, I really wanted to congratulate you on the Starbucks, that win. If you can talk about -- I know that they're undergoing a sort of massive renovation, refresh of their entire store fleet. So I'm wondering where you think you can go from here having done that flagship? \n And then also for you, Laura, is India. As you look internationally, you're opening stores, company-owned stores in Canada. Are there any other markets in which you would contemplate owning your stores from a company-owned perspective versus franchising them? \nLaura Alber: Okay. Let me go backwards, forwards. So India. We just -- Jeff and I actually had a chance to go over the ourselves and see our stores. And at the time, West Elm were the only stores open. I'd tell you, they're as good as any store here in the United States. And our partners, the Reliance Group, are so good at digital and their marketing campaigns and the collaborators that we're working with. \n And we just walked away saying, we got to really spend more time than we even think on this because this is a market where it's enormous middle-class growing and a real penchant for high-quality design and goods. There's not much out there, so we're the first person out there with a full lifestyle suite of stuff. It reminds me of we first started Pottery Barn and brought furniture into our stores in the '90s. It's that big of an opportunity. So we're thrilled that we have a great partner. \n When you have a great partner in some of these very far away, more difficult to do business places, that's the way to go, in my opinion. I mean, Canada is a lot easier than India or in the Middle East, you have to have a partner. But at this point, there's nobody else that we're -- there's nowhere else that we're intending to open company-owned stores. There is an opportunity to do DTC Europe eventually when it's the right time to do that. This would not be the right time, in my opinion, to do that, but we could do that out of DTC -- DC and our platform that we have set up in the U.K. \n Okay. Starbucks. We're thrilled we finally can talk about this. We've been working closely with them for 3 years. We've been doing a lot with them. And what I can say that I think they're going to be okay with me saying is that they're great partners, and they've been very creative with us to allow us to do some designs for them to their specs, for their stores. And we've really built this partnership up. And I don't know if you've been to that flagship, I just got the pictures, it is spectacular. And so that's one of many that we've done. \n You'll start to notice and see us popping up, but I can't give you any sort of road map of scale on the Starbucks other than to say, it's one of the many great opportunities that we have. And we continue to really believe that B2B is going to be bigger than anyone expects. And then I'll pass it over to Jeff for digital growth. \nJeff Howie: Sure. Adrienne, we're proud of both of our channels, and they both really did a great job this past quarter and delivered strong results. Retail was up 15.9%. And to get to your question, B2C delivered a 4.4% comp and was sequentially in line with our Q2 results coming about 65% of the total. Long term, we continue to see e-comm growing to 70% of revenues but both channels remain part of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, and we're happy to serve the customer in every channel they want to shop in. \nLaura Alber: I'll just also add, Adrienne, that when you really think about last year, Thanksgiving to Christmas, this is the time when, unfortunately, for a lot of people, Thanksgiving or Christmas or both or Hanukkah got canceled, get togethers got canceled because of COVID. And so it wasn't the full open that it is now. \n We actually -- or I actually believe that retail is going to be the big winner of this holiday season. I think you can see people are out and about. And we're really stocked and ready to go. We are staffed. We have the goods in the stores already, and we put them there earlier so we can capture the sales. \n And honestly, we also have something we never had before pre-pandemic, which is our omni services. So of course, BOPIS is a thing everybody does. Shipping from store is not a thing that everybody does, but we have learned to get quite good at it. And then also shipping to the store is something we do. And we have just enabled, which I am quite excited about, shipping to any store in the company. So for example, if you buy online, PB Kids, but there's no PB Kids next to you, you can ship it to your local Williams-Sonoma store and you go pick it up. \n And we did this when we worked on dorm. And our dorm strategy this summer, we saw great results. And so I think this is going to be something that continues to build, not just because we don't have stores in every market, but because also it's a convenience play as people are back in the office more and also some people don't want to have to wait at home or UPS won't deliver to their ZIP code for that reason. \n This is a way to get around having to be there and wait for it to arrive at your porch. So this is yet another example of how we're taking omni, and it optimizes the retail inventory. So for example, if I'm wrong and retail isn't as good as I think it's going to be, this inventory can be shipped against DTC orders, which I think is a really exciting advantage that we have that particularly stores or brands that don't have retail don't have the opportunity to achieve. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital. \nAnthony Chukumba: So just 2 real quick ones. First off, super exciting about Starbucks. I know in the past, you said that you expected B2B sales to be about $1 billion this year, and I was just wondering if -- I just noticed you hadn't commented on that, so I'm just wondering if that's still the right way to think about it.  \n And then my second question is just kind of what you're seeing from -- in terms of the competitive environment. I mean, obviously, you're sticking with getting rid of site-wide promotions. I 100% agree with that. But just I was wondering if you're seeing your competitors get any more promotional. \nLaura Alber: Jeff, do you want to go ahead with B2B? \nJeff Howie: Sure. We see our track on B2B just continuing to propel forward, and we are on track to hit the $1 billion this year. The demand pipeline through our projects and our major partners continues to be strong, and we're very confident in our ability to get there. \n And from a long-term standpoint, it is such a fractured market, total addressable market, $80 billion. And we think we have a really compelling proposition with our portfolio of brands, our in-house design, our global sourcing capabilities to really capture this. And we're seeing a lot of promising signs out there in terms of pent-up demand for renovations in hotels and restaurants. And we think it's quite a great opportunity for us. \nLaura Alber: Jeff, why don't you take the second piece of the question? \nJeff Howie: Could you repeat your second question, Anthony? \nAnthony Chukumba: What you're seeing in terms of the competitive environment, particularly around promotions. \nJeff Howie: We're seeing -- we're definitely seeing more promotions in the environment as the economy softens. I think a lot of retailers have been thinking -- have been talking about that this week. Our approach has been very consistent in terms of the level of promotions that we've been doing. \n And plus, I want to reiterate that we remain committed to not offering site-wide promotions in our brands, and we will do whatever it takes to continue to not do that. We think that our in-house design proprietary product really resonates with the customer because of its differentiation and commands its own pricing power, and we're seeing that in our results. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Max Rakhlenko with Cowen. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: So first, on the gross margin pressure, how would you quantify the various headwinds, just putting them into different buckets? And then how should we think about that pressure in 4Q? And just any color on puts and takes into the quarter there. \nLaura Alber: Thanks, Max. I'm giving that to Jeff, too. \nJeff Howie: All right. Thanks, Max. I think all of them are heavy pressures on our gross margin, as we've been communicating. There's the product costs, which have been with us all year as part of inflation. There's the ocean costs, which, although we see ocean costs overall coming down, we still have the cost in our balance sheet and need to sell through that higher cost inventory. \n Our shipping costs domestically have been high, as we talked about because of out of market and shipping multiple times a customer. As I said in the answer to the first question, we still have quite a bit of work to do to get our inventory in the right composition as well as the right location to properly service our customer and work on this backlog we have. \n So we think it will be -- continue to be a headwind for Q4 and into the first half of '23. The thing I'm really optimistic about is when we turn the corner, when we start to look at the back half of '23 and into '24, it's going to be a tremendous tailwind. And I'm optimistic that we can really sustain our margins when I think about all the cost pressures we've been under and still delivered the results we're delivering today. \nLaura Alber: The other piece of this is we are starting to see our vendors reduce their pricing to us. And I'm not just talking about shipping, I'm talking about product vendors. And that is a pretty sizable thing as you think about the future. In some cases, it's going to be important to pass along part of that to the consumer because everybody had to take a price increase. And when it comes down, we want to make sure that we have the best value out there. \n So we're always scrubbing to see how's our design vis-a-vis the competition. How's our quality, how's our sustainability problems and how is our price. And so as we get better prices from our vendors, which we're already starting to see, there will be some that are passed along to the consumers so that we can really continue to grab market share because we're going to offer an even better value. And so there are -- in addition to just the cost being normalized, I think there's some real opportunities as you think about the back half of next year and beyond to really improve the margin from here. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore. \nOliver Wintermantel: Jeff, congratulations on the new role. I had a question regarding retail. I think you said up 16%, 16.9%. Can you give us a little bit more detail what drove that? Is that AUR? Or is that mix or traffic versus ticket? That would be great. \nLaura Alber: Okay. Oliver, it's Laura. Remember, the 16.9% is the net comp not a demand comp. It's driven by AUR and the resulting traffic fill from the previous sales. As we look at demand comp -- yes, as we look at demand comps now, at retail, our traffic is better than our competition, better than the industry, which is really exciting. And you all know Christmas is the -- and the holidays is the time that people love to come into our stores. And I've said before, you salivate just thinking about walking into a Williams-Sonoma store. And so we're really focused on conversion, and we have the traffic. So that's why I tend to be quite optimistic that retail is going to be -- the retailers, for us at least, is going to continue to overdeliver in the short term as we're comping the pandemic not completely out of the house that we were in last year. \nOliver Wintermantel: Got it. And my second question was regarding B2B. If you just think about the macro environment and let's say that there's a slowdown, how do you think B2B is holding up versus the consumer business? Do you think there's more headwinds? Or could that hold up better than the consumer business? \nJeff Howie: That's a great question, Oliver. I think that the B2B business will hold up stronger potentially in a soft macro environment than the consumer. If you think about the dynamics of the past couple of years, the consumer market took off during the pandemic as people were home and they started shopping. And now that's possibly trailing off a little bit with the Fed's monetary actions and the macroeconomic environment. \n B2B on the other hand, a lot of those verticals they were shut down for several quarters and even over a year. And there was a big backlog of work and renovation work and projects that weren't done. And all of that pipeline of those -- that pent-up demand and deferred projects is really coming online now. We're seeing it in the RFPs we have out, talking to our customers in B2B. And when I attend trade shows, there's just a general energy about the amount of projects that are out there. Funded projects, a lot of renovations. There was a great article in the Wall Street Journal, I think it was last week and the week before, talking about the hotel experience and how there's just a dearth of great hotels. A lot of them need to be updated and renovated. And that just speaks well to our opportunity with B2B. So in sum, it can really be countercyclical if there is a macroeconomic downturn. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. \nSteven Zaccone: I'll extend my congrats to you, Jeff, as well on the new role. First question I had was just how much do you think the competitive environment is factoring into the slowing demand trends that you're seeing in your business? The macro is difficult, we understand, but the home furnishing industry has also gotten a little bit more promotional. And I guess, Laura, as you look across the industry, are you concerned inventory levels are getting high in the channel? \nLaura Alber: Yes. So it's funny, the macro environment or -- no the competitive environment has always been promotional. When you really go back and you think about -- even before all these new start-ups came about, there was Macy's always in the home business and a lot of other big players. And then Amazon came along and Wayfair. They've always been after price first. What we do versus them is very different in that we're designing our own goods. And we've been doing it for a lot of years. And so we tend to be first with new trends and able to bring out finishes that others can't replicate even when they try to copy us, they can't replicate. And so when you actually go and look at the difference between our furniture or even our tabletop or any of the categories versus theirs, you're going to see a big difference in quality and the resulting price even with their markdowns, our value is better.\n We keep looking at that, looking at whether it's the sofa, the coffee table, the rug. I mean, when you take a product down like-for-like and you really look at it in person, look at the price, I feel very good about where we sit. There's always a few exceptions. There's always a few opening price points that I wish were sharper. Those are -- the opening price points are the place that I want to get back to be more competitive as we were pre pandemic. Those are the areas where I think everybody got a little too high. But in total, I really don't think it's a competitive pricing issue because it's hard to match our goods against anyone else's goods. Now in terms of inventory in the channel, Bed Bath & Beyond has a ton of inventory that they're pressing and going to continue to press at deep markdowns. \n Again, different products. But will that hurt everybody on the fringes? That one might be the biggest factor going. But the Wayfair and the Amazon, those guys are the biggest out there, but it's just -- it's a very different business. So you might buy one thing from them for your garage or something, but you're not going to furnish your living room, your full bedroom from some of those brands. Our customer wouldn't anyway because there are -- what they're looking for is a much higher quality level and design sensibility. And they want someone to help them put it together. \n So those are, I think, the factors at play, and we just have to make sure that we're not distracted by a short-term blip and that we are all focused on what we've built here and continuing to feed it, which means innovation, innovation and product and service and continuing to press forward when everyone else is doing the duck and cover. And that's the thing. I mean it's exciting, even though it's a different hand than we expect it to be dealt right now. It's an exciting time to really think about it offensively. And what's the company that we want to look like and again, make improvements to. If this is a recession, what are we going to look like on the other side of it. And I think when you saw us come out of '08, we were stronger and we're much stronger coming out of the pandemic. And whatever this is going to be, I would say the same thing, we're going to be much stronger coming out of this, too. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Historically, there's been a nice lead, lag relationship between housing turnover and furniture sales. I'm curious, Laura, do you think that relationship still exists? Or has it been decoupled? If you listen to the home improvement names over the past week, they're seeming to suggest that this time is different and that we are seeing some decoupling, which could indirectly be good for your business over the next couple of years. \nLaura Alber: Yes. I mean I just think this is a people are nervous sort of situation. As I said earlier, Lowe's, Home Depot, they're really very optimistic. I'm sure everybody listened to their calls and people still love their homes. And the sentiment is still I want a nicer home. I want a second home. I want a bigger home. Now they're not going to buy one because nobody wants to buy right now. That doesn't mean that you don't still love your home, you don't want to still spend money on it. And so the renovation, a lot of those renovation projects are still lagging from the pandemic when you couldn't even get a refrigerator, right? You still can't get a refrigerator. And so you're not done with your kitchen, so you're not fishing your kitchen yet. So it's interesting that those projects are still lagging, and there's still, there should be, in my opinion, there should be still a big upside as they finish those projects and then they go to spruce up the furnishings. \n Because if you spend a lot of money on your new bathrooms and your new kitchen, which are usually where people go first, generally speaking, you buy furniture next. So it should be a very positive thing for us. What I think is happening is, right now is more fear than reality, and we'll see what happens and which way that goes. But as I said earlier, our customers are still in really good economic shape. They're just -- I think they're taking a small pause for a minute as everyone's been talking about. \nCharles Grom: Okay. And then I know directionally, B2B is more accretive than the traditional retail business. But clearly, some of the optimism, I think on the longer term, margin structure is in B2B, particularly as it ramps. I was wondering if you or Jeff could just maybe speak to some of the buckets of why that B2B business is so much stronger on the margin front because I think it would help bridge the gap from some of the fears on some of the costs starting to come back into the P&L as an offset. \nJeff Howie: A couple of things there, Chuck. So first of all, B2B is slightly accretive to our op margin. And really, the dynamic there is you don't have the overhead of some of the retail and then not as much advertising costs. So it does lend some accretion from that standpoint. But I think when you think about the costs that are hitting the P&L, the second part of your question is, I think we have to think about that really in 2 phases. The first is the near term, which is Q4 and the first half of '23, where we're seeing the higher product cost, a higher inbound shipping costs and all of our additional costs as we work through our backlog. That will become a tailwind for us. As we turn the corner and head in the back half of '23 and '24, I think that in and of itself will support our margins long term. And then B2B will really just be the icing on the cake on top of it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham: My first question is around merchandise margins. You guys have been doing a great job holding the line on merchandise margin despite some of the pressures. As you move forward, could you help us understand the puts and takes the arc of merchandise margins in the fourth quarter and through the first half of 2023? \nJeff Howie: Thanks, Seth. We don't guide specific line items like that, but we are giving you a guidance on the overall direction of gross margin, with March margin a sone component of that. And we do see headwinds there in Q4 and in the first half of '23 for all the reasons that we've talked about, the product cost, the ocean costs and then our own challenges with getting through our backlog with out-of-market shipments and multiple shipments to customers. And again, I think that, that becomes a huge tailwind. As we look to the back half of '23 and '24, that gives us optimism from the long-term sustainability of our margins. \nSeth Basham: Got it. Just to frame the question differently then, Jeff. Thinking about the merchandise margins and how you've been able to hold them flat year-over-year given the level of inventory that's rising and the likely higher level of clearance and discontinued lines that you'll have going forward, would you expect to be able to offset those pressures on merchandise margins with things like product costs and in-bound shipping cost reductions? \nJeff Howie: I think one thing to think about with our inventory that's different from, say, an apparel retailer, fashion retailers, we have a much higher penetration of the core. So we don't have that seasonal pressure to move like other companies do that are in the retail industry. And from a long-term standpoint, again, to the back half of '23 and into '24 these headwinds we're experiencing really become tailwinds, and that's where we see opportunity on the margin from a long-term standpoint. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas with KeyBanc. \nBradley Thomas: Two financial questions, if I could. The first just thinking about sales for the fourth quarter, I know you reiterated the full year guidance, but technically, if we back into what's implied, it's a pretty wide range. Wondering if there's any more color you could share with us with how to think about the fourth quarter revenues. \n And then we get a lot of questions about the structural margins of Williams-Sonoma and it does seem to me that you've done some great things with the brands and probably deserve a higher merchandise margin than pre-pandemic levels. And similarly, you've done a great job of getting more efficient with occupancy expense and having a greater mix of e-commerce sales and perhaps that should support a higher margin. But I would love to hear your latest thoughts on perhaps what structural margins look for you as we think about perhaps slower trends ahead. \nJeff Howie: Okay. Let's start with the Q4 implied sales. And yes, it's a wide range. As I spoke to in my prepared remarks, we saw a tremendous amount of choppiness in Q3. The result of that choppiness is there's a wide range of estimates. But our guidance is a blend of those ranges of estimates and reflects our best estimate as what we see potentially happen in Q4. As a result -- as it relates to the structural margin, there's been quite a bit of change within the structural margin. And here, I think there's a lot to talk about in terms of how we really improved our operating model. The first one is the impact of elimination of site-wide promotions. That is really buttressing our merchandise margins and giving us a lot of opportunity there to continue to sustain that. I think it speaks to something we really learned and sort of maybe relearned in the pandemic is that our proprietary differentiated product that our in-house design produced really commands its own price in the marketplace. \n And that product really resonates with the customer, and they're really willing to pay for it. The second thing is, throughout the pandemic, we really, number one, improved the profitability of our retail stores and as mix has shifted to e-commerce, which by nature is more profitable for us. So a combination of those different factors really helps us with sustaining the margin. And then over the long term, we see additional opportunity to take costs and drive efficiency throughout our P&L. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I now turn the call back to management for closing remarks. \nLaura Alber: Yes. Thank you all for joining us. I want to wish you a very happy holiday season and look forward to talking to you next year. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy, and good afternoon, everyone. We are proud of another strong quarter, generating an 8.1% comp or 25% on a 2-year basis and 50% comp growth on a 3-year basis, with record EPS growth of 12% over last year to $3.72 per share. These results reflect the continuation of backlog order fulfillment, strong product margins and disciplined cost control.  \n Demand comps for the quarter were slightly negative. This continued outperformance reflects the unique strength of our multi-brand portfolio, our growth initiatives and ongoing execution of our talented team. Since we last spoke, the macro backdrop has become more uncertain. However, what has not changed is the large and fragmented space in which we operate, where no one player owns significant market share.  \n We believe we have an ability to capture more of this market in any environment. We have and will continue to deliver results, leveraging our key differentiators, our in-house design, our digital first but not digital-only capabilities and our value. These competitive advantages in combination with our growth strategies give us many opportunities for the future. As we talked about before, one of our largest is B2B, which had another excellent quarter, driving over $30 million in demand, a 17% increase to last year. \n We continue to believe our B2B business presents a sizable growth driver for us as it disrupts an underserved estimated $80 billion total addressable market. B2B is building velocity with large and repeat projects from commercial and hospitality partners like Marriott and Hilton. We are also focused on diversifying into new industry verticals, including the healthcare space through multiproperty partnerships with national accounts. In September, we successfully launched our improved corporate gifting and custom merchandise services, and we are encouraged by the early success leading into the holiday season.  \n A key B2B customer of ours for over 3 years now in Starbucks. We are thrilled to publicly announce that our team was able to assist Starbucks with the build-out of the gorgeous 3-story flagship reserve store in the Empire State Building. In addition to incorporating furniture from Brooklyn-based West Elm, our B2B team had the opportunity to work with Starbucks to create custom furniture solutions to meet their unique needs. We look forward to growing our existing relationship with Starbucks.  \n And now I'd like to talk about our global business where we continue to expand in key markets and grow our multichannel presence. In Q3, we saw strength in both franchise and company-owned. In the franchise business, we believe that one of our biggest opportunities is in India. And after launching our website earlier this year, we opened our first Pottery Barn store in New Delhi, joining our West Elm stores in New Delhi and Mumbai. We plan to continue to focus on in India and in early 2023, will be adding stores across our brands and continuing to improve our online experience with our great partner, the Reliance Group. In our company-owned business, I want to highlight Canada where we successfully relaunched our website this year across all the brands, driving order fulfillment and improved omni experience. Another important initiative is sustainability for which we continue to be recognized for our impact initiatives and ESG leadership across the home furnishing industry. In Q3, we were named a top score on sustainable furnishings counsel wood furniture scorecard for the fifth consecutive year, and West Elm received the Ford Stewardship Council Leadership Award for its use of FSC certified wood.  \n We recognize there is much more work to do in this space, and we are committed to continuing to be a leader in planet, people and purpose. One of our sustainability initiatives is our goal to plant 6 million trees across our family of brands in partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation. We are excited to report that we have planted over 2 million trees to date.  \n Now let's turn to the performance of our brands. Pottery Barn delivered yet another very strong quarter with a 19.6% comp or 35.5% on a 2-year stack and almost 60% on a 3-year stack. Pottery Barn continues to perform, offering exclusive high-quality inspirational products and strategic growth areas like apartment, marketplace and bath reno are driving results.  \n We're particularly proud of our accessible home collection, which launched in late July and has quickly scaled. West Elm delivered a 4.2% comp in the third quarter or 26.6% on a 2-year stack and 48.4% on a 3-year basis. During the quarter, we improved our in-stock inventory position, and we expect to continue to make improvements in our service levels into Q4 and next year. We are also very focused on improving our e-commerce experience and customer-facing conversion-driving initiatives.  \n I've had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with West Elm this quarter, and I am very impressed with the talented and passionate team running the brand. Our greatest opportunity at West Elm is doubling down on what has made this brand great, our commitment to design innovation and value price points.  \n Now I'd like to update you on the Pottery Barn children's home furnishings business, which ran a negative 4.8% comp in Q3 but a positive 12.1% on a 2-year basis and a positive 35.9% on a 3-year basis. We continue to see ongoing recovery in our in-stocks. And looking to the future, we have a strong pipeline of products at compelling values. The Williams-Sonoma brand ran a negative 1.5% comp in Q3, but a positive 6.1% on a 2-year and a positive 36.5% on a 3-year basis.  \n We continue to see that people are hosting and entertaining at home. And as such, we saw strength in entertaining areas. In Q3, we successfully kicked off the holiday season with our exclusive collaboration with celebrity chefs and author, Ina Garten. As part of this collaboration, Ina shared Thanksgiving tips for cooking and hosting the ultimate Thanksgiving dinner party. We also announced the exciting launch of a collaboration with renowned British heritage textile brand, William Morrison Company. Williams-Sonoma Home delivered another double-digit comp in Q3. We continue to see this business as an opportunity to deliver outsized growth by picking up market share from the limited luxury high-end home market. We're excited to launch an expanded furnishing line for the kitchen in Q4. As we look to the holiday season, we are prepared to meet the needs of our gift giving customers with compelling product offerings. \n Our stores are a competitive advantage, and they are stocked and our associates are ready to serve our customers. And finally, our emerging brands, including Rejuv and Mark and Graham, together, they ran a 7.8% comp this quarter. At Rejuvenation, we saw success in remodel categories related to kitchen and bathroom, including vanities, cabinet hardware and wall widening. And at Mark and Graham, wins were from the travel category, including luggage and travel accessories. We are proud of our third quarter results. but we are also aware that economic uncertainty is on the minds of consumers and investors alike.  \n During the third quarter, we experienced deceleration and choppiness in our demand, and it is hard to know where the economy is going or how long the uncertainty will last. Nonetheless, we are controlling what we can control and looking at opportunities to reduce costs without an impact to the customer experience. In fact, we believe that protecting service and innovation is key to outperforming our peers. \n As it relates to pricing, we continue to be committed to not running site-wide promotions as we did before the pandemic, but we will continue to mark down and clear overstocks. We are working with our vendors to reduce costs and pass on that value strategically to our customers. As for additional expenses, out of market and redundant shipping expenses and transportation costs have negatively impacted our gross margin. We continue to focus on these pressures and mitigation of these costs will be a significant benefit for us in the future, particularly in the second half of next year.  \n In summary, we are conscious that the home furnishings market may contract due to macro factors. If this happens, we believe we are uniquely positioned to take market share even if there is a downturn, and here's why. We built a company of loved brands with a shared platform of competitive differentiators that leads the industry, in-house design, digital first but not digital-only platform and our value. We have identified opportunities for growth through strategic initiatives like B2B, global end marketplace where we have the opportunity to disrupt. And finally, we have a culture of innovation and an experienced team who knows how to increase operational efficiencies and control costs while protecting service and driving new growth opportunities. \n Now I will turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the results in more detail in his first earnings call as CFO. Thanks, Peter. I'm going to let Jeff take that one. Sure. Thanks, Cristina, for the question. So you can clearly see, even by looking at the net comps, how strong Pottery Barn was. They've really been outperforming. The rest of the brands are kind of in a similar range. But remember, you got to look at more than just a 1 year. So when you look at West Elm on a 3-year, it's really, really strong and not as far off as you might think. \n So in terms of what we see in the demos, it's really -- I'm careful not to draw any big conclusions from it because the data is very sensitive. \n It looks like the only thing we can see is lower income being more affected. We don't see necessarily an age issue. We just see lower income being more hurt than higher income, which is consistent with what you'd probably expect out there. The good news is, in total, our core customer is pretty affluent. And we also know that a lot of this is just uncertainty because there's really nothing that's happened. They still have a lot of home appreciation, and we have more savings than they did before the pandemic. \n And so depending on what happens with the macro, this could be short. But if the macro gets worse and wage loss happens and the Fed continues to do what they are tasked to do, which is to stop growth, it could impact those customers more than it even has already. And so that's the reason we've been hesitant to give guidance out into '24. It's not that we're not confident in our business. It's that it's really hard to tell what's going to happen in the macro. If that was even just going to be as it is today, we would predict it. But it's changing so rapidly. And frankly, none of us are economists. \n But we do know that we have a lot of levers to pull. We have a lot of growth strategies that are working. We talked to you about B2B, marketplace, global. You can see in our brands when you go through them, some really exciting initiatives that are not just interesting, but they're really producing great results, big one being accessible home for Pottery Barn is something that we think we can do across all brands, frankly. \n So despite what could be an uncertain environment, we see ourselves in a really good place like we were, if it's going to be '08 or if it's even because it's going to be the pandemic, I think people are always worried about what happens. And we tend to come out much better than most. So that's my insight to what's happening out there and how it affects our customer and what our opportunities are. Thanks for the question. Go ahead, Jeff. Okay. Let me go backwards, forwards. So India. We just -- Jeff and I actually had a chance to go over the ourselves and see our stores. And at the time, West Elm were the only stores open. I'd tell you, they're as good as any store here in the United States. And our partners, the Reliance Group, are so good at digital and their marketing campaigns and the collaborators that we're working with. \n And we just walked away saying, we got to really spend more time than we even think on this because this is a market where it's enormous middle-class growing and a real penchant for high-quality design and goods. There's not much out there, so we're the first person out there with a full lifestyle suite of stuff. It reminds me of we first started Pottery Barn and brought furniture into our stores in the '90s. It's that big of an opportunity. So we're thrilled that we have a great partner. \n When you have a great partner in some of these very far away, more difficult to do business places, that's the way to go, in my opinion. I mean, Canada is a lot easier than India or in the Middle East, you have to have a partner. But at this point, there's nobody else that we're -- there's nowhere else that we're intending to open company-owned stores. There is an opportunity to do DTC Europe eventually when it's the right time to do that. This would not be the right time, in my opinion, to do that, but we could do that out of DTC -- DC and our platform that we have set up in the U.K. \n Okay. Starbucks. We're thrilled we finally can talk about this. We've been working closely with them for 3 years. We've been doing a lot with them. And what I can say that I think they're going to be okay with me saying is that they're great partners, and they've been very creative with us to allow us to do some designs for them to their specs, for their stores. And we've really built this partnership up. And I don't know if you've been to that flagship, I just got the pictures, it is spectacular. And so that's one of many that we've done. \n You'll start to notice and see us popping up, but I can't give you any sort of road map of scale on the Starbucks other than to say, it's one of the many great opportunities that we have. And we continue to really believe that B2B is going to be bigger than anyone expects. And then I'll pass it over to Jeff for digital growth. I'll just also add, Adrienne, that when you really think about last year, Thanksgiving to Christmas, this is the time when, unfortunately, for a lot of people, Thanksgiving or Christmas or both or Hanukkah got canceled, get togethers got canceled because of COVID. And so it wasn't the full open that it is now. \n We actually -- or I actually believe that retail is going to be the big winner of this holiday season. I think you can see people are out and about. And we're really stocked and ready to go. We are staffed. We have the goods in the stores already, and we put them there earlier so we can capture the sales. \n And honestly, we also have something we never had before pre-pandemic, which is our omni services. So of course, BOPIS is a thing everybody does. Shipping from store is not a thing that everybody does, but we have learned to get quite good at it. And then also shipping to the store is something we do. And we have just enabled, which I am quite excited about, shipping to any store in the company. So for example, if you buy online, PB Kids, but there's no PB Kids next to you, you can ship it to your local Williams-Sonoma store and you go pick it up. \n And we did this when we worked on dorm. And our dorm strategy this summer, we saw great results. And so I think this is going to be something that continues to build, not just because we don't have stores in every market, but because also it's a convenience play as people are back in the office more and also some people don't want to have to wait at home or UPS won't deliver to their ZIP code for that reason. \n This is a way to get around having to be there and wait for it to arrive at your porch. So this is yet another example of how we're taking omni, and it optimizes the retail inventory. So for example, if I'm wrong and retail isn't as good as I think it's going to be, this inventory can be shipped against DTC orders, which I think is a really exciting advantage that we have that particularly stores or brands that don't have retail don't have the opportunity to achieve. Jeff, do you want to go ahead with B2B? Jeff, why don't you take the second piece of the question? Thanks, Max. I'm giving that to Jeff, too. The other piece of this is we are starting to see our vendors reduce their pricing to us. And I'm not just talking about shipping, I'm talking about product vendors. And that is a pretty sizable thing as you think about the future. In some cases, it's going to be important to pass along part of that to the consumer because everybody had to take a price increase. And when it comes down, we want to make sure that we have the best value out there. \n So we're always scrubbing to see how's our design vis-a-vis the competition. How's our quality, how's our sustainability problems and how is our price. And so as we get better prices from our vendors, which we're already starting to see, there will be some that are passed along to the consumers so that we can really continue to grab market share because we're going to offer an even better value. And so there are -- in addition to just the cost being normalized, I think there's some real opportunities as you think about the back half of next year and beyond to really improve the margin from here. Okay. Oliver, it's Laura. Remember, the 16.9% is the net comp not a demand comp. It's driven by AUR and the resulting traffic fill from the previous sales. As we look at demand comp -- yes, as we look at demand comps now, at retail, our traffic is better than our competition, better than the industry, which is really exciting. And you all know Christmas is the -- and the holidays is the time that people love to come into our stores. And I've said before, you salivate just thinking about walking into a Williams-Sonoma store. And so we're really focused on conversion, and we have the traffic. So that's why I tend to be quite optimistic that retail is going to be -- the retailers, for us at least, is going to continue to overdeliver in the short term as we're comping the pandemic not completely out of the house that we were in last year. Yes. So it's funny, the macro environment or -- no the competitive environment has always been promotional. When you really go back and you think about -- even before all these new start-ups came about, there was Macy's always in the home business and a lot of other big players. And then Amazon came along and Wayfair. They've always been after price first. What we do versus them is very different in that we're designing our own goods. And we've been doing it for a lot of years. And so we tend to be first with new trends and able to bring out finishes that others can't replicate even when they try to copy us, they can't replicate. And so when you actually go and look at the difference between our furniture or even our tabletop or any of the categories versus theirs, you're going to see a big difference in quality and the resulting price even with their markdowns, our value is better.\n We keep looking at that, looking at whether it's the sofa, the coffee table, the rug. I mean, when you take a product down like-for-like and you really look at it in person, look at the price, I feel very good about where we sit. There's always a few exceptions. There's always a few opening price points that I wish were sharper. Those are -- the opening price points are the place that I want to get back to be more competitive as we were pre pandemic. Those are the areas where I think everybody got a little too high. But in total, I really don't think it's a competitive pricing issue because it's hard to match our goods against anyone else's goods. Now in terms of inventory in the channel, Bed Bath & Beyond has a ton of inventory that they're pressing and going to continue to press at deep markdowns. \n Again, different products. But will that hurt everybody on the fringes? That one might be the biggest factor going. But the Wayfair and the Amazon, those guys are the biggest out there, but it's just -- it's a very different business. So you might buy one thing from them for your garage or something, but you're not going to furnish your living room, your full bedroom from some of those brands. Our customer wouldn't anyway because there are -- what they're looking for is a much higher quality level and design sensibility. And they want someone to help them put it together. \n So those are, I think, the factors at play, and we just have to make sure that we're not distracted by a short-term blip and that we are all focused on what we've built here and continuing to feed it, which means innovation, innovation and product and service and continuing to press forward when everyone else is doing the duck and cover. And that's the thing. I mean it's exciting, even though it's a different hand than we expect it to be dealt right now. It's an exciting time to really think about it offensively. And what's the company that we want to look like and again, make improvements to. If this is a recession, what are we going to look like on the other side of it. And I think when you saw us come out of '08, we were stronger and we're much stronger coming out of the pandemic. And whatever this is going to be, I would say the same thing, we're going to be much stronger coming out of this, too. Yes. I mean I just think this is a people are nervous sort of situation. As I said earlier, Lowe's, Home Depot, they're really very optimistic. I'm sure everybody listened to their calls and people still love their homes. And the sentiment is still I want a nicer home. I want a second home. I want a bigger home. Now they're not going to buy one because nobody wants to buy right now. That doesn't mean that you don't still love your home, you don't want to still spend money on it. And so the renovation, a lot of those renovation projects are still lagging from the pandemic when you couldn't even get a refrigerator, right? You still can't get a refrigerator. And so you're not done with your kitchen, so you're not fishing your kitchen yet. So it's interesting that those projects are still lagging, and there's still, there should be, in my opinion, there should be still a big upside as they finish those projects and then they go to spruce up the furnishings. \n Because if you spend a lot of money on your new bathrooms and your new kitchen, which are usually where people go first, generally speaking, you buy furniture next. So it should be a very positive thing for us. What I think is happening is, right now is more fear than reality, and we'll see what happens and which way that goes. But as I said earlier, our customers are still in really good economic shape. They're just -- I think they're taking a small pause for a minute as everyone's been talking about. Yes. Thank you all for joining us. I want to wish you a very happy holiday season and look forward to talking to you next year."

            "name": "Jeff Howie",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and hello, everyone. I am so pleased to join you today for my first earnings call in my new role as Chief Financial Officer. While I'm relatively new to this particular role, I'm a 20-year member of the Williams-Sonoma leadership team. I come into this role with deep knowledge and experience across our brands, operations and financials. I look forward to applying my breadth and depth of experience to drive continued strong results. \n Diving into our third quarter results. We delivered another quarter of record revenues and earnings in a challenging environment. Our top line results illustrate our ability to gain market share. Our bottom line results demonstrate the power of our operating model to sustain merchandise margins and control SG&A expenses.  \n Net revenues grew to $2.2 billion, with comparable brand revenue growth at 8.1% for a 2-year comp of 25% and a 3-year comp of almost 50%. Our revenue growth was driven by strong order fulfillment, ongoing momentum in our growth initiatives and our continued ability to take market share, even as we experienced inconsistent demand within our portfolio of brands and across the quarter. Both channels continued to experience strong growth, with retail at a 16.9% comp and e-commerce at a 4.4% comp.  \n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin was 41.5%, 220 basis points below last year and in line with our expectations. We sustained strong merchandise margins that were flat year-over-year. We remain committed to our decision to no longer offer site-wide promotions and preserve the pricing integrity our proprietary, differentiated product commands. \n The strength of these merchandise margins is particularly impressive given we absorbed significant cost increases from our vendors and ocean carriers, including higher demurrage and detention charges. As expected, the gross margin decline was driven by higher outbound shipping costs. This is due to our increased furniture mix, higher back order fulfillment and incremental freight costs. We also incurred higher costs to best serve our customers by shipping from out-of-market distribution centers and in some cases, shipping multiple times for multiunit orders, which typically would have been fulfilled in a single shipment.  \n Occupancy costs at 9.2% of net revenues were 30 basis points above last year, with occupancy dollars increasing 10.5% to approximately $202 million. Our ongoing retail store optimization initiative partially offset incremental costs from our new distribution centers on both the East and West Coast. These new distribution centers will support our long-term growth, improve service time for our customers and drive cost efficiencies over time. \n Our SG&A rate continues to be at historic lows at 26%, leveraging 150 basis points over last year, driven by advertising and employment leverage. Our advertising leverage reflects the agile, performance-driven proficiency of our marketing team, our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform allow us to test, learn and scale, which is a unique competitive advantage.  \n Our SG&A leverage also reflects our culture of financial discipline, where we consistently challenge all expenses for return on investment and drive operational efficiency throughout the company. On the bottom line, we delivered another record quarter of earnings. Q3 operating income grew 2% to $340 million, and we delivered strong operating margin at 15.5%, only 80 basis points below last year despite significant headwinds and cost pressures. Our diluted earnings per share of $3.72, was up 12% from last year's record third quarter earnings per share of $3.32.  \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $113 million, with no debt outstanding and year-to-date operating cash flow of $588 million. That enabled us to fund the operations of the business and expand our capital investments to support our long-term growth. In addition, year-to-date, we have returned excess cash of over $1 billion to shareholders through $165 million in dividends and $840 million in share repurchases.  \n These decisions reflect our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders. And with our strong and disciplined balance sheet, combined with our expected free cash flow, we have flexibility to continue to invest in the growth of the business and opportunistically invest in our own stock and drive long-term shareholder returns.  \n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories, which include in transit, were $1.688 billion, increasing 33% over our reduced level of last year. Inventory on hand increased 34% over last year, but was up only 11% to 2019 versus sales up 52% over the same time. In the quarter, back order levels decreased but remained well above historical levels. We are working hard to get these goods in to fulfill our customer orders but continue to anticipate our backorder levels will remain elevated in the first half of '23. \n Summarizing our Q3 results, we are proud to have delivered another quarter of record revenues and earnings. I would like to thank all our associates for their hard work and dedication in driving these great results. Now turning to our expectations for the remainder of the year and beyond. We acknowledge that the near-term macroeconomic picture remains uncertain, with conflicting economic signals surrounding consumer spending trends, decade high inflation and Federal Reserve monetary policy, intentionally moderating economic demand.  \n Additionally, our trends have been increasingly inconsistent and less predictable. This combination of conflicting economic signals and inconsistent trends makes our guidance unusually difficult to predict. However, we remain confident in our ability to operate in any environment, and are, therefore, reiterating our fiscal year '22 guidance of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth with operating margins relatively in line with fiscal year '21.  \n Our outlook is grounded in 3 factors. First, we are currently in the early stages of our upcoming holiday seasonal rent with the biggest weeks yet to come. Second, our Q3 quarter demand trends support a wide range of outcomes. And third, the ongoing improvement we see in fulfillment of our customer order backlog. From a profitability perspective, as we said in our last call,  we continue to expect cost pressures to persist for the balance of fiscal year '22 and into the first half of '23, primarily across our supply chain. \n These headwinds include our incremental distribution centers, higher product and freight costs and our efforts to best serve our customers by delivering products as timely as possible. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. In fiscal year '22, we expect capital expenditures will be approximately $350 million. We plan to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders through quarterly dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. \n While the near term may be uncertain, the current management team has successfully navigated challenging environments before, including the 2008 great financial crisis and the 2020 global pandemic. We know the levers to pull, and we have already taken steps to reduce cost and inventory to mitigate downside risk. \n Given the increased macro uncertainty, we will not be reiterating or updating our fiscal year '24 guidance at this time. We will be providing guidance for fiscal year '23 and beyond at our next call. We remain confident in the long-term fundamentals of our business. Our confidence remains rooted in our ability to take market share in the fractured home furnishings industry. The strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet.  \n And having been here before, we see opportunity to take an offensive stance in a challenging macro environment. In summary, we are very proud of our results. We continue to deliver for our customers, our associates and our shareholders. And now I'd like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Peter, when you think about inventory, I really think it's tough to look at it on a 1-year basis. I know we're up 33%. But if you think about this time last year, we're at our most aggressive inventory levels because if you think back to last year, that's when Southeast Asia was really closed, and we were still seeing the residual impacts of the COVID closures from India and China. So we're at our lowest inventory level at that point. \n We really like to look at it on a 3-year basis, where our 3-year on-hand inventory is up 12% versus our sales up 52% over the same time period. How we're thinking about it is we're making progress, but there's still a lot more work to do. Our backlog remains at historically high levels, and we're working hard to get our composition right as well as our location of our inventory to service our customer best. We anticipate our inventory levels and our back orders to gradually improve through Q4 and in the first half of '23. Thanks, Peter. I think that's a great question, and it's really how we're looking at it. So we have tremendous headwinds right now, particularly on our gross margin from higher product costs, higher inbound ocean costs. And as you mentioned, higher out-of-market costs as well as shipping multiple shipments to the same customer for the same order when we should really be shipping it once. That right now for the Q4 and into the first half of '23 is a headwind, and it will be impacting our margin. But we're pretty optimistic as we look to the back half of '23 and into '24. This is going to be a substantial tailwind and give us a lot of room to sustain our margins. Steve, let's take your demand question first. So in terms of the cadence across Q3, it was incredibly inconsistent and choppy as we described, and that's both across our portfolio of brands in the quarter. We started the quarter off relatively strong, mid-single-digit comps, as we talked about in the Q2 call. And then we saw it really trail off after Labor Day once the Fed announced our fourth rate hike. And even if you look at it, whether it's 1 year, 2 year or 3 years, it was just inconsistent. One year decelerated across the quarter, 2 year was up and down and 3 year actually accelerated across the quarter. So it's tough to get a read on it, and then we just described it as inconsistent and choppy. But what we're pretty confident about is even in this choppy environment, we continue to take market share.  \n Regarding the backlog, your second question. We still have more work to do, like I mentioned in the previous question. There's a lot of work left to do to deliver to our customers. The backlog remains sizable. And for us, some of the challenges are getting it in the right location and in the right composition so we can complete a multiline order for a customer. So we -- again, we think it's going to take us through Q4 and in the first half to really normalize that level of activity. Sure, Cristina, we have quite a few levers, particularly on our SG&A line, where advertising, we can definitely adjust as we go. And the nice thing here is we have our own hands on the keyboards with our in-house marketing team who's really agile and performance driven. We also have opportunities on employment, which, of course, leverage with sales with most of our employment in our distribution centers and stores and call centers. And then there's a number of other cost efficiencies we can drive throughout our operations to continue to leverage our SG&A to help our operating margin. Sure. Adrienne, we're proud of both of our channels, and they both really did a great job this past quarter and delivered strong results. Retail was up 15.9%. And to get to your question, B2C delivered a 4.4% comp and was sequentially in line with our Q2 results coming about 65% of the total. Long term, we continue to see e-comm growing to 70% of revenues but both channels remain part of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, and we're happy to serve the customer in every channel they want to shop in. Sure. We see our track on B2B just continuing to propel forward, and we are on track to hit the $1 billion this year. The demand pipeline through our projects and our major partners continues to be strong, and we're very confident in our ability to get there. \n And from a long-term standpoint, it is such a fractured market, total addressable market, $80 billion. And we think we have a really compelling proposition with our portfolio of brands, our in-house design, our global sourcing capabilities to really capture this. And we're seeing a lot of promising signs out there in terms of pent-up demand for renovations in hotels and restaurants. And we think it's quite a great opportunity for us. Could you repeat your second question, Anthony? We're seeing -- we're definitely seeing more promotions in the environment as the economy softens. I think a lot of retailers have been thinking -- have been talking about that this week. Our approach has been very consistent in terms of the level of promotions that we've been doing. \n And plus, I want to reiterate that we remain committed to not offering site-wide promotions in our brands, and we will do whatever it takes to continue to not do that. We think that our in-house design proprietary product really resonates with the customer because of its differentiation and commands its own pricing power, and we're seeing that in our results. All right. Thanks, Max. I think all of them are heavy pressures on our gross margin, as we've been communicating. There's the product costs, which have been with us all year as part of inflation. There's the ocean costs, which, although we see ocean costs overall coming down, we still have the cost in our balance sheet and need to sell through that higher cost inventory. \n Our shipping costs domestically have been high, as we talked about because of out of market and shipping multiple times a customer. As I said in the answer to the first question, we still have quite a bit of work to do to get our inventory in the right composition as well as the right location to properly service our customer and work on this backlog we have. \n So we think it will be -- continue to be a headwind for Q4 and into the first half of '23. The thing I'm really optimistic about is when we turn the corner, when we start to look at the back half of '23 and into '24, it's going to be a tremendous tailwind. And I'm optimistic that we can really sustain our margins when I think about all the cost pressures we've been under and still delivered the results we're delivering today. That's a great question, Oliver. I think that the B2B business will hold up stronger potentially in a soft macro environment than the consumer. If you think about the dynamics of the past couple of years, the consumer market took off during the pandemic as people were home and they started shopping. And now that's possibly trailing off a little bit with the Fed's monetary actions and the macroeconomic environment. \n B2B on the other hand, a lot of those verticals they were shut down for several quarters and even over a year. And there was a big backlog of work and renovation work and projects that weren't done. And all of that pipeline of those -- that pent-up demand and deferred projects is really coming online now. We're seeing it in the RFPs we have out, talking to our customers in B2B. And when I attend trade shows, there's just a general energy about the amount of projects that are out there. Funded projects, a lot of renovations. There was a great article in the Wall Street Journal, I think it was last week and the week before, talking about the hotel experience and how there's just a dearth of great hotels. A lot of them need to be updated and renovated. And that just speaks well to our opportunity with B2B. So in sum, it can really be countercyclical if there is a macroeconomic downturn. A couple of things there, Chuck. So first of all, B2B is slightly accretive to our op margin. And really, the dynamic there is you don't have the overhead of some of the retail and then not as much advertising costs. So it does lend some accretion from that standpoint. But I think when you think about the costs that are hitting the P&L, the second part of your question is, I think we have to think about that really in 2 phases. The first is the near term, which is Q4 and the first half of '23, where we're seeing the higher product cost, a higher inbound shipping costs and all of our additional costs as we work through our backlog. That will become a tailwind for us. As we turn the corner and head in the back half of '23 and '24, I think that in and of itself will support our margins long term. And then B2B will really just be the icing on the cake on top of it. Thanks, Seth. We don't guide specific line items like that, but we are giving you a guidance on the overall direction of gross margin, with March margin a sone component of that. And we do see headwinds there in Q4 and in the first half of '23 for all the reasons that we've talked about, the product cost, the ocean costs and then our own challenges with getting through our backlog with out-of-market shipments and multiple shipments to customers. And again, I think that, that becomes a huge tailwind. As we look to the back half of '23 and '24, that gives us optimism from the long-term sustainability of our margins. I think one thing to think about with our inventory that's different from, say, an apparel retailer, fashion retailers, we have a much higher penetration of the core. So we don't have that seasonal pressure to move like other companies do that are in the retail industry. And from a long-term standpoint, again, to the back half of '23 and into '24 these headwinds we're experiencing really become tailwinds, and that's where we see opportunity on the margin from a long-term standpoint. Okay. Let's start with the Q4 implied sales. And yes, it's a wide range. As I spoke to in my prepared remarks, we saw a tremendous amount of choppiness in Q3. The result of that choppiness is there's a wide range of estimates. But our guidance is a blend of those ranges of estimates and reflects our best estimate as what we see potentially happen in Q4. As a result -- as it relates to the structural margin, there's been quite a bit of change within the structural margin. And here, I think there's a lot to talk about in terms of how we really improved our operating model. The first one is the impact of elimination of site-wide promotions. That is really buttressing our merchandise margins and giving us a lot of opportunity there to continue to sustain that. I think it speaks to something we really learned and sort of maybe relearned in the pandemic is that our proprietary differentiated product that our in-house design produced really commands its own price in the marketplace. \n And that product really resonates with the customer, and they're really willing to pay for it. The second thing is, throughout the pandemic, we really, number one, improved the profitability of our retail stores and as mix has shifted to e-commerce, which by nature is more profitable for us. So a combination of those different factors really helps us with sustaining the margin. And then over the long term, we see additional opportunity to take costs and drive efficiency throughout our P&L."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Q2 2022 Conference Call.  \n [Operator Instructions] \n Today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJeremy Brooks: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. \n I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including guidance for fiscal '22 and our long-term outlook. Although we believe these statements reflect our best estimate and all available information, we cannot make any assurances that these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call. \n Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Those measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, along with an explanation of how and why we use those measures, appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier today. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our periodic and annual filings with the SEC. The call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our Investor Relations website.  \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer. \nLaura Alber: Thanks, Jeremy. Good afternoon, everyone. \n I'm excited to share our second quarter earnings today. Q2 marked another quarter of strong performance, delivering an 11.3% comp on the top line and earnings growth of over 19% to $3.87 per share. These impressive results reflect the strength of our multi-brand portfolio, the success of our growth initiatives and the ongoing execution of the team. We continue to demonstrate our ability to perform by offering high-quality, differentiated and sustainable products that our customers know and love. \n Our performance was driven by 3 factors: strong order fulfillment, positive demand comps and our successful continued elimination of site-wide promotions. I'm very proud of this performance, especially given the macroeconomic backdrop and the strong compares we are up against, all while delivering an impressive 41.1% comp on a 2-year basis. And it is this continued outperformance that gives us the confidence to reiterate our 2022 guidance and longer-term outlook today. \n Our positioning in the industry is a competitive strength. Our industry is large and fragmented with more than half of sales from small brick-and-mortar retailers that do not have sophisticated e-commerce capabilities. And with the arrival of the millennial generation for the household creation stage, this is a huge opportunity for ongoing market share gains for us, while the rest of the players try to catch up. \n At the same time, our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy provides a competitive edge in scaling the business into the future compared to both retail and marketplace only players. All of this creates an environment that is ripe for disruption and for us to take market share. \n We continue to win because of our key differentiators, which include our in-house design capabilities with inspirational, exclusive, sustainable and high-quality products at compelling price points. Our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy and our values rooted in sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion, which are becoming even more fundamental to purchasing decisions for many customers. These differentiators set us apart as a leader in the industry. \n And now I want to highlight one of our opportunities, business to business. Our B2B business had another terrific quarter driving a 32% increase in demand in Q2 and it is well on track to becoming a $1 billion business this year. We continue to grow in this space by focusing on diversifying our product pipeline across a range of industry verticals. \n In sports and entertainment, we are excited to service our first collegiate sports facility at San Diego State New Snapdragon Stadium. In hospitality, we continue to gain market share through renovations and new builds, leveraging our diverse fleet of brands. And in our commercial office pipeline, we are encouraged to see the momentum continue as companies return to the office and workspaces are reimagined. \n To drive the B2B growth, we are focused on the continued development of our sales team and expansion of our contract-grade product assortment. We remain optimistic and excited about the potential of this business as there is no one else providing the full suite of services and offerings that we do. \n Moving to sustainability. We are thrilled to announce the recent publication of our 2021 impact report highlighting the progress and fulfillment of our industry-leading ESG goals. We remain committed to prioritizing sustainability, diversity, philanthropy and worker well-being as key differentiators for our business. In the report, we detailed progress on our long-standing commitment, including responsibly sourced cotton and wood, waste diversion and increased fair trade premium. We are also one of the first home furnishing brands to set a science-based target for reducing our emissions across our company, and we have made progress decreasing our carbon intensity. \n Now I'd like to talk about our global business. We continue to believe that global expansion represents a sizable opportunity, and we are focused on a multichannel strategy in key markets. In Q2, we continued building momentum with our franchise partnerships. Our presence in Mexico continues to drive growth, and we launched the Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids websites in India with stores beginning in Q3 of this year and further expansion into 2023. And in our company-owned business in Canada, we continue to expand our family of brands with the launch of our Pottery Barn Teen website and the relaunches of Williams-Sonoma West Elm in our Pottery Barn Kids website in the market, all with great customer response. \n Before we get to the strong results of the brand, I want to update you on the supply chain. Unfortunately, this is an area where we continue to see significant disruption, inefficiencies and cost pressures. Although our in-stock position has improved, we have still room to improve our on-time shipments to customers. Also, we continue to incur higher distribution center costs to support our growth as well as higher ocean freight. And we are still incurring added costs to ship out of market and multiple shipments to service our customers. We expect this pressure will continue in the second half of this year and the first half of next. This is reflected in our guidance and our outlook. \n Now let's turn to the performance of our brands. Pottery Barn delivered another extremely strong quarter with a 21.5% comp or 51.1% on a 2-year basis. All channels and product divisions contributed to driving incremental demand. Our high-quality proprietary furniture business continues to lead the growth. \n Pottery Barn continues to innovate with product and incremental growth initiatives. For example, in July, Pottery Barn launched the Accessible Home, an exciting new concept designed to enhance the quality of life at home with aging in-place community and people living with disabilities and injury. Our customers have responded enthusiastically about our efforts to address this underserved market, and we believe this could be a significant opportunity across our portfolio of brands. \n Moving to West Elm. West Elm delivered a 6.1% comp in the second quarter on top of 51.1% last year or 57.2% on a 2-year basis. We're excited about our new businesses in kids and bath, which continue to drive outsized growth for the brand. And we launched our dedicated B2B e-commerce experience and expanded assortment there. \n Looking forward to Q3, we are focused on 3 key areas of growth at West Elm. One, improving furniture in-stocks and lead time reductions; two, expanding our depth in seasonal decorating, hosting and entertainment categories; and three, launching innovative collaborations across the brand. And with the ongoing success of our strategic initiatives, we remain confident in our ability to drive West Elm to become a $3 billion brand. \n Now I'd like to update you on our Pottery Barn children's home furnishing business, which delivered a sequentially stronger quarter with a 5.3% comp in Q2. During the quarter, we benefited from improving inventory receipts out of Vietnam, which filed factory closures that occurred in the back half of 2021. Also, we successfully launched our biggest ever back-to-school collection, and we enabled functionality to ship dorm products in any store in any brand in our fleet across the country. Early results also indicate the seasonal holiday business will be a success given the early positive reaction to Halloween. \n In the Williams-Sonoma brand, I want to highlight our recently announced change in leadership. Felix Carbullido, previously our Chief Marketing Officer, has assumed the role of President of the Williams-Sonoma brand. Felix brings incredible talent to the position through his experience in strategy and operations in addition to a breadth of merchandising, e-commerce and marketing expertise. Felix is only 3 weeks into the role, but sees clear opportunities for the brand, particularly in key areas, including: one, leaning further into the brand's heritage of inspiring those who love to cook at home with relevant and useful storytelling across all channels; two, the importance of offering the best product and ensuring customers can rely on Williams-Sonoma to be in stock across the key essentials of a great home kitchen. And finally, there are white space opportunities not only in our core offering, but also in new categories that have clear adjacencies to the kitchen. \n In Q2, Williams-Sonoma came in at a positive 0.5% comp with accelerating comps throughout the quarter. This was driven by an improved in-stock position, newness in the assortment as well as higher conversion on the site driven by our ongoing e-commerce initiatives that improved imagery and shop path. In stock continues to improve, and we believe we will see further recovery in the back half. \n As part of the Williams-Sonoma brand, our Williams-Sonoma Home business, we had a high double-digit comp again this quarter and continues to be an opportunity. Given the strength of the Williams-Sonoma brand name, our expertise in the furniture category and the clear opportunity in the high-end home market, we believe that Williams-Sonoma Home is destined to be a product leader of distinctive design-led, high-quality home furnishings. \n In summary, we are proud of our performance and we remain committed to executing on our growth initiatives and operational improvements to drive market share gains and strong long-term financial returns. I want to thank our customers, our employees and our shareholders. We are committed to delivering for all of you. \n And with that, I'd like to turn the call to Julie to go through all the financials in more detail. \nJulie Whalen: Thank you, Laura, and hello, everyone. \n We had another outstanding quarter with revenues, operating margin and earnings all exceeding expectations. Our performance and execution remains strong. Our comps outperformed due to positive and healthy demand comps and accelerating order fulfillment. Our growth strategy has continued to build momentum and our operating margin continued to grow above expectations due to running a more regular priced business and another quarter of advertising and employment leverage. These factors enabled us to outperform on both the top and bottom line with double-digit comps and another quarter of operating margin expansion. Our results this quarter further validate that we are one of the best positioned to succeed in the short and long term with strong profitable growth. \n Moving to our second quarter results in more detail. Net revenues grew to $2.1 billion with comparable brand revenue growth at 11.3% on top of 29.8% last year for a 2-year stack of 41.1%. This includes double-digit growth in both channels. In retail, we delivered an 11.4% comp despite retail traffic down almost 19% in 2019. And in e-commerce, we delivered an 11.3% comp and grew our e-commerce penetration 60 basis points year-over-year to 65.4%. \n Moving down the income statement. Our gross margin continued to hold near historic highs at 43.5%, which was 60 basis points below last year's record Q2. Our merchandise margins remained strong with another consecutive quarter of merchandise margin expansion year-over-year as we continue to preserve our pricing integrity by remaining committed to our decision to no longer offer site-wide promotions. The gross margin decline was driven by higher freight costs from our strong furniture demand, higher back order fulfillment and global supply chain disruptions, driving freight rates higher for all. \n We also incurred incremental freight costs in order to best serve our customers, to get product to them timely by shipping from out-of-market distribution centers and in some cases, shipping multiple times for multiunit orders, which typically would have been done in a single shipment. \n Occupancy costs at 9% of net revenues were flat to last year, with occupancy dollars increasing 9.6% to approximately $193 million, which includes incremental costs from our new distribution centers on both the East and West Coast. These new distribution centers will allow us to support our ongoing growth, optimize service times for our customers and drive efficiencies in cost over time. And given our ongoing retail real estate optimization efforts, we were pleased that we were able to help mitigate these incremental costs and hold the occupancy rate flat. \n Our SG&A rate continues to be at a historical low at 26.4%, leveraging 90 basis points over last year, driven by advertising and employment leverage from our strong topline performance and ongoing operational efficiency. Across the company, we continue to operate with a disciplined approach, challenging all expenditures to maximize the return from our spend. \n These results once again led to a record quarter of earnings with our most profitable Q2 ever, including operating income growth of 12% to $366 million, and an operating margin at 17.1%, expanding 40 basis points over last year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.87, up 19.4% from last year's record second quarter earnings per share of $3.24. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $125 million with no debt outstanding and year-to-date operating cash flow of $384 million. This year-to-date cash flow allowed us to fund the operations of the business and to almost double our capital investments to support our growth. In addition, we returned excess cash year-to-date of almost $880 million to shareholders, through $113 million in dividends and $766 million in share repurchases, a significant increase over last year at this time. These elevated share repurchase levels reflect the confidence we have in the long-term strength of our business and demonstrate our commitment to maximizing shareholder returns. \n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories, which include in-transit inventory, were $1.542 billion, increasing 32% over our reduced levels last year. Inventory on hand increased 28% over last year, but was only up 1% to 2019 versus sales up 56% over the same time frame. In the quarter, back order levels decreased. However, they continue to be too high in total. We are working hard to get these goods in to fulfill our customer orders. We believe that we will be able to return to normalized back order levels next year. \n Turning to our expectations for the remainder of the year and beyond. We are reiterating our fiscal year '22 and long-term financial outlook of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth, growing revenues to $10 billion by 2024 with operating margins relatively in line with fiscal year 2021. Our reiteration of our outlook simply acknowledges that the economic backdrop remains uncertain with currently unknown outcomes surrounding spending trends, inflation, interest rates, supply chain pressures and global unrest. The fundamentals of our business remains strong, evidenced by our first half outperformance and the accelerating demand comps we are seeing as we enter the third quarter. \n Our confidence to achieve our revenue outlook is rooted in 3 tangible drivers. Our year-to-date trends, which continue to outpace the industry and reflect market share gains, our continued improvement in our inventory receipts expected through the back half, which will enable us to fill prior orders and lower our elevated back order levels and our ongoing strength in our growth initiatives, which continue to build momentum. \n From a profitability perspective, we expect cost pressures to continue in the back half and into the beginning of 2023, particularly across our supply chain, from the incremental distribution centers and related costs to support our growth plus higher ocean freight and other freight-related costs resulting from the global supply chain disruptions and our efforts to best serve our customers by delivering product to them as timely as possible. \n Despite these pressures, we remain confident in our ability to achieve fiscal year operating margins relatively in line with our fiscal year '21 rate at 17.7%, which was an all-time high, given our strong start to the year and our culture of strong financial discipline. \n In summary, we are very proud of the results we continue to deliver for our customers, associates and shareholders. These results further validate our ability to deliver sustainable strong growth and profitability. As we continue to navigate the dynamic changes in the macro environment, we are confident that our strong foundation of differentiators and our operating model as well as the momentum of our growth initiatives will continue to keep us ahead of the competition. And this, combined with an environment where consumers are shifting increasingly online and are prioritizing value and sustainability in their purchases now more than ever, leave us uniquely positioned to continue to take market share and profitably. \n Finally, I would like to thank all our associates for their hard work and relentlessness in driving these great results. \n I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] \n We'll take our first question from Max Rakhlenko with Cowen and Company. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: Great. Nice job in the quarter. So first, just on topline, can you share what demand was in the quarter and then just provide any more color on early 3Q trends? And then just bigger picture, what do you attribute the outperformance to and ways that you can play offense from here as the environment does get tougher? \nJulie Whalen: Max, it's Julie. So as we said in our prepared remarks, our demand comps remained positive and healthy and, in fact, accelerated as we entered into the third quarter. They are lower than our double-digit net comps. We had alluded to that in our last call that we had seen the demand comps start to moderate. But they are nothing like what we've heard others indicate or report. And so we're pleased to see that we were able to deliver accelerated comps this quarter both driven by healthy demand and our accelerating net bill, and we're seeing both of those accelerate into the third quarter. \nLaura Alber: And Max, to your question about why we're winning, and how come we're outperforming. First of all, thank you for the great question. We think it's a couple of reasons. First, we've said over and over what our key differentiators are and they're truly setting us apart. Let me just talk about the first one first in more detail than I have in the past. \n We talk about in-house design, which allows us to have proprietary products that is of high quality and at the best value. It also happens to be sustainable. But it also allows us to innovate and bring in collections that no one else has and see the white space. This culture of innovation that we have is driving a lot of the great wins for our business. And truly, I don't believe we have these results have we not continued to deliver these important points. And each one is a seed that grows and some into very large brands. But in Pottery Barn, Example A is accessible home, really obvious and sizable business opportunity. We just got started. They also have in Pottery Barn a bunch of great collaborations that they've been launching my favorite one with Hailey Bieber, which is really fun if you want to check that one out. \n On Pottery Barn Kids has always had really wonderful, exciting collaborations in different licenses that kids love from Beatrix Potter, Disney to Emily Meritt, Harry Potter, and those continue to drive relevancy for the brand and delight the trial. \n For West Elm, in terms of innovation, we've talked about B2B, we've talked about kids and bath. But we also had some collaborations that really are working there like just Sarah Sherman Samuel. I don't know if you've had a chance to see that that's also in -- it's in Pottery Barn kids too. And this has really, really set us apart and gotten us more attention on our kids growth in our West Elm business. And we're still really low awareness that we even have a West Elm kids business. \n So those are just some of the examples when we say innovation, we say that it's a differentiator that we design our own products. It's this culture of innovation that really, I think, is what's making us outperform. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: Got it. That's very helpful. And then just on promotions, bigger picture. Can you speak to the strategies ahead? We've seen the debt increase, but maybe not suppressed, and you obviously haven't returned site-wide promos. So just ahead, what should we expect from you? And I guess, ultimately, would you be willing to leave some topline on the table to maintain margins even if the industry does get very promotional in some of the quarters ahead? \nLaura Alber: Yes. So first of all, the industry is already very promotional, particularly with the big box retailers faltering. There's a lot that they're flushing through, and that's been going on for more than just a couple of weeks here, you've been watching this happen most of this year. \n I believe, Julie, you did detail the difference between our MMU and our... \nJulie Whalen: Not financially, but yes, MMU has expanded. And the delta is on our gross margin is simply just the shipping cost. But the MMU still remains strong. It's another quarter of expansion that we're seeing. And so even with the promotional environment, we're still able to drive that. \nLaura Alber: I think that's the key point that I want to make sure that no one confuses when they just do the quick read of the gross margin that you understand where it came from and where it didn't come from. We are committed to the elimination of site-wide promos. We believe this is absolutely the healthiest way to run our business for long-term success. And it's a function of the products that we sell that have great design, as I said, and great quality and are sustainable. And as long as we continue to maintain that value equation in the product and the innovation, I believe we're really equipped to maintain this posture because no one else has the same product out there in the market.\n That said, this commitment doesn't mean that we're not going to use markdowns to manage our inventory. We are very aggressive about managing our inventories and markdowns are part of any retail business, and we will take markdowns particularly in seasonal products and slow-moving SKUs, but we have not expanded the amount of promotions that we're running. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez with Telsey Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernandez: Congratulations on another good quarter. I wanted to ask about inventory receipts for the back half. I mean inventory has been tight, but it seems like it's improving. So do you expect better inventory flow in the second half of the year as what you've seen so far in the first half? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I mean I would say we do. We certainly expect it to improve as we move throughout the back half. I think what's important to remember is that, I mean, first of all, as far as our growth to date, it's 32%, but it's still 1% on a 3-year basis versus 56% up on sales. And we are dealing with a lot of -- we're shifting more to furniture and bigger cube items, and we're dealing with inventory coming in both to fill back orders but also to fill our current demand. And so that creates a lot of inventory coming in at the same time. And yet at the same time, we still need to get more inventory in to be in stock. And we still, as Laura mentioned, need to be thoughtful about the inventory that's aging to be able to get it pushed out. So we have more room in the distribution center. So as we move to the back half, we do expect our inventory levels to get better but we'll still have elevated backorder levels into the first half of 2023. \nLaura Alber: Yes. I think just to add to that, the good news is as we've gotten back in stock, which is really important to our customers, we have seen backorder crate rates come down. Back order levels have decreased even though they are still too high. Our cancel rates have moderated. And also just another thing under the covers is that, we have industry-leading lead times in our domestic in-house upholstery. Nobody else is shipping custom upholstery faster than we are. And as much as our on-time shipments are not where we want to be, we are extremely focused on getting back in stock and every day working to serve our customers the best we can in this environment. And I do believe as we go through the balance of this year and next -- early next, we should be in a much better position. \nCristina Fernandez: And then just a quick follow-up. On the merchandise margin, it seems like promotions are say, flattish year-over-year. So what are the other drivers that are allowing you to expand the operator -- the merchandise margin? \nLaura Alber: That's an interesting question without giving too much competitive information away. We -- I think you know that we have taken some price raises. We've been very selective. We don't pass those costs on unilaterally to our customers. We look to see where we're underpriced and where we can still offer value to this customer. And at this point, we are sort of plateauing on raising our prices. We're also starting to see that certain raw materials and fuel has come down in price. So over time, honestly, this should allow us to get price reductions from our vendor partners that we -- that could help our margins, and that would also potentially allow us to lower some of the prices to our customers. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations again. You just keep the trend going. So Laura, there's been a lot of discussion about household income brackets and kind of the lower end, obviously, feeling much more of the pain and having that creeped into kind of the median household income in the second quarter. You guys stayed pretty high up, but I'm curious, the strength that you saw at Williams-Sonoma Home seek to really hire in. West Elm would seem to me to be maybe more median-ish in terms of household income. Can you talk about what you're seeing with regard to these different target income brackets and how they're behaving? \nLaura Alber: Sure. First of all, Williams-Sonoma home for us is still very small, coming off a small base. So I wouldn't read much into that for the total high-end industry. \n In terms of customers, I'm always looking at this data to see what we can see. I mean we don't see a ton of inconsistency across even location, slightly better, Southwest, Southeast, slightly better, but it's not material. Gen Z and millennials do continue to be our fastest growing segment, which is awesome. There isn't much differentiation with the income levels, except not based on income, it's about how much they spend. We're seeing people who spend more than $1,000 accelerate and people who spend less than $200 decelerate. But that's also not surprising given that furniture is a strong growth vehicle for our business that you would see that they're buying more furniture from us versus anything else. \n So I don't -- I'm sharing this with you to share that we are looking at all these factors, and we're not seeing it, although one could conclude that we're more insulated because our customer is in a better situation from an income perspective. I think the bigger thing about the macro is that although there's been some slowing of the housing market, most of our customers have seen significant house appreciation, okay? And our customers love their homes, and it's one of the largest assets. And they are engaged with improving that asset. \n And this -- I think we all know, we're all spending more time in our homes, working, entertaining and investing in them, of course. And we also know that home furnishing always lag the home sale and the home remodel. Therefore, the current period metrics on home sales and interest rates don't necessarily align with the home improvement journey. And as a result, we continue to believe there's significant runway ahead for home furnishing sales. \n And while I'm talking too much, I might as well just add, although there's a lot of smart people out there predicting a recession, we're also seeing consumer sentiment improve as inflation cools. So there's a lot of reasons, I think -- believe we're gaining share and that we're in the right business. We've looked at a lot of different data sources, and it is really in a couple of data sources is very clear that we're gaining share, significant share. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Okay. And then for Julie, my follow-up is custom orders versus in-stocks. I know in-stocks have been hard to keep in stock. So I'm wondering if people have -- have you seen any noticeable difference in the movement to custom orders, those are obviously stickier and than non-cap cancellations because of the deposit, so any trends in that would be super helpful? \nLaura Alber: I'll take that, Adrienne. So custom orders, most of our upholstery business is custom, okay? People always want to choose their own fabric and their own frame. We don't do much stock upholstery at all. So there's no dynamic there really that's changing. What's stocked is our bedroom furniture, dining furniture, all those wood pieces. But most of our upholstery business is custom. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham: Congrats on a great quarter. My first question is just thinking about the outlook for the back half of the year, if 2022 operating margins are in line with 2021, that implies some modest yearly decline in the second half operating margins after a strong performance in the first half. What's driving that slight decline? Is it some of the additional supply chain pressure? Or is there anything else that might get work here? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. So there's 2 things there. First of all, I mean, we are obviously reiterating our strong guidance giving a nod the fact that the environment is uncertain. So we're being cautious on that, but there is definitely some pressure that we're going to feel on the op margin line, particularly associated with these ongoing supply chain costs. So we're going to continue to have incremental distribution center costs. We've got ocean freight costs that are higher along with dray and demurrage costs. So there's all the costs that are increased to get the goods to us. And then incrementally, we are doing the right thing by our customer to accelerate getting the goods to them. And so there'll be incremental cost for out-of-market shipments and for multiple shipments that we typically would have done in a single shipment. .\n The one thing from a modeling perspective to make sure you're aware, if you remember last year in Q3, we had higher spot rate charges, and so that will help us to partially offset some of that incremental cost in Q3, but Q4, we didn't have that last year. And so you'll see that the Q4 is going to be a bigger impact than the Q3. But at the end of the day, of course, we will do everything we can to mitigate it as we always do. And thankfully, with the strength that we've had in the first half of the year, we are very confident in our ability to hit our operating margin in line with '21, which, as you know, is a 17.7% and the highest we've ever had. \nSeth Basham: That's really helpful. And then relatedly, as your inventory start to normalize, you'll have more clearance and need to mark down slow-moving SKUs. How much has that been benefiting you for the last 2 years? And what kind of reversion do we see an impact on margins over the next year or 2? \nJulie Whalen: I mean I wouldn't assume that that would go up per se. I mean we've always had inventories that ages, and we've always had to clear it. We've had warehouse sales for a while now. So I don't think there's anything there that is a significant shift, it should be concerning from a promotional stance or a margin perspective. Remember, most of what we sell is core. And so we're different than the apparel companies and so forth. And so as you get more inventory and you come back in stock, if it comes in late, there's a lot more pressure for them to push it out and get it out of the distribution center. For us, it's just a space play. And so we'll continue to have markdowns and things like that where we need to get rid of aged inventory, but there's no substantial shift that should occur. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. \nAnthony Chukumba: Congrats as well on a great quarter, particularly given the tough sort of macro environment. So just a real quick question, just more of a clarifying question. In prior calls, and I don't mean to nitpick particularly given the fact that you had a really great quarter. But in prior calls, you talked about the emerging brands and gave us updates there in terms of comps and your thoughts there. And I was just wondering if you -- if there's any color you would provide on the emerging brand performance in the second quarter? \nLaura Alber: Yes. I'm so sorry, I didn't do that just absolutely because we are being more additive in our prepared remarks, we have more time for Q&A. But they're both really driving profitable growth. So Mark and Graham, let's see, Julie won't want me to give the specific -- can I give them a specific comp? I can tell you double digit, okay? Same with rejuvenation, double-digit comp on both these brands. And in Rejuvenation consumer and B2B business are both performing consistent to each other and seeing strong performance across DTC and retail and Rejuvenation. We still would love to have a few more stores because stores are really good in driving brand awareness for Rejuvenation. \n And in Mark and Graham, we're really -- we're pushing the trends that are post pandemic trends like travel, social sports, home entertaining as primary drivers of incremental brand growth. And we're seeing particularly resurgence of Tennis and Golf, Pickleball, fueling this business. It's a really fun gift business, and we're starting to see people really noticed us and come to us for their stuff. We're excited about both Mark and Graham and Rejuvenation as growth vehicles for our company. \nAnthony Chukumba: Got it. No, that's really helpful. And yes, I appreciate you adding your comments, but don't edit your comments just so you can hear more questions from the likes of sell-side analysts like me. Anyway, just second real brief question. I mean, obviously, very strong free cash flow in the first half of this year. I would expect to see continuous strong free cash flow in the second half, you've been very aggressive about buying back stock. Obviously, you have the dividend. But how do you think about just near term about capital allocation, particularly like in the back half of this year? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I mean we're going to continue with buybacks and our dividends, of course, maybe not to the same degree we'll see. Certainly, we still believe our stock is undervalued. It has recovered nicely. We're pleased that we were able to buy the stock back on average for about $138, and obviously, stock is much higher now, but it's still undervalued. And so we're going to continue as long as we have some really strong free cash flow and are generating this kind of earnings and cash that we are, we think the right thing to do is to return it to our shareholders. So we're still committed to doing that. \nLaura Alber: And I think also the buyback signals also the confidence we have in our guidance. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Nice quarter. On our math, it looks like your backlog release continues to gain steam, which is obviously a good thing for your customer. But is it possible to size up where you are today on the backlog versus maybe where you were last year? And is there a banner where the backlog levels are more severe than others? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I mean we haven't disclosed the total amount, as you guys know, but it has come down, but it's still incredibly sizable. I think we may have said before that most of the back orders associated with furniture. So certainly, Pottery Barn and West Elm have a sizable amount of back orders, but every brand has them. And the good news is we are starting to bring that balance down, and certainly, that's a tailwind for the back half and as we move into 2023. \nCharles Grom: Okay. And is there a banner that is higher? Would you say PB is higher than maybe Sonoma or West Elm? \nLaura Alber: Well, Sonoma is obviously lower, less furniture. \nJulie Whalen: Pottery Barn is our largest brand. \nCharles Grom: Okay. And then on the 9% or so increase in occupancy dollars year-over-year. It sounds like the distribution center openings are an incremental spend on that line item. I guess is there a way to think about the occupancy line over the next couple of quarters given those openings? \nJulie Whalen: Yes, it will be a little bit higher, kind of similar to where it has been now because of those incremental distribution centers. At the same time, we've had some offsite that should be coming off. We've got some incremental hubs that over time will come off. But I think the bigger play, as you know, is our retail real estate optimization strategy, and most of our stores that we plan on closing close at the end of the year. And so as you start to lap into the new year, you'll get the benefit again from that reduced occupancy costs associated with those stores. So -- but in the shorter term, yes, there will be pressure on that line. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies. \nJonathan Matuszewski: Nice quarter. First one was just on supply chain. Laura, you mentioned challenges still persist there. Just curious where you guys are from a diversification standpoint? I think a while ago, you mentioned reducing China exposure by half. So just curious how much there is to go on that initiative? That's my first question. \nLaura Alber: Yes. I think that's an ongoing journey. We have significantly reduced the China exposure. What we're working on now is just having multiple high-quality vendors who can make some of our high-risk furniture for kids. it's been harder to find multiple vendors who can do that and to also do the -- yes, this has hit the sustainability mark that we're looking for. So we're really always looking for additional high-quality suppliers would be what I would say to that. \n And the continuation out of China has happened, but it doesn't mean you're moving it to a place that is free of any other issues. There's a lot of different issues in all these places around the globe, including the domestic market. So we just have to have more options in terms of where we are. I think this is going to be a continued issue for a while because these factories are skittish to open to -- much further than they are and to accelerate given the recessionary fears that everyone has out there. So I think we're going to continue to see pressure on flow from some of the highest quality vendors. \nJonathan Matuszewski: That's helpful. And then my follow-up question, Laura, you mentioned millennials and Gen Z, the fastest-growing cohorts you're seeing. So a question on marketing strategy for you. It feels like you guys are leaning in a bit deeper into brand ambassadors, influencer marketing from what we see on social media. You launched the West Elm collective not long ago. I never really thought about Gen Z as really a core demo for your business, but it is a group that leverages some of those channels. So just your thoughts on how you've been leaning in more to that channel, how impactful it's been? You guys have always done a good job with digital marketing. But it seems like you guys are making a bit more of a pivot at least from what we see. So any thoughts there in terms of the impact? \nLaura Alber: It's interesting. Felix is just there with me and since he's still doing 2 jobs. I'm going to make a few comments, too. But video is very engaging. So whether it's video on TikTok, on our sites, on Insta, we're doing more video. And as much as a lot of millennials and Gen Z get credit for liking video, don't we all like video. The stuff we're doing for that generation, I think, is appealing to all, and we're certainly always pushing to try these new channels, whether it's Pinterest or TikTok, Snapchat. Pinterest, has been much better than I expected, frankly. And I think there's still a lot of room to go there. And the TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube group is also showing that their engagement is multilayered and different than just a product ad on Google. Felix, do you want add anything to that? \nFelix Carbullido: No, I think it's undeniable, the impact that TikTok has on customers of all ages, particularly those demographics to what you talked about. But they also -- they bring a couple of things. They extend the reach of our brand, they introduce our brand to new customers, but some of the design collaborations also bring new aesthetics. So it's about offering a diverse point of view or expression of our brands to customers so we can acquire more and introduce our customers to some of these new looks and some of these new influencers. So it's -- you're correct, we've leaned more into that because society has. And we're -- we want to make sure we're as relevant as we always have been. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nBradley Thomas: Let me add my congratulations as well. Great first half of the year here. It's a little early probably to talk about the holiday season, but that's obviously your most important quarter of the year. So wondering, Laura, Julie, if you could just comment a little bit about maybe from a merchandising standpoint, how you plan for this year, how you're thinking about the consumer and any differences in how it may show up here for the holidays? And any nuances of how the mix is a little bit different during that quarter? \nLaura Alber: We love the holidays. And frankly, we have a great lineup, and it's always good to see the Halloween off to a good start, as I alluded to, in the kids business also off to really good start in PD and Williams-Sonoma, I should have said that. But we built on last year's great sellers. We sold out very fast last year of a lot of our key holiday products. And so we're going to get a chance to fully leverage those ideas that barely made it before last year. And we're excited about Williams-Sonoma. The Williams-Sonoma holiday season was disrupted last year by COVID. Let's remember, Thanksgiving was not exactly easy. I had many -- my family not be able to make Christmas because of COVID. \n So this year, it should be a much easier celebration for people to come together, and we're really looking forward to being a part of that and giving our customers great experience and great products to celebrate the holidays with and Felix and his team are really working on holiday preparedness right now on the website. And in fact, Felix, I think you had a meeting today with our district managers? \nFelix Carbullido: Yes. I mean before this meeting, I spent 4 hours with our district managers across the country to come in and look at holiday because it is such an important part of our business, but it's critically important for retail. And so we walked through the assortment. I think everyone is super excited about it. Laura mentioned a number of things I'm excited about, but seasonal holidays are another one because there's always -- every single month, there's a reason to celebrate. And I can't -- there's no better brand to celebrate with than Williams-Sonoma. So I'm super optimistic about this holiday and holidays going forward for this brand. So stay tuned. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: I wanted to ask about the tone of the consumer. Last quarter, there was some mentioning of, I think, some choppiness coming into this quarter. And it sounds like things have picked up and the sentiment has gotten better and demand comps have gotten better. I want to make sure that that's the right read and you're not seeing the tentativeness that maybe you were at the early part of the quarter? \nJulie Whalen: No, that's exactly right. I mean as we said in our last call, as we started that call or that quarter, we saw demand comps moderate. And we're really pleased and excited to see them coming back and accelerating and being strong, heading into third quarter. And so we haven't seen, again, what others are mentioning out there. So it's really different for certain retailers. And thankfully, we're one of those that are seeing real strength in our business. \nLaura Alber: I remember, we're only 3 weeks into the quarter, don't overread this, but this is -- this is what we meant to signal to you is exactly what Julie just said. \nSimeon Gutman: And B2B, the growth, I'm assuming, is outpacing the house average in terms of comp. Can you share at least the spread? Is that spread widening? Is it narrowing? And is B2B concentrated among any of your brands? \nLaura Alber: Yes. It's a consistent beat to last year in growth. And we're seeing also a lot of innovation from the brands to see B2B. So as we mentioned, bring in products that we can offer is a big part of the strategy and more contracts means more sales for B2B because they can do even more in the project. In terms of penetration, Rejuvenation by nature, a small business, but a large percent B2B, has always been. Trade has been a big part of that as people furnish hotels with their custom-configured lighting. \n But West Elm and Pottery Barn are really very strong in B2B and Williams-Sonoma has a lot of opportunity. We started. You've heard us talk about the gifts that we do with wins from the holidays, the business and there's a lot more room particularly as we expand the assortment in Williams-Sonoma Home because right now the assortment is so small, it's hard to do large-scale projects Williams-Sonoma Home, lots of opportunity across the board. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. \nOliver Wintermantel: I have a follow-up question for the B2B question from Simeon. Can you maybe give us a little bit more details what the margin is on the B2B business versus the rest of your business? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. We said -- I mentioned this to you in the past, but it's accretive to our total company operating margin at this time. So as that business continues to grow, we get the incremental benefit on the bottom line. \nOliver Wintermantel: Perfect. And then on the -- with now the success and also the -- not just the e-commerce but also in new stores, have you reconsidered closing what you disclosed before? I think it was 25% of your store base. Is that something that you're having a different look at now with your success over the last few quarters? \nLaura Alber: Great question. We continue to reassess and review our real estate strategy. And while we have been closing stores, we've also had incredible success in repositioning and relocating stores in their current market. A perfect example in our backyard, we moved our Williams-Sonoma Corte Madera storage in a small space and they are off to a very strong start in that store. And then as I look at the other Williams-Sonoma stores that we've repositioned, they are outperforming their forecast too as customers embrace the new design that provides an improved inspirational shopping experience. \n So we look at this as an opportunity to improve our retail fleet, not to just think of it as a line item on the P&L. But of course, there are some stores that underperform or are in areas that are not as vibrant and we are always going to look for the best location in town. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Congratulations. I do want to take again on the B2B, not to beat it up, I'm actually asking on the positive. Can you just talk a little bit about how the expense structure works there? I'm assuming you have a sales team. But it sounds like the products are coming from the brand. So is the design and R&D part coming from the brands? Because that feels like a really reliant way to leverage what's already done. And then could you just touch a little bit on the relaunch of Holds Everything because I thought the timing of it was interesting. And I always liked that brand? So I'm curious about that as well. \nLaura Alber: Okay. Great. So you're absolutely right, Marni. The structure is we have a dedicated sales team. And then we have Jose who runs it, who's powerhouse looking and working with the brand presidents to identify opportunities for categories that appeal to our clients. So if she sees white space, she says, \"Hey, let's work on this area.\" And then the brands work together and they develop new products or we have to get products contract grade approved, which most of them are, they were already and then some we had a test and then some we actually had to change to make them more durable, which, by the way, I think is pretty good for consumers to make something more durable. But as I'm looking at this incredible list of client examples, she's got not just the ones I mentioned. But whether it's Marriott headquarters hotel, Waldorf Astoria, Marriott Vacations, Hilton Boston, New Orleans, Charlotte Ceria Scottsdale, IHG Kimpton, InterContinental San Antonio, Hotel Indigo, Hyatt Regency, Huntington Beach, I mean, I could just go on and on and read you all these projects that we are doing that are so exciting. And it's just new space for us to be in, and it is that we want to furnish any space with new furniture. And so this has been just a wonderful partnership between the B2B team and the brand team. \n And then the question on Hold Everything. So we only have [indiscernible] everything back of the day, and then we close it, wasn't doing so well. But we saw an opportunity to distort just a relevant to bring it back really under the Williams-Sonoma banner. And we've designed and housed beautiful, high-quality products. And we just made it more visible on the site. And we have, I think, up to 50 products now. My favorite being the expandable storage organizer for your drawer, which if you check out, you'll see why it's great because there's versions of that online, but they really break and it makes your kitchen look like a custom kitchen and who doesn't want to be more organized. So it's been a very successful initiative and it's gaining steam, and it's real volume for us. \nOperator: We'll take our final question from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I'm just going back to a previous question that was asked with regards to the freight cost. I just wondered if there was any way you could compare the cost between what you're experiencing in Q1 versus Q2? And how you expect that to change just because you have been dealing with backlogs and multiple deliveries for some time? I just was curious what the change was between quarters and going forward? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I think the bigger change is in the ocean freight side of things and the dray and the demurrage as we're getting these big volumes of inventory coming in, there are containers that need to be moved around, need to be stored accordingly. And ocean freight rates, as has been the case for everybody, have gone up. And so that happened sort of I think it was May or June, and then as you know, those sort of charges get capitalized on the balance sheet as part of inventory, and so you don't recognize those until you make sales. So it's a function of turn, which is why we're starting to feel some of those more towards the back half. But that's the reason. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect. \nLaura Alber: Thank you. Appreciate your support. Happy shopping.",

            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremy. Good afternoon, everyone. \n I'm excited to share our second quarter earnings today. Q2 marked another quarter of strong performance, delivering an 11.3% comp on the top line and earnings growth of over 19% to $3.87 per share. These impressive results reflect the strength of our multi-brand portfolio, the success of our growth initiatives and the ongoing execution of the team. We continue to demonstrate our ability to perform by offering high-quality, differentiated and sustainable products that our customers know and love. \n Our performance was driven by 3 factors: strong order fulfillment, positive demand comps and our successful continued elimination of site-wide promotions. I'm very proud of this performance, especially given the macroeconomic backdrop and the strong compares we are up against, all while delivering an impressive 41.1% comp on a 2-year basis. And it is this continued outperformance that gives us the confidence to reiterate our 2022 guidance and longer-term outlook today. \n Our positioning in the industry is a competitive strength. Our industry is large and fragmented with more than half of sales from small brick-and-mortar retailers that do not have sophisticated e-commerce capabilities. And with the arrival of the millennial generation for the household creation stage, this is a huge opportunity for ongoing market share gains for us, while the rest of the players try to catch up. \n At the same time, our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy provides a competitive edge in scaling the business into the future compared to both retail and marketplace only players. All of this creates an environment that is ripe for disruption and for us to take market share. \n We continue to win because of our key differentiators, which include our in-house design capabilities with inspirational, exclusive, sustainable and high-quality products at compelling price points. Our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy and our values rooted in sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion, which are becoming even more fundamental to purchasing decisions for many customers. These differentiators set us apart as a leader in the industry. \n And now I want to highlight one of our opportunities, business to business. Our B2B business had another terrific quarter driving a 32% increase in demand in Q2 and it is well on track to becoming a $1 billion business this year. We continue to grow in this space by focusing on diversifying our product pipeline across a range of industry verticals. \n In sports and entertainment, we are excited to service our first collegiate sports facility at San Diego State New Snapdragon Stadium. In hospitality, we continue to gain market share through renovations and new builds, leveraging our diverse fleet of brands. And in our commercial office pipeline, we are encouraged to see the momentum continue as companies return to the office and workspaces are reimagined. \n To drive the B2B growth, we are focused on the continued development of our sales team and expansion of our contract-grade product assortment. We remain optimistic and excited about the potential of this business as there is no one else providing the full suite of services and offerings that we do. \n Moving to sustainability. We are thrilled to announce the recent publication of our 2021 impact report highlighting the progress and fulfillment of our industry-leading ESG goals. We remain committed to prioritizing sustainability, diversity, philanthropy and worker well-being as key differentiators for our business. In the report, we detailed progress on our long-standing commitment, including responsibly sourced cotton and wood, waste diversion and increased fair trade premium. We are also one of the first home furnishing brands to set a science-based target for reducing our emissions across our company, and we have made progress decreasing our carbon intensity. \n Now I'd like to talk about our global business. We continue to believe that global expansion represents a sizable opportunity, and we are focused on a multichannel strategy in key markets. In Q2, we continued building momentum with our franchise partnerships. Our presence in Mexico continues to drive growth, and we launched the Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids websites in India with stores beginning in Q3 of this year and further expansion into 2023. And in our company-owned business in Canada, we continue to expand our family of brands with the launch of our Pottery Barn Teen website and the relaunches of Williams-Sonoma West Elm in our Pottery Barn Kids website in the market, all with great customer response. \n Before we get to the strong results of the brand, I want to update you on the supply chain. Unfortunately, this is an area where we continue to see significant disruption, inefficiencies and cost pressures. Although our in-stock position has improved, we have still room to improve our on-time shipments to customers. Also, we continue to incur higher distribution center costs to support our growth as well as higher ocean freight. And we are still incurring added costs to ship out of market and multiple shipments to service our customers. We expect this pressure will continue in the second half of this year and the first half of next. This is reflected in our guidance and our outlook. \n Now let's turn to the performance of our brands. Pottery Barn delivered another extremely strong quarter with a 21.5% comp or 51.1% on a 2-year basis. All channels and product divisions contributed to driving incremental demand. Our high-quality proprietary furniture business continues to lead the growth. \n Pottery Barn continues to innovate with product and incremental growth initiatives. For example, in July, Pottery Barn launched the Accessible Home, an exciting new concept designed to enhance the quality of life at home with aging in-place community and people living with disabilities and injury. Our customers have responded enthusiastically about our efforts to address this underserved market, and we believe this could be a significant opportunity across our portfolio of brands. \n Moving to West Elm. West Elm delivered a 6.1% comp in the second quarter on top of 51.1% last year or 57.2% on a 2-year basis. We're excited about our new businesses in kids and bath, which continue to drive outsized growth for the brand. And we launched our dedicated B2B e-commerce experience and expanded assortment there. \n Looking forward to Q3, we are focused on 3 key areas of growth at West Elm. One, improving furniture in-stocks and lead time reductions; two, expanding our depth in seasonal decorating, hosting and entertainment categories; and three, launching innovative collaborations across the brand. And with the ongoing success of our strategic initiatives, we remain confident in our ability to drive West Elm to become a $3 billion brand. \n Now I'd like to update you on our Pottery Barn children's home furnishing business, which delivered a sequentially stronger quarter with a 5.3% comp in Q2. During the quarter, we benefited from improving inventory receipts out of Vietnam, which filed factory closures that occurred in the back half of 2021. Also, we successfully launched our biggest ever back-to-school collection, and we enabled functionality to ship dorm products in any store in any brand in our fleet across the country. Early results also indicate the seasonal holiday business will be a success given the early positive reaction to Halloween. \n In the Williams-Sonoma brand, I want to highlight our recently announced change in leadership. Felix Carbullido, previously our Chief Marketing Officer, has assumed the role of President of the Williams-Sonoma brand. Felix brings incredible talent to the position through his experience in strategy and operations in addition to a breadth of merchandising, e-commerce and marketing expertise. Felix is only 3 weeks into the role, but sees clear opportunities for the brand, particularly in key areas, including: one, leaning further into the brand's heritage of inspiring those who love to cook at home with relevant and useful storytelling across all channels; two, the importance of offering the best product and ensuring customers can rely on Williams-Sonoma to be in stock across the key essentials of a great home kitchen. And finally, there are white space opportunities not only in our core offering, but also in new categories that have clear adjacencies to the kitchen. \n In Q2, Williams-Sonoma came in at a positive 0.5% comp with accelerating comps throughout the quarter. This was driven by an improved in-stock position, newness in the assortment as well as higher conversion on the site driven by our ongoing e-commerce initiatives that improved imagery and shop path. In stock continues to improve, and we believe we will see further recovery in the back half. \n As part of the Williams-Sonoma brand, our Williams-Sonoma Home business, we had a high double-digit comp again this quarter and continues to be an opportunity. Given the strength of the Williams-Sonoma brand name, our expertise in the furniture category and the clear opportunity in the high-end home market, we believe that Williams-Sonoma Home is destined to be a product leader of distinctive design-led, high-quality home furnishings. \n In summary, we are proud of our performance and we remain committed to executing on our growth initiatives and operational improvements to drive market share gains and strong long-term financial returns. I want to thank our customers, our employees and our shareholders. We are committed to delivering for all of you. \n And with that, I'd like to turn the call to Julie to go through all the financials in more detail. And Max, to your question about why we're winning, and how come we're outperforming. First of all, thank you for the great question. We think it's a couple of reasons. First, we've said over and over what our key differentiators are and they're truly setting us apart. Let me just talk about the first one first in more detail than I have in the past. \n We talk about in-house design, which allows us to have proprietary products that is of high quality and at the best value. It also happens to be sustainable. But it also allows us to innovate and bring in collections that no one else has and see the white space. This culture of innovation that we have is driving a lot of the great wins for our business. And truly, I don't believe we have these results have we not continued to deliver these important points. And each one is a seed that grows and some into very large brands. But in Pottery Barn, Example A is accessible home, really obvious and sizable business opportunity. We just got started. They also have in Pottery Barn a bunch of great collaborations that they've been launching my favorite one with Hailey Bieber, which is really fun if you want to check that one out. \n On Pottery Barn Kids has always had really wonderful, exciting collaborations in different licenses that kids love from Beatrix Potter, Disney to Emily Meritt, Harry Potter, and those continue to drive relevancy for the brand and delight the trial. \n For West Elm, in terms of innovation, we've talked about B2B, we've talked about kids and bath. But we also had some collaborations that really are working there like just Sarah Sherman Samuel. I don't know if you've had a chance to see that that's also in -- it's in Pottery Barn kids too. And this has really, really set us apart and gotten us more attention on our kids growth in our West Elm business. And we're still really low awareness that we even have a West Elm kids business. \n So those are just some of the examples when we say innovation, we say that it's a differentiator that we design our own products. It's this culture of innovation that really, I think, is what's making us outperform. Yes. So first of all, the industry is already very promotional, particularly with the big box retailers faltering. There's a lot that they're flushing through, and that's been going on for more than just a couple of weeks here, you've been watching this happen most of this year. \n I believe, Julie, you did detail the difference between our MMU and our... I think that's the key point that I want to make sure that no one confuses when they just do the quick read of the gross margin that you understand where it came from and where it didn't come from. We are committed to the elimination of site-wide promos. We believe this is absolutely the healthiest way to run our business for long-term success. And it's a function of the products that we sell that have great design, as I said, and great quality and are sustainable. And as long as we continue to maintain that value equation in the product and the innovation, I believe we're really equipped to maintain this posture because no one else has the same product out there in the market.\n That said, this commitment doesn't mean that we're not going to use markdowns to manage our inventory. We are very aggressive about managing our inventories and markdowns are part of any retail business, and we will take markdowns particularly in seasonal products and slow-moving SKUs, but we have not expanded the amount of promotions that we're running. Yes. I think just to add to that, the good news is as we've gotten back in stock, which is really important to our customers, we have seen backorder crate rates come down. Back order levels have decreased even though they are still too high. Our cancel rates have moderated. And also just another thing under the covers is that, we have industry-leading lead times in our domestic in-house upholstery. Nobody else is shipping custom upholstery faster than we are. And as much as our on-time shipments are not where we want to be, we are extremely focused on getting back in stock and every day working to serve our customers the best we can in this environment. And I do believe as we go through the balance of this year and next -- early next, we should be in a much better position. That's an interesting question without giving too much competitive information away. We -- I think you know that we have taken some price raises. We've been very selective. We don't pass those costs on unilaterally to our customers. We look to see where we're underpriced and where we can still offer value to this customer. And at this point, we are sort of plateauing on raising our prices. We're also starting to see that certain raw materials and fuel has come down in price. So over time, honestly, this should allow us to get price reductions from our vendor partners that we -- that could help our margins, and that would also potentially allow us to lower some of the prices to our customers. Sure. First of all, Williams-Sonoma home for us is still very small, coming off a small base. So I wouldn't read much into that for the total high-end industry. \n In terms of customers, I'm always looking at this data to see what we can see. I mean we don't see a ton of inconsistency across even location, slightly better, Southwest, Southeast, slightly better, but it's not material. Gen Z and millennials do continue to be our fastest growing segment, which is awesome. There isn't much differentiation with the income levels, except not based on income, it's about how much they spend. We're seeing people who spend more than $1,000 accelerate and people who spend less than $200 decelerate. But that's also not surprising given that furniture is a strong growth vehicle for our business that you would see that they're buying more furniture from us versus anything else. \n So I don't -- I'm sharing this with you to share that we are looking at all these factors, and we're not seeing it, although one could conclude that we're more insulated because our customer is in a better situation from an income perspective. I think the bigger thing about the macro is that although there's been some slowing of the housing market, most of our customers have seen significant house appreciation, okay? And our customers love their homes, and it's one of the largest assets. And they are engaged with improving that asset. \n And this -- I think we all know, we're all spending more time in our homes, working, entertaining and investing in them, of course. And we also know that home furnishing always lag the home sale and the home remodel. Therefore, the current period metrics on home sales and interest rates don't necessarily align with the home improvement journey. And as a result, we continue to believe there's significant runway ahead for home furnishing sales. \n And while I'm talking too much, I might as well just add, although there's a lot of smart people out there predicting a recession, we're also seeing consumer sentiment improve as inflation cools. So there's a lot of reasons, I think -- believe we're gaining share and that we're in the right business. We've looked at a lot of different data sources, and it is really in a couple of data sources is very clear that we're gaining share, significant share. I'll take that, Adrienne. So custom orders, most of our upholstery business is custom, okay? People always want to choose their own fabric and their own frame. We don't do much stock upholstery at all. So there's no dynamic there really that's changing. What's stocked is our bedroom furniture, dining furniture, all those wood pieces. But most of our upholstery business is custom. Yes. I'm so sorry, I didn't do that just absolutely because we are being more additive in our prepared remarks, we have more time for Q&A. But they're both really driving profitable growth. So Mark and Graham, let's see, Julie won't want me to give the specific -- can I give them a specific comp? I can tell you double digit, okay? Same with rejuvenation, double-digit comp on both these brands. And in Rejuvenation consumer and B2B business are both performing consistent to each other and seeing strong performance across DTC and retail and Rejuvenation. We still would love to have a few more stores because stores are really good in driving brand awareness for Rejuvenation. \n And in Mark and Graham, we're really -- we're pushing the trends that are post pandemic trends like travel, social sports, home entertaining as primary drivers of incremental brand growth. And we're seeing particularly resurgence of Tennis and Golf, Pickleball, fueling this business. It's a really fun gift business, and we're starting to see people really noticed us and come to us for their stuff. We're excited about both Mark and Graham and Rejuvenation as growth vehicles for our company. And I think also the buyback signals also the confidence we have in our guidance. Well, Sonoma is obviously lower, less furniture. Yes. I think that's an ongoing journey. We have significantly reduced the China exposure. What we're working on now is just having multiple high-quality vendors who can make some of our high-risk furniture for kids. it's been harder to find multiple vendors who can do that and to also do the -- yes, this has hit the sustainability mark that we're looking for. So we're really always looking for additional high-quality suppliers would be what I would say to that. \n And the continuation out of China has happened, but it doesn't mean you're moving it to a place that is free of any other issues. There's a lot of different issues in all these places around the globe, including the domestic market. So we just have to have more options in terms of where we are. I think this is going to be a continued issue for a while because these factories are skittish to open to -- much further than they are and to accelerate given the recessionary fears that everyone has out there. So I think we're going to continue to see pressure on flow from some of the highest quality vendors. It's interesting. Felix is just there with me and since he's still doing 2 jobs. I'm going to make a few comments, too. But video is very engaging. So whether it's video on TikTok, on our sites, on Insta, we're doing more video. And as much as a lot of millennials and Gen Z get credit for liking video, don't we all like video. The stuff we're doing for that generation, I think, is appealing to all, and we're certainly always pushing to try these new channels, whether it's Pinterest or TikTok, Snapchat. Pinterest, has been much better than I expected, frankly. And I think there's still a lot of room to go there. And the TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube group is also showing that their engagement is multilayered and different than just a product ad on Google. Felix, do you want add anything to that? We love the holidays. And frankly, we have a great lineup, and it's always good to see the Halloween off to a good start, as I alluded to, in the kids business also off to really good start in PD and Williams-Sonoma, I should have said that. But we built on last year's great sellers. We sold out very fast last year of a lot of our key holiday products. And so we're going to get a chance to fully leverage those ideas that barely made it before last year. And we're excited about Williams-Sonoma. The Williams-Sonoma holiday season was disrupted last year by COVID. Let's remember, Thanksgiving was not exactly easy. I had many -- my family not be able to make Christmas because of COVID. \n So this year, it should be a much easier celebration for people to come together, and we're really looking forward to being a part of that and giving our customers great experience and great products to celebrate the holidays with and Felix and his team are really working on holiday preparedness right now on the website. And in fact, Felix, I think you had a meeting today with our district managers? I remember, we're only 3 weeks into the quarter, don't overread this, but this is -- this is what we meant to signal to you is exactly what Julie just said. Yes. It's a consistent beat to last year in growth. And we're seeing also a lot of innovation from the brands to see B2B. So as we mentioned, bring in products that we can offer is a big part of the strategy and more contracts means more sales for B2B because they can do even more in the project. In terms of penetration, Rejuvenation by nature, a small business, but a large percent B2B, has always been. Trade has been a big part of that as people furnish hotels with their custom-configured lighting. \n But West Elm and Pottery Barn are really very strong in B2B and Williams-Sonoma has a lot of opportunity. We started. You've heard us talk about the gifts that we do with wins from the holidays, the business and there's a lot more room particularly as we expand the assortment in Williams-Sonoma Home because right now the assortment is so small, it's hard to do large-scale projects Williams-Sonoma Home, lots of opportunity across the board. Great question. We continue to reassess and review our real estate strategy. And while we have been closing stores, we've also had incredible success in repositioning and relocating stores in their current market. A perfect example in our backyard, we moved our Williams-Sonoma Corte Madera storage in a small space and they are off to a very strong start in that store. And then as I look at the other Williams-Sonoma stores that we've repositioned, they are outperforming their forecast too as customers embrace the new design that provides an improved inspirational shopping experience. \n So we look at this as an opportunity to improve our retail fleet, not to just think of it as a line item on the P&L. But of course, there are some stores that underperform or are in areas that are not as vibrant and we are always going to look for the best location in town. Okay. Great. So you're absolutely right, Marni. The structure is we have a dedicated sales team. And then we have Jose who runs it, who's powerhouse looking and working with the brand presidents to identify opportunities for categories that appeal to our clients. So if she sees white space, she says, \"Hey, let's work on this area.\" And then the brands work together and they develop new products or we have to get products contract grade approved, which most of them are, they were already and then some we had a test and then some we actually had to change to make them more durable, which, by the way, I think is pretty good for consumers to make something more durable. But as I'm looking at this incredible list of client examples, she's got not just the ones I mentioned. But whether it's Marriott headquarters hotel, Waldorf Astoria, Marriott Vacations, Hilton Boston, New Orleans, Charlotte Ceria Scottsdale, IHG Kimpton, InterContinental San Antonio, Hotel Indigo, Hyatt Regency, Huntington Beach, I mean, I could just go on and on and read you all these projects that we are doing that are so exciting. And it's just new space for us to be in, and it is that we want to furnish any space with new furniture. And so this has been just a wonderful partnership between the B2B team and the brand team. \n And then the question on Hold Everything. So we only have [indiscernible] everything back of the day, and then we close it, wasn't doing so well. But we saw an opportunity to distort just a relevant to bring it back really under the Williams-Sonoma banner. And we've designed and housed beautiful, high-quality products. And we just made it more visible on the site. And we have, I think, up to 50 products now. My favorite being the expandable storage organizer for your drawer, which if you check out, you'll see why it's great because there's versions of that online, but they really break and it makes your kitchen look like a custom kitchen and who doesn't want to be more organized. So it's been a very successful initiative and it's gaining steam, and it's real volume for us. Thank you. Appreciate your support. Happy shopping."

            "name": "Julie Whalen",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and hello, everyone. \n We had another outstanding quarter with revenues, operating margin and earnings all exceeding expectations. Our performance and execution remains strong. Our comps outperformed due to positive and healthy demand comps and accelerating order fulfillment. Our growth strategy has continued to build momentum and our operating margin continued to grow above expectations due to running a more regular priced business and another quarter of advertising and employment leverage. These factors enabled us to outperform on both the top and bottom line with double-digit comps and another quarter of operating margin expansion. Our results this quarter further validate that we are one of the best positioned to succeed in the short and long term with strong profitable growth. \n Moving to our second quarter results in more detail. Net revenues grew to $2.1 billion with comparable brand revenue growth at 11.3% on top of 29.8% last year for a 2-year stack of 41.1%. This includes double-digit growth in both channels. In retail, we delivered an 11.4% comp despite retail traffic down almost 19% in 2019. And in e-commerce, we delivered an 11.3% comp and grew our e-commerce penetration 60 basis points year-over-year to 65.4%. \n Moving down the income statement. Our gross margin continued to hold near historic highs at 43.5%, which was 60 basis points below last year's record Q2. Our merchandise margins remained strong with another consecutive quarter of merchandise margin expansion year-over-year as we continue to preserve our pricing integrity by remaining committed to our decision to no longer offer site-wide promotions. The gross margin decline was driven by higher freight costs from our strong furniture demand, higher back order fulfillment and global supply chain disruptions, driving freight rates higher for all. \n We also incurred incremental freight costs in order to best serve our customers, to get product to them timely by shipping from out-of-market distribution centers and in some cases, shipping multiple times for multiunit orders, which typically would have been done in a single shipment. \n Occupancy costs at 9% of net revenues were flat to last year, with occupancy dollars increasing 9.6% to approximately $193 million, which includes incremental costs from our new distribution centers on both the East and West Coast. These new distribution centers will allow us to support our ongoing growth, optimize service times for our customers and drive efficiencies in cost over time. And given our ongoing retail real estate optimization efforts, we were pleased that we were able to help mitigate these incremental costs and hold the occupancy rate flat. \n Our SG&A rate continues to be at a historical low at 26.4%, leveraging 90 basis points over last year, driven by advertising and employment leverage from our strong topline performance and ongoing operational efficiency. Across the company, we continue to operate with a disciplined approach, challenging all expenditures to maximize the return from our spend. \n These results once again led to a record quarter of earnings with our most profitable Q2 ever, including operating income growth of 12% to $366 million, and an operating margin at 17.1%, expanding 40 basis points over last year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.87, up 19.4% from last year's record second quarter earnings per share of $3.24. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $125 million with no debt outstanding and year-to-date operating cash flow of $384 million. This year-to-date cash flow allowed us to fund the operations of the business and to almost double our capital investments to support our growth. In addition, we returned excess cash year-to-date of almost $880 million to shareholders, through $113 million in dividends and $766 million in share repurchases, a significant increase over last year at this time. These elevated share repurchase levels reflect the confidence we have in the long-term strength of our business and demonstrate our commitment to maximizing shareholder returns. \n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories, which include in-transit inventory, were $1.542 billion, increasing 32% over our reduced levels last year. Inventory on hand increased 28% over last year, but was only up 1% to 2019 versus sales up 56% over the same time frame. In the quarter, back order levels decreased. However, they continue to be too high in total. We are working hard to get these goods in to fulfill our customer orders. We believe that we will be able to return to normalized back order levels next year. \n Turning to our expectations for the remainder of the year and beyond. We are reiterating our fiscal year '22 and long-term financial outlook of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth, growing revenues to $10 billion by 2024 with operating margins relatively in line with fiscal year 2021. Our reiteration of our outlook simply acknowledges that the economic backdrop remains uncertain with currently unknown outcomes surrounding spending trends, inflation, interest rates, supply chain pressures and global unrest. The fundamentals of our business remains strong, evidenced by our first half outperformance and the accelerating demand comps we are seeing as we enter the third quarter. \n Our confidence to achieve our revenue outlook is rooted in 3 tangible drivers. Our year-to-date trends, which continue to outpace the industry and reflect market share gains, our continued improvement in our inventory receipts expected through the back half, which will enable us to fill prior orders and lower our elevated back order levels and our ongoing strength in our growth initiatives, which continue to build momentum. \n From a profitability perspective, we expect cost pressures to continue in the back half and into the beginning of 2023, particularly across our supply chain, from the incremental distribution centers and related costs to support our growth plus higher ocean freight and other freight-related costs resulting from the global supply chain disruptions and our efforts to best serve our customers by delivering product to them as timely as possible. \n Despite these pressures, we remain confident in our ability to achieve fiscal year operating margins relatively in line with our fiscal year '21 rate at 17.7%, which was an all-time high, given our strong start to the year and our culture of strong financial discipline. \n In summary, we are very proud of the results we continue to deliver for our customers, associates and shareholders. These results further validate our ability to deliver sustainable strong growth and profitability. As we continue to navigate the dynamic changes in the macro environment, we are confident that our strong foundation of differentiators and our operating model as well as the momentum of our growth initiatives will continue to keep us ahead of the competition. And this, combined with an environment where consumers are shifting increasingly online and are prioritizing value and sustainability in their purchases now more than ever, leave us uniquely positioned to continue to take market share and profitably. \n Finally, I would like to thank all our associates for their hard work and relentlessness in driving these great results. \n I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Max, it's Julie. So as we said in our prepared remarks, our demand comps remained positive and healthy and, in fact, accelerated as we entered into the third quarter. They are lower than our double-digit net comps. We had alluded to that in our last call that we had seen the demand comps start to moderate. But they are nothing like what we've heard others indicate or report. And so we're pleased to see that we were able to deliver accelerated comps this quarter both driven by healthy demand and our accelerating net bill, and we're seeing both of those accelerate into the third quarter. Not financially, but yes, MMU has expanded. And the delta is on our gross margin is simply just the shipping cost. But the MMU still remains strong. It's another quarter of expansion that we're seeing. And so even with the promotional environment, we're still able to drive that. Yes. I mean I would say we do. We certainly expect it to improve as we move throughout the back half. I think what's important to remember is that, I mean, first of all, as far as our growth to date, it's 32%, but it's still 1% on a 3-year basis versus 56% up on sales. And we are dealing with a lot of -- we're shifting more to furniture and bigger cube items, and we're dealing with inventory coming in both to fill back orders but also to fill our current demand. And so that creates a lot of inventory coming in at the same time. And yet at the same time, we still need to get more inventory in to be in stock. And we still, as Laura mentioned, need to be thoughtful about the inventory that's aging to be able to get it pushed out. So we have more room in the distribution center. So as we move to the back half, we do expect our inventory levels to get better but we'll still have elevated backorder levels into the first half of 2023. Yes. So there's 2 things there. First of all, I mean, we are obviously reiterating our strong guidance giving a nod the fact that the environment is uncertain. So we're being cautious on that, but there is definitely some pressure that we're going to feel on the op margin line, particularly associated with these ongoing supply chain costs. So we're going to continue to have incremental distribution center costs. We've got ocean freight costs that are higher along with dray and demurrage costs. So there's all the costs that are increased to get the goods to us. And then incrementally, we are doing the right thing by our customer to accelerate getting the goods to them. And so there'll be incremental cost for out-of-market shipments and for multiple shipments that we typically would have done in a single shipment. .\n The one thing from a modeling perspective to make sure you're aware, if you remember last year in Q3, we had higher spot rate charges, and so that will help us to partially offset some of that incremental cost in Q3, but Q4, we didn't have that last year. And so you'll see that the Q4 is going to be a bigger impact than the Q3. But at the end of the day, of course, we will do everything we can to mitigate it as we always do. And thankfully, with the strength that we've had in the first half of the year, we are very confident in our ability to hit our operating margin in line with '21, which, as you know, is a 17.7% and the highest we've ever had. I mean I wouldn't assume that that would go up per se. I mean we've always had inventories that ages, and we've always had to clear it. We've had warehouse sales for a while now. So I don't think there's anything there that is a significant shift, it should be concerning from a promotional stance or a margin perspective. Remember, most of what we sell is core. And so we're different than the apparel companies and so forth. And so as you get more inventory and you come back in stock, if it comes in late, there's a lot more pressure for them to push it out and get it out of the distribution center. For us, it's just a space play. And so we'll continue to have markdowns and things like that where we need to get rid of aged inventory, but there's no substantial shift that should occur. Yes. I mean we're going to continue with buybacks and our dividends, of course, maybe not to the same degree we'll see. Certainly, we still believe our stock is undervalued. It has recovered nicely. We're pleased that we were able to buy the stock back on average for about $138, and obviously, stock is much higher now, but it's still undervalued. And so we're going to continue as long as we have some really strong free cash flow and are generating this kind of earnings and cash that we are, we think the right thing to do is to return it to our shareholders. So we're still committed to doing that. Yes. I mean we haven't disclosed the total amount, as you guys know, but it has come down, but it's still incredibly sizable. I think we may have said before that most of the back orders associated with furniture. So certainly, Pottery Barn and West Elm have a sizable amount of back orders, but every brand has them. And the good news is we are starting to bring that balance down, and certainly, that's a tailwind for the back half and as we move into 2023. Pottery Barn is our largest brand. Yes, it will be a little bit higher, kind of similar to where it has been now because of those incremental distribution centers. At the same time, we've had some offsite that should be coming off. We've got some incremental hubs that over time will come off. But I think the bigger play, as you know, is our retail real estate optimization strategy, and most of our stores that we plan on closing close at the end of the year. And so as you start to lap into the new year, you'll get the benefit again from that reduced occupancy costs associated with those stores. So -- but in the shorter term, yes, there will be pressure on that line. No, that's exactly right. I mean as we said in our last call, as we started that call or that quarter, we saw demand comps moderate. And we're really pleased and excited to see them coming back and accelerating and being strong, heading into third quarter. And so we haven't seen, again, what others are mentioning out there. So it's really different for certain retailers. And thankfully, we're one of those that are seeing real strength in our business. Yes. We said -- I mentioned this to you in the past, but it's accretive to our total company operating margin at this time. So as that business continues to grow, we get the incremental benefit on the bottom line. Yes. I think the bigger change is in the ocean freight side of things and the dray and the demurrage as we're getting these big volumes of inventory coming in, there are containers that need to be moved around, need to be stored accordingly. And ocean freight rates, as has been the case for everybody, have gone up. And so that happened sort of I think it was May or June, and then as you know, those sort of charges get capitalized on the balance sheet as part of inventory, and so you don't recognize those until you make sales. So it's a function of turn, which is why we're starting to feel some of those more towards the back half. But that's the reason."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJeremy Brooks: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including guidance for fiscal '22 and our long-term outlook. Although we believe these statements reflect our best estimates and all available information, we cannot make any assurances that these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call.\n Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, along with an explanation of how and why we use these measures, appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier today. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our periodic and annual filings with the SEC.\n Finally, the call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on our Investor Relations website.\n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer. \nLaura Alber: Thanks, Jeremy. Good afternoon, everyone. We've been looking forward to this release. The first quarter of fiscal '22 represented another quarter of outperformance with a 9.5% comp on the top line with both demand and net sales in line with each other and 19.5% growth on the bottom line to $3.50 per share. \n These results continue to demonstrate the strength of our multibrand portfolio and our team's ability to navigate challenges and outperform. These results are even more impressive when considering that we were up against last year's strong performance with a comp of more than 40%. We are confident in our annual guidance and longer-term goal of $10 billion in revenues by 2024 with growth across our core businesses and within our B2B, marketplace and global initiatives.\n Understanding our industry is key to putting our outstanding results in perspective. We operate in a large and fragmented industry that generates more than half of its sales from smaller brick-and-mortar retailers that do not have sophisticated e-commerce capabilities. We are one of the strongest market players, and we believe we have an opportunity to capture more of this $830 billion total addressable market. Our revenues in FY '21 of $8.2 billion represented just about 1% of the opportunity, and we continue to prove our ability to incrementally capture share.\n The current economic environment is challenging, but the housing market remains strong. Hybrid work means people will continue to spend more time in their homes, and the rising costs related to gas and travel have historically led people to stay at home to cook and entertain. We believe that these 3 trends will result in continued momentum to outfit and improve the home. And as a company, we are prepared to manage through economic uncertainty. We are a multichannel portfolio of brands with a management team that has expertise and experience in managing through historical times of economic challenge.\n Another large point of change in our industry is the movement of the consumer to purchase online. Further compounding this trend is the arrival of the millennial generation to the household creation stage. In an industry occupied by companies who are behind in developing their digital experiences and capabilities and pure plays that don't have experience running stores, we believe we are well positioned as a digital-first but not digital-only company.\n These macro trends are perfectly aligned with our key differentiators. Our customers continue to look for us and turn to us for our exclusive, inspirational and high-quality products that we are able to value-engineer because of our in-house design capabilities. The benefits of our in-house design capabilities extend far beyond physical product design. We've also been able to design our own supply chain efficiencies and proprietary technology that allowed us -- has allowed our business to be resilient.\n Our channel strategy provides a competitive edge in scaling the business into the future compared to both retail and marketplace-only players. And of course, our values, which are deeply rooted in sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion, are embedded in our products and central in our actions. These principles will continue to be fundamental to our customers, who have shown us they will use their disposable income and purchasing power to support what is important to them. In fact, in a recent survey released in April, more than half of consumers said they're willing to pay a premium for sustainable products.\n All of this, combined with our growth strategies, not only provide for sizable opportunities to grow our core business but also to drive momentum in reaching new customers, geographies and industries. This expansion and diversification of our customer base presents many exciting opportunities to deliver solutions for underserved markets.\n Our B2B business had its largest quarter ever, driving almost $250 million in demand and increasing 53% over last year. We are winning in the space by leaning into our best-in-class in-house product design capabilities to develop products specifically for large contract projects. This, along with the continued expansion of our client base is not only growing our book of business but also allowing us to focus on a wide breadth of client types and industry verticals.\n For instance, in the hospitality industry, we continue to establish ourselves as a trusted partner in the large project space, including recent installs at Marriott's new headquarter hotel. In terms of B2B recognition, in April, we won an award for the Best Booth at the Hospitality Design Expo, which is North America's largest hospitality-focused trade show. Heading into Q2, this business has strong momentum and energy.\n Turning to marketing. We are pleased with the performance of our investments. This quarter, we delivered strong top line growth while leveraging our advertising spend. Key drivers of this efficiency include our proprietary in-house platform, which gives us the ability to identify customers who are in the market for home furnishings and ensures we are optimizing the spend per customer through our loyalty program and our cross-brand marketing.\n On the digital front, during the quarter, we focused our efforts on 2 main areas: improving the conversion funnel throughout the customer journey and driving our AUR with enhanced product recommendation functionality and an improved furniture shopping experience.\n On the sustainability front, our ESG leadership continues to distinguish our brands individually and our company as a whole. We are well on our way in our expanded cross-brand commitment to plant 6 million trees through 2023 in partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation.\n Also, we launched an internal award for sustainable innovation. It's called the Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Good By Design Changemaker. This award celebrates associates doing great things across the company in sustainability. And we were recognized for the fifth year as a REPREVE Champion of Sustainability for the use of recycled materials.\n Now I'd like to talk about our global business. We continue our franchise-first strategy, focusing on both retail and digital execution. We are building our franchise presence in markets like the Middle East with 3 new stores opening in Dubai during the quarter and with more global stores coming in 2022.\n Before we get into the brands, I want to take a minute to talk about the supply chain, where we continue to experience delays, challenges and additional costs across our network. We continue to navigate through challenging starts and stops from COVID-related pressures and shortages of raw materials and labor. Nonetheless, we are focused on meeting the expectations of our customers, and we are pleased that our customer satisfaction scores remain high and that we are beginning to see some improvement with in-stock inventory across our brands.\n And now let's turn to the performance of our brands that comprise our portfolio. Pottery Barn delivered another high-performance quarter with a comp of 14.6% on top of 41.3% last year or 55.9% on a 2-year basis. All channels and product categories contributed to driving incremental demand. Our high-quality proprietary furniture business continues to lead the growth. We see strength across the business in core product, new offerings and our seasonal inventories.\n In our stores, we see particular strength in our design services. As we move to Q2 and the summer season, we have further extended these services into outdoor spaces, and our newly remodeled stores continue to outperform expectations with a reimagined store design that has expanded the footprint for displaying lifestyle furniture in store.\n Moving to West Elm. West Elm delivered a 12.8% comp in the first quarter on top of 50.9% last year or 63.7% on a 2-year basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in furniture. Customers responded to new collections and line extensions and incremental sizes and aesthetics. Additionally, new categories such as kids and bath are also fueling incremental growth.\n Looking forward to Q2, we are particularly excited to launch our expanded B2B West Elm assortment and customer experience, specifically servicing the many small- and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. We are uniquely positioned to offer a broad assortment of full space, performance-led design solutions directly to these customers. This is an important initiative in our long-term strategy to capture additional growth to become a $3 billion brand. \n Now I'd like to update you on our Pottery Barn Kids and Teen business. In our Q4 call, we talked about the challenges in our children's business driven by supply chain pressure out of Vietnam. This continued into Q1, and the brands ran a negative 3.1% comp. We have seen recovery in inventory in the business. However, our back orders remain at significant levels, and our back order rates -- our creation rates are still higher than last year. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect to see recovery in inventory levels in the back half.\n Also impacted by out-of-stocks is our Williams-Sonoma brand with a fourth quarter comp of negative 2.2% following a 35.3% comp last year. Unfortunately, these out-of-stocks were in some key programs that had an outsized impact on our exclusive products. On a 3-year basis, on-hand inventories are down almost 40% in Williams-Sonoma on sales growth of 30%. We are focused on getting more in stock, and we believe we will see the recovery before Q4.\n As part of the Williams-Sonoma brand, our Williams-Sonoma Home business ran a high double-digit comp this quarter and continues to be an opportunity. Given the strength of the Williams-Sonoma brand name, our expertise in the furniture category and the clear opportunity in the high-end home market, we believe that Williams-Sonoma Home is destined to be a product leader of distinctive, design-led, high-quality furnishing.\n And finally, let's not forget about our emerging brands, which include Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham. Together, these businesses ran a 31% comp this quarter, and they continue to outperform. We are confident in these brands and their ability to contribute to the long-term growth of our company. In fact, we believe Rejuvenation, which is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, has the potential to be our next $1 billion brand.\n In summary, we are proud of our continued outperformance. As we look to the balance of the year, we remain confident and committed to our guidance of mid- to high single-digit comps with operating margins relatively aligned to fiscal '21. We have a solid lineup of growth initiatives and operational improvements planned for the balance of the year. And as we look further, we are confident in our path to be a $10 billion company by 2024.\n Before I pass the call to Julie to go through the financials in more detail, I want to thank our customers, our employees and our shareholders. We are committed to delivering for all of our stakeholders. \n And with that, I'd like to turn the call to Julie. \nJulie Whalen: Thank you, Laura, and hello, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of outstanding financial results with strong top line growth at record profitability levels, including revenue comps of 9.5%, operating margins expanding 120 basis points to 17.1% with gross margin expanding 80 basis points and EPS growing 19.5% to $3.50. \n Our results are even more impressive considering we were up against our strongest year-over-year compare, and we outperformed against the backdrop of ongoing macro volatility, including continued global supply chain pressures, rising inflation, increasing interest rates and the continued evolution of consumer spending in a post-pandemic world. Our results further validate the demand for our proprietary and sustainable products, the success of our growth strategies and the efficiencies of our operating model, highlighting why we believe we are best positioned to succeed in the short and long term with strong profitable growth. \n Moving to our first quarter results in more detail. Net revenues grew to nearly $1.9 billion with comparable brand revenue growth at 9.5%, which was in line with our demand comp. And this growth was on top of a 40.4% comp last year for a 2-year stack of 50%. These strong top line results actualized in both channels, including retail at a 14.4% comp, which was an 82.1% 2-year stack despite retail traffic still negative 20% to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. And in e-commerce, we delivered a 7.3% comp on top of a 30.6% comp last year, maintaining our e-commerce mix as a percent of total revenues at 65%.\n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin came in at a record 43.8%, an 80 basis point expansion over last year, driven primarily by the strength of our merchandise margins where we're able to continue to preserve our pricing integrity without utilizing site-wide promotions. The demand for our full-priced products once again allowed us to more than offset higher product and freight costs while still delivering record margins and strong top line sales.\n Occupancy costs came in at 9.9% of net revenues and leveraged 20 basis points, resulting from another quarter of higher sales and lower occupancy dollar growth. Occupancy dollars increased 6.1% to approximately $186 million, which includes the incremental costs from our new East Coast distribution center to support our strong customer demand as well as higher depreciation costs primarily from our capital expenditures to support our e-commerce business. All of this was partially offset by our ongoing retail optimization actions. The occupancy benefits we are seeing from our rent renegotiations and the incremental net closure of 37 stores at the end of 2021 has enabled us to minimize occupancy dollar growth and deliver this leverage.\n Our SG&A rate was a first quarter low of 26.7%, leveraging 40 basis points over last year, driven primarily by employment and advertising. This leverage was a function of our strong top line performance and operational efficiencies, holding our payroll costs, advertising and general expense growth below sales growth. We are proud of the disciplined culture we have built, which demands efficiency and returns from our spend.\n These results led to our most profitable Q1 ever with operating income growth of 16% to $323 million and an operating margin at 17.1%, our highest non-holiday quarter ever, expanding 120 basis points over last year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.50, up 19.5% from last year's record first quarter earnings per share of $2.93. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with strong liquidity levels with a cash balance of $325 million and no debt outstanding. Our strong liquidity and operating cash flow of almost $185 million during the quarter allowed us to not only fund the operations of the business but to also invest in the business at higher year-over-year levels in the form of $71 million in capital expenditures to pay incremental dividends increasing to over $58 million in the quarter and to repurchase a record $500 million in shares, a 60% year-over-year first quarter increase off of a prior year high.\n These decisions reflect our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders. And with our strong and disciplined balance sheet, combined with our expected cash flow strength and our remaining over $1 billion share repurchase authorization, this allows us the flexibility to continue to opportunistically invest in our own stock and drive long-term shareholder returns.\n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories, which include in-transit inventory, were $1,396,000,000, increasing 28.4% over depressed levels last year. Inventory on hand increased 17.7% over last year. And our units were only up 1% year-over-year, which primarily reflects the mix shift to higher AUR furniture inventory. And on a 3-year basis, our on-hand inventory was down nearly 7% to 2019 pre-pandemic levels as compared to sales that have grown over 50% over the same time frame. \n As a result, given our ongoing higher sales volumes, our continued elevated back order levels and the significant macro supply chain disruptions we are still experiencing, we are still below optimal levels, particularly in our best-selling back-ordered items. And we expect this to continue into the back half of 2022.\n Now let me turn to our expectations for the rest of the year and beyond. We remain optimistic in the long-term outlook of the business. As a result, we are reiterating our financial outlook of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth with operating margins relatively in line with 2021. We are confident in our ability to deliver our revenue outlook given the strength of our business year-to-date, the momentum in our growth initiatives such as B2B and our expected sequential improvement in our in-stock inventory levels, enabling us to fill our significant back orders and recognize net revenue and potentially at a higher comp than demand even if demand were to soften as we move throughout the year.\n From a profitability perspective, we remain confident in our ability to hold our operating margins relatively in line with 2021 despite expected ongoing cost pressures. Like everyone else, we are experiencing higher product costs and supply chain-related costs, including higher freight, and incremental distribution center costs for additional space to support our overall growth and our ongoing mix shift to furniture that is a larger cube.\n We are also experiencing higher costs to best serve our customers to get product to them as timely as possible by shipping product from out-of-market distribution centers. And for multiunit orders, we are shipping multiple times to the same customer, which typically would have all been done in one shipment * and an incremental cost to us. \n However, because of the power of our operating model, we believe we are best positioned to mitigate these costs in both the short and long term, whether it is the leverage from our higher sales on our path to $10 billion; the accelerating expansion of our highly accretive growth initiatives such as B2B; the growth of our e-commerce business, which operates at a higher margin profile; our strong merchandise margins from the pricing power our proprietary and vertically integrated products provide; our retail optimization efforts, reducing rents and other efficiencies to drive margins more in line with e-commerce; various supply chain efficiencies, including automation and in-stock inventory levels over time; and our continued emphasis on strong financial discipline.\n We continue to believe the combination of all of these opportunities provides several levers we can utilize to drive incremental earnings to offset higher costs. And this is what gives us the confidence to hold our operating margins relatively in line with last year. \n In summary, we are pleased with our outperformance this quarter. These results further validate that our key differentiators, our incremental growth strategies and our proven operational execution, combined with an environment where consumers are investing more in their homes, are shifting increasingly online and are prioritizing value and sustainability in their purchases now more than ever before, leave us uniquely positioned to continue to take market share and profitably in this evolving macro environment.\n And this, combined with our strong operating cash flow and liquidity, our operational levers that enable us to help mitigate incremental costs, along with a proven track record of strong financial discipline and a tenured management team with a winning culture, give us the confidence to reiterate our accelerated long-term growth and profitability outlook of $10 billion in revenues by 2024 with operating margins relatively in line with last year and to drive strong financial returns for our shareholders.\n Finally, I would like to thank our associates for all that they do to make our company great. The commitment, creativity and integrity of our talent is the backbone for the results we continue to deliver.\n And now I'd like to open the call for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham: Congrats on a set of great results. My question is on the demand outlook. Are you seeing any slowdown in demand as you look into the second quarter here? And how are you considering the demand comp relative to sales comp for the balance of the year? \nJulie Whalen: Seth, it's Julie. As far as the -- I mean, first of all, the first quarter, we certainly haven't seen it. You could see it in our results with a 9.5% comp on top of the 40% last year with a 50% 2-year stack, and we said that demand is in line with that. When we're talking about the second quarter, I mean, we're really only 3 weeks into the quarter. It's super early. But we have seen some short-term moderation in demand sales within our portfolio of brands, but nothing to the degree that we're hearing others reporting out there at all. \n And remember, from a net perspective or our actual reported results, we have seen and expect to continue to see sequential improvement in our in-stock inventory levels, enabling us to fill significant back orders and recognize net revenue even if demand were to wane as we move throughout the year. So this, of course, combined with, as we said, our key differentiators, our incremental growth strategies and our operational execution, make us best positioned to outperform even in an evolving macro environment. \nSeth Basham: Okay. And just to reframe the question, thinking about that delta between demand and sales comps, how much would demand have to slow for you to come in at the low end of your guidance? \nJulie Whalen: We haven't disclosed that. But I think, obviously, we have said many times that we have significant amount of backlog that gives us the confidence to move throughout the year to be able to hit our guidance on the year. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Julie, congratulations on really remarkable results. Laura, so here's -- I guess here is where the macro and kind of your results don't kind of mesh. A couple of days ago, sales of new homes were down about 17% in April, rising prices, higher mortgage rates, et cetera. How do you put what's happening with the overall kind of like the big macro backdrop with your results? And I know that you did -- you went over several things. But is it the millennials that are continuing that home buying where you have really that touch point? And what do you look for in order to see whether the macro might ultimately impact you? \nLaura Alber: That's a good question because on my desk today, I got a report from Google with some, I think, pretty fresh data. And here are some interesting stats. Nearly 40% of Americans are pondering a move in 2022, and most hope to buy. The desire for more space is the #1 reason Americans plan to move. Others have certain features in mind. Those features include outdoor space and a large kitchen, also pet friendly, which is really consistent with what we do in all of our brands with the casual lifestyle that we show. \n And so there's all sorts of different pieces about the macro you can read negatively. And then there's things like this and the reality that I said in the prepared remarks about people working from home, people learn how to cook. They care more about their homes. They have invested. And now they're moving. They want to move. And when you talk to -- we talked to New York about this, talked to many people. Most people are planning a remodel, or they're planning to move, and that drives our sales more than anything else.\n And as we also know, the market is so fractured. Let's say I'm wrong and the housing comes in a little -- there's still a lot of room to pick up share because we are so small -- even though we're the leader, we're still so small relative to the total addressable market. And so I just -- I really believe that with our differentiators, which make us really unique, and that, combined with our growth initiatives, they are not just a plan, but you see them actualize. You see us prove it. Now many quarters in a row despite what others might think, we keep proving that we have a big runway on these initiatives. Now those are all things that are really in our favor right now and very real. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Okay. And then for Julie, always helping to shape the near-end quarter, the quarter that we're in, 2Q. I know you gave sort of long, long-term LRP guidance and then for the year. But how should we think about kind of the trends, the momentum continuing into May? How should we think about gross margin? Should we just think of Q2 as a continuum of what we're seeing here today in Q1? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I mean obviously, we're not providing quarterly guidance. But we would say, as we've said before, you need to kind of stick within our band range on the top line that we've said for the year. I would say on the gross margin line, certainly, there could be pressure from supply chain costs that we've been experiencing, like everybody else has. But we're committed on the year to hitting our operating margin relatively in line with 2021, which, as a reminder, is more than 2x where it was 2 years ago. So we feel really good about that. And obviously, we've proven that we can do that with this quarter's results being up 120 basis points. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Congrats on a really tremendous quarter. I just wanted to follow up on Seth's question on the slowing demand comp. Curious when that began in the quarter. And we heard from a lot of retailers that business started to slow in the middle of March. And I know that started for you at that point in time. And I guess curious if it happened across all 4 banners equally or if it was with the PB and West Elm parts of the business where the tickets are greater. \nJulie Whalen: Yes. So I mean I guess I wouldn't read too much into it. As I said before, it's been 3 weeks into the second quarter. Clearly, with our performance in Q1 and the demand in line with net, we don't really see it in Q1. And Q2, it's 3 weeks in. And so I specifically said that it's within our portfolio of brands, so it's not necessarily across all. And we've seen things improve as well. So it's just -- it's very short term, this moderation we have seen. And at the end of the day, because of our net bill and B2B and everything else that we have going from our growth initiatives perspective, we feel very confident in our outlook for the year. \nCharles Grom: Okay. Great. And just a quick follow-up would be you've had great success raising prices over the past 12 to 24 months. When we look at recent trends and more particularly demand trends, is there any pushback on higher prices, any demand destruction? It doesn't sound like it, but we're hearing that from other retailers. And I didn't know if you were saying it so far. \nJulie Whalen: No, we haven't seen it. I mean furniture is our biggest growth vehicle. Furniture has been very, very good for us. And so you would think that if there was a problem with big ticket or higher prices or things like that, we'd see that coming down, and we have not. That merch has been very strong for us. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez with the Telsey Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernandez: Congratulations also on a really great result. I wanted to ask about promotions. And it definitely looks like a lot of retailers either are starting to get more promotional or expect to be as the year progresses. What is your stance in case -- in the event the industry gets more promotional? \nLaura Alber: Thanks, Cristina. It's Lauren. We've definitely seen more promotional environments, especially as you heard about the general softness out there. And it really hasn't changed our stance at all, as you can see by the results we just put up. We made a strategic decision not to do site-wide promotions, and that has not changed. And you can see from pre-pandemic to now, we are a much more profitable business. And this is a structural change for us and one that we continue to see opportunity in once we get out of the supply chain costly year that we're in. There's a lot of things that we expect to have the improvements to our operations, not this year, but into the future. \n And so we are always looking at turning our inventory, being better at inventory accuracy and getting rid of slow movers. And you're going to constantly see us package those things up and make them really appealing to our customers. So it's very different than wholesale price reductions across the board that you see many using right now. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Jason Haas with Bank of America. \nJason Haas: The first is just on a definition question. When you say that demand and net sales were in line with each other, are you referring to the dollar amount? Or is that also the growth rates were in line with each other? \nJulie Whalen: Relatively one and the same. But yes, I mean, I would focus on the growth rate, but if the growth rates are the same, then the demand -- I mean, the dollars have to be close as well. Yes. \nJason Haas: Got it. That's helpful. That makes sense. That's what I thought. In terms of -- I wanted to dig into the advertising expense a little bit. I think there was a point of deleverage through last year and I think in 4Q as well. And I know you called it out as a point of leverage now. So I'm curious, what are you changing there that's different there to drive that leverage? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. I think if you recall, last year, we were basically getting our advertising dollars back to the level they were previously. So in 2020, it was one of the big drivers for cost cuts as we are moving throughout that year. And so as we said all throughout 2021 that we are investing back into advertising for the future, long-term health of the business. And so last year was more of a year of deleverage. \n And now that we've sort of lapped that, we now are back to more normalized levels of advertising, and we're very happy to see that we were able to generate leverage with the top line sales and our philosophy of ROI on advertising spend. We don't spend advertising to go get customer counts or traffic numbers or -- we do advertising to get a return because we think that's the right thing to do. And so that's what we generated this quarter. \nLaura Alber: I'd just say also, as a portfolio of brands, we have a big advantage because we're bidding as one. We're not bidding separately. And also, we're looking at what works in one brand and applying it to the other. And that's a huge advantage as a multibrand company that we have. \n Felix, do you want to -- I know we just stole your thunder. We're so excited about marketing. Do you want to add to what Julie and I already said? \nFelix Carbullido: No, I think Julie is right. I mean everything we do is ROI-focused. And so when we see the return on investment, even if advertising costs go up, if we see AUR increases and dollars per customer increase, exceed that, we'll invest. So we have that ability to throttle given the business conditions because we manage it in-house and because we're all committed to the op margin growth. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Max Rakhlenko with Cowen and Company. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: So first, just if the industry were to slow, what are some tools and strategies that you have to play offense? And then what are some of those initiatives that you alluded to in your prepared remarks? \nJulie Whalen: Yes. So I mean from a leverage perspective, in a downturn, I think, first of all, we just went through this at the beginning of the pandemic. We've all been through it in '08 and '09. And thankfully, we have a lot of the same management team that's here, so we know how to do it. Hopefully, we're not in that situation. Certainly, we're not seeing anything close to that situation today. But we know how to pull back on expenses. We know how to cut inventory, capital, advertising, put a cease to all discretionary spend. \n On the flip side, to your point about being on the offense, as we're seeing other folks not have the same results as us and here we are with these incredible results and we're seeing that momentum continue, there's lots of opportunities there. I mean advertising is one example where people are pulling out from advertising. That could be an interesting play for us to play. But it really depends. Obviously, it's confidential as to what we want to -- what levers we can pull. But certainly, we can if we're generating the cash flow and the earnings that we are. \nLaura Alber: And then in terms of supply chain efficiencies, I think you asked that question as well as your second piece. So there's a lot of things that are getting better. They're still not where they should be. I do want to bring up a couple. So our Sutter Street upholstery operation has cut its lead time down in half from where it was last year. It's still too high, frankly, but we have the best custom quote times, I believe, in the market right now. \n In-stock improvement, less out of market, less duplicate shipping, reduction in damages, return rates, utilization of hubs, retail stores to drive efficiencies. I think we talked about this year, we've told you we're putting together -- we're opening a new Arizona distribution center. And we'll have more automation there. That should give us some efficiencies. And eventual reduction of shipping costs in general and reduction of the cost I brought up before of customer accommodations because we've been, and unfortunately, in some cases, with the Vietnam slowdown, so embarrassingly having to tell a customer 1 or 2 or 3x even that their delivery is delayed because of all the problems that we've had due to COVID in some of those countries. \n So it just begins the list of things I think about when you ask me about efficiencies into the future. And I'm excited when I hear about these opportunities because it means we can do better, and that's our mantra, is to just make it better. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: Great. That's helpful. And just very quickly, I don't know if I missed it, but did you call out how your cancel rates are trending? And then I imagine that you check a lot of your competitors, but how do you rate how your lead times are today versus some of your top peers? \nJulie Whalen: As far as cancel rates, they're really low. I mean we haven't seen much movement from week to week, thankfully. I mean the customer is obviously voting with their wallet and they're willing to stay on and work with us to get the product that they want. And so we haven't seen that change at all. \n I don't know if you want to talk about the lead times. \nLaura Alber: Lead times. I mentioned the upholstery. It looks like we're significantly lower. Most people have about 100 days. On the other things -- and we have so many different brands, product lines. I can answer on one but not on all of them, so I'll hesitate to say what it is specifically other than it seems based on what the customers are telling us that we're faster. And exciting, we have some new tools that allow us to see what's in stock across brands. \n Yasir, do you want to comment about that? \nYasir Anwar: Yes. I think we've been continuously working on this opportunity of the challenges that we are seeing in inventory. And we have built our in-house, cross-brand, product finding tool that allows us to serve the customers even upfront, especially in the B2B channel. But also when there are situations whether there are gaps and delays, we can quickly find across the brand the right product the customer needs for their design, and it is turning out to be a very, very strong, powerful tool for us. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. \nOliver Wintermantel: Yes. I had a question regarding the divergence between the Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn Kids and Teens versus Pottery Barn and West Elm. Is that -- in your prepared remarks, you said it was out-of-stocks or you don't have enough inventory. Were these the only drivers for the divergence there? And when do you expect that to be getting better? And then on top of that is then would you expect Pottery Barn and West Elm to slow down in the second half? Or could we see then you being at the upper end of the spectrum of your guidance if that Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn teen and Kids improves? \nLaura Alber: Well, Oliver, I wish I had the crystal ball. We're confident in our guidance is what I'll say again, like Julie has said. In terms of our portfolio of brands, they serve sometimes similar markets but often different and -- life stages and product types. The product types that Kids and Teen serves were allotment -- many more were from Vietnam, unfortunately, furniture, and big backbone of that business is the furniture. And we all know what happened in Vietnam with the full shutdown. \n So it's been the one that has had the most out-of-stocks, the highest back orders, still continues to have the highest back order create rates versus Pottery Barn and West Elm have seen more recovery in their inventory. You can measure that by all the numbers we look at. And so that's been an advantage to them. \n And then Williams-Sonoma is in a totally different business: kitchenware, housewares, furniture. So they don't have the benefit of the strong furniture trend that we have. And as I said earlier, they had some out-of-stocks that were pretty unfortunate. And unfortunately, they affected the amount of exclusives that we presented to the customer, which is a big part of our strategy. You've heard us talk about that before. And I'm optimistic that we are going to get them in this year before holiday. \n Kids and Teen, I think it's going to be sooner than that. But I've predicted this before, and unfortunately, I've been wrong because you think you get one thing fixed and you have another problem happen in the supply chain. So it's good to have a portfolio of brands to produce results, and we are on top of the details. But in terms of the second half, that would be my best estimate. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Peter Benedict with Baird. \nPeter Benedict: I want to talk a little bit about the -- to ask you about the B2B business. It looks like it was probably over 60% of your growth in the first quarter. So incredibly robust. Can you help us maybe break down the future opportunity you see there? I know you expect to double it, I think, in the next 3 years, so another $750 million or so in revenue. Kind of where is that coming from? And I guess the real question is if -- is that less exposed to, let's say, the macro concerns that people have in the market right now around consumer spending and housing and all these types of things? Is that a business that you think can kind of be, I guess, a bit acyclical over the next few years? \nLaura Alber: Yes. It's great. It's a different customer. And the slowdown of the building and the pandemic means there's a backlog of all this. Remember they build, then they furnish. So there's, I think, more opportunity even now than there was. And we write estimates. We see our book. Our business is very strong. We haven't seen a slowdown. A big win for us. Clearly, one of our differentiators even if it's a more challenging environment in the future. \n And so it's across multiple verticals. We've told you that. We're excited because we're designing for people products that are specific to their needs, and then we're finding that those are just great wins for even consumer. So it's a really interesting innovator also of new product wins. \n And it's interesting also, it's becoming a real -- first, this is just an idea, and now it's big business. People are starting to take notice of it. And it's a really a source of confidence. Furniture is everywhere. It's not just in your home. And we're going to continue to invest in this white space, and we're winning awards. And we're building this business, and it's a competitive advantage. \nPeter Benedict: Absolutely. It sounds like -- and I know you guys asked only one question, but everyone seems to be asking 2. So I'll just throw one in. Can you give us a sense for how many shares you bought back in the quarter with that $500 million? \nJulie Whalen: I think that will be in the Q when we release the Q. So we'll give it to you then. But certainly, it was, as I said in my prepared remarks, that it's up 60% off of last year's all-time high. So it is considerable amount of shares that we bought. And we believe wholeheartedly, obviously, in the strength of our business and believe certainly that we're at a level of our stock price that we shouldn't be at. And so we're going to continue to opportunistically invest in our own company. \nOperator: And moving on to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My question is on ticket. Is there anything that's surprising you? Or maybe the spread between ticket and unit, is it widening? And then it sounds like given that there's higher costs coming into the system that maybe even higher prices maybe by the back half of the year. So how do you kind of weigh that trade-off with -- look, maybe macro headwinds or maybe not, but it feels like prices probably go even higher in the back half. And you're reiterating your guide, but curious how that fits into it. \nLaura Alber: A couple of things. First of all, it's not just about ticket of one thing. It's about our mix of business, right? So we are growing our furniture business, which has a higher ticket. And that's where our growth is coming versus the small business. So that is going to continue to be an interesting dynamic as we think about these things. So I don't think worrying about that as just an inflationary issue is the right way to think about it because I know that it's also because we're very deliberately building the world's greatest furniture business. \n So that's going to mean that ticket goes up. So that's the first. And then Pottery Barn is higher ticket, obviously, than some of our other brands, even higher than -- bed is more expensive than a crib. So if you don't need a crib -- there's so many dynamics underneath ticket as a question. So it's not just as easy as saying it's an inflationary issue. \n In terms of pricing, I mean, the first thing is we just we beat the op margin substantially. We're not guiding that beat through the balance of this year, okay? So that's because we know there's additional costs that are coming through the balance of this year. So it's not that we're raising prices. It's that we don't expect to be by -- how much we'd be by, Julie? \nJulie Whalen: 120 basis points. \nLaura Alber: 120 basis points. We said we're going to be in line for the balance of the year. \nSimeon Gutman: Fair enough. If I can sneak in my first follow-up question, outdoor and seasonal, is anything deferred, whether because it's coming in late or because the weather didn't break? And how do you plan that category? \nLaura Alber: I mean there's no specific weather pattern that I've ever seen, frankly, impact us. But versus last year, of course, coming out of COVID or because we're still in COVID, we sold it earlier. And so we're back at a more normalized curve for outdoor that's later in the season, which is actually a really good thing. We have a year-round business, so it's not a business that we just have during the summertime, and that also helps us with stability of inventory. But outdoor business is a very strong business for us. It's one where we continue to gain market share and push our assortments and have better product and better marketing. And it's a real growth vehicle for us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies. \nJonathan Matuszewski: Laura, Julie, great results. A follow-up question about a scenario of the economy slowing. Could you remind us how much of your COGS and SG&A could flex the fixed and variable split for both, if you could share? \nJulie Whalen: We've never really disclosed that. And I guess what I would say, what we've learned is nothing is fixed. If you're depending on the environment, we go after it all, and we've been very successful at that. So it's kind of irrelevant for us. We've been very successful going after it. \nLaura Alber: Remember, if prices come down, costs come down, too, from our vendors. \nJonathan Matuszewski: Okay. And just a quick follow-up on B2B. A lot of traction there. Any sense of how much of your business on B2B has been driven by repeat engagements? Presumably, if you've done a hotel or a satellite office for one hospitality or corporate client, how often does that translate into a future project? Trying to get a sense of how much of this is relationship-driven or would be open to kind of recurring competitive bidding. \nJulie Whalen: Yes. So that piece of the business is growing. But we still have a lot of small projects, too. We love both. So teasing it out that way. I don't think there's anything really to that yet other than to say that we're building this more consistent annuity business, and that will get more and more stable as we grow. \nOperator: And moving on to Steven Zaccone with Citi. \nSteven Zaccone: Great. I wanted to follow up on Simeon's question. So you referenced inventory on hand was up 17%, and then I think units on hand are up about 1%. Is that spread a good proxy to think about how much AUR is up? \nJulie Whalen: Not necessarily. It's mix shift. It's pricing. It's all sorts of things that are a combination that make up that delta. But I think the point there is to really think about that we don't have excess inventory like the other companies that have been reporting. We have been very thoughtful about that, and we only have 1% up in units to make the point that the 28% is overstated relative to what we've heard from others. \nSteven Zaccone: Got it. Perfect. The other question, just to follow up, I just want to make sure I understand the messaging correctly. So it sounds like there's some more costs coming online as we think about the balance of the year. Should we interpret that, that gross margin expansion gets a bit more challenging as we go through the year? I'm just trying to understand if that's new or is it just -- this is still a little bit of conservatism that you're factoring in on the gross margin line. \nJulie Whalen: It's possible. I mean certainly, we do have higher costs coming throughout the year. As we've said, we've got higher product costs, higher freight costs. There's costs that we're incurring to have additional distribution space to house the fact that we've got this mix shift to furniture, which is a larger cube. \n And we're also doing the right thing by our customers. As I said before, we are shipping things to them that are out of market -- from out-of-market distribution centers because we want to get it to them faster. Customer service is critical for us. And we might ship multiple times to a same customer if they've got a multiunit order. And we want to do the right thing by the customer. \n And so yes, there could be pressures moving through. But at the end of the day, we're committed to obviously doing everything we can to mitigate it as we've done in the past. And we are committed to holding our op margin on the year relatively in line, which, again, is more than 2x where it's been. \nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. \nLaura Alber: Yes. I just want to thank all of you for your support and interest in our company, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. \nOperator: Well, thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",

            "name": "Felix Carbullido",
            "content": "No, I think Julie is right. I mean everything we do is ROI-focused. And so when we see the return on investment, even if advertising costs go up, if we see AUR increases and dollars per customer increase, exceed that, we'll invest. So we have that ability to throttle given the business conditions because we manage it in-house and because we're all committed to the op margin growth."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremy. Good afternoon, everyone. We've been looking forward to this release. The first quarter of fiscal '22 represented another quarter of outperformance with a 9.5% comp on the top line with both demand and net sales in line with each other and 19.5% growth on the bottom line to $3.50 per share. \n These results continue to demonstrate the strength of our multibrand portfolio and our team's ability to navigate challenges and outperform. These results are even more impressive when considering that we were up against last year's strong performance with a comp of more than 40%. We are confident in our annual guidance and longer-term goal of $10 billion in revenues by 2024 with growth across our core businesses and within our B2B, marketplace and global initiatives.\n Understanding our industry is key to putting our outstanding results in perspective. We operate in a large and fragmented industry that generates more than half of its sales from smaller brick-and-mortar retailers that do not have sophisticated e-commerce capabilities. We are one of the strongest market players, and we believe we have an opportunity to capture more of this $830 billion total addressable market. Our revenues in FY '21 of $8.2 billion represented just about 1% of the opportunity, and we continue to prove our ability to incrementally capture share.\n The current economic environment is challenging, but the housing market remains strong. Hybrid work means people will continue to spend more time in their homes, and the rising costs related to gas and travel have historically led people to stay at home to cook and entertain. We believe that these 3 trends will result in continued momentum to outfit and improve the home. And as a company, we are prepared to manage through economic uncertainty. We are a multichannel portfolio of brands with a management team that has expertise and experience in managing through historical times of economic challenge.\n Another large point of change in our industry is the movement of the consumer to purchase online. Further compounding this trend is the arrival of the millennial generation to the household creation stage. In an industry occupied by companies who are behind in developing their digital experiences and capabilities and pure plays that don't have experience running stores, we believe we are well positioned as a digital-first but not digital-only company.\n These macro trends are perfectly aligned with our key differentiators. Our customers continue to look for us and turn to us for our exclusive, inspirational and high-quality products that we are able to value-engineer because of our in-house design capabilities. The benefits of our in-house design capabilities extend far beyond physical product design. We've also been able to design our own supply chain efficiencies and proprietary technology that allowed us -- has allowed our business to be resilient.\n Our channel strategy provides a competitive edge in scaling the business into the future compared to both retail and marketplace-only players. And of course, our values, which are deeply rooted in sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion, are embedded in our products and central in our actions. These principles will continue to be fundamental to our customers, who have shown us they will use their disposable income and purchasing power to support what is important to them. In fact, in a recent survey released in April, more than half of consumers said they're willing to pay a premium for sustainable products.\n All of this, combined with our growth strategies, not only provide for sizable opportunities to grow our core business but also to drive momentum in reaching new customers, geographies and industries. This expansion and diversification of our customer base presents many exciting opportunities to deliver solutions for underserved markets.\n Our B2B business had its largest quarter ever, driving almost $250 million in demand and increasing 53% over last year. We are winning in the space by leaning into our best-in-class in-house product design capabilities to develop products specifically for large contract projects. This, along with the continued expansion of our client base is not only growing our book of business but also allowing us to focus on a wide breadth of client types and industry verticals.\n For instance, in the hospitality industry, we continue to establish ourselves as a trusted partner in the large project space, including recent installs at Marriott's new headquarter hotel. In terms of B2B recognition, in April, we won an award for the Best Booth at the Hospitality Design Expo, which is North America's largest hospitality-focused trade show. Heading into Q2, this business has strong momentum and energy.\n Turning to marketing. We are pleased with the performance of our investments. This quarter, we delivered strong top line growth while leveraging our advertising spend. Key drivers of this efficiency include our proprietary in-house platform, which gives us the ability to identify customers who are in the market for home furnishings and ensures we are optimizing the spend per customer through our loyalty program and our cross-brand marketing.\n On the digital front, during the quarter, we focused our efforts on 2 main areas: improving the conversion funnel throughout the customer journey and driving our AUR with enhanced product recommendation functionality and an improved furniture shopping experience.\n On the sustainability front, our ESG leadership continues to distinguish our brands individually and our company as a whole. We are well on our way in our expanded cross-brand commitment to plant 6 million trees through 2023 in partnership with the Arbor Day Foundation.\n Also, we launched an internal award for sustainable innovation. It's called the Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Good By Design Changemaker. This award celebrates associates doing great things across the company in sustainability. And we were recognized for the fifth year as a REPREVE Champion of Sustainability for the use of recycled materials.\n Now I'd like to talk about our global business. We continue our franchise-first strategy, focusing on both retail and digital execution. We are building our franchise presence in markets like the Middle East with 3 new stores opening in Dubai during the quarter and with more global stores coming in 2022.\n Before we get into the brands, I want to take a minute to talk about the supply chain, where we continue to experience delays, challenges and additional costs across our network. We continue to navigate through challenging starts and stops from COVID-related pressures and shortages of raw materials and labor. Nonetheless, we are focused on meeting the expectations of our customers, and we are pleased that our customer satisfaction scores remain high and that we are beginning to see some improvement with in-stock inventory across our brands.\n And now let's turn to the performance of our brands that comprise our portfolio. Pottery Barn delivered another high-performance quarter with a comp of 14.6% on top of 41.3% last year or 55.9% on a 2-year basis. All channels and product categories contributed to driving incremental demand. Our high-quality proprietary furniture business continues to lead the growth. We see strength across the business in core product, new offerings and our seasonal inventories.\n In our stores, we see particular strength in our design services. As we move to Q2 and the summer season, we have further extended these services into outdoor spaces, and our newly remodeled stores continue to outperform expectations with a reimagined store design that has expanded the footprint for displaying lifestyle furniture in store.\n Moving to West Elm. West Elm delivered a 12.8% comp in the first quarter on top of 50.9% last year or 63.7% on a 2-year basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in furniture. Customers responded to new collections and line extensions and incremental sizes and aesthetics. Additionally, new categories such as kids and bath are also fueling incremental growth.\n Looking forward to Q2, we are particularly excited to launch our expanded B2B West Elm assortment and customer experience, specifically servicing the many small- and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. We are uniquely positioned to offer a broad assortment of full space, performance-led design solutions directly to these customers. This is an important initiative in our long-term strategy to capture additional growth to become a $3 billion brand. \n Now I'd like to update you on our Pottery Barn Kids and Teen business. In our Q4 call, we talked about the challenges in our children's business driven by supply chain pressure out of Vietnam. This continued into Q1, and the brands ran a negative 3.1% comp. We have seen recovery in inventory in the business. However, our back orders remain at significant levels, and our back order rates -- our creation rates are still higher than last year. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect to see recovery in inventory levels in the back half.\n Also impacted by out-of-stocks is our Williams-Sonoma brand with a fourth quarter comp of negative 2.2% following a 35.3% comp last year. Unfortunately, these out-of-stocks were in some key programs that had an outsized impact on our exclusive products. On a 3-year basis, on-hand inventories are down almost 40% in Williams-Sonoma on sales growth of 30%. We are focused on getting more in stock, and we believe we will see the recovery before Q4.\n As part of the Williams-Sonoma brand, our Williams-Sonoma Home business ran a high double-digit comp this quarter and continues to be an opportunity. Given the strength of the Williams-Sonoma brand name, our expertise in the furniture category and the clear opportunity in the high-end home market, we believe that Williams-Sonoma Home is destined to be a product leader of distinctive, design-led, high-quality furnishing.\n And finally, let's not forget about our emerging brands, which include Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham. Together, these businesses ran a 31% comp this quarter, and they continue to outperform. We are confident in these brands and their ability to contribute to the long-term growth of our company. In fact, we believe Rejuvenation, which is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, has the potential to be our next $1 billion brand.\n In summary, we are proud of our continued outperformance. As we look to the balance of the year, we remain confident and committed to our guidance of mid- to high single-digit comps with operating margins relatively aligned to fiscal '21. We have a solid lineup of growth initiatives and operational improvements planned for the balance of the year. And as we look further, we are confident in our path to be a $10 billion company by 2024.\n Before I pass the call to Julie to go through the financials in more detail, I want to thank our customers, our employees and our shareholders. We are committed to delivering for all of our stakeholders. \n And with that, I'd like to turn the call to Julie. That's a good question because on my desk today, I got a report from Google with some, I think, pretty fresh data. And here are some interesting stats. Nearly 40% of Americans are pondering a move in 2022, and most hope to buy. The desire for more space is the #1 reason Americans plan to move. Others have certain features in mind. Those features include outdoor space and a large kitchen, also pet friendly, which is really consistent with what we do in all of our brands with the casual lifestyle that we show. \n And so there's all sorts of different pieces about the macro you can read negatively. And then there's things like this and the reality that I said in the prepared remarks about people working from home, people learn how to cook. They care more about their homes. They have invested. And now they're moving. They want to move. And when you talk to -- we talked to New York about this, talked to many people. Most people are planning a remodel, or they're planning to move, and that drives our sales more than anything else.\n And as we also know, the market is so fractured. Let's say I'm wrong and the housing comes in a little -- there's still a lot of room to pick up share because we are so small -- even though we're the leader, we're still so small relative to the total addressable market. And so I just -- I really believe that with our differentiators, which make us really unique, and that, combined with our growth initiatives, they are not just a plan, but you see them actualize. You see us prove it. Now many quarters in a row despite what others might think, we keep proving that we have a big runway on these initiatives. Now those are all things that are really in our favor right now and very real. Thanks, Cristina. It's Lauren. We've definitely seen more promotional environments, especially as you heard about the general softness out there. And it really hasn't changed our stance at all, as you can see by the results we just put up. We made a strategic decision not to do site-wide promotions, and that has not changed. And you can see from pre-pandemic to now, we are a much more profitable business. And this is a structural change for us and one that we continue to see opportunity in once we get out of the supply chain costly year that we're in. There's a lot of things that we expect to have the improvements to our operations, not this year, but into the future. \n And so we are always looking at turning our inventory, being better at inventory accuracy and getting rid of slow movers. And you're going to constantly see us package those things up and make them really appealing to our customers. So it's very different than wholesale price reductions across the board that you see many using right now. I'd just say also, as a portfolio of brands, we have a big advantage because we're bidding as one. We're not bidding separately. And also, we're looking at what works in one brand and applying it to the other. And that's a huge advantage as a multibrand company that we have. \n Felix, do you want to -- I know we just stole your thunder. We're so excited about marketing. Do you want to add to what Julie and I already said? And then in terms of supply chain efficiencies, I think you asked that question as well as your second piece. So there's a lot of things that are getting better. They're still not where they should be. I do want to bring up a couple. So our Sutter Street upholstery operation has cut its lead time down in half from where it was last year. It's still too high, frankly, but we have the best custom quote times, I believe, in the market right now. \n In-stock improvement, less out of market, less duplicate shipping, reduction in damages, return rates, utilization of hubs, retail stores to drive efficiencies. I think we talked about this year, we've told you we're putting together -- we're opening a new Arizona distribution center. And we'll have more automation there. That should give us some efficiencies. And eventual reduction of shipping costs in general and reduction of the cost I brought up before of customer accommodations because we've been, and unfortunately, in some cases, with the Vietnam slowdown, so embarrassingly having to tell a customer 1 or 2 or 3x even that their delivery is delayed because of all the problems that we've had due to COVID in some of those countries. \n So it just begins the list of things I think about when you ask me about efficiencies into the future. And I'm excited when I hear about these opportunities because it means we can do better, and that's our mantra, is to just make it better. Lead times. I mentioned the upholstery. It looks like we're significantly lower. Most people have about 100 days. On the other things -- and we have so many different brands, product lines. I can answer on one but not on all of them, so I'll hesitate to say what it is specifically other than it seems based on what the customers are telling us that we're faster. And exciting, we have some new tools that allow us to see what's in stock across brands. \n Yasir, do you want to comment about that? Well, Oliver, I wish I had the crystal ball. We're confident in our guidance is what I'll say again, like Julie has said. In terms of our portfolio of brands, they serve sometimes similar markets but often different and -- life stages and product types. The product types that Kids and Teen serves were allotment -- many more were from Vietnam, unfortunately, furniture, and big backbone of that business is the furniture. And we all know what happened in Vietnam with the full shutdown. \n So it's been the one that has had the most out-of-stocks, the highest back orders, still continues to have the highest back order create rates versus Pottery Barn and West Elm have seen more recovery in their inventory. You can measure that by all the numbers we look at. And so that's been an advantage to them. \n And then Williams-Sonoma is in a totally different business: kitchenware, housewares, furniture. So they don't have the benefit of the strong furniture trend that we have. And as I said earlier, they had some out-of-stocks that were pretty unfortunate. And unfortunately, they affected the amount of exclusives that we presented to the customer, which is a big part of our strategy. You've heard us talk about that before. And I'm optimistic that we are going to get them in this year before holiday. \n Kids and Teen, I think it's going to be sooner than that. But I've predicted this before, and unfortunately, I've been wrong because you think you get one thing fixed and you have another problem happen in the supply chain. So it's good to have a portfolio of brands to produce results, and we are on top of the details. But in terms of the second half, that would be my best estimate. Yes. It's great. It's a different customer. And the slowdown of the building and the pandemic means there's a backlog of all this. Remember they build, then they furnish. So there's, I think, more opportunity even now than there was. And we write estimates. We see our book. Our business is very strong. We haven't seen a slowdown. A big win for us. Clearly, one of our differentiators even if it's a more challenging environment in the future. \n And so it's across multiple verticals. We've told you that. We're excited because we're designing for people products that are specific to their needs, and then we're finding that those are just great wins for even consumer. So it's a really interesting innovator also of new product wins. \n And it's interesting also, it's becoming a real -- first, this is just an idea, and now it's big business. People are starting to take notice of it. And it's a really a source of confidence. Furniture is everywhere. It's not just in your home. And we're going to continue to invest in this white space, and we're winning awards. And we're building this business, and it's a competitive advantage. A couple of things. First of all, it's not just about ticket of one thing. It's about our mix of business, right? So we are growing our furniture business, which has a higher ticket. And that's where our growth is coming versus the small business. So that is going to continue to be an interesting dynamic as we think about these things. So I don't think worrying about that as just an inflationary issue is the right way to think about it because I know that it's also because we're very deliberately building the world's greatest furniture business. \n So that's going to mean that ticket goes up. So that's the first. And then Pottery Barn is higher ticket, obviously, than some of our other brands, even higher than -- bed is more expensive than a crib. So if you don't need a crib -- there's so many dynamics underneath ticket as a question. So it's not just as easy as saying it's an inflationary issue. \n In terms of pricing, I mean, the first thing is we just we beat the op margin substantially. We're not guiding that beat through the balance of this year, okay? So that's because we know there's additional costs that are coming through the balance of this year. So it's not that we're raising prices. It's that we don't expect to be by -- how much we'd be by, Julie? 120 basis points. We said we're going to be in line for the balance of the year. I mean there's no specific weather pattern that I've ever seen, frankly, impact us. But versus last year, of course, coming out of COVID or because we're still in COVID, we sold it earlier. And so we're back at a more normalized curve for outdoor that's later in the season, which is actually a really good thing. We have a year-round business, so it's not a business that we just have during the summertime, and that also helps us with stability of inventory. But outdoor business is a very strong business for us. It's one where we continue to gain market share and push our assortments and have better product and better marketing. And it's a real growth vehicle for us. Remember, if prices come down, costs come down, too, from our vendors. Yes. I just want to thank all of you for your support and interest in our company, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter."

            "name": "Julie Whalen",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and hello, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of outstanding financial results with strong top line growth at record profitability levels, including revenue comps of 9.5%, operating margins expanding 120 basis points to 17.1% with gross margin expanding 80 basis points and EPS growing 19.5% to $3.50. \n Our results are even more impressive considering we were up against our strongest year-over-year compare, and we outperformed against the backdrop of ongoing macro volatility, including continued global supply chain pressures, rising inflation, increasing interest rates and the continued evolution of consumer spending in a post-pandemic world. Our results further validate the demand for our proprietary and sustainable products, the success of our growth strategies and the efficiencies of our operating model, highlighting why we believe we are best positioned to succeed in the short and long term with strong profitable growth. \n Moving to our first quarter results in more detail. Net revenues grew to nearly $1.9 billion with comparable brand revenue growth at 9.5%, which was in line with our demand comp. And this growth was on top of a 40.4% comp last year for a 2-year stack of 50%. These strong top line results actualized in both channels, including retail at a 14.4% comp, which was an 82.1% 2-year stack despite retail traffic still negative 20% to pre-pandemic levels in 2019. And in e-commerce, we delivered a 7.3% comp on top of a 30.6% comp last year, maintaining our e-commerce mix as a percent of total revenues at 65%.\n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin came in at a record 43.8%, an 80 basis point expansion over last year, driven primarily by the strength of our merchandise margins where we're able to continue to preserve our pricing integrity without utilizing site-wide promotions. The demand for our full-priced products once again allowed us to more than offset higher product and freight costs while still delivering record margins and strong top line sales.\n Occupancy costs came in at 9.9% of net revenues and leveraged 20 basis points, resulting from another quarter of higher sales and lower occupancy dollar growth. Occupancy dollars increased 6.1% to approximately $186 million, which includes the incremental costs from our new East Coast distribution center to support our strong customer demand as well as higher depreciation costs primarily from our capital expenditures to support our e-commerce business. All of this was partially offset by our ongoing retail optimization actions. The occupancy benefits we are seeing from our rent renegotiations and the incremental net closure of 37 stores at the end of 2021 has enabled us to minimize occupancy dollar growth and deliver this leverage.\n Our SG&A rate was a first quarter low of 26.7%, leveraging 40 basis points over last year, driven primarily by employment and advertising. This leverage was a function of our strong top line performance and operational efficiencies, holding our payroll costs, advertising and general expense growth below sales growth. We are proud of the disciplined culture we have built, which demands efficiency and returns from our spend.\n These results led to our most profitable Q1 ever with operating income growth of 16% to $323 million and an operating margin at 17.1%, our highest non-holiday quarter ever, expanding 120 basis points over last year. This resulted in diluted earnings per share of $3.50, up 19.5% from last year's record first quarter earnings per share of $2.93. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with strong liquidity levels with a cash balance of $325 million and no debt outstanding. Our strong liquidity and operating cash flow of almost $185 million during the quarter allowed us to not only fund the operations of the business but to also invest in the business at higher year-over-year levels in the form of $71 million in capital expenditures to pay incremental dividends increasing to over $58 million in the quarter and to repurchase a record $500 million in shares, a 60% year-over-year first quarter increase off of a prior year high.\n These decisions reflect our commitment to maximizing returns for our shareholders. And with our strong and disciplined balance sheet, combined with our expected cash flow strength and our remaining over $1 billion share repurchase authorization, this allows us the flexibility to continue to opportunistically invest in our own stock and drive long-term shareholder returns.\n Moving down the balance sheet. Merchandise inventories, which include in-transit inventory, were $1,396,000,000, increasing 28.4% over depressed levels last year. Inventory on hand increased 17.7% over last year. And our units were only up 1% year-over-year, which primarily reflects the mix shift to higher AUR furniture inventory. And on a 3-year basis, our on-hand inventory was down nearly 7% to 2019 pre-pandemic levels as compared to sales that have grown over 50% over the same time frame. \n As a result, given our ongoing higher sales volumes, our continued elevated back order levels and the significant macro supply chain disruptions we are still experiencing, we are still below optimal levels, particularly in our best-selling back-ordered items. And we expect this to continue into the back half of 2022.\n Now let me turn to our expectations for the rest of the year and beyond. We remain optimistic in the long-term outlook of the business. As a result, we are reiterating our financial outlook of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth with operating margins relatively in line with 2021. We are confident in our ability to deliver our revenue outlook given the strength of our business year-to-date, the momentum in our growth initiatives such as B2B and our expected sequential improvement in our in-stock inventory levels, enabling us to fill our significant back orders and recognize net revenue and potentially at a higher comp than demand even if demand were to soften as we move throughout the year.\n From a profitability perspective, we remain confident in our ability to hold our operating margins relatively in line with 2021 despite expected ongoing cost pressures. Like everyone else, we are experiencing higher product costs and supply chain-related costs, including higher freight, and incremental distribution center costs for additional space to support our overall growth and our ongoing mix shift to furniture that is a larger cube.\n We are also experiencing higher costs to best serve our customers to get product to them as timely as possible by shipping product from out-of-market distribution centers. And for multiunit orders, we are shipping multiple times to the same customer, which typically would have all been done in one shipment * and an incremental cost to us. \n However, because of the power of our operating model, we believe we are best positioned to mitigate these costs in both the short and long term, whether it is the leverage from our higher sales on our path to $10 billion; the accelerating expansion of our highly accretive growth initiatives such as B2B; the growth of our e-commerce business, which operates at a higher margin profile; our strong merchandise margins from the pricing power our proprietary and vertically integrated products provide; our retail optimization efforts, reducing rents and other efficiencies to drive margins more in line with e-commerce; various supply chain efficiencies, including automation and in-stock inventory levels over time; and our continued emphasis on strong financial discipline.\n We continue to believe the combination of all of these opportunities provides several levers we can utilize to drive incremental earnings to offset higher costs. And this is what gives us the confidence to hold our operating margins relatively in line with last year. \n In summary, we are pleased with our outperformance this quarter. These results further validate that our key differentiators, our incremental growth strategies and our proven operational execution, combined with an environment where consumers are investing more in their homes, are shifting increasingly online and are prioritizing value and sustainability in their purchases now more than ever before, leave us uniquely positioned to continue to take market share and profitably in this evolving macro environment.\n And this, combined with our strong operating cash flow and liquidity, our operational levers that enable us to help mitigate incremental costs, along with a proven track record of strong financial discipline and a tenured management team with a winning culture, give us the confidence to reiterate our accelerated long-term growth and profitability outlook of $10 billion in revenues by 2024 with operating margins relatively in line with last year and to drive strong financial returns for our shareholders.\n Finally, I would like to thank our associates for all that they do to make our company great. The commitment, creativity and integrity of our talent is the backbone for the results we continue to deliver.\n And now I'd like to open the call for questions. Thank you. Seth, it's Julie. As far as the -- I mean, first of all, the first quarter, we certainly haven't seen it. You could see it in our results with a 9.5% comp on top of the 40% last year with a 50% 2-year stack, and we said that demand is in line with that. When we're talking about the second quarter, I mean, we're really only 3 weeks into the quarter. It's super early. But we have seen some short-term moderation in demand sales within our portfolio of brands, but nothing to the degree that we're hearing others reporting out there at all. \n And remember, from a net perspective or our actual reported results, we have seen and expect to continue to see sequential improvement in our in-stock inventory levels, enabling us to fill significant back orders and recognize net revenue even if demand were to wane as we move throughout the year. So this, of course, combined with, as we said, our key differentiators, our incremental growth strategies and our operational execution, make us best positioned to outperform even in an evolving macro environment. We haven't disclosed that. But I think, obviously, we have said many times that we have significant amount of backlog that gives us the confidence to move throughout the year to be able to hit our guidance on the year. Yes. I mean obviously, we're not providing quarterly guidance. But we would say, as we've said before, you need to kind of stick within our band range on the top line that we've said for the year. I would say on the gross margin line, certainly, there could be pressure from supply chain costs that we've been experiencing, like everybody else has. But we're committed on the year to hitting our operating margin relatively in line with 2021, which, as a reminder, is more than 2x where it was 2 years ago. So we feel really good about that. And obviously, we've proven that we can do that with this quarter's results being up 120 basis points. Yes. So I mean I guess I wouldn't read too much into it. As I said before, it's been 3 weeks into the second quarter. Clearly, with our performance in Q1 and the demand in line with net, we don't really see it in Q1. And Q2, it's 3 weeks in. And so I specifically said that it's within our portfolio of brands, so it's not necessarily across all. And we've seen things improve as well. So it's just -- it's very short term, this moderation we have seen. And at the end of the day, because of our net bill and B2B and everything else that we have going from our growth initiatives perspective, we feel very confident in our outlook for the year. No, we haven't seen it. I mean furniture is our biggest growth vehicle. Furniture has been very, very good for us. And so you would think that if there was a problem with big ticket or higher prices or things like that, we'd see that coming down, and we have not. That merch has been very strong for us. Relatively one and the same. But yes, I mean, I would focus on the growth rate, but if the growth rates are the same, then the demand -- I mean, the dollars have to be close as well. Yes. Yes. I think if you recall, last year, we were basically getting our advertising dollars back to the level they were previously. So in 2020, it was one of the big drivers for cost cuts as we are moving throughout that year. And so as we said all throughout 2021 that we are investing back into advertising for the future, long-term health of the business. And so last year was more of a year of deleverage. \n And now that we've sort of lapped that, we now are back to more normalized levels of advertising, and we're very happy to see that we were able to generate leverage with the top line sales and our philosophy of ROI on advertising spend. We don't spend advertising to go get customer counts or traffic numbers or -- we do advertising to get a return because we think that's the right thing to do. And so that's what we generated this quarter. Yes. So I mean from a leverage perspective, in a downturn, I think, first of all, we just went through this at the beginning of the pandemic. We've all been through it in '08 and '09. And thankfully, we have a lot of the same management team that's here, so we know how to do it. Hopefully, we're not in that situation. Certainly, we're not seeing anything close to that situation today. But we know how to pull back on expenses. We know how to cut inventory, capital, advertising, put a cease to all discretionary spend. \n On the flip side, to your point about being on the offense, as we're seeing other folks not have the same results as us and here we are with these incredible results and we're seeing that momentum continue, there's lots of opportunities there. I mean advertising is one example where people are pulling out from advertising. That could be an interesting play for us to play. But it really depends. Obviously, it's confidential as to what we want to -- what levers we can pull. But certainly, we can if we're generating the cash flow and the earnings that we are. As far as cancel rates, they're really low. I mean we haven't seen much movement from week to week, thankfully. I mean the customer is obviously voting with their wallet and they're willing to stay on and work with us to get the product that they want. And so we haven't seen that change at all. \n I don't know if you want to talk about the lead times. I think that will be in the Q when we release the Q. So we'll give it to you then. But certainly, it was, as I said in my prepared remarks, that it's up 60% off of last year's all-time high. So it is considerable amount of shares that we bought. And we believe wholeheartedly, obviously, in the strength of our business and believe certainly that we're at a level of our stock price that we shouldn't be at. And so we're going to continue to opportunistically invest in our own company. 120 basis points. We've never really disclosed that. And I guess what I would say, what we've learned is nothing is fixed. If you're depending on the environment, we go after it all, and we've been very successful at that. So it's kind of irrelevant for us. We've been very successful going after it. Yes. So that piece of the business is growing. But we still have a lot of small projects, too. We love both. So teasing it out that way. I don't think there's anything really to that yet other than to say that we're building this more consistent annuity business, and that will get more and more stable as we grow. Not necessarily. It's mix shift. It's pricing. It's all sorts of things that are a combination that make up that delta. But I think the point there is to really think about that we don't have excess inventory like the other companies that have been reporting. We have been very thoughtful about that, and we only have 1% up in units to make the point that the 28% is overstated relative to what we've heard from others. It's possible. I mean certainly, we do have higher costs coming throughout the year. As we've said, we've got higher product costs, higher freight costs. There's costs that we're incurring to have additional distribution space to house the fact that we've got this mix shift to furniture, which is a larger cube. \n And we're also doing the right thing by our customers. As I said before, we are shipping things to them that are out of market -- from out-of-market distribution centers because we want to get it to them faster. Customer service is critical for us. And we might ship multiple times to a same customer if they've got a multiunit order. And we want to do the right thing by the customer. \n And so yes, there could be pressures moving through. But at the end of the day, we're committed to obviously doing everything we can to mitigate it as we've done in the past. And we are committed to holding our op margin on the year relatively in line, which, again, is more than 2x where it's been."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJeremy Brooks: Good morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including guidance for fiscal '24 and our long-term outlook. We believe these statements reflect our best estimates. However, we cannot make any assurances that these statements will materialize and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations.  \n The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier this morning. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our filings with the SEC. \n Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our Investor Relations website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer. \nLaura Alber: Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Before we get into our Q4 results, I'd like to acknowledge the accomplishments of the entire team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. The results we are about to share with you today reflect their collaboration, innovation and dedication, and I want to give everybody on this team a huge shout-out and a huge thank you.  \n We are pleased with our strong finish to 2023. In Q4, our comp came in above expectations at negative 6.8%, with a 2-year comp at negative 7.4% and a 4-year comp at positive 29.1%. In the quarter, we exceeded profitability estimates with an operating margin of 20.1% and earnings per share of $5.44. \n Turning to the full year. Our comp went down 9.9% with a 2-year comp at negative 3.4% and a 4-year comp at positive 35.6%. We delivered an annual operating margin of 16.4% with full year earnings per share of $14.85 beating our 2023 comp guidance of negative 10% to negative 12% and hitting our operating margin range of 16% to 16.5%.  \n I think it's worth putting these results in context. 4 years ago, the global pandemic changed how we worked and lived as most of us began to spend an unprecedented amount of time in our homes and interest rates were historical lows. As a result of these 2 dynamics, the demand for home furnishing surged. Our company was well positioned to meet this demand with its compelling product assortment, supply chain capabilities and the experience of our tenured management team. But the demand of the pandemic came with complications, including supply chain inefficiencies and higher vendor costs. Despite these increased costs and complexities, we stayed focused on innovating our proprietary products, running a full price business and managing ad costs and employment expenses.  \n As we came out of the record year in 2022, we started to see slowing in our sales trend as interest rates increased and home sales declined. Decreases in furniture demand continued to put pressure on our top line. But again, we stayed focus on transforming our operations, cutting costs and improving supply chain inefficiencies, all which drove us to nearly double our profitability compared to pre-pandemic. Our exceptional results in 2023 were driven by strong operational execution in a challenging environment for home furnishings.  \n While the data suggested that consumers were resilient, they shifted away from home into experiences in entertainment and they have been hesitant on furniture purchases. Nonetheless, we have continued to drive results. From prepandemic through the pandemic and to today, we have navigated, learned, optimized and built all in preparation for our next chapter of growth. We have developed a strong omni-channel platform and have invested in a distribution network with additional capacity.  \n Going forward, we see another growth opportunity on the horizon for our company, resulting from a more normalized interest rate environment, improved home sales and our strategy. As we look to next year and beyond, we are focused on 3 key priorities: First, returning to growth; second, elevating our world-class customer service; and three, driving margins. Our growth will be driven by our business strategies in each of our core businesses, our B2B program, our emerging brands and our global business. \n We will continue to improve our world-class customer service by driving supply chain improvements from reduced out of market and multiple shipments, fewer customer accommodations, lower returns and damages and reduced replacements. These improvements will continue to contribute meaningfully to our profitability in 2024 and beyond.  And we see opportunity to drive margin by continuing our focus on full price selling and cost negotiations.  \n As it relates to other cost efficiencies, we will maintain our employment cost savings that we achieved last year following our comprehensive review of our organization structure. Regarding marketing, we continue to increase our spend, and we are seeing very effective returns on our paid marketing and on our social strategy. This investment will both drive sales and help us acquire new customers. Our in-house marketing expertise and performance-driven approach continues to serve as a differentiator between us and our peers.\n Also, our ongoing investment in our proprietary e-commerce technology continues to improve our online experience. We are focused on offering customers inspiring content and dynamic tools to assist with design projects and AI is accelerating these efforts. We see many opportunities for our business from developments in AI, and we believe our leadership in this area will be yet another competitive advantage.  \n As focused as we are on our digital and e-commerce capabilities, we remain passionate about our best-in-class retail business. We continue to improve our in-store experiences with inspirational products and next-level design services. I truly believe our teams are the best in the industry. And our continued retail optimization efforts have transformed our fleet to be positioned in the most profitable, inspiring and strategic locations.  \n On the sustainability front, in Q4, we are proud to be the only home furnishings retailer included in the 2023 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. And we started 2024 by being named one of Barron's 100 most sustainable companies. Our commitment to value is embedded in our company strategy, and we are proud of our recognition as a leader in sustainable home furnishings. \n Now I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 9.6% comp in Q4 and ran a negative 3.8% on a 2-year basis and positive 38.1% on a 4-year basis. The comp improved sequentially from Q3 but still ran negative due to the pullback in consumer spending and furniture.  \n During the holiday season, we saw strength in seasonal decor, entertaining and home textiles. The brand experienced a strong customer response over the Black Friday, Cyber Monday period, and we continue to reduce discounting and strengthen our merchandise margins. The brand benefited from a Q4 launch of the Pottery Barn mobile shopping and design app. This new app allows customers to shop full room designs, share their favorite products and connect with a design expert all through the convenience of their phone or tablet.  \n We anticipate the continued customer adoption of this app will drive conversion for Pottery Barn in 2024 and beyond. As we launch our exclusive spring product collections, we're seeing continued strength in fashion bedding, home furnishings and  botanicals. Customers are continuing to gravitate towards easy updates with color, prints and pattern. \n The Pottery Barn children business ran a negative 2.5% comp in Q4 and was 1.5% positive on a 2-year basis and 21.1% positive on a 4-year basis. We continue to be focused on delivering compelling innovation and evolving the customer experience, and we are pleased to see improvement in the comp. Our baby business continued to be very strong and represents a sizable opportunity. We have been delivering growth in registry with our curated assortment, easy-to-use mobile app and in-store baby experts.  \n We've also introduced new products that are both high in quality and innovation, such as our dream deluxe power swivel recliner with heat and massage. Also, we're proud of our collaborations, and we just launched [indiscernible], who is making her debut line for baby with whimsical design and keepsake  quality. Also in Q4, we saw a strong consumer response to our expanded seasonal offerings that range from baby's first Christmas to Grinch-themed betting for teens. We saw customers return to us for Valentine's Day and Easter with a strong response to our new collaborations, including an expanded collection of Hello Kitty. We're also seeing a particularly strong trend with our NFL offering in teens. And finally, we're seeing strength in nursery furniture, a purchase that is less dependent on new home sales.  \n Moving to West Elm. West Elm is the brand that has been the most impacted by the consumer pullback in furniture. In Q4, West Elm ran a negative 15.3% and was negative 26% on a 2-year basis and positive 17.5% on a 4-year basis. However, what I'm excited about are our new product sales from this year's holiday assortment, which has strong growth to last year across all categories. The customers responded positively to fresh designs in furniture, textiles and decorative accessories. We also saw strong sales in holiday decor. And as we move into 2024, newness continues to accelerate and is performing well. \n Given these positive trends in newness, we continue to see a sizable opportunity in West Elm as it rebalances more inventory into these new products. The Williams-Sonoma brand ran a positive 1.6% comp in Q4. On a 2-year basis, the brand was negative 0.9% and was positive 29.8% on a 4-year basis. In Q4, the Williams-Sonoma Kitchen business ran a positive comp for the third consecutive quarter, and our Williams-Sonoma home business meaningfully improved.  \n Retail has been very strong, with inspiring in-store events and dramatically improved in stocks. Our seasonal categories grew double digits and we saw strength in core businesses like cookware and bakeware, as customers gravitated towards gifting and entertaining at home. Throughout the quarter, collaborations like our Cookware partnership with GreenPan and Stanley Tucci and the launch of a partnership with one of Netflix most watched shows, Bridgerton, continue to drive sales, buzz and new customer acquisition.  \n Now I would like to update you on our other initiatives. Business-to-business ended the year strong with Q4 at positive 5%, bringing the total year to a positive 1%, coming in just under $1 billion. The contract business exceeded expectations at positive 31% on the year, fueled by continued strength in the hospitality and residential sectors along with early traction in developing segments such as health care, gaming and senior living. Flagship projects in the back half of the year range from providing furnishings from medical office providers across the country as well as entertainment venues like Dave & Buster's.  \n Our B2B team also provided guest room furniture for the new Fontainebleau hotel that recently opened in Vegas. Now I'd like to talk about our global business. While macroeconomic pressures continue to affect our global business, we are pleased with our performance in India, Mexico and Canada. In India, we are seeing growth from strong marketing and brand awareness campaigns across the brands with a high penetration of our Design Crew business. In Mexico, the market continues to show strength driven by improved in-stocks and a strong holiday season. The Canada business continues to build momentum, fueled by our commitment to enhance the customer experience, both online and in retail.  \n Our digital initiatives in the Canadian market continue to gain new customers and drive results for our brands. And we are pleased with the initial positive response to the recent launches of Rejuvenation, Mark and Graham and Williams-Sonoma Home in Canada. As we continue to expand our omnichannel presence around the globe, India, Mexico and Canada remain our key strategic growth markets. \n Lastly, I'd like to update you on our emerging brands. Rejuvenation delivered a strong quarter with a double-digit positive comp driven by success in our remodel product categories and new growth initiatives.  \n We continue to see strength in both consumer and B2B sales. Rejuvenation continues to establish itself as a destination for home projects by providing products with great function, high-quality and timeless design details. We're excited about the momentum in the brand and the growth potential in 2024 and beyond and believe Rejuvenation can be our next billion-dollar brand. Mark and Graham, our high-quality gifting business saw strong growth this year with a single -- high single-digit positive comp in the quarter.  \n Our monogramming capabilities, coupled with unique high-quality gifts and the brand's curated online gift shops make it easy for customers to find a perfect gift. And finally, our startup GreenRow. We continue to gain momentum in this new brand, which utilizes sustainable materials and manufacturing practices to create colorful heirloom quality products. We remain optimistic about the potential of this brand and it's aesthetic. In 2024, we are planning to grow GreenRow with substantial increases in product assortment. These successful and exciting emerging brands demonstrate our ability to develop new businesses that expand our portfolio and address white space in the market. \n In summary, we're extremely proud of our accomplishments and financial results this year. We outperformed in 2023 despite the slowest housing market in several decades and massive geopolitical unrest. Although this pressured our top line trend, we stayed focused on full price selling, supply chain efficiencies and best-in-class customer service. We have transformed our business model, and as a result, we delivered an operating margin well above our guidance and well ahead for pre-pandemic operating margin.  \n We have a powerful portfolio of brands serving a range of categories, aesthetics and life stages, and we have built a strong omnichannel platform and infrastructure, which positions us well for the next stage of growth. It is early, but our reads on Q1 is strong, and we are optimistic about the opportunities that exist ahead.  \n With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers and our outlook in more detail. \nJeff Howie: Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. As Laura said, we're pleased to deliver a strong finish to fiscal year '23 with Q4 and full year '23 earnings significantly exceeding expectations. We delivered these earnings despite a challenging backdrop for home furnishings, pressuring our top line. Our strong profitability in this environment demonstrates the durability of our operating margin. Our results once again reinforced the themes we consistently communicated in 2023.  \n First, our steadfast commitment to maintain price integrity and not run site-wide promotions. Second, our first half supply chain cost pressures became tailwinds in the second half. And third, our discipline to control costs and manage inventory levels. Given the strength of our earnings through this challenging period for home furnishings, we're confident we can deliver long-term growth and even stronger earnings as the customer shifts back to home. \n Now let's dive into the numbers. I'll start with our Q4 results, followed by our full fiscal year '23 results, then provide guidance for '24. Q4 net revenues finished at $2.28 billion. Our revenues came in at the high end of our expectations, driven by strong holiday performance across our portfolio of brands, partially offset by ongoing customer hesitancy towards big ticket expenditures.  \n During the quarter, we continued our commitment to maintain price integrity and we reduced our overall level of promotions. Our Q4 comps came in at negative 6.8%, with our 2-year comp at negative 7.4% and our full year comp to 2019 at plus 29.1%. From a cadence perspective, our comps reflect a strong Black Friday to Christmas holiday period, [ bookended ] by inconsistent and choppy sales on both ends. \n Moving down the income statement. Q4 gross margin improved 480 basis points over last year to 46% as higher selling margins more than offset the impact of higher occupancy costs. Q4 selling margin at 55.1% were 560 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the full impact to our profitability of the supply chain tailwinds we've been guiding for several quarters.  \n Our higher Q4 selling margins were driven by both higher merchandise margins, and lower costs from supply chain efficiencies. Q4 merchandise margins contributed about half the increase in selling margins, driven by lower input costs, and our focus on full price selling. The balance sheet improvement came directly from supply chain efficiencies, which drove an improved customer experience and lower costs. We're proud to see our focus on execution and investment in supply chain paying off. Key metrics, including out-of-market shipping, multiple deliveries per order, returns, accommodations, damages and replacements are all performing at pre-pandemic levels, if not better.  \n Our higher Q4 selling margins more than offset the 2% growth in Q4 occupancy costs to $208 million or 9.1% of net revenues, up 80 basis points from last year. Turning now to SG&A. Our Q4 SG&A expense of $591 million, grew 13% and ran at 25.9% of revenues, deleveraging 460 basis points. As a reminder, our Q4 '22 SG&A results benefited from favorable items that we guided would not repeat in Q4 '23. Excluding the favorable items from last year, our SG&A dollars decreased 4%. Q4 employment was 300 basis points higher year-over-year, driven by higher performance-based incentive compensation in fiscal year '23 than last year.  \n In Q4, we continued to manage variable employment costs in accordance with top line trends. Q4 advertising expense was 60 basis points higher year-over-year as we took advantage of opportunities to invest into higher levels of advertising spend. As Laura mentioned, we continue to increase our spend as we are seeing very effective returns on this investment. Our ability to invest in these opportunities is an example of the competitive advantage of our agile, performance-driven marketing organization. our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform continue to drive efficient advertising spend.  \n Q4 general expenses drove the balance of the increase as we lapped a favorable insurance settlement received in fiscal year '22. On the bottom line, our Q4 earnings significantly exceeded expectations. Q4 operating income came in at $458 million and operating margin at 20.1%, 20 basis points above last year, with Q4 diluted earnings per share of $5.44. \n Turning now to our full year results, which again exceeded expectations. Full year net revenues finished at $7.75 billion. Our full year revenues reflect a larger home furnishings backdrop and our commitment to maintain price integrity even if it meant for growing some revenues in the short term.  \n Our full year comp ran down 9.9% with our 2-year comp at negative 3.4%, and our 4-year comp to 2019 at plus 35.6%. Full year gross margin ended at 42.7%, a 30 basis point improvement over last year as our first half supply chain headwinds turned into even stronger tailwinds in the back half. Full year selling margins at 53.2% were 170 basis points over last year and our highest ever selling margin rate driven by a nearly equal mix of higher merchandise margins and supply chain efficiency, these higher selling margins more than offset the 4% increase in our full year occupancy costs to $814 million. \n Full year SG&A expense decreased 5.8% to $2.04 billion. This decrease was driven by employment reductions taken in Q1 and Q2, our management of variable employment in line with top line trends and a 20 basis point reduction in advertising on the full year.  \n Full year SG&A deleverage of 140 basis points was primarily driven by lapping the favorable items recognized in Q4 '22 that I discussed earlier. On the bottom line, full year operating income finished at $1.27 billion, and operating margin at 16.4%, significantly above our pre-COVID levels and the 15% operating margin floor we established at the start of the year. Full year diluted earnings per share ended at $14.85. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance  of $1.26 billion with no debt outstanding. This was after we invested $188 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth, and we returned over $545 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends. Year-end merchandise inventories stood at $1.25 billion, down 14.4% to last year. At these levels, we are well positioned to maintain our price integrity as we proactively managed our inventory levels in line with our top line trends.  \n We generated a record level of free cash flow in 2023 at $1.49 billion, driven by the strength of our earnings, proactive inventory management and financial discipline. Speaking of financial discipline, a prime example is our fiscal year '23 return on invested capital of 45%. This is among the best in the retail industry. \n Summing up our '23 results, we're proud to have delivered earnings substantially exceeding expectations. As Laura said, these results reflect the efforts of the entire team at Williams-Sonoma Inc. And I'd like to thank our talented team for delivering these outstanding results in a challenging environment.  \n Now let's turn to our '24 outlook. First, let me point out that 2024 is a 53-week year for Williams-Sonoma Inc. So the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. We will report comps on a 53-week versus 53-week comparable basis. All other year-over-year compares will be 53 weeks versus 52 weeks. \n We anticipate the additional week will contribute 150 basis points to revenue growth and 10 basis points to operating margins, both of which are embedded in our guidance. We anticipate 2024 will be a year of continued macroeconomic uncertainty. Lower interest rates could spur the housing market and shift consumer spending back to home, but timing is hard to predict.  \n And there is also the election and global geopolitical tension. With this in mind, we are providing a wide range of guidance for '24. '24 net revenues are expected to be in the range of down 3% to up 3% with comps between down 4.5% to up 1.5% and operating margins between 16.5% and 16.8%. On the top line, we anticipate sequential improvement across the year. With the first half tougher than the second half, as our top line comparisons get easier. On the bottom line, we expect our supply chain tailwinds will continue through at least the first half of '24, but will be partially offset by higher advertising spend. In the back half, we anticipate our operating margins will be in line with '23 results.  \n Our capital allocation plans for '24 prioritize funding our business operations and investing in long-term growth. We expect to spend $225 million in capital expenditures to invest in the long-term growth of our business. 75% of this capital spend will be dedicated to drive our e-commerce leadership and supply chain efficiency. We expect to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and ongoing share repurchases. For dividends, today, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend payout of 26% or $0.23 to $1.13 per share. Fiscal year '24 will be the 15th consecutive year of increased dividend payouts, which we are both proud of and remain committed to.  \n For share repurchases, today, we also announced our Board has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing previous authorizations and under which we will opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns to our shareholders. Combined, our dividend increase and new share repurchase authorization continue our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.  \n In fact, we've returned over $3.8 billion to our shareholders over the last 6 years. As we look further into the future beyond '24, we are reiterating our long-term top line guidance of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth. And in the long term, we now believe we can sustain operating margins in the mid to high teens. \n We are confident that we will continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these reasons. Our ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet. \n With that, I'll open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  Our first question will come from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. \nSteven Zaccone: Congrats on the strong margin execution here in a tough environment. So Jeff, first question for you. Can you talk a bit more about the margin assumptions in the 2024 guide in more detail. You gave the commentary about operating margin in the back half. Can you talk about gross margin in particular? How does that look on the cadence of the year? \nJeff Howie: Steve. Yes, on our gross margin outlook and our EBIT margin outlook, as you know, we don't guide the individual line items. We provide top line guidance and bottom line operating margin guidance. And the reason why it gives us the flexibility to react as we see trends evolve in the business and the different levers we can pull along the way. And as you've seen, as we did in '23, we know the levers to pull to deliver results. We see continued strength in our operating margin.  \n And as we guided today, we see it landing between 16.5% to 16.8% on the year. We do see that the supply chain tailwinds that we've been seeing in the back half of '23 will continue into the front half of '24 but will be offset by some additional advertising expenditures as we talked about, we did in -- Q4 of '23. But overall, we're very confident in our operating margin and looking forward to delivering these results. \nSteven Zaccone: Okay. Great. Then second question for you, Laura. I was hoping to get more detail on the West Elm turnaround.  You talked about some newness, and that's doing well. But how long do you expect the turnaround to take? And if we think about the performance of that brand relative to the overall guidance for the company, would you expect West Elm to still underperform? \nLaura Alber: Yes. I'm so excited about West Elm. I've had a chance to see all of the product that's coming in this year and their strategies. And I think it's a very clear, exciting growth story again for us. I think in terms of timing, it's always hard to predict exactly when things will go. But we are seeing, as I said, really strong results, not just in the holiday seasonal decor but the new product offer that's core. And the new design language that we've brought out, the new modern forms, we are building back our nonfurniture business, which drives customer engagement and also new customer acquisition and is very relevant and important for UPTs and repeat purchases. So that is on its way.  \n You're going to see that continue to grow through the year. And then also now that we have success on some of these furniture items, we know that the time line on when a furniture bestseller will be relevant is a lot longer than if you're a fashion apparel person. So we can then buy into it with confidence versus now our newness, although very high over last year, is -- it's just not a big enough percent of the total. So as we buy back into these winners and they compound through the year, that's when we expect to see then hit the total top line in a meaningful way. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham: Congrats on another strong quarter. My first question is just thinking about the 2024 outlook. Obviously, a lot of uncertainty with the environment and your revenue growth guidance reflects that. But you guys have been very good at managing costs. And if we were to see revenue come in a bit below your guidance, would you still be able to hit that 16.5% operating margin target? \nJeff Howie: Yes. So simply to answer your question, even if revenues were to come a little bit lower, we're confident in our operating margin guidance. There's additional levers that we can pull within the business if that were to be the case. But our outlook is a little bit more positive. We think we're closer to the end of the down cycle in home furnishings rather than the beginning. And we're focused on delivering results in our business. And I really think that we have opportunities to continue to improve what we're doing, and there's more things that we can do to drive earnings throughout the year. \nSeth Basham: That's helpful. And then secondly, it seems like there's been a little bit of a change in how you're approaching advertising. You're finding good opportunities to invest there. Can you give some more color there? And also, is that one of the levers you can pull if this top line doesn't play out the way you expect? \nLaura Alber: It's not a difference in approach. It's that when we see more opportunity, we invest more. And so we want to invest in advertising if we're going to get paid back. So we are looking at this every day, every week, every brand, and we're so lucky to have a test-and-learn methodology where we can try something in one brand. And if it works, roll it. And if it doesn't work, shut it down.  \n And so when we find something that works, you spend more, the ad cost then stays lower or it goes up with sales in tandem giving you more on the bottom line. We've done this for years. It's a little more complicated than it used to be when we just had the catalog because there's so many different things to invest in. And we're seeing a lot of opportunity in organic social now. And that is not paid. Now it helps to have paid social go along with organic social, but we're getting really good at pushing our content not just through our own channels, but into the whole social media world in a very effective way to get new customers into our brands. \n And so it's not just the ad cost spend, it's the creative spend that goes in building that incredible content like we did with Stanley Tucci, for example, which continues to be a really wonderful example of a successful collaboration that's working both in the short-term sales but also in bringing new customers to the brand. And so it's a great example of the kind of things that are changing, and they're really different from 10 years ago when those channels were not available to use. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies. \nJonathan Matuszewski: Nice results. The first one is on B2B. Just curious how you're thinking about B2B in the context of your 2024 guide in terms of sales or comp? And relatedly, maybe if you could just update us on what you're doing to make that channel more profitable. It seems like you're doing a lot of good things on the consumer side to take costs out of the business in terms of less accommodations and damages, but curious, anything to make B2B more profitable? That's my first question. \nJeff Howie: Jonathan, we see B2B contributing about 100 basis points to our comp in '24, which is embedded in our guidance. Here's what's exciting. We're really optimistic about B2B growth as we look forward to '24. The business was up 1% overall in '23 with contract up 31%. And while the trade business has been more impacted by the slowed housing market, we've seen some recent improvement in that trend. However, we remain focused on accelerating our contract business, and we're really pleased with the momentum we're seeing. And here for us, it's really a growth story. Overall, B2B is slightly accretive to our operating margins. And we just see continued growth as we disrupt this $80 billion piece of our TAM. \nJonathan Matuszewski: That's really helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on your store fleet. Just maybe update us on the mindset regarding store closures.  What's embedded in the 2024 guide? Obviously, a lot of leases up for renewal. \nLaura Alber: Yes. So really exciting story in our retail stores because we're very successfully leaving certain stores in certain areas and moving to vibrant centers. A great example is Annapolis. I don't know if you've been there, but we moved our WS right next to Whole Foods which is a really different strategy than your traditional retail placement. \n And it's really -- it's up to pro forma. It's up to the previous store and the [ 4-wall ] is much higher than our average. It's a really good case of where we work to the landlord to really build a killer store, and we're paying less and the financials are really strong and the store is great for the customers. And so that's what we continue to do as leases come up for renewal, there are amazing centers we're staying in, and we've been successful in reinvesting in the right things. So that if you're staying in the center, the stores look really fresh and also serve the customer in the way they want to be served, and there's new things than when we built stores 10 years ago, new businesses to fund, space allocation. \n And so across all of our brands, we're constantly looking at what's working, what's not working and how do we continue to optimize, but also keeping that beautiful inspiring store experience where you go in and we say the music plays, and you're excited to be there and you're inspired by the features, and we've got great salespeople who help you. And we're matching that also with very intuitive and helpful tech to help build these rooms, these houses. \n And just while I'm talking about this, I really just -- during this time where people are buying less furniture, we've taken the time to really reinvest in how we take our design service to the next level because we know that they're dying to buy new houses. And when the market switches, we're going to be there with an advanced platform for design services that we can use and leverage in our stores and also online that I think is game changing. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Max Rakhlenko with TD Cowen. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: Great. So first, Laura, can you just provide any more color on your comment that 1Q reads are strong. What brands are you seeing that in? And then just how are you thinking about what brands will lead the return back to growth over the coming quarters? \nLaura Alber: Sure, Max. We really do have a strong lineup of opportunities in our portfolio of brands, and we're really confident in our outlook. Some examples of things that are working -- we're in a color trend phase, and we're seeing print and pattern and color sell across the brands actually. Easter is strong. That's good. It's early. So Jeff is telling me to be careful with this comment because when it's early, sometimes it ends a little differently than you expect but so far so good and even shifted. \n That tells you customers -- we saw Christmas decor be strong, too, Easter -- this is good for our brands. There's not a lot of people out there that serve in a quality way, the seasonal holidays. And we think they're wonderful. We love to decorate and entertain and show people how to do that across them. And for West Elm, that's been a business they haven't really gone after. So that's really upside for them. Easy updates, people, they may not be buying a house, but they might decide to redo one room. And we can see the effects of that on our sales. \n And also, the projects I mentioned in my prepared remarks about rejuvenation. Bath and kitchen remodels are still happening, and we are getting more attention as someone who can help provide high-quality and unique products in those spaces. New furniture, we're seeing strong results in West Elm, as I mentioned, new forms, and that's very exciting. And then collaboration. So whether it's Tucci, I keep talking about Tucci, Colin King, LoveShackFancy, Sheila Bridges, [ Elf ]. I mean, we've got a wide range of these collaborations. And they're just -- they bring new customers in, and we have a great time with them. They help us think about new design language that we may not naturally design into. \n And all of that is really good for the teams and great for the customers. And then there's continued categories that we're pushing as a bigger percent of total and pulling back. And so without going on too long or giving away too much competitive information, we're seeing some pockets where we have a lot of upside. The other thing that's really important in all this that you guys got to realize is that we continue to reduce our promotional offering. \n So at the same time that we're pushing this growth posture for this year, we are also absolutely determined to continue to pull back on promotions, which is a tricky thing, right? So we did it last year. You're going to see us continue to push it this year and balance the 2 out. We really believe strongly that long term, this is the right thing for our business. And we will take markdowns, and we will always try new things, and sometimes they don't work so you take a markdown, but we do not want to have up down pricing in our brands. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: Got it. That's very helpful. And so the big update, I think, is the new long-term EBIT margin outlook. So I'm just curious, what are you seeing now that gives you confidence to raise it? And then as we think about post 2024, is that going to be more on gross margin or SG&A? Just curious where you see the big opportunities ahead to continue to march forward. \nJeff Howie: I think the way we think about it is at the start of '23, we established a 15% operating margin floor. And then year-end results, we delivered a 16.4% operating margin. And this year, we're guiding 16.5% to 16.8%. So we remain confident in our operating margin durability especially as we start to see our growth algorithm of mid- to high single-digit growth over the long term. So we're pretty confident in that. And we think that as we get beyond '24, we certainly have the upside to sustain these operating margins longer. In terms of the pieces of margin versus SG&A, we don't -- as you know, we don't guide those particular in the line items, especially over the long term. But on the bottom line, we've established that we can deliver these results, and we remain confident in both for '24 as well as the long term beyond that. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. \nPeter Benedict: So first one is just on kind of the supply chain environment. You guys have obviously been doing a great job on what you can control. I'm curious about the things that are maybe out of your control, some of the events going on, some of the costs on ocean freight. Just kind of remind us maybe where you sit there, how you may be baked some of that into the outlook here for '24? That's my first question. \nLaura Alber: Sure. Our team, our supply chain team, I'd say, is just phenomenal, and they continue to show that through the results. Although things have normalized from the pandemic, we still have a lot of areas for improvement, which will result in margin upside. We want to continue to drive down returns and replacements and any issue that affects the customer. We want a perfect delivery. We want to take all the friction out of that delivery. And so we're seeing incredible numbers across the board, on all those metrics I mentioned in my script. \n When a problem comes along, they're real, the Red Sea disruption is pretty terrible. However, it is not costing us any more money. So far, it is costing us about 10 days of delivery, give or take. And as I mentioned last time, we padded the deliveries to our customers once we heard about it, so we didn't disappoint them. And if we outperform and deliver faster, they're always happier than if it's late. Because they don't -- they can't -- most people don't connect anything with these world events. And so we have to really manage our delivery quotes very quickly once we hear these things. That's the most recent example. \n There is no doubt in my mind, Peter, that this year will be met with other things that we have to deal with. We tend to be very proactive about -- thinking about what those things could be to make sure that we're ahead. And I guess the good news is if there is any -- when these things happen, they affect everyone. And we're usually able to get ahead of it and solve it better than most. \nPeter Benedict: Yes. No, very true. And then I guess my next question was around kind of the real estate, I guess, optimization process that's been going on for a while here couple of years now, maybe 10 to 15 stores lower year-over-year. Is that the cadence we should be expecting kind of going forward? And I'm just curious maybe how the occupancy cost growth is assumed for 2024, another year, maybe mid-single-digit increases, Jeff? Is that the way to think about it? Just trying to understand where you sit from that standpoint. \nJeff Howie: Yes. I mean in terms of where we are in our journey of retail optimization, we're probably in the middle innings. As I've discussed in the past, we have -- about 50% of our leases come due in the next 5 years. So we look to continue to optimize the real estate. And usually, we target a higher number of store closures, but they just tend to net out through the way the process works to about where we've been in the past few years. \n So in terms of particular numbers, you can look to the past, say, 3 or 4 years is a good guidepost. And then in terms of where occupancy is going to go, and I'll go back to we don't guide individual lines. We really guide the top and the bottom line. So that gives us more levers to pull throughout the year. And now there are fixed costs within occupancy, there's also a lot of variable costs, too. So there's things we can go -- do throughout the year if necessary. So it's all embedded within our full year guidance. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So I guess my first question is, as you talk about the optimism about the bottom of the market and the improvement quarter-to-date, I was just curious what you're seeing on the furniture side of the business. You mentioned some newness in West Elm resonating but it does sound like a lot of the decor categories are what's been driving the strength. On the other hand, the mix does shift back towards the furniture brands away from Williams-Sonoma into the first quarter. \n So does the implied sort of sequential improvement in the first quarter? Are you seeing like better furniture demand trends? Maybe how much of it is some of the deflation working through the system from ocean freight normalizing. So any comment there would be really helpful. \nJeff Howie: Yes, Chris. So furniture trends in Q4 were down, but sequentially improved over Q3. And yes, we do see a benefit by the higher penetration of Sonoma in Q4. But overall, to Laura's comments before, we're very pleased with our quarter-to-date performance. but it's early. And as Laura mentioned, there's the Easter shift, the turnover at Easter, which sometimes has impacts on the curves. But I think the important thing is we're not just a furniture company. \n We only have about half of our assortment in furniture. So we have a powerful portfolio of brands with a wide range of product assortment, and we can really meet the trends as the consumer shopping. And that gives us confidence in where we see our outlook and we can really service the customers to what they're shopping to today. \nChristopher Horvers: For sure. And then in terms of the follow-up, I know you're not -- Jeff, you are not guiding to individual line items. But could you maybe help us think about like on the SG&A line, you've done an incredible job, really managing around incentives and the advertising, flexing it with demand and you had some headcount reductions as well a year ago. Should we think about that being more variable into a recovery like should you see rate leverage, should we think about it modeling it from a dollar growth perspective and focus less on rates. So any color there in terms of just how variable SG&A is into a recovery as you start to reinvest back into the business as the top line improves. \nLaura Alber: Yes, Chris. It's Laura. I just wanted to comment, I think it's important to remember that our focus this year is threefold. It's delivering growth, elevating customer service and driving margin. And we believe we can do all 3 things. We have that many opportunities in our model with our platform, with our world-class brands to achieve those things. I really -- as we look to the year, believe that the natural investments that we need to make will drive the top line. \n And so to the extent of the line by line, I know we're not answering your questions about those line by line. But you've seen our -- what we produced even in a down cycle, right, with margin improvements. And as I said in I think last call, you can imagine what that looks like in an up cycle. Our investments that we've been making over the last 10 years, have gotten us to a place where we are ready for more volume without having to have a step-up infrastructure investment. \n So while we talk about these things, they're small potatoes compared to distribution costs that others or a real platform -- re-platform costs that others have to put in place. We're ready for the volume to come this year and next and really excited about how that not only flows through, but also the opportunities to improve these customer service lines and we love those customer service lines because they drive margin. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: Question on pricing. We wondered where you were on an average price versus last year. I know you talked about adding more opening price points last quarter. I just wondered if we could get an update on how that trended in Q4 and what you expect to see in 2024. \nLaura Alber: It's interesting, Kate. We try to glean every piece of information from sales and then they change. So I don't think it's fair to say right now that there's a specific price point that's the magic price point. We're seeing success across all prices. The customer wants a value. So we have some really expensive stuff that's really selling. And then we have some value price points that are really selling. And so there's not a pattern there that I'd hang a strategy on for now. \n In all of our brands, we've worked on great value to the consumer and also really new fresh designs. And so you cannot underestimate how important it is. When we get it right on a design, it's not that we take advantage of the price, it's that our price is generally a lot cheaper than other people making the same product and our quality is better. So we're -- that's what we're focused on is delivering value to the customer -- and I -- we were talking about this before the call, I can't prove that it's low prices, mid prices and high prices that are soft or strong. \n It's the stuff they want, and it's the new fresh product. \nKatharine McShane: And I just wanted to ask a follow-up question with regards to tariffs that if there were to be, [ I noticed ] is a risk profile for your guidance, the election. But how are you thinking about managing through a scenario where there could be more tariffs? \nJeff Howie: Kate. Well, first, we're in an election year. A lot's get said on the campaign trail and who knows where this conversation really goes in the end. Second, we've transformed our sourcing base since the last time the subject was top of mind 6 years ago. Today, only 25% of our goods are sourced from China, which is about half of what it was back then. And here is the most important thing. We have some real key competitive advantages that serve us well into these situations. First, 90% of our products are proprietary, designed and exclusively made for our brands. And then we operate our own in-house best-in-class global sourcing operation. \n So with 12 overseas offices, it's our own boots on the ground, managing sourcing decisions, production and shipping, and we're the 13th largest container importer into the United States. So we have scale and relationships. Others do not. So punchline being, if the landscape changes, we have the ability to respond that others do not. \nOperator: I'll now hand the call back to Laura Alber for any closing remarks. \nLaura Alber: Well, thank you all for joining us. We really appreciate your support and look forward to seeing some of you in New York and talking to you throughout the year. \nOperator: That will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Before we get into our Q4 results, I'd like to acknowledge the accomplishments of the entire team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. The results we are about to share with you today reflect their collaboration, innovation and dedication, and I want to give everybody on this team a huge shout-out and a huge thank you.  \n We are pleased with our strong finish to 2023. In Q4, our comp came in above expectations at negative 6.8%, with a 2-year comp at negative 7.4% and a 4-year comp at positive 29.1%. In the quarter, we exceeded profitability estimates with an operating margin of 20.1% and earnings per share of $5.44. \n Turning to the full year. Our comp went down 9.9% with a 2-year comp at negative 3.4% and a 4-year comp at positive 35.6%. We delivered an annual operating margin of 16.4% with full year earnings per share of $14.85 beating our 2023 comp guidance of negative 10% to negative 12% and hitting our operating margin range of 16% to 16.5%.  \n I think it's worth putting these results in context. 4 years ago, the global pandemic changed how we worked and lived as most of us began to spend an unprecedented amount of time in our homes and interest rates were historical lows. As a result of these 2 dynamics, the demand for home furnishing surged. Our company was well positioned to meet this demand with its compelling product assortment, supply chain capabilities and the experience of our tenured management team. But the demand of the pandemic came with complications, including supply chain inefficiencies and higher vendor costs. Despite these increased costs and complexities, we stayed focused on innovating our proprietary products, running a full price business and managing ad costs and employment expenses.  \n As we came out of the record year in 2022, we started to see slowing in our sales trend as interest rates increased and home sales declined. Decreases in furniture demand continued to put pressure on our top line. But again, we stayed focus on transforming our operations, cutting costs and improving supply chain inefficiencies, all which drove us to nearly double our profitability compared to pre-pandemic. Our exceptional results in 2023 were driven by strong operational execution in a challenging environment for home furnishings.  \n While the data suggested that consumers were resilient, they shifted away from home into experiences in entertainment and they have been hesitant on furniture purchases. Nonetheless, we have continued to drive results. From prepandemic through the pandemic and to today, we have navigated, learned, optimized and built all in preparation for our next chapter of growth. We have developed a strong omni-channel platform and have invested in a distribution network with additional capacity.  \n Going forward, we see another growth opportunity on the horizon for our company, resulting from a more normalized interest rate environment, improved home sales and our strategy. As we look to next year and beyond, we are focused on 3 key priorities: First, returning to growth; second, elevating our world-class customer service; and three, driving margins. Our growth will be driven by our business strategies in each of our core businesses, our B2B program, our emerging brands and our global business. \n We will continue to improve our world-class customer service by driving supply chain improvements from reduced out of market and multiple shipments, fewer customer accommodations, lower returns and damages and reduced replacements. These improvements will continue to contribute meaningfully to our profitability in 2024 and beyond.  And we see opportunity to drive margin by continuing our focus on full price selling and cost negotiations.  \n As it relates to other cost efficiencies, we will maintain our employment cost savings that we achieved last year following our comprehensive review of our organization structure. Regarding marketing, we continue to increase our spend, and we are seeing very effective returns on our paid marketing and on our social strategy. This investment will both drive sales and help us acquire new customers. Our in-house marketing expertise and performance-driven approach continues to serve as a differentiator between us and our peers.\n Also, our ongoing investment in our proprietary e-commerce technology continues to improve our online experience. We are focused on offering customers inspiring content and dynamic tools to assist with design projects and AI is accelerating these efforts. We see many opportunities for our business from developments in AI, and we believe our leadership in this area will be yet another competitive advantage.  \n As focused as we are on our digital and e-commerce capabilities, we remain passionate about our best-in-class retail business. We continue to improve our in-store experiences with inspirational products and next-level design services. I truly believe our teams are the best in the industry. And our continued retail optimization efforts have transformed our fleet to be positioned in the most profitable, inspiring and strategic locations.  \n On the sustainability front, in Q4, we are proud to be the only home furnishings retailer included in the 2023 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. And we started 2024 by being named one of Barron's 100 most sustainable companies. Our commitment to value is embedded in our company strategy, and we are proud of our recognition as a leader in sustainable home furnishings. \n Now I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 9.6% comp in Q4 and ran a negative 3.8% on a 2-year basis and positive 38.1% on a 4-year basis. The comp improved sequentially from Q3 but still ran negative due to the pullback in consumer spending and furniture.  \n During the holiday season, we saw strength in seasonal decor, entertaining and home textiles. The brand experienced a strong customer response over the Black Friday, Cyber Monday period, and we continue to reduce discounting and strengthen our merchandise margins. The brand benefited from a Q4 launch of the Pottery Barn mobile shopping and design app. This new app allows customers to shop full room designs, share their favorite products and connect with a design expert all through the convenience of their phone or tablet.  \n We anticipate the continued customer adoption of this app will drive conversion for Pottery Barn in 2024 and beyond. As we launch our exclusive spring product collections, we're seeing continued strength in fashion bedding, home furnishings and  botanicals. Customers are continuing to gravitate towards easy updates with color, prints and pattern. \n The Pottery Barn children business ran a negative 2.5% comp in Q4 and was 1.5% positive on a 2-year basis and 21.1% positive on a 4-year basis. We continue to be focused on delivering compelling innovation and evolving the customer experience, and we are pleased to see improvement in the comp. Our baby business continued to be very strong and represents a sizable opportunity. We have been delivering growth in registry with our curated assortment, easy-to-use mobile app and in-store baby experts.  \n We've also introduced new products that are both high in quality and innovation, such as our dream deluxe power swivel recliner with heat and massage. Also, we're proud of our collaborations, and we just launched [indiscernible], who is making her debut line for baby with whimsical design and keepsake  quality. Also in Q4, we saw a strong consumer response to our expanded seasonal offerings that range from baby's first Christmas to Grinch-themed betting for teens. We saw customers return to us for Valentine's Day and Easter with a strong response to our new collaborations, including an expanded collection of Hello Kitty. We're also seeing a particularly strong trend with our NFL offering in teens. And finally, we're seeing strength in nursery furniture, a purchase that is less dependent on new home sales.  \n Moving to West Elm. West Elm is the brand that has been the most impacted by the consumer pullback in furniture. In Q4, West Elm ran a negative 15.3% and was negative 26% on a 2-year basis and positive 17.5% on a 4-year basis. However, what I'm excited about are our new product sales from this year's holiday assortment, which has strong growth to last year across all categories. The customers responded positively to fresh designs in furniture, textiles and decorative accessories. We also saw strong sales in holiday decor. And as we move into 2024, newness continues to accelerate and is performing well. \n Given these positive trends in newness, we continue to see a sizable opportunity in West Elm as it rebalances more inventory into these new products. The Williams-Sonoma brand ran a positive 1.6% comp in Q4. On a 2-year basis, the brand was negative 0.9% and was positive 29.8% on a 4-year basis. In Q4, the Williams-Sonoma Kitchen business ran a positive comp for the third consecutive quarter, and our Williams-Sonoma home business meaningfully improved.  \n Retail has been very strong, with inspiring in-store events and dramatically improved in stocks. Our seasonal categories grew double digits and we saw strength in core businesses like cookware and bakeware, as customers gravitated towards gifting and entertaining at home. Throughout the quarter, collaborations like our Cookware partnership with GreenPan and Stanley Tucci and the launch of a partnership with one of Netflix most watched shows, Bridgerton, continue to drive sales, buzz and new customer acquisition.  \n Now I would like to update you on our other initiatives. Business-to-business ended the year strong with Q4 at positive 5%, bringing the total year to a positive 1%, coming in just under $1 billion. The contract business exceeded expectations at positive 31% on the year, fueled by continued strength in the hospitality and residential sectors along with early traction in developing segments such as health care, gaming and senior living. Flagship projects in the back half of the year range from providing furnishings from medical office providers across the country as well as entertainment venues like Dave & Buster's.  \n Our B2B team also provided guest room furniture for the new Fontainebleau hotel that recently opened in Vegas. Now I'd like to talk about our global business. While macroeconomic pressures continue to affect our global business, we are pleased with our performance in India, Mexico and Canada. In India, we are seeing growth from strong marketing and brand awareness campaigns across the brands with a high penetration of our Design Crew business. In Mexico, the market continues to show strength driven by improved in-stocks and a strong holiday season. The Canada business continues to build momentum, fueled by our commitment to enhance the customer experience, both online and in retail.  \n Our digital initiatives in the Canadian market continue to gain new customers and drive results for our brands. And we are pleased with the initial positive response to the recent launches of Rejuvenation, Mark and Graham and Williams-Sonoma Home in Canada. As we continue to expand our omnichannel presence around the globe, India, Mexico and Canada remain our key strategic growth markets. \n Lastly, I'd like to update you on our emerging brands. Rejuvenation delivered a strong quarter with a double-digit positive comp driven by success in our remodel product categories and new growth initiatives.  \n We continue to see strength in both consumer and B2B sales. Rejuvenation continues to establish itself as a destination for home projects by providing products with great function, high-quality and timeless design details. We're excited about the momentum in the brand and the growth potential in 2024 and beyond and believe Rejuvenation can be our next billion-dollar brand. Mark and Graham, our high-quality gifting business saw strong growth this year with a single -- high single-digit positive comp in the quarter.  \n Our monogramming capabilities, coupled with unique high-quality gifts and the brand's curated online gift shops make it easy for customers to find a perfect gift. And finally, our startup GreenRow. We continue to gain momentum in this new brand, which utilizes sustainable materials and manufacturing practices to create colorful heirloom quality products. We remain optimistic about the potential of this brand and it's aesthetic. In 2024, we are planning to grow GreenRow with substantial increases in product assortment. These successful and exciting emerging brands demonstrate our ability to develop new businesses that expand our portfolio and address white space in the market. \n In summary, we're extremely proud of our accomplishments and financial results this year. We outperformed in 2023 despite the slowest housing market in several decades and massive geopolitical unrest. Although this pressured our top line trend, we stayed focused on full price selling, supply chain efficiencies and best-in-class customer service. We have transformed our business model, and as a result, we delivered an operating margin well above our guidance and well ahead for pre-pandemic operating margin.  \n We have a powerful portfolio of brands serving a range of categories, aesthetics and life stages, and we have built a strong omnichannel platform and infrastructure, which positions us well for the next stage of growth. It is early, but our reads on Q1 is strong, and we are optimistic about the opportunities that exist ahead.  \n With that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers and our outlook in more detail. Yes. I'm so excited about West Elm. I've had a chance to see all of the product that's coming in this year and their strategies. And I think it's a very clear, exciting growth story again for us. I think in terms of timing, it's always hard to predict exactly when things will go. But we are seeing, as I said, really strong results, not just in the holiday seasonal decor but the new product offer that's core. And the new design language that we've brought out, the new modern forms, we are building back our nonfurniture business, which drives customer engagement and also new customer acquisition and is very relevant and important for UPTs and repeat purchases. So that is on its way.  \n You're going to see that continue to grow through the year. And then also now that we have success on some of these furniture items, we know that the time line on when a furniture bestseller will be relevant is a lot longer than if you're a fashion apparel person. So we can then buy into it with confidence versus now our newness, although very high over last year, is -- it's just not a big enough percent of the total. So as we buy back into these winners and they compound through the year, that's when we expect to see then hit the total top line in a meaningful way. It's not a difference in approach. It's that when we see more opportunity, we invest more. And so we want to invest in advertising if we're going to get paid back. So we are looking at this every day, every week, every brand, and we're so lucky to have a test-and-learn methodology where we can try something in one brand. And if it works, roll it. And if it doesn't work, shut it down.  \n And so when we find something that works, you spend more, the ad cost then stays lower or it goes up with sales in tandem giving you more on the bottom line. We've done this for years. It's a little more complicated than it used to be when we just had the catalog because there's so many different things to invest in. And we're seeing a lot of opportunity in organic social now. And that is not paid. Now it helps to have paid social go along with organic social, but we're getting really good at pushing our content not just through our own channels, but into the whole social media world in a very effective way to get new customers into our brands. \n And so it's not just the ad cost spend, it's the creative spend that goes in building that incredible content like we did with Stanley Tucci, for example, which continues to be a really wonderful example of a successful collaboration that's working both in the short-term sales but also in bringing new customers to the brand. And so it's a great example of the kind of things that are changing, and they're really different from 10 years ago when those channels were not available to use. Yes. So really exciting story in our retail stores because we're very successfully leaving certain stores in certain areas and moving to vibrant centers. A great example is Annapolis. I don't know if you've been there, but we moved our WS right next to Whole Foods which is a really different strategy than your traditional retail placement. \n And it's really -- it's up to pro forma. It's up to the previous store and the [ 4-wall ] is much higher than our average. It's a really good case of where we work to the landlord to really build a killer store, and we're paying less and the financials are really strong and the store is great for the customers. And so that's what we continue to do as leases come up for renewal, there are amazing centers we're staying in, and we've been successful in reinvesting in the right things. So that if you're staying in the center, the stores look really fresh and also serve the customer in the way they want to be served, and there's new things than when we built stores 10 years ago, new businesses to fund, space allocation. \n And so across all of our brands, we're constantly looking at what's working, what's not working and how do we continue to optimize, but also keeping that beautiful inspiring store experience where you go in and we say the music plays, and you're excited to be there and you're inspired by the features, and we've got great salespeople who help you. And we're matching that also with very intuitive and helpful tech to help build these rooms, these houses. \n And just while I'm talking about this, I really just -- during this time where people are buying less furniture, we've taken the time to really reinvest in how we take our design service to the next level because we know that they're dying to buy new houses. And when the market switches, we're going to be there with an advanced platform for design services that we can use and leverage in our stores and also online that I think is game changing. Sure, Max. We really do have a strong lineup of opportunities in our portfolio of brands, and we're really confident in our outlook. Some examples of things that are working -- we're in a color trend phase, and we're seeing print and pattern and color sell across the brands actually. Easter is strong. That's good. It's early. So Jeff is telling me to be careful with this comment because when it's early, sometimes it ends a little differently than you expect but so far so good and even shifted. \n That tells you customers -- we saw Christmas decor be strong, too, Easter -- this is good for our brands. There's not a lot of people out there that serve in a quality way, the seasonal holidays. And we think they're wonderful. We love to decorate and entertain and show people how to do that across them. And for West Elm, that's been a business they haven't really gone after. So that's really upside for them. Easy updates, people, they may not be buying a house, but they might decide to redo one room. And we can see the effects of that on our sales. \n And also, the projects I mentioned in my prepared remarks about rejuvenation. Bath and kitchen remodels are still happening, and we are getting more attention as someone who can help provide high-quality and unique products in those spaces. New furniture, we're seeing strong results in West Elm, as I mentioned, new forms, and that's very exciting. And then collaboration. So whether it's Tucci, I keep talking about Tucci, Colin King, LoveShackFancy, Sheila Bridges, [ Elf ]. I mean, we've got a wide range of these collaborations. And they're just -- they bring new customers in, and we have a great time with them. They help us think about new design language that we may not naturally design into. \n And all of that is really good for the teams and great for the customers. And then there's continued categories that we're pushing as a bigger percent of total and pulling back. And so without going on too long or giving away too much competitive information, we're seeing some pockets where we have a lot of upside. The other thing that's really important in all this that you guys got to realize is that we continue to reduce our promotional offering. \n So at the same time that we're pushing this growth posture for this year, we are also absolutely determined to continue to pull back on promotions, which is a tricky thing, right? So we did it last year. You're going to see us continue to push it this year and balance the 2 out. We really believe strongly that long term, this is the right thing for our business. And we will take markdowns, and we will always try new things, and sometimes they don't work so you take a markdown, but we do not want to have up down pricing in our brands. Sure. Our team, our supply chain team, I'd say, is just phenomenal, and they continue to show that through the results. Although things have normalized from the pandemic, we still have a lot of areas for improvement, which will result in margin upside. We want to continue to drive down returns and replacements and any issue that affects the customer. We want a perfect delivery. We want to take all the friction out of that delivery. And so we're seeing incredible numbers across the board, on all those metrics I mentioned in my script. \n When a problem comes along, they're real, the Red Sea disruption is pretty terrible. However, it is not costing us any more money. So far, it is costing us about 10 days of delivery, give or take. And as I mentioned last time, we padded the deliveries to our customers once we heard about it, so we didn't disappoint them. And if we outperform and deliver faster, they're always happier than if it's late. Because they don't -- they can't -- most people don't connect anything with these world events. And so we have to really manage our delivery quotes very quickly once we hear these things. That's the most recent example. \n There is no doubt in my mind, Peter, that this year will be met with other things that we have to deal with. We tend to be very proactive about -- thinking about what those things could be to make sure that we're ahead. And I guess the good news is if there is any -- when these things happen, they affect everyone. And we're usually able to get ahead of it and solve it better than most. Yes, Chris. It's Laura. I just wanted to comment, I think it's important to remember that our focus this year is threefold. It's delivering growth, elevating customer service and driving margin. And we believe we can do all 3 things. We have that many opportunities in our model with our platform, with our world-class brands to achieve those things. I really -- as we look to the year, believe that the natural investments that we need to make will drive the top line. \n And so to the extent of the line by line, I know we're not answering your questions about those line by line. But you've seen our -- what we produced even in a down cycle, right, with margin improvements. And as I said in I think last call, you can imagine what that looks like in an up cycle. Our investments that we've been making over the last 10 years, have gotten us to a place where we are ready for more volume without having to have a step-up infrastructure investment. \n So while we talk about these things, they're small potatoes compared to distribution costs that others or a real platform -- re-platform costs that others have to put in place. We're ready for the volume to come this year and next and really excited about how that not only flows through, but also the opportunities to improve these customer service lines and we love those customer service lines because they drive margin. It's interesting, Kate. We try to glean every piece of information from sales and then they change. So I don't think it's fair to say right now that there's a specific price point that's the magic price point. We're seeing success across all prices. The customer wants a value. So we have some really expensive stuff that's really selling. And then we have some value price points that are really selling. And so there's not a pattern there that I'd hang a strategy on for now. \n In all of our brands, we've worked on great value to the consumer and also really new fresh designs. And so you cannot underestimate how important it is. When we get it right on a design, it's not that we take advantage of the price, it's that our price is generally a lot cheaper than other people making the same product and our quality is better. So we're -- that's what we're focused on is delivering value to the customer -- and I -- we were talking about this before the call, I can't prove that it's low prices, mid prices and high prices that are soft or strong. \n It's the stuff they want, and it's the new fresh product. Well, thank you all for joining us. We really appreciate your support and look forward to seeing some of you in New York and talking to you throughout the year."

            "name": "Jeff Howie",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. As Laura said, we're pleased to deliver a strong finish to fiscal year '23 with Q4 and full year '23 earnings significantly exceeding expectations. We delivered these earnings despite a challenging backdrop for home furnishings, pressuring our top line. Our strong profitability in this environment demonstrates the durability of our operating margin. Our results once again reinforced the themes we consistently communicated in 2023.  \n First, our steadfast commitment to maintain price integrity and not run site-wide promotions. Second, our first half supply chain cost pressures became tailwinds in the second half. And third, our discipline to control costs and manage inventory levels. Given the strength of our earnings through this challenging period for home furnishings, we're confident we can deliver long-term growth and even stronger earnings as the customer shifts back to home. \n Now let's dive into the numbers. I'll start with our Q4 results, followed by our full fiscal year '23 results, then provide guidance for '24. Q4 net revenues finished at $2.28 billion. Our revenues came in at the high end of our expectations, driven by strong holiday performance across our portfolio of brands, partially offset by ongoing customer hesitancy towards big ticket expenditures.  \n During the quarter, we continued our commitment to maintain price integrity and we reduced our overall level of promotions. Our Q4 comps came in at negative 6.8%, with our 2-year comp at negative 7.4% and our full year comp to 2019 at plus 29.1%. From a cadence perspective, our comps reflect a strong Black Friday to Christmas holiday period, [ bookended ] by inconsistent and choppy sales on both ends. \n Moving down the income statement. Q4 gross margin improved 480 basis points over last year to 46% as higher selling margins more than offset the impact of higher occupancy costs. Q4 selling margin at 55.1% were 560 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the full impact to our profitability of the supply chain tailwinds we've been guiding for several quarters.  \n Our higher Q4 selling margins were driven by both higher merchandise margins, and lower costs from supply chain efficiencies. Q4 merchandise margins contributed about half the increase in selling margins, driven by lower input costs, and our focus on full price selling. The balance sheet improvement came directly from supply chain efficiencies, which drove an improved customer experience and lower costs. We're proud to see our focus on execution and investment in supply chain paying off. Key metrics, including out-of-market shipping, multiple deliveries per order, returns, accommodations, damages and replacements are all performing at pre-pandemic levels, if not better.  \n Our higher Q4 selling margins more than offset the 2% growth in Q4 occupancy costs to $208 million or 9.1% of net revenues, up 80 basis points from last year. Turning now to SG&A. Our Q4 SG&A expense of $591 million, grew 13% and ran at 25.9% of revenues, deleveraging 460 basis points. As a reminder, our Q4 '22 SG&A results benefited from favorable items that we guided would not repeat in Q4 '23. Excluding the favorable items from last year, our SG&A dollars decreased 4%. Q4 employment was 300 basis points higher year-over-year, driven by higher performance-based incentive compensation in fiscal year '23 than last year.  \n In Q4, we continued to manage variable employment costs in accordance with top line trends. Q4 advertising expense was 60 basis points higher year-over-year as we took advantage of opportunities to invest into higher levels of advertising spend. As Laura mentioned, we continue to increase our spend as we are seeing very effective returns on this investment. Our ability to invest in these opportunities is an example of the competitive advantage of our agile, performance-driven marketing organization. our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform continue to drive efficient advertising spend.  \n Q4 general expenses drove the balance of the increase as we lapped a favorable insurance settlement received in fiscal year '22. On the bottom line, our Q4 earnings significantly exceeded expectations. Q4 operating income came in at $458 million and operating margin at 20.1%, 20 basis points above last year, with Q4 diluted earnings per share of $5.44. \n Turning now to our full year results, which again exceeded expectations. Full year net revenues finished at $7.75 billion. Our full year revenues reflect a larger home furnishings backdrop and our commitment to maintain price integrity even if it meant for growing some revenues in the short term.  \n Our full year comp ran down 9.9% with our 2-year comp at negative 3.4%, and our 4-year comp to 2019 at plus 35.6%. Full year gross margin ended at 42.7%, a 30 basis point improvement over last year as our first half supply chain headwinds turned into even stronger tailwinds in the back half. Full year selling margins at 53.2% were 170 basis points over last year and our highest ever selling margin rate driven by a nearly equal mix of higher merchandise margins and supply chain efficiency, these higher selling margins more than offset the 4% increase in our full year occupancy costs to $814 million. \n Full year SG&A expense decreased 5.8% to $2.04 billion. This decrease was driven by employment reductions taken in Q1 and Q2, our management of variable employment in line with top line trends and a 20 basis point reduction in advertising on the full year.  \n Full year SG&A deleverage of 140 basis points was primarily driven by lapping the favorable items recognized in Q4 '22 that I discussed earlier. On the bottom line, full year operating income finished at $1.27 billion, and operating margin at 16.4%, significantly above our pre-COVID levels and the 15% operating margin floor we established at the start of the year. Full year diluted earnings per share ended at $14.85. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the year with a cash balance  of $1.26 billion with no debt outstanding. This was after we invested $188 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth, and we returned over $545 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends. Year-end merchandise inventories stood at $1.25 billion, down 14.4% to last year. At these levels, we are well positioned to maintain our price integrity as we proactively managed our inventory levels in line with our top line trends.  \n We generated a record level of free cash flow in 2023 at $1.49 billion, driven by the strength of our earnings, proactive inventory management and financial discipline. Speaking of financial discipline, a prime example is our fiscal year '23 return on invested capital of 45%. This is among the best in the retail industry. \n Summing up our '23 results, we're proud to have delivered earnings substantially exceeding expectations. As Laura said, these results reflect the efforts of the entire team at Williams-Sonoma Inc. And I'd like to thank our talented team for delivering these outstanding results in a challenging environment.  \n Now let's turn to our '24 outlook. First, let me point out that 2024 is a 53-week year for Williams-Sonoma Inc. So the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. We will report comps on a 53-week versus 53-week comparable basis. All other year-over-year compares will be 53 weeks versus 52 weeks. \n We anticipate the additional week will contribute 150 basis points to revenue growth and 10 basis points to operating margins, both of which are embedded in our guidance. We anticipate 2024 will be a year of continued macroeconomic uncertainty. Lower interest rates could spur the housing market and shift consumer spending back to home, but timing is hard to predict.  \n And there is also the election and global geopolitical tension. With this in mind, we are providing a wide range of guidance for '24. '24 net revenues are expected to be in the range of down 3% to up 3% with comps between down 4.5% to up 1.5% and operating margins between 16.5% and 16.8%. On the top line, we anticipate sequential improvement across the year. With the first half tougher than the second half, as our top line comparisons get easier. On the bottom line, we expect our supply chain tailwinds will continue through at least the first half of '24, but will be partially offset by higher advertising spend. In the back half, we anticipate our operating margins will be in line with '23 results.  \n Our capital allocation plans for '24 prioritize funding our business operations and investing in long-term growth. We expect to spend $225 million in capital expenditures to invest in the long-term growth of our business. 75% of this capital spend will be dedicated to drive our e-commerce leadership and supply chain efficiency. We expect to continue to return excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and ongoing share repurchases. For dividends, today, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend payout of 26% or $0.23 to $1.13 per share. Fiscal year '24 will be the 15th consecutive year of increased dividend payouts, which we are both proud of and remain committed to.  \n For share repurchases, today, we also announced our Board has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing previous authorizations and under which we will opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns to our shareholders. Combined, our dividend increase and new share repurchase authorization continue our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.  \n In fact, we've returned over $3.8 billion to our shareholders over the last 6 years. As we look further into the future beyond '24, we are reiterating our long-term top line guidance of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth. And in the long term, we now believe we can sustain operating margins in the mid to high teens. \n We are confident that we will continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these reasons. Our ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet. \n With that, I'll open the call for questions. Steve. Yes, on our gross margin outlook and our EBIT margin outlook, as you know, we don't guide the individual line items. We provide top line guidance and bottom line operating margin guidance. And the reason why it gives us the flexibility to react as we see trends evolve in the business and the different levers we can pull along the way. And as you've seen, as we did in '23, we know the levers to pull to deliver results. We see continued strength in our operating margin.  \n And as we guided today, we see it landing between 16.5% to 16.8% on the year. We do see that the supply chain tailwinds that we've been seeing in the back half of '23 will continue into the front half of '24 but will be offset by some additional advertising expenditures as we talked about, we did in -- Q4 of '23. But overall, we're very confident in our operating margin and looking forward to delivering these results. Yes. So simply to answer your question, even if revenues were to come a little bit lower, we're confident in our operating margin guidance. There's additional levers that we can pull within the business if that were to be the case. But our outlook is a little bit more positive. We think we're closer to the end of the down cycle in home furnishings rather than the beginning. And we're focused on delivering results in our business. And I really think that we have opportunities to continue to improve what we're doing, and there's more things that we can do to drive earnings throughout the year. Jonathan, we see B2B contributing about 100 basis points to our comp in '24, which is embedded in our guidance. Here's what's exciting. We're really optimistic about B2B growth as we look forward to '24. The business was up 1% overall in '23 with contract up 31%. And while the trade business has been more impacted by the slowed housing market, we've seen some recent improvement in that trend. However, we remain focused on accelerating our contract business, and we're really pleased with the momentum we're seeing. And here for us, it's really a growth story. Overall, B2B is slightly accretive to our operating margins. And we just see continued growth as we disrupt this $80 billion piece of our TAM. I think the way we think about it is at the start of '23, we established a 15% operating margin floor. And then year-end results, we delivered a 16.4% operating margin. And this year, we're guiding 16.5% to 16.8%. So we remain confident in our operating margin durability especially as we start to see our growth algorithm of mid- to high single-digit growth over the long term. So we're pretty confident in that. And we think that as we get beyond '24, we certainly have the upside to sustain these operating margins longer. In terms of the pieces of margin versus SG&A, we don't -- as you know, we don't guide those particular in the line items, especially over the long term. But on the bottom line, we've established that we can deliver these results, and we remain confident in both for '24 as well as the long term beyond that. Yes. I mean in terms of where we are in our journey of retail optimization, we're probably in the middle innings. As I've discussed in the past, we have -- about 50% of our leases come due in the next 5 years. So we look to continue to optimize the real estate. And usually, we target a higher number of store closures, but they just tend to net out through the way the process works to about where we've been in the past few years. \n So in terms of particular numbers, you can look to the past, say, 3 or 4 years is a good guidepost. And then in terms of where occupancy is going to go, and I'll go back to we don't guide individual lines. We really guide the top and the bottom line. So that gives us more levers to pull throughout the year. And now there are fixed costs within occupancy, there's also a lot of variable costs, too. So there's things we can go -- do throughout the year if necessary. So it's all embedded within our full year guidance. Yes, Chris. So furniture trends in Q4 were down, but sequentially improved over Q3. And yes, we do see a benefit by the higher penetration of Sonoma in Q4. But overall, to Laura's comments before, we're very pleased with our quarter-to-date performance. but it's early. And as Laura mentioned, there's the Easter shift, the turnover at Easter, which sometimes has impacts on the curves. But I think the important thing is we're not just a furniture company. \n We only have about half of our assortment in furniture. So we have a powerful portfolio of brands with a wide range of product assortment, and we can really meet the trends as the consumer shopping. And that gives us confidence in where we see our outlook and we can really service the customers to what they're shopping to today. Kate. Well, first, we're in an election year. A lot's get said on the campaign trail and who knows where this conversation really goes in the end. Second, we've transformed our sourcing base since the last time the subject was top of mind 6 years ago. Today, only 25% of our goods are sourced from China, which is about half of what it was back then. And here is the most important thing. We have some real key competitive advantages that serve us well into these situations. First, 90% of our products are proprietary, designed and exclusively made for our brands. And then we operate our own in-house best-in-class global sourcing operation. \n So with 12 overseas offices, it's our own boots on the ground, managing sourcing decisions, production and shipping, and we're the 13th largest container importer into the United States. So we have scale and relationships. Others do not. So punchline being, if the landscape changes, we have the ability to respond that others do not."

[Operator Instructions]\n I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJeremy Brooks: Good morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'm here this morning with Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; Yasir Anwar, our Chief Digital and Technology Officer; and Felix Carbullido, our President of the Williams-Sonoma brand. \n Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, included updated guidance for fiscal '23 and our long-term outlook. We believe these statements reflect our best estimates. However, we cannot make any assurances these statements will materialize, and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call. \n Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier this morning. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our filings with the SEC. Finally, a replay of this call is available on our Investor Relations website. \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laura. \nLaura Alber: Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Before we get into our Q3 results, I would like to take a minute to thank the incredible team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. for another quarter of great results. Without their hard work, dedication and focus, none of the results we are reporting today would have been achievable. \n We are proud to deliver another quarter of strong earnings, significantly exceeding expectations despite a challenging economic backdrop for our industry. We beat profitability estimates with a record third quarter operating margin of 17%, with earnings per share of $3.66. \n Our comp sales, which reflect the larger macroeconomic backdrop, ran negative 14.6% in Q3 and our 2-year comp was negative 6.5% and our 4-year comp to 2019 was positive 34.8%. These results were achieved in an environment filled with ongoing consumer hesitancy on high-ticket discretionary furniture and elevated levels of promotional activity. \n Despite this environment, we continue to drive results because of our unique proposition in the marketplace and our relentless focus on customer service. Our advantage is our portfolio of brands serving a wide range of categories, aesthetics and life stages. While people are currently buying fewer large-ticket furniture pieces than last year, our portfolio of brands and product offerings has us positioned well for this shift into kitchen purchases, fashion textiles, dorm, baby and seasonal holiday offerings. \n Our in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated supply chain are also key in producing proprietary products at the best quality value relationship in the market. We remain firmly committed to reducing promotions despite elevated levels of discounting in the industry. In fact, our third quarter promotional levels were meaningfully lower than last year. \n Instead, we are meeting our customers' needs for value by introducing a larger offering of new products at mid-tier and lower price points. Not only is this strategy good for profits, but we have also reduced friction with our customers as we give them better value without confusing them with short-term discounts. We strongly believe that this is the right way to run our business as it preserves the design value price equation that we offer and our customers appreciate. \n Moving on to customer service and the supply chain. We are seeing the year-over-year benefit of selling through inventories with lower supply chain costs. And we continue to increase selling margins by reducing out-of-market multiple shipments. We have improved our customer service, returning to pre-pandemic and best-in-class levels. \n Investments in the final mile delivery experience have resulted in fewer customer accommodations, lower returns, lower damages and lower replacements. And customer metrics like on-time delivery are at record highs, and backorder crate -- rates have substantially improved. The total benefit from these supply chain and customer service improvements is significant, and you can see it in our results today. \n Regarding marketing, we increased our spend from Q2 but still leveraged in the quarter. We continue to ensure that our marketing investment gives us the ability to test new formats, to connect with new customers and to showcase our offering to our existing customer base and our highly engaged brand loyalists. We've seen increasing success with our marketing and product collaborations, and we will continue to build upon them. \n Our ongoing investment in building our proprietary e-commerce technology continues to improve our online experience. We're focused on offering customers inspiring content and dynamic tools to assist with their design projects, and AI is accelerating these efforts. We see many opportunities for our business from developments from AI. And as early adapters of integrating AI, we look forward to leading the retail industry in the area, and we will focus on quality, authenticity and responsiveness of this new technology. \n And as focused as we are on our e-commerce capabilities, we are also continuing to focus on delivering a best-in-class retail business. Our stores are beautifully designed and curated with inspirational assortments, and our continued retail optimization efforts have refocused our fleet on the most profitable, inspiring and strategic locations. \n On the sustainability front, we are proud to report that in Q3, we were named the top scorer on the Sustainable Furnishings Council's Wood Furniture Scorecard for the sixth consecutive year. Using sustainable wood has been a key focus of our strategy and a differentiator of our business. \n Now I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 16.6% comp in Q3, but ran a positive 3% on a 2-year basis and a positive 43% on a 4-year basis. We have substantially reduced the promotional offerings in the brand and have successfully introduced new low- and mid-tier programs at great value. And while furniture demand has been most impacted, we are seeing strength in textiles and seasonal decorating. We're excited for the holiday season given strong early reads on our innovative proprietary collections. \n Earlier this week, we announced the launch of a new mobile shopping and design app for Pottery Barn following the success of our Pottery Barn Kids and Pottery Barn Teen apps. The Pottery Barn mobile app delivers a convenient customer shopping experience and makes it easy to create and manage a registry on the go. Now customers can explore and shop full rooms, easily share their favorite products and connect with a design experts, all through the convenience of their phone or tablet. \n The Pottery Barn children's business ran a negative 6.9% comp in Q3 and was negative 11.7% on a 2-year basis and positive 29% on a 4-year basis. Across these life stage brands, we are focused on delivering compelling innovation and elevating the customer experience.\n One key area of focus in the quarter has been the evolution of our back-to-school offering. Here, we saw standout growth in our dorm business as customers gravitated to higher design and quality. We offer a compelling, complete solution that is easy to shop on our Pottery Barn Teen app. And given the size of the dorm market, we believe this represents a significant opportunity for us for years to come. \n We also continue to focus on another key life stage offering, which is baby, the entry point to the children's home furnishings brand. Here, we are winning with our innovative nursery seating and a curated selection of high-quality baby gear. In our stores and across our mobile app, customers can register with Pottery Barn Kids and receive help from our nursery experts. \n Also, we're really encouraged by the strength of our innovative product introductions and fresh product collaborations with strong response to recent Super Mario and LoveShackFancy launches. And as we look to the quarter ahead, we believe we have a compelling pipeline of collaborations that our customer will love. \n Moving on to West Elm. West Elm is the brand that has been most impacted by the customer pullback in furniture. In Q3, West Elm ran a negative 22.4% and was negative 18.2% on a 2-year basis and ran a positive 26.1% on a 4-year basis. West Elm has the highest percentage of its assortment in furniture, the most underdeveloped in other categories and a customer base that's the most impacted by the current macro environment. \n Despite current challenging dynamics, West Elm saw very strong reception to their new fall products, which marked a real evolution in the brand's modern design voice. Sales from this year's fall assortment are up to last year, with positive customer response to fresh, furniture forms, mixed materials and new textures and innovations in textile. Early holiday reads have also been positive in seasonal trim and tabletop, as well as hosting and entertaining categories. \n Given these positive reads, we see sizable opportunity in West Elm as it rebalances more into textiles, decorative accessories, entertainment and seasonal offerings. We continue to be very optimistic about the long-term growth trajectory of West Elm with its industry-leading design and value. \n The Williams-Sonoma brand, which includes Williams-Sonoma Home, ran a negative 1.9% comp in Q3. On a 2-year basis, the brand ran negative 3.4% and was positive 34.6% on a 4-year basis. The Williams-Sonoma Kitchen business ran a positive comp for the second consecutive quarter this year, primarily driven by retail. \n Earlier this quarter, we launched a successful collaboration in cookware with Stanley Tucci, who designed an exclusive collection with GreenPan for Williams-Sonoma. Collaborations like Tucci's have been an excellent vehicle for growth and new customer acquisition. \n Kitchen continues to see strength in high-end electrics, particularly in coffee and espresso. And the Williams-Sonoma Home business, while still negative, is beginning to see improved trends, with a refreshed more editorial point of view that showcases updated textiles and decorative accessories. \n Looking to Q4, Williams-Sonoma becomes a bigger part of our business, and early reads on holiday are positive, indicating a strong season of entertaining and gifting ahead. We have an impressive pipeline of new launches, with engaging content and corresponding events for our customers to experience both in-store and online. \n Now I'd like to update you on our other initiatives. We are pleased to report Business-to-Business delivered a positive quarter, running positive 1.5% in Q3, driven by 30% growth in the contract business. Exciting wins in the quarter included a brand standard program for Pottery Barn with Pendry Hotels for custom outdoor furniture and a new partnership with a premier developer partner, Jamestown, for 2 new properties, including a senior living tower and a new residential development. \n We're also excited by the success of specific B2B product developments like the expansion of our restaurant furniture program that has been key to gaining momentum in the food and beverage space with clients like Dave & Buster's, along with clients in the sports and entertainment space. The future remains bright for this business. \n Now I'd like to talk about our global business. Our global strategy has not changed, and we continue to focus on a franchise-first model. This business has, of course, been affected by the uncertain macro environment, particularly in the Middle East. We are excited to see our brands exceed expectations in other markets like India. \n We opened our third West Elm retail location in Pune, and expanded our Pottery Barn brands into the world famous Jio World Plaza now open in Mumbai. The Mexico market is also showing strength, driven by improved in-stocks in furniture and strong back-to-school and seasonal assortments. And we continue to see momentum in our Canada business, fueled by our commitment to enhancing the customer experience both online and in retail. We have also grown the brand and service offerings available to Canadian customers by launching Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham online, and relaunching Gift Registry in Canada. \n Lastly, I'd like to update you on our emerging brands. Rejuvenation delivered a positive quarter, driven by our remodel and refresh categories as well as new growth initiatives. Customers continue to update their homes, specifically in the spaces of kitchen and bath. We are continuing to grow the brand in new markets by opening a new store in the San Diego market and another new store opening this weekend in North Carolina. We continue to be excited by the opportunity we have for growth from the Rejuvenation brand. \n We are also pleased with our results in Mark and Graham, our gifting and personalization brand. We are optimistic for Q4 as we head into the key gift-giving holiday season. Customers will benefit from the brand's inspiring content and curated monogram gift guides organized by both recipients and price points. \n And at GreenRow, we continue to gain momentum in this new brand, which utilizes sustainable materials and manufacturing practices to create colorful heirloom quality products. While it's early, we remain optimistic about the potential of this brand and its aesthetic. These successful and exciting emerging brands demonstrate our ability to develop new businesses that expand our portfolio of brands and address white space in our product offerings, all with minimal investment and low cost of entry, leveraging our knowledge and infrastructure.\n In summary, our outperformance this quarter drove a record Q3 operating margin of 17%. Although customers are shifting their spending temporarily away from high-ticket furniture purchases, we have a powerful portfolio of brands serving a range of categories, aesthetics and life stages to meet the demands of customers. And despite our sales running down this year, our execution and the strength of our operating model produced strong earnings again this quarter, driven by our full-price selling, supply chain efficiencies and best-in-class customer service. Our early seasonal reads are strong, and we are optimistic about the holiday season. \n As we put this all together, we are raising our guidance for the year. We now expect full year revenues to come in at a range of down 10% to down 12%, and we are raising our outlook on operating margin to a range of 16% to 16.5%. It is important to note that the reduction in our revenues outlook is more than offset by our raised operating margin outlook. \n And with that, I will turn the call over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers in detail. \nJeff Howie: Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. As Laura said, we're proud that, once again, we've delivered earnings substantially exceeding expectations. \n Our Q3 results reinforce the themes we've consistently communicated over the past several quarters: first, our steadfast commitment to maintain price integrity and not run site-wide promotions; second, how our earlier supply chain cost pressures will become tailwinds in the second half and beyond and third, our ability to control costs and manage inventory levels. Our strong profitability this quarter, despite softer top line revenues, demonstrates the durability of our operating margin. \n Now let's dive into our Q3 results, followed by an update on our fiscal year guidance. In addition to year-over-year results, I'll reference 2019 as it's helpful to compare our performance with pre-pandemic levels. Net revenues came in at $1.854 billion. While below our expectations, our revenues reflect the larger home furnishing backdrop and our commitment to maintain price integrity even if it means forgoing some revenues in the short term. \n Our revenue growth in Q3 came in at negative 14.6% comp. Our 2-year stack was negative 6.5% and our 4-year stack against 2019 grew 34.8%. Our Q3 demand comp at negative 11.8% was materially unchanged from our Q2 trend. Our 2-year demand stack was negative 13.8%, and our 4-year demand stack was a positive 33.2%. \n Our revenue comps this quarter reflect a normalized spread between demand and net comps. Our improvement across returns and appeasements offsets the majority of last year's outsized back order fill. From a cadence perspective, our demand trends continue to be inconsistent and choppy, especially after Labor Day. \n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin at 44.4% exceeded our expectations. The 290 basis point improvement over last year reflects the supply chain tailwinds we've been guiding for several quarters. Merchandise margins increased materially over last year, driven by lower ocean freight costs flowing into our income statement and our focus on full price selling and price integrity. In fact, merchandise margins were substantially higher than Q3 2019.\n Selling margin also improved materially over last year, driven by supply chain efficiencies. Through our improved execution and investment in supply chain, we substantially improved our customer experience. Key metrics, including out-of-market shipping, multiple deliveries per order, returns, accommodations, damages and replacements are all performing at pre-pandemic levels, if not better. I'd like to congratulate and thank our supply chain organization for delivering these results. Altogether, our selling margins were 450 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the full impact to our profitability of the supply chain tailwinds. \n Occupancy costs of $200 million were 1% lower than last year and decreased 2% quarter-over-quarter. Coming in at 10.8% of net revenues, occupancy deleveraged 160 basis points to last year driven by the softer top line. Our Q3 gross margin at 44.4% is 840 basis points higher than 2019's 36%. Our SG&A expenses of $507 million were down 11% to last year, once again reflecting our ability to control costs. Our 27.4% rate deleveraged 140 basis points to last year, driven by general expenses offsetting variable expense savings.\n Employment expense decreased double digits versus last year, but deleveraged, primarily driven by favorability in last year's stock-based compensation. We continue to manage variable employment costs in accordance with top line trends. Our advertising expense slightly leveraged in Q3 despite increased funding quarter-over-quarter as we continue to test into higher levels of advertising spend.\n Our rate leverage reflects the competitive advantage of our agile performance-driven marketing organization. Our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform continue to drive efficient advertising spend. General expenses drove the majority of the deleverage on the quarter, resulting from timing of asset disposals and legal settlements. Overall, our year-to-date SG&A through 39 weeks is down 12% to last year and flat on a rate basis. And it's 100 basis points lower than 2019's SG&A rate of 28.4%.\n Regarding the bottom line, our results speak for themselves. Q3 operating income came in at $315 million and operating margin at 17%, a record operating margin for our third quarter. 17% is 150 basis points above last year and 940 basis points above 2019's 7.6%. Our diluted earnings per share of $3.66 was slightly below last year's third quarter earnings per share of $3.72, but significantly above 2019 earnings per share of $1.02. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $699 million with no debt outstanding. This was after we invested $42 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth, and we returned over $61 million to our shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. \n Merchandise inventories at $1.4 billion were down 17.2% to last year. Three important points I'd like to emphasize once again: First, we are well positioned to maintain our price integrity as we proactively manage our inventory levels in line with our demand trends; second, going into the holiday season, our in-stock levels are near historical highs, and our regional inventory balance and composition is well positioned; third, our Q3 ending inventory levels are up only 11% versus same period in 2019, and that's with revenue comps of 34.8% over the same time frame. This discipline highlights how we've improved both our inventory efficiency and turnover. \n Summing up our Q3 results, we're proud to have delivered earnings substantially exceeding expectations. I'd like to thank all our associates for delivering these outstanding results. \n Now let's turn to our outlook. Based on our Q3 results, we are updating our full year outlook. Our new guidance reflects both the ongoing top line uncertainty and the strength in our operating margin. We now expect full year '23 net revenues to be in a range of down 10% comp to down 12% comp, and we are raising our operating margin outlook to a range of 16% to 16.5%. It's important to note that our lower sales outlook is more than offset by our increased operating margin, producing higher implied EPS guidance. \n On the top line, our updated guidance is based upon the facts and trends we know today from our Q3 results. Specifically, a conservative view of our 1-, 2- and 4-year trends in Q3 connects with the implicit Q4 guide in our updated full year '23 net revenue guidance. Given the macroeconomic environment, we believe this outlook is prudent. \n On the bottom line, our supply chain tailwinds will continue to bolster our profitability, producing full year operating margin within our updated range of 16% to 16.5%, with implied Q4 operating margins in line with historical builds from Q3. We continue to expect our full year income tax rate to be approximately 26%. Our 2023 capital expenditures are now anticipated to be $225 million due to timing of project spend. \n As we have communicated quarterly, we are committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic stock repurchases. We will continue to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, and we have almost $700 million remaining under our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization to repurchase our stock opportunistically. \n As we look forward to 2024, we will balance the macroeconomic uncertainty with our long-term growth potential, and we'll provide guidance in March. As we look further into the future beyond '24, we are reiterating our long-term guidance of mid- to high single-digit top line growth with operating margins exceeding 15%. \n We're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these reasons: our ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishings industry; the strength of our in-house proprietary design; the competitive advantage of our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy; the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives; and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet. \n With that, I'll open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: The compression in your top line in the third quarter and the implied slowdown in the fourth quarter really isn't all that surprising given the backdrop today. But at what point do you run the risk of losing market share or mind share by not engaging? And then as a follow-up, gross margin control was actually more impressive. Can you talk about the drivers there and the sustainability into 2024, particularly on the supply chain front? \nJeff Howie: Chuck, why don't we start with the last one, and I'll talk about gross margin, and then I'll turn it over to Laura to talk about our promotional posture. \n Gross margin exceeded our expectations this quarter, really driven by the tailwinds I've been guiding for the past several quarters. There were 3 main drivers in order of magnitude: first, our lower ocean freight from rate normalization flowing into our income statement; second, supply chain efficiencies, including lower out-of-market shipping, fewer multiple deliveries per order and decreased returns, accommodations, damages and replacements; and third, reduced promotional activity as we focused on full-price selling and maintained our price integrity. \n Overall, the majority of the improvement came from ocean freight and supply chain efficiencies. We've made significant improvements in our customer service, and you can see it in our results. And I want to once again thank our supply chain organization for really knocking the cover off the ball. \n Going to your question about how these will continue, here's what you need to remember. Our Q3 margins represent the start of the tailwinds we will see from supply chain efficiencies. And while we don't guide specific lines, we anticipate similar tailwinds in Q4 and even into 2024. \nLaura Alber: Chuck, so I don't think we should think about gross margin as a trade for share. The two are not necessarily as correlated as one might think. In fact, it's not clear that people who are running more promotions are going to gain more share, especially long term. And for our target customer, we are confident that we are gaining share. And at the high-quality, regular price customer is the one that we best serve given what we do with brands. \n And trust me, we are very focused on returning to growth. In fact, we're very confident about our strategies and our ability to execute. It's the environment that is really the question mark for us as we look at the balance of the year in the short term. And so we continue to test different things to see what makes sense, whether it's pricing up, down, more marketing, less marketing. And trust me, as we see things that do not just benefit short term, we are definitely focused on pushing them and building upon them for the long term. \nCharles Grom: Okay. Great. And then can we just talk a little bit about like-for-like SKU pricing today relative to 2019? I know there's been a lot of improvements, but if you finance that are actually like-for-like, where do we stand today relative to back then? \nLaura Alber: That's a good question, Chuck. I didn't expect that one. So 2019, well, it was a long time ago, it's hard to remember. We took some price increases during the pandemic, as you know. And a lot of them have stuck and some we've backed off. And we've also gotten a lot of vendor price reductions, which is a great thing to see. And we've used some of those to reduce prices to our consumers so that we are very competitive with our value quality relationship. \n The thing to remember also is that it's not just about reducing prices on existing products. We bring in a fair amount of exclusive, exciting newness. And we've been building into both our mid-tier and low price points, and those things are full margins. And so it's a very good way to continue to build value into the business. But vis-a-vis 2019, I actually don't have that number on how we exactly stand with the entire assortment versus 2019 in pricing. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez with Telsey Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernandez: Congratulations on the profitability. I wanted to ask on promotions, Laura, your comment that you were less promotional than a year ago. I know you've pulled back from the site-wide promotions a while back. So where -- I guess, where are you lowering promotions? Is it clearance? Is it other items like rewards, et cetera? It would be helpful to understand that trend. \nLaura Alber: Yes. Thank you for the question. We've, in fact, pulled back promotions both sequentially this year and versus last year. And we've pulled back in -- we took away all up-down pricing that was site-wide. The site-wide promotions have been gone. We also did remove e-mail overlay, all those hidden promo tactics that other people use, coupon matches, double points, we don't offer any of those. But the level of clearance and promotions during our sale periods, which we call warehouse sales, is also lower. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. \nPeter Benedict: I guess just maybe can you expand a little more on retail optimization, where you stand in that process, what's still to come. Jeff, you mentioned the occupancy cost down slightly year-over-year in the third quarter. Is flat to down something that's sustainable in that line as you think into 4Q and then into '24? That's my first question. \nJeff Howie: Peter, we continue to operate a world-class retail business, and our stores serve as billboards for the brand and operate as profit centers. They're beautifully designed and curated with aspirational assortments, and we believe we will continue to serve as a competitive advantage. \n We continue on our journey of retail optimization. Since 2019, we've closed about 15% of our store count. And over the next 3 to 5 years, about 50% of our leases come due, and we'll continue to guide that we anticipate about 20% of the will close over time.\n Now there's multiple aspects to our retail optimization strategy. And first, obviously, we'll close any of the least-performing stores from a profitability standpoint or a brand denigrating, that's the low-hanging fruit. \n The second point, which is really the exciting one, is the repositioning of our retail fleet. And this is where we're taking a look at some of our older stores that in our older malls that the customer is not shopping as frequently in or moving to more vibrant lifestyle centers. And here, we're seeing not only a better customer engagement, better top line, but better economics as well. And we'll continue to look to reposition our fleet to right locations as leases come due. \n And of course, it all comes down to negotiations. It's part of the real estate business, as we all know. We're probably -- and from an innings standpoint, we're probably in inning 6, I think, inning 5 or 6. And on our journey here, there's more work to do. We have -- like I said, we have a lot of leases coming due.\n But the key point here is we continue to improve our retail profitability. And I'll give one example of where this is continuing to resonate. And I know used in the last call, but it continues to be an outstanding example of where the strategy of retail positioning, retail optimization really works, and that's our Pottery Barn store in Westport, Connecticut, which we moved from downtown Westport, not the best location for us to a location on the post road that is more vibrant, more customer-friendly. And I said in Q3 that the results were 30% better than the prior store -- I mean, in Q2, that the results were 30% better than prior store. They're now up 45% to the prior store. So this strategy continues to gain traction. \n The key thing for us is that our world-class stores, coupled with our best-in-class e-commerce tools, demonstrates a digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy as a key differentiator in the home furnishings industry. \nPeter Benedict: Well, good. Nice to see my recent visit to the Westport store showing up in the numbers there, I guess. \nJeff Howie: Thank you for your business, Peter. \nPeter Benedict: Yes. Not exactly. So next question just would be around the cash balance, obviously, it continues to rise. You've slowed the buyback here of late. Just curious, is this just prudent caution given all the macro pressures, the risks that are out there? Or is there something more strategic that's maybe at play here in terms of building the cash balance? \nJeff Howie: Yes. Peter, as you know, we don't commit to a consistent cadence of share repurchases. We do remain committed to driving long-term shareholder returns, and will opportunistically buy back stock and drive shareholder returns. \n In Q3, we had extremely strong performance in our stock price relative to the broader market. We exceeded all 3 major indexes, a collection of hardlines retail and softlines retail. So we outperformed. So it's not what we consider opportunistic. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Max Rakhlenko with TD Cowen. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: Congrats on the nice quarter. So first, Laura, how are the brands performing against your own internal expectations? And which brands do you view to have the bigger opportunities to take market share from some of your struggling or closing peers? \nLaura Alber: It's a great question. We are disappointed in the top line performance. As you know, in most of our brands this year, except for our emerging brands, we've seen slower-than-expected furniture performance. That said, we've seen really strong seasonal performance, and these life stage businesses in certain categories are better than expected. So it's a big change for us that we've really focused on and made the shift into quickly with our marketing and our inventory purchases. \n But as I think about the long term and we think about where we sit vis-a-vis the market, the market as you know is very large and very fractured. And so there's huge opportunity for us to gain share with all of our brands. I think that the names of our brands are stronger than the volumes that they produce. \n When you think about the Williams-Sonoma name, the brand, Williams-Sonoma, and you think about how small it is, and the consolidation of the industry with Bed Bath & Beyond closing its retail footprint and others going out of business, and not seeing anyone deliver on exclusive proprietary products for high-end kitchen, you can see what a tremendous opportunity we have. \n And with that also, we have Williams-Sonoma Home, which sits in that higher-end space where there's not many, particularly in the aesthetic that we're serving. I actually have Felix sitting right next to me. And I -- we invited him today because we're upon the very large holiday season that we're looking forward to. And as you know, Williams-Sonoma really spikes during the holiday season. \n And so Felix, do you want to make a few comments about how you see your brand gaining market share in the future? \nFelix Carbullido: Sure. I don't want to give away too much of our winning formula, but it includes curating the best products out there, right, inspiring customers how to use it, offering it in their channel of choice, whether it be online or in-store. I think some houseware brands offer products that don't inspire, and some inspire but don't have 150-plus stores and a great website to purchase from. As Jeff said, our beautiful stores, our well-trained and passionate store associates, our inspiring catalog and our multidimensional website are competitive advantages I don't think anyone really has. \n And as we head into the fourth quarter, this is the time that we celebrate the most. We have Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas, New Year's Eve, these are reasons for people to come visit our stores. And I think we've pulled together the best assortment of gifts and holiday decor that we ever have had. So we're excited, and we want to continue to gain market share, and all indicators are that in the kitchen business, it appears we are. \nLaura Alber: And then as you look at our other brands, both the big ones, both West Elm and Pottery Barn, we have shown this year that there's areas within each brand that are very underdeveloped and where there's sizable opportunity from accessible furniture for Pottery Barn and dorm to -- in West Elm, filling out the modern accessory textile piece, which we haven't addressed and also more modern seasonal assortments. That's a big opportunity and one that has never been built. So we see us being able to pick up share in those two brands in specific categories. \n And of course, the temporary furniture pullback is just that. This, too, shall reverse. And the great news is that we won't have built our business or held it up with promotions like others are at this time. That is getting out of our base, and it's going to continue to allow us to focus on delivering proprietary products and not just thinking about markdowns all the time, but thinking about how to build better collaborations and more relevant product lines that the customer loves. \n The last thing I'll just say is, we've talked about B2B, it's across all brands. It's a big driver of market share for us because nobody is doing what we're doing. And so it's a very, very large industry, and we're still scratching the surface. And we are still -- as Josie who runs it likes to say, we are still doing more gathering than hunting. And we have a lot more that we can do as we continue to build this muscle. So we're excited about the growth algorithm for the future. And we do recognize that it's been softer than expected this year, particularly in furniture, but we're completely focused on that growth posture looking out into the future. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: That's great. Super helpful. And Jeff, I have to ask you a margin question. But when we think about the updated margin guidance, is there anything in it that makes you think that you can at least hold it as we think ahead, especially once you start to leverage fixed expenses on top line growth? \nJeff Howie: As I said in the answer to Chuck's question on gross margin, we anticipate that the results we saw in Q4, the tailwinds I've been talking about will continue -- I'm sorry, the results from Q3, the tailwinds I've been talking about will continue into Q4. These are pretty strong tailwinds. I talked about the impact of ocean freight, our supply chain efficiencies and our full price selling.\n While we're talking about guidance, I also want to just point out that while we don't guide specific lines, in last year's Q4, our SG&A materially benefited from some large favorable items we recorded that we don't anticipate reoccurring this year. But here's the key takeaway, it's all contemplated in our guidance, which we've raised our full year outlook for implied EPS. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nUriel Zachary Abraham: This is Zach on for Simeon. On your view for top line, do you think this year will be the bottom? Your updated guidance implies an underlying deceleration in the fourth quarter across stacks. So do you think that the trends could inflect in '24? \nJeff Howie: We'll talk more about next year after we get through the really important holiday season. Right now, that's where our focus is. And as Laura just touched on, our primary objective in '24 will be to drive both growth and margin, and we'll balance the macroeconomic certainty with our long-term growth potential. But we'll talk more about that in March. \nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. \nAnthony Chukumba: Let me add my congratulations as well on the strong profitability. So you talked about introducing a larger ordering of new products at mid-tier and lower price points. And then you talked specifically about Pottery Barn introducing some of those products. \n I guess just 2 questions related. Are there any other brands that have -- where you've introduced those mid- and lower-tier products? And then how do the merchandise, the selling margins on those products, compare to some of your higher price point offerings? \nLaura Alber: Thanks, Anthony. The margin profile is the same as the rest of our products. So it's not that they're lower at all, in fact, they're great margins. And we've done the same thing also in West Elm. And you're going to see us West Elm, which I'm really excited about, continue to have more and more newness sequentially. So for fall, you might have heard in my prepared remarks that we had some just superb winners in the furniture assortment. \n And in some cases, they were also at the higher price points. So we're building upon those. Many of them are sold out right now. And we're thrilled, but we are also chasing those products, and we'll be getting back in stock in Q1 in those. And that gives us confidence about where we want to take the brand aesthetically, not just from a price point, but where we think the modern customer wants to be now where that evolution is going. \n And so as we go into Q1 and Q2, I'm just really excited about the product line that you're going to see in West Elm. And based on the wins that we have currently, I think it's going to be a big change and the next really big step in the evolution, the next chapter, if you will, for West Elm's winning strategy. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Bank of America. \nJason Haas: So I wanted to also ask about how you're thinking about the trade-off between comps and margins. I'm curious if you think that you could have driven gross profit dollars higher this year if you had used more promotions. Or do you think that, that wouldn't have actually driven the gross profit dollars higher? \n My question is, obviously, if you could, but didn't, the reason would be because you don't want to destroy the pricing power over the long term. You don't want to harm the brand image. So I'm curious if you feel like that's the dynamic where you're basically sacrificing in the short term to hopefully have better results once the industry turns in your favor. \nLaura Alber: Yes. Jeff and I are fighting over your question. I would say it's both short term and long term. It's not clear as reducing prices drives more. If you have less people buying furniture, you just reduce the price 20%, you get 20% more people buy it just to be even, right? So you may think you're doing something, it's what retailers do, they mark stuff down when they want more sales, and it's not necessarily the case. In fact, we've done a lot of testing up and down to see where that sensitivity is. So that's one. \n Secondly, for sure, it's not good for the long term. And you can see that -- the race to the bottom with promotions, if you look at the history of retailers who've done that, it's a bad idea. And we are not a low-price provider. We are quality, high-service, high-design retailer. And so pricing is not usually why you come to us. You want the price to be great for the value and the design. But our quality is so much higher, and we're not willing to sacrifice it in the short term or long term to sustain a promotional strategy. \nJason Haas: That makes sense. And then as a follow-up, I was curious to ask about the West Elm performance in particular. It's good to see Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma performing well, both on a year-over-year basis and then also versus 2019. That used to not be the case, where previously, you'd see West Elm as the stronger performer. \n I'm curious to know how much you think of that is external, given West Elm, I believe, tends to serve a younger, maybe less-affluent customer than those other brands versus how much of it is internal. You've talked about some of them. Can you talk about what changes are being made at West Elm and when we should expect to see improvement from those? \nLaura Alber: Sure. There's no doubt that the metrics -- the makeup of the West Elm business makes it more vulnerable to the external, right? You mentioned it. The younger customer, the less-affluent customer, the higher furniture, the less-developed seasonal business or less-developed decorative and textile business, those are all factors in the West Elm underperformance. \n That said, we do not think about not being able to do anything about anything. We are focused on what we can do being served this set of circumstances. So we have been working very diligently to give the customer other options other than just furniture, and to make sure our stores have those things ready to go versus having them only online. It's a big change for us to push that business into the stores to drive repeat traffic not just when you come to buy furniture. \n So we've talked about not just the development of those things, but I want to make sure you understand, too, the way we're using the channel strategy is to push things that are lower ticket and that are more for easy updates for the home versus the whole home. Also, we've been pushing collaborations. We've had some really great success lately with Colin King and Joseph Altuzarra. Those things sold out, and we've got some really exciting ones in that pipeline, and we have more confidence now to buy into those. And collaborations are very exciting for brands because they bring in new customer groups. And so that's a nice incremental change for us as well. \n And then in terms of the product design, and without going into it too competitively, you always want to lead, right? You always want to lead with design. And we are making, as I just said previously, some pretty significant improvements in what we're bringing in, in terms of newness quantity and also the relevancy, in my opinion. And so that's very exciting. And it's in the hopper, it's on order. We're filling in where we're out of stock currently on some winners. And we're excited to see that come to fruition next year. \n So it's not to me the -- and that's what all of our brands do with their designs. It's not that there's a problem, it's more that you want to stay on top and you want to lead. And this new leadership at West Elm and the focus on product and focus on design is really exciting. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: So first off, I too, would like to add my congratulations on your continued profitability beats. So the question I want to ask, and I know it's a bit of a follow-up here, but just with respect to just the overall promotional environment. So I'll ask maybe a couple of questions within this question. I mean, one, as you're monitoring the environment and the actions of your competitors, is it -- if you look at the promotions that have accelerated, do you believe this is more temporary, either backdrop-driven, clearance-driven? Or is this the kind of the return to levels we saw pre-pandemic? \n And then the second question I have -- and look, you've done a great job holding the line on your pricing. We clearly see that in the margins. I guess the question I'm asking is, is you're communicating with your customers then, has there been a shift in marketing or shifts otherwise that you're saying to your customers, look, we have great brands, these are high quality and you should not expect promotions from us? \nLaura Alber: And there's still plenty of things on sale because we clear products. So you can find -- if you're a promotional shopper, you can find sale prices on our websites for sure. So let's not pretend we don't have any. It's just that the quantity of those is so much lower than it's been, it's so much lower than our competitors. I don't like to name people by name, but we have scrubbed everybody's websites. And look at them, and they're littered with -- I mean, in some cases, it's 80% red lines, 100% red lines of some really good names out there.\n And I don't know what they're doing, but I can tell you what the customer sees. And I don't know when they're going to go back to regular price or if this is the new strategy, but this is what's going on in the marketplace. And it's very important to us that the customer can count on the price. Because if you buy a piece of furniture, it's likely not delivered for 4 to 5 weeks, if that price changes and it hasn't even been delivered, you're never going to -- you're going to always wait until you get the sale and you just create this up-and-down curve customers waiting for sale. It's not a good cycle. \n And what I said before about the newness selling. When you bring out an incredible product, and this is today, even with this depressed furniture buyer, I'm talking about furniture. It sells out. Because when you have a product that good, customers want to buy it. But the key thing is the first time you price it, that price-value relationship needs to be great. So that is where we're focused. What is the first price, is that a great value? Is it the best value in the marketplace? And now we're looking at the competition and assuming they're going to be 20% off, assuming they're going to be 30% off. \n So we're not just saying is it the best versus the regular price, we're saying is it the best versus their sale price. And that's the key driver here on creating value for the consumer and having them trust us. And when they trust us, they furnish their whole house with us. \nBrian Nagel: No, that's very helpful. If I could ask just a follow-up, unrelated. But with regard to -- again, gross margins, I mean, now we're seeing the benefit of moderating shipping costs. And recognizing that there's a lot of accounting noise in how these costs are capitalized but -- I guess, Jeff, maybe this is more for you, but I mean, how long will this dynamic prove a tailwind for gross margins for Williams-Sonoma? \nJeff Howie: Look, we've certainly said in the call that it will continue into Q4. And previously, I've said it will continue to be a tailwind into 2024. But we're starting to hinge on 2024 guidance, which we'll address in March. But meanwhile, we're really laser-focused on delivering our Q4 results with the all-important holiday season ahead of us. \nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Laura Alber for any closing remarks. \nLaura Alber: Well, thank you all. We really appreciate your time, and I want to wish you all a wonderful Thanksgiving, and a great beginning to the exciting and beautiful holiday season with your family and friends. We look forward to talking to you again after the New Year, and take care. \nOperator: That will conclude. We thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Before we get into our Q3 results, I would like to take a minute to thank the incredible team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. for another quarter of great results. Without their hard work, dedication and focus, none of the results we are reporting today would have been achievable. \n We are proud to deliver another quarter of strong earnings, significantly exceeding expectations despite a challenging economic backdrop for our industry. We beat profitability estimates with a record third quarter operating margin of 17%, with earnings per share of $3.66. \n Our comp sales, which reflect the larger macroeconomic backdrop, ran negative 14.6% in Q3 and our 2-year comp was negative 6.5% and our 4-year comp to 2019 was positive 34.8%. These results were achieved in an environment filled with ongoing consumer hesitancy on high-ticket discretionary furniture and elevated levels of promotional activity. \n Despite this environment, we continue to drive results because of our unique proposition in the marketplace and our relentless focus on customer service. Our advantage is our portfolio of brands serving a wide range of categories, aesthetics and life stages. While people are currently buying fewer large-ticket furniture pieces than last year, our portfolio of brands and product offerings has us positioned well for this shift into kitchen purchases, fashion textiles, dorm, baby and seasonal holiday offerings. \n Our in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated supply chain are also key in producing proprietary products at the best quality value relationship in the market. We remain firmly committed to reducing promotions despite elevated levels of discounting in the industry. In fact, our third quarter promotional levels were meaningfully lower than last year. \n Instead, we are meeting our customers' needs for value by introducing a larger offering of new products at mid-tier and lower price points. Not only is this strategy good for profits, but we have also reduced friction with our customers as we give them better value without confusing them with short-term discounts. We strongly believe that this is the right way to run our business as it preserves the design value price equation that we offer and our customers appreciate. \n Moving on to customer service and the supply chain. We are seeing the year-over-year benefit of selling through inventories with lower supply chain costs. And we continue to increase selling margins by reducing out-of-market multiple shipments. We have improved our customer service, returning to pre-pandemic and best-in-class levels. \n Investments in the final mile delivery experience have resulted in fewer customer accommodations, lower returns, lower damages and lower replacements. And customer metrics like on-time delivery are at record highs, and backorder crate -- rates have substantially improved. The total benefit from these supply chain and customer service improvements is significant, and you can see it in our results today. \n Regarding marketing, we increased our spend from Q2 but still leveraged in the quarter. We continue to ensure that our marketing investment gives us the ability to test new formats, to connect with new customers and to showcase our offering to our existing customer base and our highly engaged brand loyalists. We've seen increasing success with our marketing and product collaborations, and we will continue to build upon them. \n Our ongoing investment in building our proprietary e-commerce technology continues to improve our online experience. We're focused on offering customers inspiring content and dynamic tools to assist with their design projects, and AI is accelerating these efforts. We see many opportunities for our business from developments from AI. And as early adapters of integrating AI, we look forward to leading the retail industry in the area, and we will focus on quality, authenticity and responsiveness of this new technology. \n And as focused as we are on our e-commerce capabilities, we are also continuing to focus on delivering a best-in-class retail business. Our stores are beautifully designed and curated with inspirational assortments, and our continued retail optimization efforts have refocused our fleet on the most profitable, inspiring and strategic locations. \n On the sustainability front, we are proud to report that in Q3, we were named the top scorer on the Sustainable Furnishings Council's Wood Furniture Scorecard for the sixth consecutive year. Using sustainable wood has been a key focus of our strategy and a differentiator of our business. \n Now I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 16.6% comp in Q3, but ran a positive 3% on a 2-year basis and a positive 43% on a 4-year basis. We have substantially reduced the promotional offerings in the brand and have successfully introduced new low- and mid-tier programs at great value. And while furniture demand has been most impacted, we are seeing strength in textiles and seasonal decorating. We're excited for the holiday season given strong early reads on our innovative proprietary collections. \n Earlier this week, we announced the launch of a new mobile shopping and design app for Pottery Barn following the success of our Pottery Barn Kids and Pottery Barn Teen apps. The Pottery Barn mobile app delivers a convenient customer shopping experience and makes it easy to create and manage a registry on the go. Now customers can explore and shop full rooms, easily share their favorite products and connect with a design experts, all through the convenience of their phone or tablet. \n The Pottery Barn children's business ran a negative 6.9% comp in Q3 and was negative 11.7% on a 2-year basis and positive 29% on a 4-year basis. Across these life stage brands, we are focused on delivering compelling innovation and elevating the customer experience.\n One key area of focus in the quarter has been the evolution of our back-to-school offering. Here, we saw standout growth in our dorm business as customers gravitated to higher design and quality. We offer a compelling, complete solution that is easy to shop on our Pottery Barn Teen app. And given the size of the dorm market, we believe this represents a significant opportunity for us for years to come. \n We also continue to focus on another key life stage offering, which is baby, the entry point to the children's home furnishings brand. Here, we are winning with our innovative nursery seating and a curated selection of high-quality baby gear. In our stores and across our mobile app, customers can register with Pottery Barn Kids and receive help from our nursery experts. \n Also, we're really encouraged by the strength of our innovative product introductions and fresh product collaborations with strong response to recent Super Mario and LoveShackFancy launches. And as we look to the quarter ahead, we believe we have a compelling pipeline of collaborations that our customer will love. \n Moving on to West Elm. West Elm is the brand that has been most impacted by the customer pullback in furniture. In Q3, West Elm ran a negative 22.4% and was negative 18.2% on a 2-year basis and ran a positive 26.1% on a 4-year basis. West Elm has the highest percentage of its assortment in furniture, the most underdeveloped in other categories and a customer base that's the most impacted by the current macro environment. \n Despite current challenging dynamics, West Elm saw very strong reception to their new fall products, which marked a real evolution in the brand's modern design voice. Sales from this year's fall assortment are up to last year, with positive customer response to fresh, furniture forms, mixed materials and new textures and innovations in textile. Early holiday reads have also been positive in seasonal trim and tabletop, as well as hosting and entertaining categories. \n Given these positive reads, we see sizable opportunity in West Elm as it rebalances more into textiles, decorative accessories, entertainment and seasonal offerings. We continue to be very optimistic about the long-term growth trajectory of West Elm with its industry-leading design and value. \n The Williams-Sonoma brand, which includes Williams-Sonoma Home, ran a negative 1.9% comp in Q3. On a 2-year basis, the brand ran negative 3.4% and was positive 34.6% on a 4-year basis. The Williams-Sonoma Kitchen business ran a positive comp for the second consecutive quarter this year, primarily driven by retail. \n Earlier this quarter, we launched a successful collaboration in cookware with Stanley Tucci, who designed an exclusive collection with GreenPan for Williams-Sonoma. Collaborations like Tucci's have been an excellent vehicle for growth and new customer acquisition. \n Kitchen continues to see strength in high-end electrics, particularly in coffee and espresso. And the Williams-Sonoma Home business, while still negative, is beginning to see improved trends, with a refreshed more editorial point of view that showcases updated textiles and decorative accessories. \n Looking to Q4, Williams-Sonoma becomes a bigger part of our business, and early reads on holiday are positive, indicating a strong season of entertaining and gifting ahead. We have an impressive pipeline of new launches, with engaging content and corresponding events for our customers to experience both in-store and online. \n Now I'd like to update you on our other initiatives. We are pleased to report Business-to-Business delivered a positive quarter, running positive 1.5% in Q3, driven by 30% growth in the contract business. Exciting wins in the quarter included a brand standard program for Pottery Barn with Pendry Hotels for custom outdoor furniture and a new partnership with a premier developer partner, Jamestown, for 2 new properties, including a senior living tower and a new residential development. \n We're also excited by the success of specific B2B product developments like the expansion of our restaurant furniture program that has been key to gaining momentum in the food and beverage space with clients like Dave & Buster's, along with clients in the sports and entertainment space. The future remains bright for this business. \n Now I'd like to talk about our global business. Our global strategy has not changed, and we continue to focus on a franchise-first model. This business has, of course, been affected by the uncertain macro environment, particularly in the Middle East. We are excited to see our brands exceed expectations in other markets like India. \n We opened our third West Elm retail location in Pune, and expanded our Pottery Barn brands into the world famous Jio World Plaza now open in Mumbai. The Mexico market is also showing strength, driven by improved in-stocks in furniture and strong back-to-school and seasonal assortments. And we continue to see momentum in our Canada business, fueled by our commitment to enhancing the customer experience both online and in retail. We have also grown the brand and service offerings available to Canadian customers by launching Rejuvenation and Mark and Graham online, and relaunching Gift Registry in Canada. \n Lastly, I'd like to update you on our emerging brands. Rejuvenation delivered a positive quarter, driven by our remodel and refresh categories as well as new growth initiatives. Customers continue to update their homes, specifically in the spaces of kitchen and bath. We are continuing to grow the brand in new markets by opening a new store in the San Diego market and another new store opening this weekend in North Carolina. We continue to be excited by the opportunity we have for growth from the Rejuvenation brand. \n We are also pleased with our results in Mark and Graham, our gifting and personalization brand. We are optimistic for Q4 as we head into the key gift-giving holiday season. Customers will benefit from the brand's inspiring content and curated monogram gift guides organized by both recipients and price points. \n And at GreenRow, we continue to gain momentum in this new brand, which utilizes sustainable materials and manufacturing practices to create colorful heirloom quality products. While it's early, we remain optimistic about the potential of this brand and its aesthetic. These successful and exciting emerging brands demonstrate our ability to develop new businesses that expand our portfolio of brands and address white space in our product offerings, all with minimal investment and low cost of entry, leveraging our knowledge and infrastructure.\n In summary, our outperformance this quarter drove a record Q3 operating margin of 17%. Although customers are shifting their spending temporarily away from high-ticket furniture purchases, we have a powerful portfolio of brands serving a range of categories, aesthetics and life stages to meet the demands of customers. And despite our sales running down this year, our execution and the strength of our operating model produced strong earnings again this quarter, driven by our full-price selling, supply chain efficiencies and best-in-class customer service. Our early seasonal reads are strong, and we are optimistic about the holiday season. \n As we put this all together, we are raising our guidance for the year. We now expect full year revenues to come in at a range of down 10% to down 12%, and we are raising our outlook on operating margin to a range of 16% to 16.5%. It is important to note that the reduction in our revenues outlook is more than offset by our raised operating margin outlook. \n And with that, I will turn the call over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers in detail. Chuck, so I don't think we should think about gross margin as a trade for share. The two are not necessarily as correlated as one might think. In fact, it's not clear that people who are running more promotions are going to gain more share, especially long term. And for our target customer, we are confident that we are gaining share. And at the high-quality, regular price customer is the one that we best serve given what we do with brands. \n And trust me, we are very focused on returning to growth. In fact, we're very confident about our strategies and our ability to execute. It's the environment that is really the question mark for us as we look at the balance of the year in the short term. And so we continue to test different things to see what makes sense, whether it's pricing up, down, more marketing, less marketing. And trust me, as we see things that do not just benefit short term, we are definitely focused on pushing them and building upon them for the long term. That's a good question, Chuck. I didn't expect that one. So 2019, well, it was a long time ago, it's hard to remember. We took some price increases during the pandemic, as you know. And a lot of them have stuck and some we've backed off. And we've also gotten a lot of vendor price reductions, which is a great thing to see. And we've used some of those to reduce prices to our consumers so that we are very competitive with our value quality relationship. \n The thing to remember also is that it's not just about reducing prices on existing products. We bring in a fair amount of exclusive, exciting newness. And we've been building into both our mid-tier and low price points, and those things are full margins. And so it's a very good way to continue to build value into the business. But vis-a-vis 2019, I actually don't have that number on how we exactly stand with the entire assortment versus 2019 in pricing. Yes. Thank you for the question. We've, in fact, pulled back promotions both sequentially this year and versus last year. And we've pulled back in -- we took away all up-down pricing that was site-wide. The site-wide promotions have been gone. We also did remove e-mail overlay, all those hidden promo tactics that other people use, coupon matches, double points, we don't offer any of those. But the level of clearance and promotions during our sale periods, which we call warehouse sales, is also lower. It's a great question. We are disappointed in the top line performance. As you know, in most of our brands this year, except for our emerging brands, we've seen slower-than-expected furniture performance. That said, we've seen really strong seasonal performance, and these life stage businesses in certain categories are better than expected. So it's a big change for us that we've really focused on and made the shift into quickly with our marketing and our inventory purchases. \n But as I think about the long term and we think about where we sit vis-a-vis the market, the market as you know is very large and very fractured. And so there's huge opportunity for us to gain share with all of our brands. I think that the names of our brands are stronger than the volumes that they produce. \n When you think about the Williams-Sonoma name, the brand, Williams-Sonoma, and you think about how small it is, and the consolidation of the industry with Bed Bath & Beyond closing its retail footprint and others going out of business, and not seeing anyone deliver on exclusive proprietary products for high-end kitchen, you can see what a tremendous opportunity we have. \n And with that also, we have Williams-Sonoma Home, which sits in that higher-end space where there's not many, particularly in the aesthetic that we're serving. I actually have Felix sitting right next to me. And I -- we invited him today because we're upon the very large holiday season that we're looking forward to. And as you know, Williams-Sonoma really spikes during the holiday season. \n And so Felix, do you want to make a few comments about how you see your brand gaining market share in the future? And then as you look at our other brands, both the big ones, both West Elm and Pottery Barn, we have shown this year that there's areas within each brand that are very underdeveloped and where there's sizable opportunity from accessible furniture for Pottery Barn and dorm to -- in West Elm, filling out the modern accessory textile piece, which we haven't addressed and also more modern seasonal assortments. That's a big opportunity and one that has never been built. So we see us being able to pick up share in those two brands in specific categories. \n And of course, the temporary furniture pullback is just that. This, too, shall reverse. And the great news is that we won't have built our business or held it up with promotions like others are at this time. That is getting out of our base, and it's going to continue to allow us to focus on delivering proprietary products and not just thinking about markdowns all the time, but thinking about how to build better collaborations and more relevant product lines that the customer loves. \n The last thing I'll just say is, we've talked about B2B, it's across all brands. It's a big driver of market share for us because nobody is doing what we're doing. And so it's a very, very large industry, and we're still scratching the surface. And we are still -- as Josie who runs it likes to say, we are still doing more gathering than hunting. And we have a lot more that we can do as we continue to build this muscle. So we're excited about the growth algorithm for the future. And we do recognize that it's been softer than expected this year, particularly in furniture, but we're completely focused on that growth posture looking out into the future. Thanks, Anthony. The margin profile is the same as the rest of our products. So it's not that they're lower at all, in fact, they're great margins. And we've done the same thing also in West Elm. And you're going to see us West Elm, which I'm really excited about, continue to have more and more newness sequentially. So for fall, you might have heard in my prepared remarks that we had some just superb winners in the furniture assortment. \n And in some cases, they were also at the higher price points. So we're building upon those. Many of them are sold out right now. And we're thrilled, but we are also chasing those products, and we'll be getting back in stock in Q1 in those. And that gives us confidence about where we want to take the brand aesthetically, not just from a price point, but where we think the modern customer wants to be now where that evolution is going. \n And so as we go into Q1 and Q2, I'm just really excited about the product line that you're going to see in West Elm. And based on the wins that we have currently, I think it's going to be a big change and the next really big step in the evolution, the next chapter, if you will, for West Elm's winning strategy. Yes. Jeff and I are fighting over your question. I would say it's both short term and long term. It's not clear as reducing prices drives more. If you have less people buying furniture, you just reduce the price 20%, you get 20% more people buy it just to be even, right? So you may think you're doing something, it's what retailers do, they mark stuff down when they want more sales, and it's not necessarily the case. In fact, we've done a lot of testing up and down to see where that sensitivity is. So that's one. \n Secondly, for sure, it's not good for the long term. And you can see that -- the race to the bottom with promotions, if you look at the history of retailers who've done that, it's a bad idea. And we are not a low-price provider. We are quality, high-service, high-design retailer. And so pricing is not usually why you come to us. You want the price to be great for the value and the design. But our quality is so much higher, and we're not willing to sacrifice it in the short term or long term to sustain a promotional strategy. Sure. There's no doubt that the metrics -- the makeup of the West Elm business makes it more vulnerable to the external, right? You mentioned it. The younger customer, the less-affluent customer, the higher furniture, the less-developed seasonal business or less-developed decorative and textile business, those are all factors in the West Elm underperformance. \n That said, we do not think about not being able to do anything about anything. We are focused on what we can do being served this set of circumstances. So we have been working very diligently to give the customer other options other than just furniture, and to make sure our stores have those things ready to go versus having them only online. It's a big change for us to push that business into the stores to drive repeat traffic not just when you come to buy furniture. \n So we've talked about not just the development of those things, but I want to make sure you understand, too, the way we're using the channel strategy is to push things that are lower ticket and that are more for easy updates for the home versus the whole home. Also, we've been pushing collaborations. We've had some really great success lately with Colin King and Joseph Altuzarra. Those things sold out, and we've got some really exciting ones in that pipeline, and we have more confidence now to buy into those. And collaborations are very exciting for brands because they bring in new customer groups. And so that's a nice incremental change for us as well. \n And then in terms of the product design, and without going into it too competitively, you always want to lead, right? You always want to lead with design. And we are making, as I just said previously, some pretty significant improvements in what we're bringing in, in terms of newness quantity and also the relevancy, in my opinion. And so that's very exciting. And it's in the hopper, it's on order. We're filling in where we're out of stock currently on some winners. And we're excited to see that come to fruition next year. \n So it's not to me the -- and that's what all of our brands do with their designs. It's not that there's a problem, it's more that you want to stay on top and you want to lead. And this new leadership at West Elm and the focus on product and focus on design is really exciting. And there's still plenty of things on sale because we clear products. So you can find -- if you're a promotional shopper, you can find sale prices on our websites for sure. So let's not pretend we don't have any. It's just that the quantity of those is so much lower than it's been, it's so much lower than our competitors. I don't like to name people by name, but we have scrubbed everybody's websites. And look at them, and they're littered with -- I mean, in some cases, it's 80% red lines, 100% red lines of some really good names out there.\n And I don't know what they're doing, but I can tell you what the customer sees. And I don't know when they're going to go back to regular price or if this is the new strategy, but this is what's going on in the marketplace. And it's very important to us that the customer can count on the price. Because if you buy a piece of furniture, it's likely not delivered for 4 to 5 weeks, if that price changes and it hasn't even been delivered, you're never going to -- you're going to always wait until you get the sale and you just create this up-and-down curve customers waiting for sale. It's not a good cycle. \n And what I said before about the newness selling. When you bring out an incredible product, and this is today, even with this depressed furniture buyer, I'm talking about furniture. It sells out. Because when you have a product that good, customers want to buy it. But the key thing is the first time you price it, that price-value relationship needs to be great. So that is where we're focused. What is the first price, is that a great value? Is it the best value in the marketplace? And now we're looking at the competition and assuming they're going to be 20% off, assuming they're going to be 30% off. \n So we're not just saying is it the best versus the regular price, we're saying is it the best versus their sale price. And that's the key driver here on creating value for the consumer and having them trust us. And when they trust us, they furnish their whole house with us. Well, thank you all. We really appreciate your time, and I want to wish you all a wonderful Thanksgiving, and a great beginning to the exciting and beautiful holiday season with your family and friends. We look forward to talking to you again after the New Year, and take care."

I don't want to give away too much of our winning formula, but it includes curating the best products out there, right, inspiring customers how to use it, offering it in their channel of choice, whether it be online or in-store. I think some houseware brands offer products that don't inspire, and some inspire but don't have 150-plus stores and a great website to purchase from. As Jeff said, our beautiful stores, our well-trained and passionate store associates, our inspiring catalog and our multidimensional website are competitive advantages I don't think anyone really has. \n And as we head into the fourth quarter, this is the time that we celebrate the most. We have Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas, New Year's Eve, these are reasons for people to come visit our stores. And I think we've pulled together the best assortment of gifts and holiday decor that we ever have had. So we're excited, and we want to continue to gain market share, and all indicators are that in the kitchen business, it appears we are."

            "name": "Jeff Howie",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. As Laura said, we're proud that, once again, we've delivered earnings substantially exceeding expectations. \n Our Q3 results reinforce the themes we've consistently communicated over the past several quarters: first, our steadfast commitment to maintain price integrity and not run site-wide promotions; second, how our earlier supply chain cost pressures will become tailwinds in the second half and beyond and third, our ability to control costs and manage inventory levels. Our strong profitability this quarter, despite softer top line revenues, demonstrates the durability of our operating margin. \n Now let's dive into our Q3 results, followed by an update on our fiscal year guidance. In addition to year-over-year results, I'll reference 2019 as it's helpful to compare our performance with pre-pandemic levels. Net revenues came in at $1.854 billion. While below our expectations, our revenues reflect the larger home furnishing backdrop and our commitment to maintain price integrity even if it means forgoing some revenues in the short term. \n Our revenue growth in Q3 came in at negative 14.6% comp. Our 2-year stack was negative 6.5% and our 4-year stack against 2019 grew 34.8%. Our Q3 demand comp at negative 11.8% was materially unchanged from our Q2 trend. Our 2-year demand stack was negative 13.8%, and our 4-year demand stack was a positive 33.2%. \n Our revenue comps this quarter reflect a normalized spread between demand and net comps. Our improvement across returns and appeasements offsets the majority of last year's outsized back order fill. From a cadence perspective, our demand trends continue to be inconsistent and choppy, especially after Labor Day. \n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin at 44.4% exceeded our expectations. The 290 basis point improvement over last year reflects the supply chain tailwinds we've been guiding for several quarters. Merchandise margins increased materially over last year, driven by lower ocean freight costs flowing into our income statement and our focus on full price selling and price integrity. In fact, merchandise margins were substantially higher than Q3 2019.\n Selling margin also improved materially over last year, driven by supply chain efficiencies. Through our improved execution and investment in supply chain, we substantially improved our customer experience. Key metrics, including out-of-market shipping, multiple deliveries per order, returns, accommodations, damages and replacements are all performing at pre-pandemic levels, if not better. I'd like to congratulate and thank our supply chain organization for delivering these results. Altogether, our selling margins were 450 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the full impact to our profitability of the supply chain tailwinds. \n Occupancy costs of $200 million were 1% lower than last year and decreased 2% quarter-over-quarter. Coming in at 10.8% of net revenues, occupancy deleveraged 160 basis points to last year driven by the softer top line. Our Q3 gross margin at 44.4% is 840 basis points higher than 2019's 36%. Our SG&A expenses of $507 million were down 11% to last year, once again reflecting our ability to control costs. Our 27.4% rate deleveraged 140 basis points to last year, driven by general expenses offsetting variable expense savings.\n Employment expense decreased double digits versus last year, but deleveraged, primarily driven by favorability in last year's stock-based compensation. We continue to manage variable employment costs in accordance with top line trends. Our advertising expense slightly leveraged in Q3 despite increased funding quarter-over-quarter as we continue to test into higher levels of advertising spend.\n Our rate leverage reflects the competitive advantage of our agile performance-driven marketing organization. Our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform continue to drive efficient advertising spend. General expenses drove the majority of the deleverage on the quarter, resulting from timing of asset disposals and legal settlements. Overall, our year-to-date SG&A through 39 weeks is down 12% to last year and flat on a rate basis. And it's 100 basis points lower than 2019's SG&A rate of 28.4%.\n Regarding the bottom line, our results speak for themselves. Q3 operating income came in at $315 million and operating margin at 17%, a record operating margin for our third quarter. 17% is 150 basis points above last year and 940 basis points above 2019's 7.6%. Our diluted earnings per share of $3.66 was slightly below last year's third quarter earnings per share of $3.72, but significantly above 2019 earnings per share of $1.02. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $699 million with no debt outstanding. This was after we invested $42 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth, and we returned over $61 million to our shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. \n Merchandise inventories at $1.4 billion were down 17.2% to last year. Three important points I'd like to emphasize once again: First, we are well positioned to maintain our price integrity as we proactively manage our inventory levels in line with our demand trends; second, going into the holiday season, our in-stock levels are near historical highs, and our regional inventory balance and composition is well positioned; third, our Q3 ending inventory levels are up only 11% versus same period in 2019, and that's with revenue comps of 34.8% over the same time frame. This discipline highlights how we've improved both our inventory efficiency and turnover. \n Summing up our Q3 results, we're proud to have delivered earnings substantially exceeding expectations. I'd like to thank all our associates for delivering these outstanding results. \n Now let's turn to our outlook. Based on our Q3 results, we are updating our full year outlook. Our new guidance reflects both the ongoing top line uncertainty and the strength in our operating margin. We now expect full year '23 net revenues to be in a range of down 10% comp to down 12% comp, and we are raising our operating margin outlook to a range of 16% to 16.5%. It's important to note that our lower sales outlook is more than offset by our increased operating margin, producing higher implied EPS guidance. \n On the top line, our updated guidance is based upon the facts and trends we know today from our Q3 results. Specifically, a conservative view of our 1-, 2- and 4-year trends in Q3 connects with the implicit Q4 guide in our updated full year '23 net revenue guidance. Given the macroeconomic environment, we believe this outlook is prudent. \n On the bottom line, our supply chain tailwinds will continue to bolster our profitability, producing full year operating margin within our updated range of 16% to 16.5%, with implied Q4 operating margins in line with historical builds from Q3. We continue to expect our full year income tax rate to be approximately 26%. Our 2023 capital expenditures are now anticipated to be $225 million due to timing of project spend. \n As we have communicated quarterly, we are committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic stock repurchases. We will continue to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share, and we have almost $700 million remaining under our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization to repurchase our stock opportunistically. \n As we look forward to 2024, we will balance the macroeconomic uncertainty with our long-term growth potential, and we'll provide guidance in March. As we look further into the future beyond '24, we are reiterating our long-term guidance of mid- to high single-digit top line growth with operating margins exceeding 15%. \n We're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these reasons: our ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishings industry; the strength of our in-house proprietary design; the competitive advantage of our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy; the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives; and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet. \n With that, I'll open the call for questions. Chuck, why don't we start with the last one, and I'll talk about gross margin, and then I'll turn it over to Laura to talk about our promotional posture. \n Gross margin exceeded our expectations this quarter, really driven by the tailwinds I've been guiding for the past several quarters. There were 3 main drivers in order of magnitude: first, our lower ocean freight from rate normalization flowing into our income statement; second, supply chain efficiencies, including lower out-of-market shipping, fewer multiple deliveries per order and decreased returns, accommodations, damages and replacements; and third, reduced promotional activity as we focused on full-price selling and maintained our price integrity. \n Overall, the majority of the improvement came from ocean freight and supply chain efficiencies. We've made significant improvements in our customer service, and you can see it in our results. And I want to once again thank our supply chain organization for really knocking the cover off the ball. \n Going to your question about how these will continue, here's what you need to remember. Our Q3 margins represent the start of the tailwinds we will see from supply chain efficiencies. And while we don't guide specific lines, we anticipate similar tailwinds in Q4 and even into 2024. Peter, we continue to operate a world-class retail business, and our stores serve as billboards for the brand and operate as profit centers. They're beautifully designed and curated with aspirational assortments, and we believe we will continue to serve as a competitive advantage. \n We continue on our journey of retail optimization. Since 2019, we've closed about 15% of our store count. And over the next 3 to 5 years, about 50% of our leases come due, and we'll continue to guide that we anticipate about 20% of the will close over time.\n Now there's multiple aspects to our retail optimization strategy. And first, obviously, we'll close any of the least-performing stores from a profitability standpoint or a brand denigrating, that's the low-hanging fruit. \n The second point, which is really the exciting one, is the repositioning of our retail fleet. And this is where we're taking a look at some of our older stores that in our older malls that the customer is not shopping as frequently in or moving to more vibrant lifestyle centers. And here, we're seeing not only a better customer engagement, better top line, but better economics as well. And we'll continue to look to reposition our fleet to right locations as leases come due. \n And of course, it all comes down to negotiations. It's part of the real estate business, as we all know. We're probably -- and from an innings standpoint, we're probably in inning 6, I think, inning 5 or 6. And on our journey here, there's more work to do. We have -- like I said, we have a lot of leases coming due.\n But the key point here is we continue to improve our retail profitability. And I'll give one example of where this is continuing to resonate. And I know used in the last call, but it continues to be an outstanding example of where the strategy of retail positioning, retail optimization really works, and that's our Pottery Barn store in Westport, Connecticut, which we moved from downtown Westport, not the best location for us to a location on the post road that is more vibrant, more customer-friendly. And I said in Q3 that the results were 30% better than the prior store -- I mean, in Q2, that the results were 30% better than prior store. They're now up 45% to the prior store. So this strategy continues to gain traction. \n The key thing for us is that our world-class stores, coupled with our best-in-class e-commerce tools, demonstrates a digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy as a key differentiator in the home furnishings industry. Thank you for your business, Peter. Yes. Peter, as you know, we don't commit to a consistent cadence of share repurchases. We do remain committed to driving long-term shareholder returns, and will opportunistically buy back stock and drive shareholder returns. \n In Q3, we had extremely strong performance in our stock price relative to the broader market. We exceeded all 3 major indexes, a collection of hardlines retail and softlines retail. So we outperformed. So it's not what we consider opportunistic. As I said in the answer to Chuck's question on gross margin, we anticipate that the results we saw in Q4, the tailwinds I've been talking about will continue -- I'm sorry, the results from Q3, the tailwinds I've been talking about will continue into Q4. These are pretty strong tailwinds. I talked about the impact of ocean freight, our supply chain efficiencies and our full price selling.\n While we're talking about guidance, I also want to just point out that while we don't guide specific lines, in last year's Q4, our SG&A materially benefited from some large favorable items we recorded that we don't anticipate reoccurring this year. But here's the key takeaway, it's all contemplated in our guidance, which we've raised our full year outlook for implied EPS. We'll talk more about next year after we get through the really important holiday season. Right now, that's where our focus is. And as Laura just touched on, our primary objective in '24 will be to drive both growth and margin, and we'll balance the macroeconomic certainty with our long-term growth potential. But we'll talk more about that in March. Look, we've certainly said in the call that it will continue into Q4. And previously, I've said it will continue to be a tailwind into 2024. But we're starting to hinge on 2024 guidance, which we'll address in March. But meanwhile, we're really laser-focused on delivering our Q4 results with the all-important holiday season ahead of us."

With our focus on compelling products, customer service and profitability, we achieved our financial expectations.  \n We continue to distinguish ourselves as the world's largest digital-first, design-led, sustainable home retailer. What are the things that distinguish us? No other home furnishings company offers our in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated sourcing organization. This allows us to deliver high-quality, sustainable products at the best value to market that cannot be found anywhere else.  \n Most importantly, it allows us to lead with innovation, distinguishing us from our competition. We are always looking for new opportunities to inspire our customers through our in-house design. From the new summer block prints and exclusive heritage quilts in Pottery Barn to the Viv Swivel Chair in West Elm to the compelling new dorm assortment in Pottery Barn Teen and the exclusive electronics and ergonomic tools in the Williams-Sonoma brand, our company leads with innovation.  \n And just last week, we launched the newest brand in the Williams-Sonoma, Inc. portfolio, GreenRow. This new brand has been internally designed and developed, utilizing sustainable materials and manufacturing practices to create powerful, vintage-inspired heirloom quality products. GreenRow addresses white space within our portfolio and in the market. It is this type of innovation that distinguishes us within the home furnishings industry and most importantly, resonates with our customers.\n But not only are we innovators, we are operators. As you know, no other home furnishings company offers our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy that's transforming the customer experience. With our proprietary e-commerce platform, we are one of the largest e-commerce players in the United States. And our in-house CRM and data analytics teams optimize our digital spend and customer connections.\n And we operate a world-class retail business with our stores serving as billboards for our brands. They are beautifully designed and curated with aspirational assortments. Our retail optimization efforts have refocused our fleet on the most profitable, most inspiring and most strategic locations. And our omni capabilities are a competitive advantage in the market.\n In Q1, examples of our operational excellence continued. We replatformed Rejuvenation's website, capturing new demand and driving higher conversions through enhanced imagery and an elevated customer experience. We managed our SG&A expense, leveraging our ad cost by limiting our spend to more proven efficient channels where customers show a higher level of intent to purchase. We made tough decisions to rightsize our organization to control costs and to drive focus and efficiency. We managed our receipts to control inventory levels. And we are making substantial progress on our customer service, which was affected by the pandemic. \n We have successfully improved customer metrics, including on-time delivery. We are working hard to rebalance inventory to reduce multiple and out-of-market shipments, both of which will improve service levels further and reduce costs. We are here to serve our customers. Without them, nothing else matters.\n Lastly, we lead the home furnishings industry with our sustainability efforts and values-based culture. In Q1, we are recognized as one of the top 10 companies on Forbes list of America's Best Employers for Diversity in 2023. We were the highest ranking home furnishings retailer on the list.  \n Turning to the quarter. While our top line comp ran down 6%, our 2-year comp was 3.5%, our 4-year comp to 2019 was plus 46.5% and we delivered an operating margin of 12.9%, with earnings per share of $2.64, significantly above our prepandemic results.  \n In terms of demand, our trend softened from negative mid-single digits in Q4 to down 10% in Q1. The softness in demand was most notable in our high-ticket furniture offerings, but we didn't see that same trend in our high-ticket electronics and kitchen offerings. These disparate trends tell that the customer is still spending. The diversification and durability within our portfolio of brands and product offerings positions us better than our competition with this shift in spending.\n Now let's turn to more details in the brands. Pottery Barn ran down slightly with a negative 0.4% net comp in Q1, but ran 14% on a 2-year basis and 54.4% on a 4-year basis. We are seeing subdued demand in our furniture business, with customers demonstrating more caution on high-ticket considered purchases.  \n And in our outdoor business, we are seeing delayed purchasing until later in the summer season versus early spring. However, we are seeing strength in our exclusive decorating and textiles categories as customers choose to postpone bigger redesign projects to focus on easy updates, leveraging our beautiful print and pattern pillows, table linens, bedding and bath textiles, frames and decorative lighting.  \n In PB, summer seasonal newness is off to a good start with strong demand for block print quilts and heritage patchwork quotes. The customer response to our Americana and coastal decorating across tabletop, textile and decor has been strong ahead of the Memorial Day weekend and should extend into the summer season. As we look to the year ahead, the brand has a strong lineup of textiles, decorating and entertaining products at a great value and we are increasing our marketing of these categories to drive performance. \n The Pottery Barn children's business ran a negative 3.3% comp in Q1. It was a negative 6.4% on a 2-year basis, but ran positive 29.6% on a 4-year basis. We see pressure in some of our children's furniture categories, but we continue to see strength in many parts of the baby business. And we are focused on elevating the customer experience in these life stage businesses. For example, in our baby business, we saw strength in our GREENGUARD Gold nursery seating, personalized baby gifts and our curated selection of baby gear, which positions us well as a destination for the registry business. And in our stores and across our mobile app, customers can register with Pottery Barn Kids and receive help from our nursery experts.  \n In our Teen brand, we are excited to have launched a compelling new dorm assortment, covering the needs of college-bound students with extra-long twin bedding and storage. Customers can shop online and ship products to any of our company stores near their college campus. Included in our dorm offer, we are excited to showcase our partnership with LoveShackFancy which has resonated with customers. Also, we are pleased with our first full quarter of results for our Pottery Barn Kids and Teen shopping apps. We are seeing customers respond to the easy-to-shop, thoughtfully designed experience and both apps are outperforming the mobile web across all KPIs. \n The West Elm brand continues to be the most affected by the tough macro environment. In Q1, West Elm ran a negative 15.8% and was negative 3% on a 2-year basis, but 51.1% positive on a 4-year basis. We're excited that Day Kornbluth started with the team as the new Brand President on April 3. She'll lead West Elm through its next chapter of growth, most immediately with a focus on 4 areas: one, industry-leading design and value; two, increasing brand awareness and customer acquisition; three, expanding into product white space; and four, leveraging channel growth opportunities.\n West Elm is our brand with the highest percentage of its assortment in furniture. We see opportunity in West Elm as it expands into textiles, decorating, accessories, entertaining and seasonal offerings. We continue to be very excited about the long-term growth trajectory of West Elm.\n The Williams-Sonoma brand ran a negative 4.4% comp in Q1. On a 2-year basis, the brand ran negative 6.7%, but positive 33.9% on a 4-year basis. The Williams-Sonoma team remains focused on increasing product exclusivity, innovation, relevant content and full price selling. We have a pipeline of innovative product launches and collaborations planned throughout the year, and we see new opportunities from the integration of the Williams-Sonoma Home furnishings assortment into our kitchen business. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in the housewares industry.  \n Now I'd like to update you on our growth initiatives, beginning with Business-to-Business. This business has 2 formats: trade and contract. The trade side of the business has been more impacted by the macro environment, but we continue to remain focused on the growth opportunity on the contract side. Contract grew mid-double digits in the quarter despite B2B running down 7% in total. We continue to win B2B accounts due to our design capabilities and a wide range of products offered in our multi-brand portfolio. And in fact, we have a stronger pipeline of projects currently out for bid compared to last year.\n Another growth initiative is our expansion into global markets. Our brand momentum continues to exceed expectations in the India market and we are driving growth through retail expansion with the opening of our third West Elm store, our second Pottery Barn store and our first Pottery Barn Kids store in Q3 2023. India is a strategic market as we expand globally, and we plan to open additional locations in 2024. \n Additionally, we are seeing strength across all of our brands in the Middle East led by strong design services. We'll be expanding in the region with the opening of an additional Pottery Barn and West Elm store in Saudi Arabia in Q2. Canada is also a highlight with digital representing our biggest growth opportunity for the market. We launched B2B in Q1 in Canada, and we look forward to introducing the Canadian customer to Rejuvenation, Mark and Graham and Williams-Sonoma Home with the launch of their websites later this year.  \n In summary, we recognize that there is continued uncertainty with the environment and the consumer, but we operate in a highly fragmented market and we will continue to gain share by inspiring customers with our portfolio of strong brands and by building trust with a return to world-class customer service. And we will continue to generate strong profits.  \n On the guidance front, we are only 1 quarter into the fiscal year with a lot more volume to come. We have a lineup of opportunities in our brands which, considered with our 2-year and 4-year trends, supports our 2023 guidance. As we indicated in Q4, the first half of the year will be tougher with the strong comps we are up against and the declining macro. But in the back half, our compares get easier and our supply chain cost pressures start to roll off. Looking past the short term, we remain confident in our long-term guidance and our opportunity to furnish our customers everywhere.  \n We have built a company of loved brands with a shared platform of competitive differentiators that lead the industry: in-house design, a digital-first but not digital-only platform and our values. We have identified opportunities for growth through strategic initiatives like B2B, Emerging Brands and Global where we have the opportunities to disrupt. We have a culture of innovation and an experienced team who knows how to increase operational efficiency, control costs, deliver world-class customer service and drive new growth opportunities.\n And finally, with our focus on compelling products and restoring world-class customer service, along with our financial discipline and our great team, we are confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitment to our customers, our employees and our shareholders, all of whom I'd like to thank for their support. Now I will turn it over to Jeff. \nJeff Howie: Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. As Laura said, we're proud that we've delivered solid quarter of earnings in a challenging environment. On the top line, we continue to distinguish ourselves from the home furnishing industry through the strength of our proprietary in-house design, our family of strong and stable brands and our culture of innovation. On the bottom line, our operating margin demonstrates the resiliency of our profitability despite softer top line results and illustrates how the structural changes in our operating model support our long-term 15% operating margin floor.  \n Before I walk through our Q1 results and our fiscal year '23 guidance, I'll first touch on our non-GAAP adjustments. As Laura said, we continue to distinguish ourselves through innovation and good operations. Laura touched on the innovation across our brands that will continue to propel our market share gains and the newest member of our family of brands, GreenRow.  \n On the operations side, we are committed to driving efficiency across all our operations. As part of this commitment, we undertook 3 key initiatives to drive efficiency in Q1 that resulted in our recording $26 million in non-GAAP expenses. First, we completed a company-wide reduction in force, rightsizing our teams domestically and internationally, primarily focused on corporate noncustomer-facing positions.  \n Second, we closed our Southern West Coast upholstery manufacturing facility, moving our production from California to our lower-cost Southeastern U.S. facilities. Third, we exited our noncore Aperture SaaS business. Combined, these changes will result not only in an estimated annualized savings of $40 million, but also increased focus and efficiency across our corporate, supply chain and technology teams. For more details, please refer to the GAAP to non-GAAP schedule in our press release.  \n Now let's dive into our Q1 results. As I do so, in addition to year-over-year results, I'll reference 2019 as it's helpful to compare our performance with prepandemic levels. Net revenues came in at $1.755 billion, slightly below our expectations. While comparable brand revenue growth on the 1-year stack came in at negative 6%, our 2-year stack grew 3.5% and our full year stack against 2019 grew 46.5%.  \n In demand, we were up against our toughest 1-year compare to the year, leading Q1 demand to come in at negative 10% on a 1-year stack. However, our demand was negative 1% on a 2-year stack and positive 46.7% on a 4-year stack. Our net revenues were driven by strong order fulfillment and timing of revenue recognition as we had less undelivered orders in Q1 than in Q4. For context, in a normalized environment, typically, there is a spread between demand and net comps.\n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin at 38.6% was in line with our expectations. Coming in 520 basis points below last year, reflects the impact of the short-term supply chain costs and inefficiencies flowing through our income statement that we've been discussing in the past several quarters.  \n Merchandise margins decreased from last year as we experienced the full effect of the capitalized costs from higher product costs, ocean freight, detention and demerge into our income statement. This was partially offset by the higher pricing power, our proprietary products command and by our ongoing commitment to forgo site-wide promotions.  \n Selling margin continue to be impacted by higher outbound customer shipping costs as well. We continue to incur these higher costs to best serve our customers by shipping from out-of-market distribution centers and, in some cases, shipping multiple times for multiunit orders, which typically would have been fulfilled in a single shipment.  \n We're working hard to rebalance our inventory composition and regional inventory location to improve our customer service. As Laura touched on, we are pleased with the improvements in customer service we are already seeing, and we expect customer service will continue to improve over the course of 2023. Altogether, our selling margins were 350 basis points lower than last year. We estimate more than 300 of the 350 basis points are attributable to the short-term supply chain costs and inefficiencies I just discussed. At 38.6%, our Q1 gross margin remains 270 basis points higher than 2019's 35.9%. And that's inclusive of absorbing these more than 300 basis points in supply chain-related costs and inefficiencies.  \n Occupancy costs at 11.5% of net revenues were 170 basis points above last year with occupancy dollars increasing 8.6% to approximately $202 million. Our ongoing retail store optimization initiatives partially offset incremental costs from our new distribution centers on both the East and West Coast.  \n These new distribution centers will support our long-term growth, improve service time for our customers and drive cost efficiencies over time. Our 250 basis points leverage versus 2019's 14% occupancy rate demonstrates the impact of our higher e-com mix and retail optimization has had on our gross margin.  \n Our SG&A rate continues to be at a historic low for Q1 at 25.7%, leveraging 100 basis points over last year. This reflects our financial discipline and ability to control costs in a challenging environment. We held employment expenses as a rate of revenues flat to last year as we managed variable employment costs in accordance with our top line trends.  \n Our advertising leverage continues to reflect the agile, performance-driven proficiency of our marketing team. Our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform are an underappreciated competitive advantage that allow us to drive efficient advertising spend in near real time as we see trends evolve in the business. Overall, SG&A came in 320 basis points lower than 2019's SG&A rate of 28.9%. This once again highlights the impact of our higher e-com mix and retail optimization on our profitability.  \n With regard to the bottom line, we are pleased with our results despite the quarter's declining macroeconomic backdrop. Q1 operating income came in at $226 million, and operating margin at 12.9%. While down 420 basis points below last year, 12.9% stands 590 basis points above 2019's 7%.  \n These results reflect the durability of our profitability and underpin our 15% operating margin long-term guidance, [ and that's another ] quarter marked by significant macroeconomic headwinds, softer top line results and over 300 basis points in short-term supply chain-related cost pressures.  \n Our diluted earnings per share of $2.64 was $0.86 or 25% below last year's record first quarter earnings per share of $3.50, but significantly above 2019's earnings per share of $0.81. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $297 million with no debt outstanding. This is inclusive of investing $50 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth, paying $58 million in quarterly dividends and opportunistically repurchasing [ 300 million ] or 3.8% of shares outstanding, congruent with our commitment to maximizing shareholder value.  \n Merchandise inventories, which include in-transit inventory, at $1.402 billion were essentially flat year-over-year, while inventory on hand increased 28% over last year. Two important points to emphasize here once again. First, our inventory on hand increase continues to be skewed by last year's pandemic-related supply chain disruption, creating an artificially low base. An apples-to-apples comparison versus 2019 highlights how we've improved our inventory turnover as our on-hand inventory levels have increased only 19% against revenue growth of over 41% during that time. Second, our lower balance sheet inventory growth reflects a 46% reduction in merchandise in transit as we've aligned our future on order with cautious forward-looking demand given our Q1 trends and the macroeconomic outlook.  \n Summing up our Q1, we are pleased to have delivered results in line with our expectations. We continue to distinguish ourselves within a fragmented home furnishings industry. Our operating margin demonstrates the resiliency of our profitability and our ability to maintain at least a 15% operating margin over the long term. I want to thank all our associates for their hard work and dedication in delivering these results in a challenging environment.\n Now let's turn to our guidance for 2023. As we look to the balance of the year, we are reiterating our fiscal '23 guidance. We recognize there is uncertainty in the macro and the consumer is becoming increasingly cautious, but this is our best estimate based on the facts and trends we know today.\n On the top line, extrapolating our 2- and 4-year trends in Q1 to full year '23 revenues land us within our guidance range. Specifically, our Q1 2-year trend yields full year revenues at the low end of guidance, while our Q1 4-year trend yields full year revenues between the midpoint and high end of guidance. On the bottom line, our Q1 results project our operating margin landing within our guidance, especially with the cost reductions we undertook this quarter. We continue to anticipate the first half of the year will be materially tougher.\n On the top line, our year-over-year demand comparisons and last year's high back order fill, coupled with the declining macro will yield negative comps. On the bottom line, we continue to foresee gross margin pressures as the supply chain cost sitting on our balance sheet continue to amortize into our income statement as well as ongoing incremental shipping costs to service our customers.  \n In the back half of the year, these headwinds should turn into tailwinds as our top line year-over-year comparisons get easier and our gross margin pressures become tailwinds that support our profitability. As we look beyond 2023, we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals of our business. We believe our long-term growth algorithm will continue to drive mid- to high single-digit top line growth with operating margins exceeding a floor of 15%. \n As the world's largest digital-first, design-led, sustainable home retailer, we're committed to furnishing our customers everywhere. And we're confident that we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver profitable growth for these reasons: our ability to gain market share in a fractured home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital-first, but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet.\n With that, I'll open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez with Telsey Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernandez: I wanted to see if you could expand on the demand. You gave a good amount of color, but is the consumer still focused on, I mean, full price selling? And how are you conveying value to the customer in this environment? \nLaura Alber: Thanks, Cristina. It's been since Labor Day last year where we've seen choppiness in our demand across brands, channels, categories. It's no wonder because of the housing, higher rates, job loss, it does make the customer more cautious. However, it is clear that the customer is still spending and our portfolio of brands, our omni platform and our positioning allows us to compete better than our competition. We can serve our customers across a wide range of price points, product categories and aesthetics. And while we are seeing softness in our furniture business, we are also seeing quite a lot of strength in our high-end electrics and kitchen business. \n And so there's areas where we are shifting our focus, particularly on our marketing. Customers are interested in easy updates for their house. They are entertaining at home, they are cooking at home and they are buying gifts. The recent news about some of the large-scale retailers like Bed Bath & Beyond going out of business gives us a wonderful opportunity to pick up even more market share. There's a lot out there that they served, whether it be dorm or baby and wedding registry that are areas of focus for us but are really going to be exaggerated now that we see the opportunity.\n So we are seeing some subdued areas, we also see that they are buying at full price the things that they are really looking for that are unique and that gives them the ability to update their home, which is so important to them without making that very large scale purchase. \nCristina Fernandez: And then as a follow-up, on the revenue guidance for the year, if the environment stays the same, I guess, how are you thinking about specific, either brand merchandising initiatives or as you commented, market share gains from Bed Bath that would allow you to hit the guidance range you laid -- you maintained today? \nLaura Alber: I'm going to start by letting Jeff talk about our approach to the guidance range. \nJeff Howie: Thank you, Laura. So we recognize that there's still uncertainty in the macro and the consumer is becoming increasingly cautious. As I said in my prepared remarks, if we extrapolate our 2- and 4-year trends in Q1, it lends us within our guidance range. And we've talked a lot about how the first half of the year is going to be materially tougher, especially on the top line, we're up against last year's more higher demand comps and the back order fill. But the back half is a different story, where our demand really started to decelerate last year after Labor Day. And that's where some of our headwinds right now should become tailwinds. \n On the -- respect to things like Bed Bath & Beyond, that's an area where we continue to believe we gain market share. It's clear to us we're gaining our share of the Bed Bath & Beyond volume up for grabs. For example, in the Williams-Sonoma brand, we're picking up share in kitchen electrics and registry. In Kids, we're picking up share from buybuy BABY. Those customers want certainty when decorating their nurseries and know that the store they're buying from will still be there in a few months. And in Teen, we're seeing an early benefit in dorm that we anticipate will ramp as we hit the back-to-school season. \n Bottom line is we think we're positioned to -- well positioned to gain market share in this fractured home furnishings industry with our in-house design, our digital-first, but not digital-only channel strategy and our strong and stable portfolio of brands. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Max Rakhlenko with TD Cowen. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: All right. Great. So first, just staying on the reiterated guidance. For top line, how much breathing room do you think that you're giving yourself for second half of the year? Especially, I think, you said demand comps was down 10% in 1Q and then B2B is also softening. \nJeff Howie: Max, we -- like I spoke to in the last question in my prepared remarks, when we extrapolate our 2- and 4-year trends in Q1, it lands us pretty squarely in the guidance range. And so if you think about what that range could be, very specifically, our 2-year trend in Q1 land us at the low end, but our 4-year trend, which has been very consistent over Q1, land us between the midpoint and high end of guidance. So looking at that, combined with opportunities we have in the brand, what's happening in the market with people exiting like Bed Bath & Beyond, some of the smaller players who don't have the balance sheet to withstand some of the current pressures, we see there's opportunity for us to gain market share. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And then can you speak specifically to product margins in 1Q, how they look compared to last year in prepandemic and the key drivers there? And then just how should we think about gross margin cadence for the remainder of the year? And how much of the pressure from second half of last year do you think that you can get back this year versus some of that continuing into next year? \nJeff Howie: Yes. I think if you take a look at it, we don't break out product margins separate from our selling margins. But if we look at it all together, selling margins were down 350 basis points, driven by lower merch margins and higher shipping costs. As we've been talking about for several quarters, our merch margins reflect the full impact of the capitalized cost in our balance sheet from higher product costs, ocean freight, the tension and demerge that are now flowing through our income statement. And on the selling margins, it continues to reflect the additional costs we've incurred shipping multiple items to customers as I've enumerated. \n When we think about it, in terms of the back half, it's really what we keep talking about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds. We quantified in the call that altogether, these incremental short-term costs accounted for over 300 basis points of the 350 basis points decline in our gross margin as well as our selling margin. So we see that in the back half, the main point is we've been guiding that we have near-term cost pressures that are a headwind, but in the back half, this will become a tailwind as we look to the back half of '23 and into '24. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: Got it. And then just maybe more specifically on promos, curious how those look, both versus last year and then prepandemic levels. \nLaura Alber: We are maintaining our stance on not running site-wide promos and only marking down things where we have a little bit too much inventory. And we are comped in our current Memorial Day promotion that we're running this year. We do that, I'd say, quarterly to reduce our overstocks and keep our inventory as clean as possible. and you're going to just continue to see us take markdowns where we need to. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: Laura, Jeff, I wanted to ask first about the 14% to 15%. I know it said above 15% in the long-term guidance. Can you talk about the path and how much you'll protect that, especially if we see a weaker consumer continue through the back half of the year. Are you intent on protecting this number through cost efficiency, et cetera? Or could we see that dip below and then a return back to some of the longer-term ranges? \nJeff Howie: Simeon, thank you for the question. I love talking about operating margin. We are very confident in our guidance for fiscal year '23 at the 14% to 15%. If you take a look at where it's coming from in terms of our SG&A leverage, we are very focused on our cost control, managing our employment expenses, which we can flex with sales and managing our advertising costs, which you can see in Q1, we leveraged to drive the SG&A leverage there.\n And if I think about the back half of the year and where we're headed, we've quantified that of the 350 basis points decline in selling margin year-over-year, 300 of that we attribute to the short-term supply chain costs and efficiencies we've been talking to. That gives us a lot of room and a lot of confidence to be able to hit the 14% to 15% guidance. And then we throw on top of that, the restructuring charges we took in Q1, which should add $40 million annualized to fiscal year '23, which only a small portion of which actually hit in Q1. That adds another, say, 45, 50 basis points to our opportunity to hit the 14% to 15%.\n So bottom line is we feel confident in our 14% to 15% guidance for fiscal year '23. And we think longer term to the 15% operating margin floor, we think that our Q1 results provide the building blocks so everyone can see how we get there, especially when you take a look at the occupancy and SG&A leverage, versus 2019, and that's evidence of our structural change because of our higher e-com mix and our retail optimization strategy. \nSimeon Gutman: And if I'm allowed to sneak in a follow-up, did you -- can you quantify backlog at all? I think you helped us talk about it last quarter, I think. Can you help frame the year for us? \nJeff Howie: Yes. In terms of the backlog, the backlog is normalized. It's not necessarily a factor like it's been in '20, '21 or '22. So we -- as we said on our Q4 call, the backlog is pretty much normalized at this point. It's not a factor in terms of our results. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Clearly, on the SGA side, you're doing a great job controlling what you can control. But the Home category in itself is really rebased much higher than 2019. And I guess I'm just curious what gives you the confidence that the category doesn't continue to mean reverts. So when we get into, say, '24 or maybe even '25,some of these sales issues persist. \nLaura Alber: Thanks, Chuck. I think the first thing to remember is that the category is very fractured and very large and no one company owns much share. And so companies like ours that are positioned to take share will continue to win. Customers are still spending. They love their homes. When I talked to you last, the housing was down 37% last year, it's now down 22%. It's gotten a little bit better, but we're certainly not counting on that.\n The reality is that the cycle of how they purchase is in phases. Some people are in their home for -- a lot of our customers, mostly in their home for a year, but a lot of them have been in their home for over 3 years, right? And there's a large group that's been in their home for more than 10 years. And these are all opportunities for remodel, update, decorate. You don't have to just redo the whole house to come shop with us because we sell so many other things. We sell pillows. We have frames for those grad gifts that you're all looking for. We are showing you beautiful tablescapes. The gift giving, the babies, all those life stages are embedded and they're real pieces of our business.\n And so it's not just about that movement to buy a new house and buy everything in it. And people love their homes. There's no question that it's on everyone's mind still. And I think they're just very cautious right now to buy the big ticket. And they are still shopping, as I said to you before, we can see it in so many of our categories where they're coming to us every -- we have newness, whether it's LoveShackFancy or some of the new bedding products in Pottery Barn. When we have that high fashion newness that we're so good at, that's exclusive, they definitely purchase and they're purchasing at regular price. \nCharles Grom: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thank, Laura. And then just for Jeff, I mean, clearly, the math on the 2- and the 4-year stacks are correct, and you would be within your guidance. But I guess I'm curious on the demand comp, your comments about the consumer becoming increasingly cautious, if the trend line in that demand comp changed at all as we progressed throughout the past couple of months and into May? \nJeremy Brooks: So our demand trends have remained consistent. They did on the -- 1- and 2-year they did... \nLaura Alber: It's really choppy. \nJeff Howie: Yes. But the 1- and 2-year did decelerate across Q1, but the 4-year was remarkably consistent. So when we look at these trends and we extrapolate them forward, both on the demand side and the net side, we feel it supports our guidance that we've given, as I outlined in the call. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. \nAnthony Chukumba: Just had a question about GreenRow. Obviously, it's super, super early, just launched the brand next week, but I would love to just get some perspectives in terms of the way you think about positioning GreenRow. It looks like it's a lot of furniture. It looks like it's an heirloom, like more traditional furniture. But how are you sort of thinking about that? And obviously, once again, super early, but dream the dream in terms of the long-term opportunity there. \nLaura Alber: Thank you for bringing that up, Anthony. We're very excited and proud of what we've done on GreenRow. We are very focused on sustainability across all of our brands, but we thought it was time that we really approached a brand from the beginning with that as a -- as one of the primary things that we're doing. And so we are able to use all that we know to build an assortment that is both completely sustainable, but also really beautiful and differentiated in the market.\n Many times, when you think about sustainable products, you think about neutrals, very basic products. You don't think about fashion. And GreenRow has both. It's colorful, it's optimistic, it's, I would say, vintage-inspired, European-inspired, and we are giving a range of products from table linens to furniture, very carefully selected, built-to-last. It should be the last table that you buy. It's -- the product is high quality, durable and beautiful.\n And I'd say in terms of white space, the aesthetic is definitely more feminine than our other brands. And just like there are so many different types of music and new songs that come out as best sellers, we knew that there was -- there's always opportunities for new brands, and we've been good at starting them. Most of our business today we're internally started brands. And so while it's going to be very small, it is significant for a while, we're optimistic and it's an example of innovation at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. \nAnthony Chukumba: Got it. That's helpful. And then a quick related follow-up. So you've talked in the past about the fact that as access to easy money has dried up a lot of these smaller DTC brands, these ankle biters, I believe is the term that you've used, you're seeing more like inbounds where they're trying to sell to you or maybe they're going away. I guess any change that you've seen over the last few months in terms of what's going on with the ankle biters? \nLaura Alber: Yes. I mean they're certainly having a tougher time. And we're seeing it in all the ways you mentioned, whether it's people looking for an exit or site-wide promotions. We can see that some of them are buying less ad terms than they were previously, and not enough innovation. I mean this innovation piece is really key to the future. And so they may have had a product or an idea that was very good a couple of years ago, but they can't keep up. They're falling behind. So it's a real opportunity for us. None of them -- put them all together and it's a part of the market and I think some of them will make it, but most of them will not. \nJeff Howie: Yes. I would just jump in and say I think this is a competitive advantage for us in the marketplace that is going to come -- potentially come under some pressure, where our fortress balance sheet will enable us to withstand these pressures that many of these small competitors were not. And so we'll just continue to pick up market share as they run into trouble. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. \nOliver Wintermantel: I had a question regarding B2B. I think, Laura, you said it was down 7% in the quarter, but then contract was up mid-double digits. Can you explain the difference there? What drove that up mid-double digits? And then trading must have been down, obviously, a lot worse than the 7%. \nLaura Alber: Yes. Thank you. This continues to be an area that we're very excited about, and we've seen continued success in driving large project growth including it was our largest quarter history to date for our brand standard and annuity programs. Our contract business has maintained an accelerated growth trajectory, most notably this quarter in hospitality, multi-residential mixed use, along with increased engagement from the commercial sector. Although the trade business has softened over the last few months, we are starting to see signs of volume building back in our designer business, and we are confident in our ability to compete for this business, and we continue to take share while maintaining a very, very strong focus on growing our contract project pipeline, which is really where we want to increase the penetration over the future. Jeff, do you want to add anything to what I... \nJeff Howie: Yes. I think it's always helpful to dimensionalize with some of our notable wins in the last quarter. So with Marriott and Starbucks, both names everyone knows, we saw our best quarter ever. They both logged triple-digit growth. In our residential developer business, we continue to expand our portfolio with key industry names, such as [ Related ], Pulte and Lennar. We completed office projects with Salesforce, [ Dan's Corporation ], Republic Airways. In the stadium space, we helped Auburn University update their Gameday suites. And we're getting traction in some of our newer industry segments like cruise, where we partnered with Celebrity Cruises to furnish some of the departure lounges and continue to build out our book of business in the space. The key point here is B2B continues to be a winning strategy for us, and we continue to capture market share in this $80 billion fragmented market. \nOliver Wintermantel: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, when I hear your commentary there, the -- on contract, that mid-double digit, it sounds like it should continue to grow nicely, but the trade should recover. So should we -- for the rest of the year, in other words, should we see that negative 7% to improve throughout the year? \nJeff Howie: We don't guide B2B specifically across the quarters, but we do continue to expect B2B will aid our comps throughout the quarter. And it's all baked in to... \nLaura Alber: Throughout the [ year ]. Yes, throughout the [ year ]. \nJeff Howie: Yes, thank you. Thank you, Laura. And it's all contemplated in our annual guidance. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. \nSeth Sigman: I wanted to follow up on the shape of demand. So there was clearly a step down in Q1, maybe even within Q1. But I wanted to confirm, based on an earlier comment that it sounds like you're seeing some stabilization. I don't know if that was late Q1 or a Q2 comment, but maybe you could just clarify that.\n And then the second part of the question, it's more about visibility into some of the specific operational drivers that you have that I think you've embedded in the sales outlook for the year. Maybe you could just elaborate on where you are with respect to some of those, thinking about rebalancing inventory, improving delivery accuracy, maybe reducing some of the concessions. I think you've built some of those into the sales outlook. So where are we with those today? And how important are those for the outlook? \nLaura Alber: Sure. It's Laura, and then I'll let Jeff add some more detail. So as I said, we've seen choppiness since Labor Day. So the consistency is the choppiness. And when we look at the balance of the year and we take into consideration our opportunities by brand and the fact that Williams-Sonoma becomes a bigger part of the mix in Q4. And then we run our 2- and 4- years, Jeff, when we get to our guidance range. \n But there's a lot of other things other than just sales that are extremely important. And there's a lot of opportunities even in the short term. And the biggest one of all is customer service. The pandemic was a time where supply chain was very disrupted. Products were late -- very late. We had to repeatedly tell customers that they weren't getting things and that cost us a lot of money and a lot of credibility with our customers.\n And during this time, we have been working so hard to improve our service levels and return to world-class service, which has always been a key tenet of who we are and why our customers come to us. And I'm pleased to tell you that we are already seeing significant improvements in on-time delivery, which is a key part of customer satisfaction.\n Customer service is also a profit driver. So Jeff went through some of the areas where we're going to see natural improvement just because we're lapping high cost from last year. But what we haven't quantified is the -- all the costs that are embedded that were wastes, that will improve our operating margin. So while, yes, the top line is subdued, we have opportunity to build for the long term and ensure that we deliver a very profitable business while others really suffer. And over time, you're going to see us be one of the strongest players, I believe, in the industry. \nSeth Sigman: So then -- that's really helpful. So I guess, one follow-up would be just around the sensitivity in the financial model, right? Obviously, top line is under pressure but that's not the only thing that matters, right? And so how much have you built in here? How much can sales potentially flex lower while still achieving the margins and EPS that you laid out here based on some of those drivers? \nLaura Alber: I think Jeff has already answered that question. I think you saw us -- I know you saw us deliver a higher operating margin than expected in Q1. And with, I think, lower sales than most people's model showed, and that is because we've always been very disciplined. We are aggressive about finding efficiencies and cutting costs but also our platform and our omni positioning allows us to flex more than others. We've been doing this for a while. We went through the downturn and we came out stronger. And so I would tell you that our track record versus me just saying I'm confident, our track record shows you that we are able to produce even if the top line is more subdued. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Anna Andreeva with Needham. \nAnna Andreeva: Great. Two quick ones from us, keeping in mind that it's volatile out there, like you've said. Just curious on what are you seeing with demand so far in the second quarter? I think you mentioned the Memorial Day promos are being planned similar to last year's levels. Can you talk if you're still seeing the consumer come out for events? And then secondly, on the $40 million in cost reduction I think you said some of it affected the P&L already in the first quarter. Just any color on how we should think about those savings as we go through the year. \nLaura Alber: Yes. Thank you. We're really early in the quarter, couple of weeks in here versus when we talked about after Q4, we were more -- we're further along in the quarter. So I wouldn't read anything into -- I wouldn't make any comment about at least a couple of weeks into the quarter. I did mention we're seeing softer sales in furniture and outdoor seems to be following a later curve than it did obviously in the pandemic where people bought it earlier. We are seeing strength in our textile decorating business, gift giving, kitchen business. And so all those were covered in my prepared remarks.\n And when we think about the back half of the year, we're going to continue to build on those strengths, both in marketing, but also as we think about West Elm, the opportunity to add more assortment in gift giving and also in entertaining for the more modern customer, you will see us do that this fall and holiday season with some more newness in those categories, which I think was a really good strategy to do that because we're seeing that that's where the strength is in the business. \nJeff Howie: And Anna, in respect to your question on the $40 million in savings, our cost-cutting measures happened in phases across the quarter, both domestically and internationally. And because of that timing, only a very small portion of the $40 million actually booked into Q1. So the majority of that savings will be recognized over the next 3 quarters. So that is factored into our guidance, but it gives us additional confidence in the op margin guidance range we gave of 14% to 15% for 2023. \nOperator: At this time, I will hand the call back over to management for closing remarks. \nLaura Alber: Well, thank you all for joining us. I really appreciate all the great questions, and I wish you all the best over the summer. Looking forward to talking to you soon. \nOperator: That will conclude today's meeting. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I want to begin by thanking our strong team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. for their talent and hard work in delivering another solid quarter of earnings despite a challenging macro backdrop. With our focus on compelling products, customer service and profitability, we achieved our financial expectations.  \n We continue to distinguish ourselves as the world's largest digital-first, design-led, sustainable home retailer. What are the things that distinguish us? No other home furnishings company offers our in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated sourcing organization. This allows us to deliver high-quality, sustainable products at the best value to market that cannot be found anywhere else.  \n Most importantly, it allows us to lead with innovation, distinguishing us from our competition. We are always looking for new opportunities to inspire our customers through our in-house design. From the new summer block prints and exclusive heritage quilts in Pottery Barn to the Viv Swivel Chair in West Elm to the compelling new dorm assortment in Pottery Barn Teen and the exclusive electronics and ergonomic tools in the Williams-Sonoma brand, our company leads with innovation.  \n And just last week, we launched the newest brand in the Williams-Sonoma, Inc. portfolio, GreenRow. This new brand has been internally designed and developed, utilizing sustainable materials and manufacturing practices to create powerful, vintage-inspired heirloom quality products. GreenRow addresses white space within our portfolio and in the market. It is this type of innovation that distinguishes us within the home furnishings industry and most importantly, resonates with our customers.\n But not only are we innovators, we are operators. As you know, no other home furnishings company offers our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy that's transforming the customer experience. With our proprietary e-commerce platform, we are one of the largest e-commerce players in the United States. And our in-house CRM and data analytics teams optimize our digital spend and customer connections.\n And we operate a world-class retail business with our stores serving as billboards for our brands. They are beautifully designed and curated with aspirational assortments. Our retail optimization efforts have refocused our fleet on the most profitable, most inspiring and most strategic locations. And our omni capabilities are a competitive advantage in the market.\n In Q1, examples of our operational excellence continued. We replatformed Rejuvenation's website, capturing new demand and driving higher conversions through enhanced imagery and an elevated customer experience. We managed our SG&A expense, leveraging our ad cost by limiting our spend to more proven efficient channels where customers show a higher level of intent to purchase. We made tough decisions to rightsize our organization to control costs and to drive focus and efficiency. We managed our receipts to control inventory levels. And we are making substantial progress on our customer service, which was affected by the pandemic. \n We have successfully improved customer metrics, including on-time delivery. We are working hard to rebalance inventory to reduce multiple and out-of-market shipments, both of which will improve service levels further and reduce costs. We are here to serve our customers. Without them, nothing else matters.\n Lastly, we lead the home furnishings industry with our sustainability efforts and values-based culture. In Q1, we are recognized as one of the top 10 companies on Forbes list of America's Best Employers for Diversity in 2023. We were the highest ranking home furnishings retailer on the list.  \n Turning to the quarter. While our top line comp ran down 6%, our 2-year comp was 3.5%, our 4-year comp to 2019 was plus 46.5% and we delivered an operating margin of 12.9%, with earnings per share of $2.64, significantly above our prepandemic results.  \n In terms of demand, our trend softened from negative mid-single digits in Q4 to down 10% in Q1. The softness in demand was most notable in our high-ticket furniture offerings, but we didn't see that same trend in our high-ticket electronics and kitchen offerings. These disparate trends tell that the customer is still spending. The diversification and durability within our portfolio of brands and product offerings positions us better than our competition with this shift in spending.\n Now let's turn to more details in the brands. Pottery Barn ran down slightly with a negative 0.4% net comp in Q1, but ran 14% on a 2-year basis and 54.4% on a 4-year basis. We are seeing subdued demand in our furniture business, with customers demonstrating more caution on high-ticket considered purchases.  \n And in our outdoor business, we are seeing delayed purchasing until later in the summer season versus early spring. However, we are seeing strength in our exclusive decorating and textiles categories as customers choose to postpone bigger redesign projects to focus on easy updates, leveraging our beautiful print and pattern pillows, table linens, bedding and bath textiles, frames and decorative lighting.  \n In PB, summer seasonal newness is off to a good start with strong demand for block print quilts and heritage patchwork quotes. The customer response to our Americana and coastal decorating across tabletop, textile and decor has been strong ahead of the Memorial Day weekend and should extend into the summer season. As we look to the year ahead, the brand has a strong lineup of textiles, decorating and entertaining products at a great value and we are increasing our marketing of these categories to drive performance. \n The Pottery Barn children's business ran a negative 3.3% comp in Q1. It was a negative 6.4% on a 2-year basis, but ran positive 29.6% on a 4-year basis. We see pressure in some of our children's furniture categories, but we continue to see strength in many parts of the baby business. And we are focused on elevating the customer experience in these life stage businesses. For example, in our baby business, we saw strength in our GREENGUARD Gold nursery seating, personalized baby gifts and our curated selection of baby gear, which positions us well as a destination for the registry business. And in our stores and across our mobile app, customers can register with Pottery Barn Kids and receive help from our nursery experts.  \n In our Teen brand, we are excited to have launched a compelling new dorm assortment, covering the needs of college-bound students with extra-long twin bedding and storage. Customers can shop online and ship products to any of our company stores near their college campus. Included in our dorm offer, we are excited to showcase our partnership with LoveShackFancy which has resonated with customers. Also, we are pleased with our first full quarter of results for our Pottery Barn Kids and Teen shopping apps. We are seeing customers respond to the easy-to-shop, thoughtfully designed experience and both apps are outperforming the mobile web across all KPIs. \n The West Elm brand continues to be the most affected by the tough macro environment. In Q1, West Elm ran a negative 15.8% and was negative 3% on a 2-year basis, but 51.1% positive on a 4-year basis. We're excited that Day Kornbluth started with the team as the new Brand President on April 3. She'll lead West Elm through its next chapter of growth, most immediately with a focus on 4 areas: one, industry-leading design and value; two, increasing brand awareness and customer acquisition; three, expanding into product white space; and four, leveraging channel growth opportunities.\n West Elm is our brand with the highest percentage of its assortment in furniture. We see opportunity in West Elm as it expands into textiles, decorating, accessories, entertaining and seasonal offerings. We continue to be very excited about the long-term growth trajectory of West Elm.\n The Williams-Sonoma brand ran a negative 4.4% comp in Q1. On a 2-year basis, the brand ran negative 6.7%, but positive 33.9% on a 4-year basis. The Williams-Sonoma team remains focused on increasing product exclusivity, innovation, relevant content and full price selling. We have a pipeline of innovative product launches and collaborations planned throughout the year, and we see new opportunities from the integration of the Williams-Sonoma Home furnishings assortment into our kitchen business. We remain confident in our ability to gain market share in the housewares industry.  \n Now I'd like to update you on our growth initiatives, beginning with Business-to-Business. This business has 2 formats: trade and contract. The trade side of the business has been more impacted by the macro environment, but we continue to remain focused on the growth opportunity on the contract side. Contract grew mid-double digits in the quarter despite B2B running down 7% in total. We continue to win B2B accounts due to our design capabilities and a wide range of products offered in our multi-brand portfolio. And in fact, we have a stronger pipeline of projects currently out for bid compared to last year.\n Another growth initiative is our expansion into global markets. Our brand momentum continues to exceed expectations in the India market and we are driving growth through retail expansion with the opening of our third West Elm store, our second Pottery Barn store and our first Pottery Barn Kids store in Q3 2023. India is a strategic market as we expand globally, and we plan to open additional locations in 2024. \n Additionally, we are seeing strength across all of our brands in the Middle East led by strong design services. We'll be expanding in the region with the opening of an additional Pottery Barn and West Elm store in Saudi Arabia in Q2. Canada is also a highlight with digital representing our biggest growth opportunity for the market. We launched B2B in Q1 in Canada, and we look forward to introducing the Canadian customer to Rejuvenation, Mark and Graham and Williams-Sonoma Home with the launch of their websites later this year.  \n In summary, we recognize that there is continued uncertainty with the environment and the consumer, but we operate in a highly fragmented market and we will continue to gain share by inspiring customers with our portfolio of strong brands and by building trust with a return to world-class customer service. And we will continue to generate strong profits.  \n On the guidance front, we are only 1 quarter into the fiscal year with a lot more volume to come. We have a lineup of opportunities in our brands which, considered with our 2-year and 4-year trends, supports our 2023 guidance. As we indicated in Q4, the first half of the year will be tougher with the strong comps we are up against and the declining macro. But in the back half, our compares get easier and our supply chain cost pressures start to roll off. Looking past the short term, we remain confident in our long-term guidance and our opportunity to furnish our customers everywhere.  \n We have built a company of loved brands with a shared platform of competitive differentiators that lead the industry: in-house design, a digital-first but not digital-only platform and our values. We have identified opportunities for growth through strategic initiatives like B2B, Emerging Brands and Global where we have the opportunities to disrupt. We have a culture of innovation and an experienced team who knows how to increase operational efficiency, control costs, deliver world-class customer service and drive new growth opportunities.\n And finally, with our focus on compelling products and restoring world-class customer service, along with our financial discipline and our great team, we are confident that we will continue to deliver on our commitment to our customers, our employees and our shareholders, all of whom I'd like to thank for their support. Now I will turn it over to Jeff. Thanks, Cristina. It's been since Labor Day last year where we've seen choppiness in our demand across brands, channels, categories. It's no wonder because of the housing, higher rates, job loss, it does make the customer more cautious. However, it is clear that the customer is still spending and our portfolio of brands, our omni platform and our positioning allows us to compete better than our competition. We can serve our customers across a wide range of price points, product categories and aesthetics. And while we are seeing softness in our furniture business, we are also seeing quite a lot of strength in our high-end electrics and kitchen business. \n And so there's areas where we are shifting our focus, particularly on our marketing. Customers are interested in easy updates for their house. They are entertaining at home, they are cooking at home and they are buying gifts. The recent news about some of the large-scale retailers like Bed Bath & Beyond going out of business gives us a wonderful opportunity to pick up even more market share. There's a lot out there that they served, whether it be dorm or baby and wedding registry that are areas of focus for us but are really going to be exaggerated now that we see the opportunity.\n So we are seeing some subdued areas, we also see that they are buying at full price the things that they are really looking for that are unique and that gives them the ability to update their home, which is so important to them without making that very large scale purchase. I'm going to start by letting Jeff talk about our approach to the guidance range. We are maintaining our stance on not running site-wide promos and only marking down things where we have a little bit too much inventory. And we are comped in our current Memorial Day promotion that we're running this year. We do that, I'd say, quarterly to reduce our overstocks and keep our inventory as clean as possible. and you're going to just continue to see us take markdowns where we need to. Thanks, Chuck. I think the first thing to remember is that the category is very fractured and very large and no one company owns much share. And so companies like ours that are positioned to take share will continue to win. Customers are still spending. They love their homes. When I talked to you last, the housing was down 37% last year, it's now down 22%. It's gotten a little bit better, but we're certainly not counting on that.\n The reality is that the cycle of how they purchase is in phases. Some people are in their home for -- a lot of our customers, mostly in their home for a year, but a lot of them have been in their home for over 3 years, right? And there's a large group that's been in their home for more than 10 years. And these are all opportunities for remodel, update, decorate. You don't have to just redo the whole house to come shop with us because we sell so many other things. We sell pillows. We have frames for those grad gifts that you're all looking for. We are showing you beautiful tablescapes. The gift giving, the babies, all those life stages are embedded and they're real pieces of our business.\n And so it's not just about that movement to buy a new house and buy everything in it. And people love their homes. There's no question that it's on everyone's mind still. And I think they're just very cautious right now to buy the big ticket. And they are still shopping, as I said to you before, we can see it in so many of our categories where they're coming to us every -- we have newness, whether it's LoveShackFancy or some of the new bedding products in Pottery Barn. When we have that high fashion newness that we're so good at, that's exclusive, they definitely purchase and they're purchasing at regular price. It's really choppy. Thank you for bringing that up, Anthony. We're very excited and proud of what we've done on GreenRow. We are very focused on sustainability across all of our brands, but we thought it was time that we really approached a brand from the beginning with that as a -- as one of the primary things that we're doing. And so we are able to use all that we know to build an assortment that is both completely sustainable, but also really beautiful and differentiated in the market.\n Many times, when you think about sustainable products, you think about neutrals, very basic products. You don't think about fashion. And GreenRow has both. It's colorful, it's optimistic, it's, I would say, vintage-inspired, European-inspired, and we are giving a range of products from table linens to furniture, very carefully selected, built-to-last. It should be the last table that you buy. It's -- the product is high quality, durable and beautiful.\n And I'd say in terms of white space, the aesthetic is definitely more feminine than our other brands. And just like there are so many different types of music and new songs that come out as best sellers, we knew that there was -- there's always opportunities for new brands, and we've been good at starting them. Most of our business today we're internally started brands. And so while it's going to be very small, it is significant for a while, we're optimistic and it's an example of innovation at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Yes. I mean they're certainly having a tougher time. And we're seeing it in all the ways you mentioned, whether it's people looking for an exit or site-wide promotions. We can see that some of them are buying less ad terms than they were previously, and not enough innovation. I mean this innovation piece is really key to the future. And so they may have had a product or an idea that was very good a couple of years ago, but they can't keep up. They're falling behind. So it's a real opportunity for us. None of them -- put them all together and it's a part of the market and I think some of them will make it, but most of them will not. Yes. Thank you. This continues to be an area that we're very excited about, and we've seen continued success in driving large project growth including it was our largest quarter history to date for our brand standard and annuity programs. Our contract business has maintained an accelerated growth trajectory, most notably this quarter in hospitality, multi-residential mixed use, along with increased engagement from the commercial sector. Although the trade business has softened over the last few months, we are starting to see signs of volume building back in our designer business, and we are confident in our ability to compete for this business, and we continue to take share while maintaining a very, very strong focus on growing our contract project pipeline, which is really where we want to increase the penetration over the future. Jeff, do you want to add anything to what I... Throughout the [ year ]. Yes, throughout the [ year ]. Sure. It's Laura, and then I'll let Jeff add some more detail. So as I said, we've seen choppiness since Labor Day. So the consistency is the choppiness. And when we look at the balance of the year and we take into consideration our opportunities by brand and the fact that Williams-Sonoma becomes a bigger part of the mix in Q4. And then we run our 2- and 4- years, Jeff, when we get to our guidance range. \n But there's a lot of other things other than just sales that are extremely important. And there's a lot of opportunities even in the short term. And the biggest one of all is customer service. The pandemic was a time where supply chain was very disrupted.

So while, yes, the top line is subdued, we have opportunity to build for the long term and ensure that we deliver a very profitable business while others really suffer.

We are seeing strength in our textile decorating business, gift giving, kitchen business. And so all those were covered in my prepared remarks.\n And when we think about the back half of the year, we're going to continue to build on those strengths, both in marketing, but also as we think about West Elm, the opportunity to add more assortment in gift giving and also in entertaining for the more modern customer, you will see us do that this fall and holiday season with some more newness in those categories, which I think was a really good strategy to do that because we're seeing that that's where the strength is in the business. Well, thank you all for joining us. I really appreciate all the great questions, and I wish you all the best over the summer. Looking forward to talking to you soon."

            "name": "Jeff Howie",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. As Laura said, we're proud that we've delivered solid quarter of earnings in a challenging environment. On the top line, we continue to distinguish ourselves from the home furnishing industry through the strength of our proprietary in-house design, our family of strong and stable brands and our culture of innovation. On the bottom line, our operating margin demonstrates the resiliency of our profitability despite softer top line results and illustrates how the structural changes in our operating model support our long-term 15% operating margin floor.  \n Before I walk through our Q1 results and our fiscal year '23 guidance, I'll first touch on our non-GAAP adjustments. As Laura said, we continue to distinguish ourselves through innovation and good operations. Laura touched on the innovation across our brands that will continue to propel our market share gains and the newest member of our family of brands, GreenRow.  \n On the operations side, we are committed to driving efficiency across all our operations. As part of this commitment, we undertook 3 key initiatives to drive efficiency in Q1 that resulted in our recording $26 million in non-GAAP expenses. First, we completed a company-wide reduction in force, rightsizing our teams domestically and internationally, primarily focused on corporate noncustomer-facing positions.  \n Second, we closed our Southern West Coast upholstery manufacturing facility, moving our production from California to our lower-cost Southeastern U.S. facilities. Third, we exited our noncore Aperture SaaS business. Combined, these changes will result not only in an estimated annualized savings of $40 million, but also increased focus and efficiency across our corporate, supply chain and technology teams. For more details, please refer to the GAAP to non-GAAP schedule in our press release.  \n Now let's dive into our Q1 results. As I do so, in addition to year-over-year results, I'll reference 2019 as it's helpful to compare our performance with prepandemic levels. Net revenues came in at $1.755 billion, slightly below our expectations. While comparable brand revenue growth on the 1-year stack came in at negative 6%, our 2-year stack grew 3.5% and our full year stack against 2019 grew 46.5%.  \n In demand, we were up against our toughest 1-year compare to the year, leading Q1 demand to come in at negative 10% on a 1-year stack. However, our demand was negative 1% on a 2-year stack and positive 46.7% on a 4-year stack. Our net revenues were driven by strong order fulfillment and timing of revenue recognition as we had less undelivered orders in Q1 than in Q4. For context, in a normalized environment, typically, there is a spread between demand and net comps.\n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin at 38.6% was in line with our expectations. Coming in 520 basis points below last year, reflects the impact of the short-term supply chain costs and inefficiencies flowing through our income statement that we've been discussing in the past several quarters.  \n Merchandise margins decreased from last year as we experienced the full effect of the capitalized costs from higher product costs, ocean freight, detention and demerge into our income statement. This was partially offset by the higher pricing power, our proprietary products command and by our ongoing commitment to forgo site-wide promotions.  \n Selling margin continue to be impacted by higher outbound customer shipping costs as well. We continue to incur these higher costs to best serve our customers by shipping from out-of-market distribution centers and, in some cases, shipping multiple times for multiunit orders, which typically would have been fulfilled in a single shipment.  \n We're working hard to rebalance our inventory composition and regional inventory location to improve our customer service. As Laura touched on, we are pleased with the improvements in customer service we are already seeing, and we expect customer service will continue to improve over the course of 2023. Altogether, our selling margins were 350 basis points lower than last year. We estimate more than 300 of the 350 basis points are attributable to the short-term supply chain costs and inefficiencies I just discussed. At 38.6%, our Q1 gross margin remains 270 basis points higher than 2019's 35.9%. And that's inclusive of absorbing these more than 300 basis points in supply chain-related costs and inefficiencies.  \n Occupancy costs at 11.5% of net revenues were 170 basis points above last year with occupancy dollars increasing 8.6% to approximately $202 million. Our ongoing retail store optimization initiatives partially offset incremental costs from our new distribution centers on both the East and West Coast.  \n These new distribution centers will support our long-term growth, improve service time for our customers and drive cost efficiencies over time. Our 250 basis points leverage versus 2019's 14% occupancy rate demonstrates the impact of our higher e-com mix and retail optimization has had on our gross margin.  \n Our SG&A rate continues to be at a historic low for Q1 at 25.7%, leveraging 100 basis points over last year. This reflects our financial discipline and ability to control costs in a challenging environment. We held employment expenses as a rate of revenues flat to last year as we managed variable employment costs in accordance with our top line trends.  \n Our advertising leverage continues to reflect the agile, performance-driven proficiency of our marketing team. Our in-house capabilities, first-party data and multi-brand platform are an underappreciated competitive advantage that allow us to drive efficient advertising spend in near real time as we see trends evolve in the business. Overall, SG&A came in 320 basis points lower than 2019's SG&A rate of 28.9%. This once again highlights the impact of our higher e-com mix and retail optimization on our profitability.  \n With regard to the bottom line, we are pleased with our results despite the quarter's declining macroeconomic backdrop. Q1 operating income came in at $226 million, and operating margin at 12.9%. While down 420 basis points below last year, 12.9% stands 590 basis points above 2019's 7%.  \n These results reflect the durability of our profitability and underpin our 15% operating margin long-term guidance, [ and that's another ] quarter marked by significant macroeconomic headwinds, softer top line results and over 300 basis points in short-term supply chain-related cost pressures.  \n Our diluted earnings per share of $2.64 was $0.86 or 25% below last year's record first quarter earnings per share of $3.50, but significantly above 2019's earnings per share of $0.81. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $297 million with no debt outstanding. This is inclusive of investing $50 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth, paying $58 million in quarterly dividends and opportunistically repurchasing [ 300 million ] or 3.8% of shares outstanding, congruent with our commitment to maximizing shareholder value.  \n Merchandise inventories, which include in-transit inventory, at $1.402 billion were essentially flat year-over-year, while inventory on hand increased 28% over last year. Two important points to emphasize here once again. First, our inventory on hand increase continues to be skewed by last year's pandemic-related supply chain disruption, creating an artificially low base. An apples-to-apples comparison versus 2019 highlights how we've improved our inventory turnover as our on-hand inventory levels have increased only 19% against revenue growth of over 41% during that time. Second, our lower balance sheet inventory growth reflects a 46% reduction in merchandise in transit as we've aligned our future on order with cautious forward-looking demand given our Q1 trends and the macroeconomic outlook.  \n Summing up our Q1, we are pleased to have delivered results in line with our expectations. We continue to distinguish ourselves within a fragmented home furnishings industry. Our operating margin demonstrates the resiliency of our profitability and our ability to maintain at least a 15% operating margin over the long term. I want to thank all our associates for their hard work and dedication in delivering these results in a challenging environment.\n Now let's turn to our guidance for 2023. As we look to the balance of the year, we are reiterating our fiscal '23 guidance. We recognize there is uncertainty in the macro and the consumer is becoming increasingly cautious, but this is our best estimate based on the facts and trends we know today.\n On the top line, extrapolating our 2- and 4-year trends in Q1 to full year '23 revenues land us within our guidance range. Specifically, our Q1 2-year trend yields full year revenues at the low end of guidance, while our Q1 4-year trend yields full year revenues between the midpoint and high end of guidance. On the bottom line, our Q1 results project our operating margin landing within our guidance, especially with the cost reductions we undertook this quarter. We continue to anticipate the first half of the year will be materially tougher.\n On the top line, our year-over-year demand comparisons and last year's high back order fill, coupled with the declining macro will yield negative comps. On the bottom line, we continue to foresee gross margin pressures as the supply chain cost sitting on our balance sheet continue to amortize into our income statement as well as ongoing incremental shipping costs to service our customers.  \n In the back half of the year, these headwinds should turn into tailwinds as our top line year-over-year comparisons get easier and our gross margin pressures become tailwinds that support our profitability. As we look beyond 2023, we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals of our business. We believe our long-term growth algorithm will continue to drive mid- to high single-digit top line growth with operating margins exceeding a floor of 15%. \n As the world's largest digital-first, design-led, sustainable home retailer, we're committed to furnishing our customers everywhere. And we're confident that we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver profitable growth for these reasons: our ability to gain market share in a fractured home furnishings industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital-first, but not digital-only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet.\n With that, I'll open the call for questions. Thank you, Laura. So we recognize that there's still uncertainty in the macro and the consumer is becoming increasingly cautious. As I said in my prepared remarks, if we extrapolate our 2- and 4-year trends in Q1, it lends us within our guidance range. And we've talked a lot about how the first half of the year is going to be materially tougher, especially on the top line, we're up against last year's more higher demand comps and the back order fill. But the back half is a different story, where our demand really started to decelerate last year after Labor Day. And that's where some of our headwinds right now should become tailwinds. \n On the -- respect to things like Bed Bath & Beyond, that's an area where we continue to believe we gain market share. It's clear to us we're gaining our share of the Bed Bath & Beyond volume up for grabs. For example, in the Williams-Sonoma brand, we're picking up share in kitchen electrics and registry. In Kids, we're picking up share from buybuy BABY. Those customers want certainty when decorating their nurseries and know that the store they're buying from will still be there in a few months. And in Teen, we're seeing an early benefit in dorm that we anticipate will ramp as we hit the back-to-school season. \n Bottom line is we think we're positioned to -- well positioned to gain market share in this fractured home furnishings industry with our in-house design, our digital-first, but not digital-only channel strategy and our strong and stable portfolio of brands. Max, we -- like I spoke to in the last question in my prepared remarks, when we extrapolate our 2- and 4-year trends in Q1, it lands us pretty squarely in the guidance range. And so if you think about what that range could be, very specifically, our 2-year trend in Q1 land us at the low end, but our 4-year trend, which has been very consistent over Q1, land us between the midpoint and high end of guidance. So looking at that, combined with opportunities we have in the brand, what's happening in the market with people exiting like Bed Bath & Beyond, some of the smaller players who don't have the balance sheet to withstand some of the current pressures, we see there's opportunity for us to gain market share. Yes. I think if you take a look at it, we don't break out product margins separate from our selling margins. But if we look at it all together, selling margins were down 350 basis points, driven by lower merch margins and higher shipping costs. As we've been talking about for several quarters, our merch margins reflect the full impact of the capitalized cost in our balance sheet from higher product costs, ocean freight, the tension and demerge that are now flowing through our income statement. And on the selling margins, it continues to reflect the additional costs we've incurred shipping multiple items to customers as I've enumerated. \n When we think about it, in terms of the back half, it's really what we keep talking about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds. We quantified in the call that altogether, these incremental short-term costs accounted for over 300 basis points of the 350 basis points decline in our gross margin as well as our selling margin. So we see that in the back half, the main point is we've been guiding that we have near-term cost pressures that are a headwind, but in the back half, this will become a tailwind as we look to the back half of '23 and into '24. Simeon, thank you for the question. I love talking about operating margin. We are very confident in our guidance for fiscal year '23 at the 14% to 15%. If you take a look at where it's coming from in terms of our SG&A leverage, we are very focused on our cost control, managing our employment expenses, which we can flex with sales and managing our advertising costs, which you can see in Q1, we leveraged to drive the SG&A leverage there.\n And if I think about the back half of the year and where we're headed, we've quantified that of the 350 basis points decline in selling margin year-over-year, 300 of that we attribute to the short-term supply chain costs and efficiencies we've been talking to. That gives us a lot of room and a lot of confidence to be able to hit the 14% to 15% guidance. And then we throw on top of that, the restructuring charges we took in Q1, which should add $40 million annualized to fiscal year '23, which only a small portion of which actually hit in Q1. That adds another, say, 45, 50 basis points to our opportunity to hit the 14% to 15%.\n So bottom line is we feel confident in our 14% to 15% guidance for fiscal year '23. And we think longer term to the 15% operating margin floor, we think that our Q1 results provide the building blocks so everyone can see how we get there, especially when you take a look at the occupancy and SG&A leverage, versus 2019, and that's evidence of our structural change because of our higher e-com mix and our retail optimization strategy. Yes. In terms of the backlog, the backlog is normalized. It's not necessarily a factor like it's been in '20, '21 or '22. So we -- as we said on our Q4 call, the backlog is pretty much normalized at this point. It's not a factor in terms of our results. Yes. But the 1- and 2-year did decelerate across Q1, but the 4-year was remarkably consistent. So when we look at these trends and we extrapolate them forward, both on the demand side and the net side, we feel it supports our guidance that we've given, as I outlined in the call. Yes. I would just jump in and say I think this is a competitive advantage for us in the marketplace that is going to come -- potentially come under some pressure, where our fortress balance sheet will enable us to withstand these pressures that many of these small competitors were not. And so we'll just continue to pick up market share as they run into trouble. Yes. I think it's always helpful to dimensionalize with some of our notable wins in the last quarter. So with Marriott and Starbucks, both names everyone knows, we saw our best quarter ever. They both logged triple-digit growth. In our residential developer business, we continue to expand our portfolio with key industry names, such as [ Related ], Pulte and Lennar. We completed office projects with Salesforce, [ Dan's Corporation ], Republic Airways. In the stadium space, we helped Auburn University update their Gameday suites. And we're getting traction in some of our newer industry segments like cruise, where we partnered with Celebrity Cruises to furnish some of the departure lounges and continue to build out our book of business in the space. The key point here is B2B continues to be a winning strategy for us, and we continue to capture market share in this $80 billion fragmented market. We don't guide B2B specifically across the quarters, but we do continue to expect B2B will aid our comps throughout the quarter. And it's all baked in to... Yes, thank you. Thank you, Laura. And it's all contemplated in our annual guidance. And Anna, in respect to your question on the $40 million in savings, our cost-cutting measures happened in phases across the quarter, both domestically and internationally. And because of that timing, only a very small portion of the $40 million actually booked into Q1. So the majority of that savings will be recognized over the next 3 quarters. So that is factored into our guidance, but it gives us additional confidence in the op margin guidance range we gave of 14% to 15% for 2023."

A question-and-answer session will follow the conclusion of the prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Brooks: Good morning and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'm here this morning with Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Howie, our Chief Financial Officer; and Sameer Hassan, our Chief Digital and Technology Officer.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Laura.\nLaura Alber: Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call. At Williams-Sonoma Inc., we continue to have strong performance exceeding both top and bottom-line expectations. The third quarter was driven by continued improvement in our sales trends, market share gains and strong profit. Our comp came in at down 2.9% with an operating margin of 17.8%, delivering a 7% increase in earnings per share to $1.96. Also, we bought back $533 million of our stock this quarter and have purchased 4% of our shares outstanding so far this year. Our operating results reflect the operational improvements that we have been focused on all year and the strength of our margin profile. Even in a difficult environment, our initiatives continue to gain momentum and we are optimistic and confident about our business. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year revenues to come in at a range of down 3% to down 1.5% and we are raising our guidance on operating margin 40 basis points to be in the range of 17.8% to 18.2%. And due to our confidence in our business model and our ability to perform in almost any environment, our Board has approved an additional $1 billion stock repurchase authorization. We continue to be focused on our three key priorities. First, returning to growth. Second, elevating our world-class customer service. And third, driving earnings. Let's start first with returning to growth. Our top-line trend improved over Q2 and even though we ran negative in Q3, we outperformed the industry decline of 7% this quarter. Our better-than-industry performance is a result of our focus on innovation from our products to our design services. We set ourselves apart from the competition with our unique in house design capabilities and vertically-integrated sourcing organization, which gives us the ability to offer high-quality products at compelling price points. It is this price-value balance that allows us to continue to significantly reduce our promotional activity. On the design front, we have been innovating and preparing for the next generation of design services. The new tools that we have launched assist our customers with developing design plans for any size or style of home. In October, we also launched our Shop by Style and Design Boards in Pottery Barn, allowing customers to create and share mood boards online. The next key component of our return to growth strategy is our commitment to improving our channel experiences. We are continuously investing in our proprietary e-commerce technology. We are actively incorporating AI into our capabilities in areas like personalized e-mails and home pages and supply chain decision making. From product discovery and selection to personalization, content, customer care and the final mile, our team is constantly thinking about how to elevate and evolve our best-in-class e-commerce experience. And we are pleased with the strong performance in our retail stores. We have continued to improve our in store experience with inspiring new products, improved in stock inventory levels and next level design services and events. Our retail optimization strategy is working. Our new store locations and designs are driving good ROI and we see continued opportunities to transform our store fleet to be positioned in the most profitable and inspiring locations. Now, let's talk through progress on our second and third key priorities. We continue to make progress improving our world class customer service, which in turn drives earnings and contributes to our strong operating results. Our customer service metrics have improved since Q2 and are all time record levels. Our supply chain team continues to reduce costs by limiting out-of-market and multiple shipments, reducing customer accommodations, lowering returns and damages and reducing replacements. And despite the progress we have already made, we see more margin opportunity ahead, as we continue to drill down on areas for additional optimization and efficiency. Now, I'd like to update you on the performance of our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 7.5% comp in Q3. In the brand, we saw improved furniture performance during the quarter. Also, fall new launches were up to last year, driven by the strength of our new furniture offerings and SKU additions to core. Also, the brand continues to see strength in proprietary seasonal offerings. In Q3, we launched Thanksgiving and holiday, representing the biggest offer of seasonal products this year and we are pleased with early reads. The customer is responding to innovation and newness in key collections and our easy decorating updates for the home. We believe there are no lifestyle brands in the market that have seasonal decorating and entertaining offerings like ours. This is a competitive advantage for Pottery Barn that is highly relevant and uniquely positions us in the industry, especially in the fourth quarter. The Pottery Barn children's business ran at 3.8% comp in Q3, marking its third consecutive quarter of positive comps. We saw widespread comp improvement in the quarter with all divisions of the business delivering positive comps with particular strength in the areas of textile and decor. Innovation across our product offering has been key to delivering growth in our kids business. In the quarter, compelling new product introductions in our fall and holiday assortments drove a significant portion of our comp growth. We are seeing success with new furniture, fresh bedding and kid-friendly products to celebrate the holidays. One particular highlight was our success with product collaboration, which has been a strategic focus. We have grown our collections with key partners and are delighted to expand our successful Chris Loves Julia line to span all of the Pottery Barn brands. We also see continued strength in our trending LoveShackFancy partnership. As we look to holiday and the quarters ahead, we have a robust pipeline of new products, exciting partnerships and channel innovation to fuel continued growth. Now, let's review West Elm. West Elm ran a negative 3.5% comp in Q3, a significant improvement from Q2. While macroeconomic factors continue to impact overall consumer demand for furniture, West Elm is proving that, good innovative product will always resonate. Fall newness drove double-digits positive comps and furniture newness in particular was strong. Holiday, which is West Elm's biggest season of new product intros this year is also off to a strong start, with double-digits positive comps in seasonal textiles, kids and furniture. Additionally, West Elm launched a very exciting kids collaboration with fashion pacemaker and children's book author, Eva Chen, in September. The collection bright fashion colors, multifunctional furniture and novelty pieces are driving sales. This collab has secured articles and publications like vogue.com, Architectural Digest, Forbes and New York Magazine. The brand also launched the Halloween capsule collection with Christina Ricci, who was popular with press, our customers and the actresses' large social following. We are thrilled with the momentum we're seeing in the West Elm business, especially the positive trends and newness and exciting collaboration. Now, let's talk about Williams-Sonoma. The Williams-Sonoma brand was essentially flat in Q3. The brand continues to focus on new, exclusive and innovative product offerings. Strength continues in high ticket items in electrics, especially espresso machines and stand mixers. Also tabletop is strong. At the Williams-Sonoma brand, we celebrate great design and quality. We are thrilled to see the consumer and media response to the launch of the new Evergreen KitchenAid mixer. Our customers were quick to embrace the new green base and wood bowl design evolution of the KitchenAid mixer, an item iconic to the Williams-Sonoma brand. The business also benefited from several key collaboration launches in Q3, including the launch of new cookware additions to the popular Stanley Tucci for Green Pan collection, a food collaboration with the world famous Chef, Jean-Georges and the launch of our Thanksgiving partnership with Ina Garten. Ina is on the cover of this year's Thanksgiving catalog, which features an exclusive look at her Thanksgiving menu, recipes and hosting tips. Our team is also proud to be supporting Ina, as the exclusive bookseller on a five city book tour. In addition to her tour, Williams-Sonoma held more than 50 cookbook signings and events in Q3, posting top chefs, influencers and popular celebrities like Bobby Flay, Al Roker and Eva Longoria in our stores. As I said, the tabletop business was also strong in Q3 as people were gearing up for the holiday season and prioritizing eating at home. Williams-Sonoma has launched a robust part of entertaining content marketing campaign designed to drive growth by teaching our customers how to set a table, stock a bar and host a party. We're also encouraged by the improvement of the Williams-Sonoma Home business with expanded products across categories. We've recently launched a collaboration with artist and designer Josh Young, whose beautiful collection for Williams-Sonoma Home features products inspired by popular original art. Now, I'd like to update you on our other initiatives. Business-to-business continues its momentum delivering its largest quarter history-to-date. The business grew 9% in Q3 with contract growing 17%, while trade grew 4%. The contract business represented 36% of the B2B business in the quarter. Project and partner wins this quarter include JW Marriott, Las Vegas, Ritz-Carlton, Papagayo, office projects for Google and Sony, along with our continued work with Sunrise Senior Living, related companies, Hanover and SpringHill Suites. As we move into Q4, we are excited to be ramping up our corporate gifting program along with focusing on our strategic growth opportunities and pipeline development to support our continued growth moving into FY2025 and beyond. Now, I'd like to talk about our global business. We're pleased to report strong results across key markets including Canada, Mexico and India. In Canada, our strong performance across all brands was driven in our design business, B2B and successful Thanksgiving season. In Mexico, our brands continue to gain market share, due to our unique product and service offerings and we are well positioned for a strong holiday season. We're excited to expand our presence with four new store openings in Mexico for West Elm, Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids in early 2025. Our business in India is also growing, demonstrating strength in our design services and an increase in decorating during the festive season. We'll be opening two additional West Elm stores in India during the first quarter of 2025. In the UK, we have renewed our partnership with John Lewis for the West Elm and Pottery Barn Kids brands, and we're also proud to be selling Williams-Sonoma products inside Fortnum & Mason this holiday season. Initial sales are promising and we look forward to the opportunities these partnerships present for enhancing our marketing and brand awareness in this market and around the globe. Lastly, I'd like to update you on our emerging brands. Rejuvenation continued to have strong performance with another quarter of double-digits growth. We are seeing success with both consumer and trade customers. The brand offers high-quality exclusively designed products for your home remodel or refresh and the trend of home updates, particularly in kitchen and bathroom continues and we have increased our assortments and in store presence of these categories. We're also seeing success in furniture and textiles at Rejuvenation. At Mark and Graham, we launched two new incremental businesses in the fall season, Mark and Graham Kids and Mark and Grahama Wedding Shoppe, both of which our customers responded well to. Also the brand just launched their holiday gifting collection with many new in house designed gifts. And we are thrilled to roll out our new collection, Bark and Graham for all of our pet lovers. Please go online and check it out. And finally, GreenRow, our newest brand continues to show strong growth with its unique collection of thoughtfully sourced vintage inspired furnishings. In October, GreenRow launched its first holiday collection with handcrafted and upcycled gifts and decor. The brand continues to inspire with its innovative use of materials and bright optimistic colors. We're excited to continue to grow GreenRow and look forward to new products and partnerships in the coming months. In summary, we're proud of our continued strong results and outperformance at Williams-Sonoma Inc. Our strategy of focusing on returning to growth, enhancing our world-class customer service and driving earnings is working. As we head into the last quarter of the year, we are optimistic and confident. Our stores are set, the music is on, the lights are twinkling and you can smell the aroma of the holidays. This is the time of year when we shine and we welcome you to come visit us at any location. And we sincerely wish you and your family a very happy Thanksgiving next week. Before I hand it over to Jeff, I also want to take a minute to say thank you to our teams, our vendors and all of our partners for their continued dedication and contributions to our company's performance. We are grateful for all of you. And with that, I will turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers and our outlook in more detail.\nJeff Howie: Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. We're proud to report results that surpassed expectations on both the top and the bottom-line, marked by sequential improvement in top-line trends, ongoing market share gains and robust earnings performance. Our results this quarter reinforced the five key drivers underpinning our profitability. First, our e-commerce sales mix with its higher operating margin sustained at 66% of total revenues. Second, our retail optimization strategy delivering 3% less occupancy expense than last year, inclusive of additional technology and supply chain investments. Third, our emphasis on full price selling contributed to our 130 basis point improvement to last year in merchandise margin, even as we gained market share. Fourth, our ongoing opportunity to achieve cost savings from supply chain efficiency, producing a 100 basis point improvement to last year in selling margin. And fifth, our ability to control costs to manage our bottom line profitability. Our results this quarter demonstrate the flexibility, strength and durability of our operating model to drive market share gains and deliver highly profitable earnings in almost any environment. Now, let's dive into the numbers. I'll start with our Q3 results and then provide an update on guidance for 2024. Net revenues finished above expectation, coming in at $1.8 billion with a comp of negative 2.9%. We gained market share, as we outperformed the industry, which declined by approximately 7%, even as we continued to reduce our overall level of promotion in the quarter. Our Q3 comps improved in Q2, reflected a better performance in furniture and continued growth in our non-furniture category. From a cadence perspective, our trends across the quarter were choppy, reflecting the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Moving down to income statement. Gross margin exceeded expectations, coming in at 46.7%, 230 basis points higher than last year. There were three drivers behind this improvement: merchandise margins, supply chain efficiencies and occupancy costs. Let's start with merchandise margins, which improved 130 basis points to last year. This improvement was driven by lower input costs and our commitment to full price balance. Next, supply chain efficiencies contribute 100 basis points to the year-over-year improvement in gross margin. We continue to realize cost savings across the supply chain, driven by more consistent operations from less promotional excellence. These savings are reflected in improved efficiencies in manufacturing, warehousing and delivery expense. More importantly, these operational gains are enhancing our customer service. Key metrics including returns, accommodations, damages, replacements, out-of-market shipping and multiple deliveries per order are all better than pre-pandemic levels. And finally, occupancy costs, which were down 3% from last year and flat as a percent of revenue. We continue to see our retail optimization strategy deliver leverage in retail occupancy offset by our investments in our world-class technology and our supply chain. Overall, our higher gross margin this quarter exceeded our expectations. Turning now to SG&A, which came in at 28.9% of revenue or 150 basis points higher than last year from higher employment expense and advertising spend, partially offset by lower general expenses. Employment expense was 160 basis points higher year-over-year, mostly from higher performance based incentive compensation due to our strong EPS performance and from higher employee benefits costs during the quarter. Advertising expense deleveraged 20 basis points, as we continued to invest in the higher levels of ad spend. Our advertising model is a powerful competitive advantage. Our multi brand portfolio allows us to test the ROAS of our incremental spending, while our hands on approach maximizes the effectiveness of our investment and keeps valuable insights in house. General expenses leveraged 30 basis points from timing of administrative expenses. On the bottom line, our earnings exceeded expectations. Operating income came in at $321 million, up 2% to last year. Operating margin finished at 17.8%, which was 80 basis points above last year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.96, up $0.13 or 7% better than last year. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $827 million with no debt outstanding. This was after we both invested $83 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth and we returned $606 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividend. Speaking of share repurchases, year-to-date, we have repurchased $707 million or 4% of our outstanding shares. Merchandise inventory ended the quarter at $1.45 billion, up 3.8% to last year. Our inventory levels are well-positioned to support the upcoming holiday season and our inventory levels are up only 15%, compared to 2019 with revenues up 25% over that time period. Summing up our Q3 results, we're proud to have delivered another quarter of results that exceeded expectations. I'd like to thank our talented, dedicated team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. for their exceptional work in achieving these results. Now, let's turn to our '24 outlook. First, a reminder, that fiscal year 2024 is a 53 week year for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. so the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. We will report comps on a 53 week versus 53 week comparable basis. All other year-over-year comparisons will be 53 week versus 52 weeks. We anticipate the additional week will contribute 150 basis points to revenue on the year and 10 basis points to annual operating margin, both of which are embedded in our guidance. Now, let's talk to our updated guidance. We are raising our full year guidance to reflect our strong Q3 results and our optimism about Q4 with our improving furniture trends and the strong performance of seasonal products all year. However, considering the holiday calendarships, economic uncertainty and slow housing markets, our guidance contemplates a range of possible outcomes. On the top-line, we are raising our full year '24 net revenue guidance to be in the range of down 3% to down 1.5% with comps between down 4.5% to down 3%. The midpoint of our guide reflects the continuation of Q3 trends into Q4. We believe the high-end of our guide implies a strong holiday season and the low-end of our guide reflects the potential for a greater impact from the macroeconomic environment on our Q4 results. On the bottom-line, we are raising our full year operating margin guidance 40 basis points, based upon our Q3 outperformance. With the 40 basis point increase, our full year '24 operating margin will now be in the range of 18.4% to 18.8%, which includes a 60 basis point benefit from the full year impact from the Q1 2024 out of period adjustment. Without the Q1 out of period adjustment, our full year operating margin will now be in the range of 17.8% to 18.2%. We continue to anticipate our Q4 operating margins will be materially in line with 2023 results, without the benefit of the 53rd week on the quarter. Additionally, we expect our full year interest income to be approximately $50 million and our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. Turning to our 2024 capital allocation plan, we anticipate investing $250 million in capital expenditures to support the long-term growth of our business. Of this amount, 75% will be focused on strengthening our e-commerce leadership and enhancing our supply chain efficiency. As we communicated quarterly, we're committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We will continue to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share. In conjunction with our earnings release today, we announced that our Board of Directors has approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Combined with our existing authorization, we now have nearly $1.3 billion in share repurchase authorization available to opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns for our shareholders. Wrapping up Laura's and my comments on Q3. We're proud to deliver results exceeding expectations on both the top and the bottom-line. For the remainder of '24, we're focused on our three key priorities: returning to growth, elevating our world-class customer service and driving earnings. We're confident the flexibility, strength and durability of our business model will drive market share gains and deliver highly profitable earnings in almost any environment. As we look beyond '24, we will provide guidance for fiscal year '25 in March as per our standard practice. Looking further into the future, we are reiterating our long-term guidance of mid to high single-digits revenue growth with operating margin in the mid to high teens. We're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these five reasons that remain consistent. Our ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishings industry, the strength of our in house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first, but not digital only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet. With that, I'll open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Cristina Fernandez with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.\nCristina Fernandez: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about the trends you saw in the quarter, particularly in furniture. It seemed like seasonal and small ticket is working really well. Furniture, Laura, you commented that it was slightly better. So can you talk about what you're seeing there? And any signs that the consumer is starting to want to spend a bit more on big ticket furniture items?\nLaura Alber: Sure. It's really hard to know exactly what's going on with the consumer, but our opinion is they're probably a little bit better off than everybody thinks, especially our consumer. And we are a lot more than just a furniture brand, as we've talked about. We're life stage brands. We're lifestyle brands. And we've seen the best results in those businesses like our kids business. Look at those comps and that's less related to housing, of course. We also have seen really good results all year on our seasonal assortments, which is exciting going into the holidays and partially why we're so optimistic about this quarter for us. We did see furniture improve slightly in West Elm and Pottery Barn across the board. And we're seeing also our newness really work, which is great news for us because when you bring in a new furniture collection and it works, generally you only bring it in maybe one item. So you might just bring in the coffee table, and when you see that look sell, you can expand that out into a whole franchise of a collection that will yield really good, non-comp newness for years to come.\nCristina Fernandez: And then, my follow-up is for Jeff. On the operating margin, this quarter you guided to flat, it came in a lot better. Where was the upside and why would that not continue in the fourth quarter with the better sales outlook?\nJeff Howie: Good morning, Christina and thanks for asking that question. I know it's probably on top of everybody's mind. But look, Q3 operating margin exceeded expectations for three reasons. First, merchandise margins were stronger than we anticipated, really driven by lower input costs and our focus on full price selling. I think Laura touched on this. We continue to see a positive customer response to our consistent pricing, our focus on selling and service and the newness and the breadth of product assortment that we offer. Second, the supply chain efficiencies, which I've been talking about all year, also came in better attributable to our commitment to full price selling, really smoothing out the peaks and troughs driven by promotional activity. This is delivering significant cost savings for more consistent operations across manufacturing, warehousing and delivery expenses and have to really complement our entire supply chain organization for their diligence and really the way they've attacked the supply chain and really gone after these cost savings. The third thing on why we beat the op margin in the quarter is, we deleveraged advertising expense less in Q2 than in Q1. We continue to evaluate that spend and adjust weekly as we see the effectiveness. And I think it's the Q3 results is really a testimony to how we continue to deliver strong profitability despite the tough environment for home furnishings. As far as the second part of your question is, why wouldn't that continue into Q2?\nLaura Alber: Q4.\nJeff Howie: Thank you. Q4. Our guidance is based upon the facts and trends we know today. And there is a few factors in Q4 that make it very unusual. The first one is the holiday calendar shifts. And you hear us talk about that today. With the late Thanksgiving and the shorter holiday shopping period, it makes reading the business really difficult. And then, the second piece is we started lapping the reduction in promos, there's less upside than it was in prior quarters. Finally, our guide reflects the potential for greater impact in the environment in the slow housing market. But, here's the thing, we guide top-line revenues and bottom-line operating margin because it gives us the flexibility to respond to any changes in the business. To the extent there might be an upside in one line, we'll take a look and see where we might offset that in others. But it gives us the flexibility to pull levers, as the business ebbs and flows. As you've seen in Q3 and other quarters this year, we know the levers to pull to deliver results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Benedict: Thanks for taking the question. First, just, Laura, maybe a little bit more on your approach to marketing and promo this holiday. Consumers have been responding, at least we're hearing from a lot of folks that they're responding more to promotions and events and that's been going on for some time, but maybe that's getting a little more pronounced of late. I know you guys are very tactical and strategic with how you use promotions. I'm just curious how you guys have planned this holiday relative to maybe last year and what you're kind of seeing from competitors in the space when it comes to promotions in this holiday season? That's my first question.\nLaura Alber: Okay, great. I don't know if you've been in our stores or in the malls, but there is no one, who has the holiday headquarters that we have from Thanksgiving to Christmas, Hanukkah, New Year, entertaining, decorating, gift giving. There's nobody who does that. That is a huge competitive advantage, when you go to the malls, and you go online that we have not just one category, but we have a fully integrated holiday assortment on top of incredible foundation of core and furniture and all the things that already exist in your house. And we show the customer how to put those things together. That is a big deal. It's very relevant particularly this year, as people are very excited about the holidays. We saw it in the beginning of the year from Easter to Halloween, now Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's still early, but that is something that, we said earlier in the year we're going to continue to flex as we knew that likely the furniture part of the business wasn't going to recover as soon as we thought. As it relates to pricing, let's just call it pricing versus promotions. We have an incredible sourcing platform. We have worked with vendors for decades. We design our own goods. We source them ourselves with our people overseas. And as a result, we get better prices. We have lots of loyalty. We have approachable prices with great quality. We know that. We've learned that many times in good business and in bad business. And we made the decision, as you know, to stop this up down pricing and this constant promotion. Once you're in that loop, you can't stop it, you have to comp it. And over the last several years, we have been reducing and reducing and reducing the level of promotions and it has been working. So the customer doesn't have to wait to see, if they're going to have a better price on that sofa in two weeks. They know the price is the price. But it's also incumbent on retailers like us to make sure that we give that great value the first time to the customers. So we think we're very, very competitively priced all in versus anyone with the same level of design and quality, which allows us to be less promotional. As Jeff said, we still have been reducing it every quarter. We have less of it to reduce as we lap these quarters, but there's still, opportunity to do a better job also in buying the winners and maximizing selling, because we're seeing great newness, results. And so, buying back into those things and when we buy back in getting better margins is another key part of our strategy.\nPeter Benedict: That's helpful. It kind of leads me to my next question, maybe for Jeff. I mean, you're talking about smoothing out demand and how that helps on the supply chain. Jeff, you mentioned some additional or further opportunities for efficiency and optimization as you look out going forward. If we maybe put the smoothing of demand aside, what are the other buckets that you see the most -- where you see the most opportunity? You've done such a great job so far on all that. Just curious kind of where the next leg of savings might lie.\nLaura Alber: So, just to talk about that, we have been delivering record customer service. This customer service has built tremendous brand loyalty. But we still have room to go in specific areas, where we need to be even more efficient. So we are drilling down in the supply chain in every hub, in every furniture area. And remember, we just did a full conversion out of one facility to another and that is at the beginning of that cycle. We did that this year, into our new Arizona DC out of our CMO building Sonoma Cove. That's a big deal. There's a lot of efficiency in some of those areas. We don't believe that we are done with supply chain efficiency. We have also some continued opportunity in occupancy, where we are continuing to close less profitable stores that are in old centers and move them to better lifestyle centers and also reduce in some cases some brands and increase others. And we've seen really good results from our remodels. Retail is back and we have been really honing our retail execution and our retail footprint. And our new stores are doing quite well. So that's another example of in the same size box, can we do more dollars per square foot? We believe we can. And that is also going to help us, with our occupancy leverage. In terms of ad costs, this is an area that is a strength of ours, and we use it competitively to gain share, both in the short-term and gain customers for the long-term. The work that we're doing with influencers and collaborators is driving brand heat and bringing new customers into brands and driving traffic to our stores. So you're going to continue to see us drive collaborations higher, which is really good to drive ad costs actually and also sales. Those are the big buckets. Payroll is obviously another very large bucket, and there's opportunity to both continue to be more efficient in areas in our company, but then also to fund other areas that we believe are sales driving and we're in the early innings of testing there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKate McShane: Hi, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on Cristina's earlier question with regards to furniture sales and just ask if you have a view on when furniture sales could stabilize and can furniture sales grow, just given some of the success that again you've seen with innovation and new product introduction, if housing turnover were to remain muted in 2025?\nLaura Alber: We're assuming housing turnover remains muted, which is why, we've been working so hard to improve our business despite it, okay? And you've seen us have consecutively improved our comps and we have improved our furniture comps too. There's no doubt, based on what we're seeing that there's opportunity to continue to improve them in my mind. We believe that the newness, the percent of newness to total will continue to yield better results for us in furniture, even if housing doesn't improve. Now if housing really collapses, obviously, that's not in our -- that's not something that is contemplated as huge collapse or a Black Swan event or something. But we think if it's a normalized environment, our operational execution, the things we can control will help us to improve our furniture business. On the flip side, you get big housing rebound, we'll see very good results in furniture. So I'm sorry that I don't have a date for you. I wish I did, but your guess is as good as mine of when housing turns around.\nKate McShane: Okay. Thank you. And then our second question was just around inventory. It looks like inventory grew about 3.8% in the quarter. We wondered if there was any pull forward that you did in anticipation of some of the noise that was going on with regards to the port strike. And I know there's still a lot of uncertainty around tariffs, but now that we are through the election, could you remind us, how you're thinking about operating in a higher tariff environment and how much you can mitigate?\nJeff Howie: Yes. Thanks, Kate. Yes, our inventory at the end of the quarter was up 4% to last year. Notably, our inventory levels are only up 15% versus 2019 compared with revenue growth of over 25% of that time. In terms of your question about did we pull forward some regarding the port strike activity, that wasn't really a big factor for us. This is really about getting well-positioned for holiday and being in stock. If you've been in any of our stores, you've been on the website, you can see that we're in stock and we're well-positioned for holiday. That's reflected in the guidance ranges that we provided. In terms of China tariffs and our outlook on that, first, there's a lot of uncertainty in terms of what's happening there. Just want to remind everyone that it's not our first time at this. We've always been a leader and proactively responded to changes in the trade environment. There's a lot of change since the last time this came up. First, we've significantly reduced our China sourced goods from 50% to 25% over the last few years. So exposure is significantly less than the last time in 2018 that we saw this activity. Second, and I think this is something that we don't talk enough about, the U.S. is already a major manufacturing hub for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Much of our upholstery is manufactured domestically at our facilities in North Carolina and Mississippi. Our lighting from Rejuvenation is manufactured in Oregon and a large portion of the Williams-Sonoma assortment is produced domestically. In Peppermint Bark, everyone's favorite ski this time of the year is made here in the San Francisco Bay Area. Third, we're prepared to reduce our exports to China further if tariffs increase. We've mapped out a category-by-category plan to reduce China sourcing if conditions warrant and we're currently evaluating and quantifying the impact from additional tariffs. We have a wide range of mitigation options. In fact, everything is on the table. We'll probably move some things to other countries we may at some point in '25 front load some goods. I'm sure the vendors will pay some and there may be some that the consumers absorb as well. But that is really a lot of uncertainty right now. We're working through that. And as the landscape changes, we have the scale and strategy to pivot. But here's a really big strategic thing that I want you to take away and that is our vertically integrated supply chain is a competitive advantage. 90% of the products we sell our proprietary design and exclusively made for our brands. We operate our own in-house, best-in-class global sourcing operation with 12 overseas offices, it's our own boots on the ground managing sourcing decisions, production and shipping. We are the 11th largest container importer in the United States, so we have scale and relationships. Others do not. Punch line being as the tariff landscape changes, we have the scale and strategy to pivot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies.\nJonathan Matuszewski : Good morning. The first one was on newness. I hear that it's contributing to the sales [indiscernible] here. Frame the magnitude of unit introduce this year maybe relative to last? And any aspirations for kind of the magnitude of new collections you bring '25? That's my first question.\nLaura Alber : Great, Jonathan. Yes, newness and innovation are key parts of our strategy to return to growth in 2024, and we've seen a strong response to newness. I should say, 2024 and beyond. And West Elm has been really benefiting from the increase in newness across all categories, particularly in furniture and they've seen double-digit positive comps in their new furniture introductions. And they've also really increased substantially the amount of product in the holiday assortments, which is also an important opportunity for them. I've mentioned before that when you look at the scale of West Elm and then you compare the department to Pottery Barn percent to total, you see some clear areas of opportunity. And the non-furniture business is a big area of opportunity in West Elm. So we've been really pushing newness there. Pottery Barn is also seeing good responsiveness, especially in furniture and seasonal decorating, kids and team really seeing the big pop and baby and dorm and the collaborations that we brought and the new collaborations and building on LoveShackFancy have been seeing tremendous consumer response. And in Williams-Sonoma, the have premium electrics cookware newness and seasonal that's only found there and we've seen great results in Sonoma from our exciting holiday lineup and the newness that we brought in. So in terms of quantifying this, it's double-digit increases. It's across categories. It's a very competitive area. And the numbers, although they may be indicative of how important it is to us, it's more on the quality of the newness. So making sure that it's truly incremental newness and that we have reason to believe that it's going to work and not just getting over assorted. And I think we're really balancing that well, and it's going to be a key part of staying ahead and giving us pricing power to continually design our own products and bring them to market.\nJonathan Matuszewski : That's really helpful. And just a question on trade. Maybe you could update us on your approach there and how your business is continuing to make inroads. Looks like up mid-single digits this quarter, category down 7%. And so are you doing anything currently in terms of working designers to get their business and plan for the future?\nJeff Howie : Yes. Our trade business did grow 4% in the quarter and it's been up all year. And it's really a function of the outstanding performance that our retail teams have done engaging with the trade community. A lot of trade is the local interior designer that works with the designers within our stores. And we set out a goal early this year to really ask our store retail teams to reengage with that interior designer community. And to their credit, our retail teams have taken that off and they're doing a really good job. And that really explains the 4% increase in this quarter and why we're seeing that trade business pop a little bit. I think it's important to note that while trade is a component of the B2B business, it's really the contract side of the business that we are really excited about. And that had another outstanding quarter, growing 17% in Q3. And this accounts for about 36% of our overall volume in the quarter. And it's where we really have a competitive advantage and bringing the scale of our brand, the variety of assortment, our supply chain and really becoming a disruptor in that $80 billion business-to-business market, where we think we compete favorably and have a lot of opportunity to gain market share.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman : Hi, good morning, everyone. I'm going to ask about full price selling. I don't know if this is quantifiable, if we should be asking what -- I don't think you'll tell us what the mix is, but is that run rate accelerating? And does it ever reach a ceiling, the business will have a certain amount of product that gets sold on some type of clearance, I suppose? And is that run rate accelerating? And how much more ceiling do we have to go?\nLaura Alber : I'll just start by saying we're absolutely committed to the stance of running the business without promotional pricing. And we have continued to reduce the amount from last year. We have always said we'll take markdowns. We do take markdowns. And so of course, in a better sales environment, you'd have markdowns. You might actually have scarcity. So you could see that happen over time where we're actually chasing goods and there are less clearance goods. We are definitely seeing improvements in our regular priced comps, which is great and our clearance inventory is in great shape, too. As Jeff said, inventory is pretty clean. And we like that. That does mean that there's less clearance sales. And I will just point out that in Q3, there are some brands that had more promotional comp roll-off than others like Pottery Barn had more to cut than we would have liked. And we made the decision, as we've said before and we've said we're going to always choose to go after the operating earnings and to not go up-down pricing. And so I do expect that because we've reduced this kind of behavior, substantially, the go forward is going to be a lot cleaner and easier to understand for all of us.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Max Rakhlenko with TD Cowen.\nMax Rakhlenko : Great. Laura, in the past, I think that you've noted that your regular price business was outcomping your discounted or promoted business. Curious, did that occur this quarter once again? And why do you think this phenomenon is occurring and just the key learnings from that?\nLaura Alber : Yes, sure. Yes, that's true. Regular price is outperforming because we're reducing the promotional substantially. And as much as reduced the last year to the year before, we have continued to reduce it. And so as I said, it's good for margins, it's actually good for the customer because we don't have them having to wait. They can trust us on the pricing integrity.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom : Thanks very much. If we double click here on your cost of goods sold line, in the third quarter, you're roughly 42%, which is about 1,000 basis points better than where you were in the third quarter of 2019. I'm curious if it's possible to sort of unpack how much of that you see as structural? In other words, as we start to see the top line improve, which I think you all hope next year, how much of that can be sticky?\nJeff Howie : Chuck, we think a lot of it can be sticky. We're pretty confident in our operating margin. And I think it goes back to the five drivers I talked about and what's really happening within gross margin. E-commerce sales mix really at 66% is sustaining. I think everyone knows that we have a substantially higher operating margin and less occupancy expense in our e-commerce business. The retail optimization strategy, our second big driver is also kicking in. Again, elevating that the profitability of our retail chain and also comes with less occupancy. A big part of the improvement since 2019 has been our pricing power. That accounts for about 390 of the basis points of that about 1,000. And that comes from our merchandise margin team, the benefit of our focus on full price selling and the strength of our in-house design proprietary products. That obviously, given our results compared to the competition are resonating with consumers. And the last is the supply chain efficiencies. You've heard Laura and I talk about how all of our metrics or KPIs that we look at are performing better than pre-pandemic levels. And here, this is our own internal version of the 4 minute mile. If you're not familiar with that story, there's -- for years, it was thought that human beings couldn't run a 4 minute mile. It has even said there's no way that can happen. And as soon as one person was able to break it, everyone was able to run a 4 minute mile. Well, that's the same thing for us. For years, we thought that these -- KPIs had to run at a certain level and that's just the way our business ran. And post-pandemic, as we try to get back to those, we ask a simple question of why are those metrics at those levels. And to our supply chain team's credit, they said, well, we think we can do better. Laura and I said, yes, let's see you do that. And not only do they achieve those levels, but as soon as they go through those levels, they said, you know what, there's actually even more here. So this is an ongoing opportunity for us. And we think we're excited about what that can bring. I think the key point here is since 2019, we've transformed our profitability and can sustain these operating margins at a higher level.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel : Hi, good morning. So I want to go back to a couple of the prior questions just with regard to sales. So look, I mean, you've done a phenomenal job managing the business through what has been a difficult demand environment now for several quarters. So the comments they suggest you're starting to see some wins here, some better sales in certain categories. But if I look at the data in aggregate, your comps were down 2.9% in Q3 this versus -- down 3.3% in Q2. So I mean slightly better there. But on any stack basis, it seems like the business is actually decelerated. So I guess my question will be two-fold, mean, am I looking at the data correctly? But then second, what's the offset to those sort of -- what's keeping -- you're starting to see these better sales trends as you articulate, what's the offset keeping sales weak?\nLaura Alber : Well, I'd just say that we're not topping the probe is the first answer. And that definitely gave us some sales that you could pull forward, call them what you will but lower quality sales. And then secondly, furniture is still relatively weak, right? So as much as we're talking about improvements in furniture, and we have some categories that are positive, furniture has been weak. And so this is the opportunity. We've been focused on the areas we knew would be stronger, which are life stage pieces of our business and holiday decorating, but can you imagine what happens when the furniture picks up. And we've used the word coil spring about our platform. We have said that when this picks up, we've been doing. We've been focused on operating margin with a down sales environment. So can you imagine the kind of operating margin improvements we could have if sales pick up, even if there are some negatives next year, even if tariffs cost us something, even if there's other cost increases, there should be sales leverage on that operating margin.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore.\nOliver Wintermantel : Thanks very much. Maybe just to that point, Laura, your sales leverage, what kind of comp do you need to see to get some sales leverage on SG&A? And with your cost taken out over the last few years, how would that compare to pre-pandemics?\nLaura Alber : Yes. I mean, it's not a linear relationship. There's not like a box that one number goes in the other number comes out because there's a lot of choices. And so -- and you can't predict all the variables, you've seen it's like a game of life for a next thing you know you've got something new you have to deal with that you didn't expect and that you have to invest in -- and with growth, there's always different opportunities. You can be more competitive on ad comp. So we have a lot of brands here in different states, not all brands have the same operating margin. We may decide that push a few of our smaller brands heavier. And the most important thing of all I'd say is being competitive for our consumers. We want to give them the best quality, the best designs at the best value. And we think we fit the sweet spot of the industry with what we're doing, which is why I think we have better results. Because they love our product. I mean, there's all these things that we talk about on these calls that end of the day the customer votes, right? And they go based on what they see and what the price is. And we've built this loyalty over years that makes them come back. They trust us to shop online on big ticket. A lot of people can't get them to do that. But because they see our stores in their minds eye, they can sit on the self-op, they will pull the trigger and buy it online. And that is something that not a lot of people can say because of our channel excellence and our customer service, we have built up so much goodwill with our customers that's been so important to driving our results even in a tough environment.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Laura Alber for closing remarks.\nLaura Alber : Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you all, again, for joining our call this morning. And all of us here at Williams-Sonoma wish you a very enjoyable holiday season. And of course, as I like to say, please go into our stores and happy shopping. We'll talk again in March. Thank you.\nOperator: That will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call. At Williams-Sonoma Inc., we continue to have strong performance exceeding both top and bottom-line expectations. The third quarter was driven by continued improvement in our sales trends, market share gains and strong profit. Our comp came in at down 2.9% with an operating margin of 17.8%, delivering a 7% increase in earnings per share to $1.96. Also, we bought back $533 million of our stock this quarter and have purchased 4% of our shares outstanding so far this year. Our operating results reflect the operational improvements that we have been focused on all year and the strength of our margin profile. Even in a difficult environment, our initiatives continue to gain momentum and we are optimistic and confident about our business. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year revenues to come in at a range of down 3% to down 1.5% and we are raising our guidance on operating margin 40 basis points to be in the range of 17.8% to 18.2%. And due to our confidence in our business model and our ability to perform in almost any environment, our Board has approved an additional $1 billion stock repurchase authorization. We continue to be focused on our three key priorities. First, returning to growth. Second, elevating our world-class customer service. And third, driving earnings. Let's start first with returning to growth. Our top-line trend improved over Q2 and even though we ran negative in Q3, we outperformed the industry decline of 7% this quarter. Our better-than-industry performance is a result of our focus on innovation from our products to our design services. We set ourselves apart from the competition with our unique in house design capabilities and vertically-integrated sourcing organization, which gives us the ability to offer high-quality products at compelling price points. It is this price-value balance that allows us to continue to significantly reduce our promotional activity. On the design front, we have been innovating and preparing for the next generation of design services. The new tools that we have launched assist our customers with developing design plans for any size or style of home. In October, we also launched our Shop by Style and Design Boards in Pottery Barn, allowing customers to create and share mood boards online. The next key component of our return to growth strategy is our commitment to improving our channel experiences. We are continuously investing in our proprietary e-commerce technology. We are actively incorporating AI into our capabilities in areas like personalized e-mails and home pages and supply chain decision making. From product discovery and selection to personalization, content, customer care and the final mile, our team is constantly thinking about how to elevate and evolve our best-in-class e-commerce experience. And we are pleased with the strong performance in our retail stores. We have continued to improve our in store experience with inspiring new products, improved in stock inventory levels and next level design services and events. Our retail optimization strategy is working. Our new store locations and designs are driving good ROI and we see continued opportunities to transform our store fleet to be positioned in the most profitable and inspiring locations. Now, let's talk through progress on our second and third key priorities. We continue to make progress improving our world class customer service, which in turn drives earnings and contributes to our strong operating results. Our customer service metrics have improved since Q2 and are all time record levels. Our supply chain team continues to reduce costs by limiting out-of-market and multiple shipments, reducing customer accommodations, lowering returns and damages and reducing replacements. And despite the progress we have already made, we see more margin opportunity ahead, as we continue to drill down on areas for additional optimization and efficiency. Now, I'd like to update you on the performance of our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 7.5% comp in Q3. In the brand, we saw improved furniture performance during the quarter. Also, fall new launches were up to last year, driven by the strength of our new furniture offerings and SKU additions to core. Also, the brand continues to see strength in proprietary seasonal offerings. In Q3, we launched Thanksgiving and holiday, representing the biggest offer of seasonal products this year and we are pleased with early reads. The customer is responding to innovation and newness in key collections and our easy decorating updates for the home. We believe there are no lifestyle brands in the market that have seasonal decorating and entertaining offerings like ours. This is a competitive advantage for Pottery Barn that is highly relevant and uniquely positions us in the industry, especially in the fourth quarter. The Pottery Barn children's business ran at 3.8% comp in Q3, marking its third consecutive quarter of positive comps. We saw widespread comp improvement in the quarter with all divisions of the business delivering positive comps with particular strength in the areas of textile and decor. Innovation across our product offering has been key to delivering growth in our kids business. In the quarter, compelling new product introductions in our fall and holiday assortments drove a significant portion of our comp growth. We are seeing success with new furniture, fresh bedding and kid-friendly products to celebrate the holidays. One particular highlight was our success with product collaboration, which has been a strategic focus. We have grown our collections with key partners and are delighted to expand our successful Chris Loves Julia line to span all of the Pottery Barn brands. We also see continued strength in our trending LoveShackFancy partnership. As we look to holiday and the quarters ahead, we have a robust pipeline of new products, exciting partnerships and channel innovation to fuel continued growth. Now, let's review West Elm. West Elm ran a negative 3.5% comp in Q3, a significant improvement from Q2. While macroeconomic factors continue to impact overall consumer demand for furniture, West Elm is proving that, good innovative product will always resonate. Fall newness drove double-digits positive comps and furniture newness in particular was strong. Holiday, which is West Elm's biggest season of new product intros this year is also off to a strong start, with double-digits positive comps in seasonal textiles, kids and furniture. Additionally, West Elm launched a very exciting kids collaboration with fashion pacemaker and children's book author, Eva Chen, in September. The collection bright fashion colors, multifunctional furniture and novelty pieces are driving sales. This collab has secured articles and publications like vogue.com, Architectural Digest, Forbes and New York Magazine. The brand also launched the Halloween capsule collection with Christina Ricci, who was popular with press, our customers and the actresses' large social following. We are thrilled with the momentum we're seeing in the West Elm business, especially the positive trends and newness and exciting collaboration. Now, let's talk about Williams-Sonoma. The Williams-Sonoma brand was essentially flat in Q3. The brand continues to focus on new, exclusive and innovative product offerings. Strength continues in high ticket items in electrics, especially espresso machines and stand mixers. Also tabletop is strong. At the Williams-Sonoma brand, we celebrate great design and quality. We are thrilled to see the consumer and media response to the launch of the new Evergreen KitchenAid mixer. Our customers were quick to embrace the new green base and wood bowl design evolution of the KitchenAid mixer, an item iconic to the Williams-Sonoma brand. The business also benefited from several key collaboration launches in Q3, including the launch of new cookware additions to the popular Stanley Tucci for Green Pan collection, a food collaboration with the world famous Chef, Jean-Georges and the launch of our Thanksgiving partnership with Ina Garten. Ina is on the cover of this year's Thanksgiving catalog, which features an exclusive look at her Thanksgiving menu, recipes and hosting tips. Our team is also proud to be supporting Ina, as the exclusive bookseller on a five city book tour. In addition to her tour, Williams-Sonoma held more than 50 cookbook signings and events in Q3, posting top chefs, influencers and popular celebrities like Bobby Flay, Al Roker and Eva Longoria in our stores. As I said, the tabletop business was also strong in Q3 as people were gearing up for the holiday season and prioritizing eating at home. Williams-Sonoma has launched a robust part of entertaining content marketing campaign designed to drive growth by teaching our customers how to set a table, stock a bar and host a party. We're also encouraged by the improvement of the Williams-Sonoma Home business with expanded products across categories. We've recently launched a collaboration with artist and designer Josh Young, whose beautiful collection for Williams-Sonoma Home features products inspired by popular original art. Now, I'd like to update you on our other initiatives. Business-to-business continues its momentum delivering its largest quarter history-to-date. The business grew 9% in Q3 with contract growing 17%, while trade grew 4%. The contract business represented 36% of the B2B business in the quarter. Project and partner wins this quarter include JW Marriott, Las Vegas, Ritz-Carlton, Papagayo, office projects for Google and Sony, along with our continued work with Sunrise Senior Living, related companies, Hanover and SpringHill Suites. As we move into Q4, we are excited to be ramping up our corporate gifting program along with focusing on our strategic growth opportunities and pipeline development to support our continued growth moving into FY2025 and beyond. Now, I'd like to talk about our global business. We're pleased to report strong results across key markets including Canada, Mexico and India. In Canada, our strong performance across all brands was driven in our design business, B2B and successful Thanksgiving season. In Mexico, our brands continue to gain market share, due to our unique product and service offerings and we are well positioned for a strong holiday season. We're excited to expand our presence with four new store openings in Mexico for West Elm, Pottery Barn and Pottery Barn Kids in early 2025. Our business in India is also growing, demonstrating strength in our design services and an increase in decorating during the festive season. We'll be opening two additional West Elm stores in India during the first quarter of 2025. In the UK, we have renewed our partnership with John Lewis for the West Elm and Pottery Barn Kids brands, and we're also proud to be selling Williams-Sonoma products inside Fortnum & Mason this holiday season. Initial sales are promising and we look forward to the opportunities these partnerships present for enhancing our marketing and brand awareness in this market and around the globe. Lastly, I'd like to update you on our emerging brands. Rejuvenation continued to have strong performance with another quarter of double-digits growth. We are seeing success with both consumer and trade customers. The brand offers high-quality exclusively designed products for your home remodel or refresh and the trend of home updates, particularly in kitchen and bathroom continues and we have increased our assortments and in store presence of these categories. We're also seeing success in furniture and textiles at Rejuvenation. At Mark and Graham, we launched two new incremental businesses in the fall season, Mark and Graham Kids and Mark and Grahama Wedding Shoppe, both of which our customers responded well to. Also the brand just launched their holiday gifting collection with many new in house designed gifts. And we are thrilled to roll out our new collection, Bark and Graham for all of our pet lovers. Please go online and check it out. And finally, GreenRow, our newest brand continues to show strong growth with its unique collection of thoughtfully sourced vintage inspired furnishings. In October, GreenRow launched its first holiday collection with handcrafted and upcycled gifts and decor. The brand continues to inspire with its innovative use of materials and bright optimistic colors. We're excited to continue to grow GreenRow and look forward to new products and partnerships in the coming months. In summary, we're proud of our continued strong results and outperformance at Williams-Sonoma Inc. Our strategy of focusing on returning to growth, enhancing our world-class customer service and driving earnings is working. As we head into the last quarter of the year, we are optimistic and confident. Our stores are set, the music is on, the lights are twinkling and you can smell the aroma of the holidays. This is the time of year when we shine and we welcome you to come visit us at any location. And we sincerely wish you and your family a very happy Thanksgiving next week. Before I hand it over to Jeff, I also want to take a minute to say thank you to our teams, our vendors and all of our partners for their continued dedication and contributions to our company's performance. We are grateful for all of you. And with that, I will turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers and our outlook in more detail. Sure. It's really hard to know exactly what's going on with the consumer, but our opinion is they're probably a little bit better off than everybody thinks, especially our consumer. And we are a lot more than just a furniture brand, as we've talked about. We're life stage brands. We're lifestyle brands. And we've seen the best results in those businesses like our kids business. Look at those comps and that's less related to housing, of course. We also have seen really good results all year on our seasonal assortments, which is exciting going into the holidays and partially why we're so optimistic about this quarter for us. We did see furniture improve slightly in West Elm and Pottery Barn across the board. And we're seeing also our newness really work, which is great news for us because when you bring in a new furniture collection and it works, generally you only bring it in maybe one item. So you might just bring in the coffee table, and when you see that look sell, you can expand that out into a whole franchise of a collection that will yield really good, non-comp newness for years to come. Q4. Okay, great. I don't know if you've been in our stores or in the malls, but there is no one, who has the holiday headquarters that we have from Thanksgiving to Christmas, Hanukkah, New Year, entertaining, decorating, gift giving. There's nobody who does that. That is a huge competitive advantage, when you go to the malls, and you go online that we have not just one category, but we have a fully integrated holiday assortment on top of incredible foundation of core and furniture and all the things that already exist in your house. And we show the customer how to put those things together. That is a big deal. It's very relevant particularly this year, as people are very excited about the holidays. We saw it in the beginning of the year from Easter to Halloween, now Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's still early, but that is something that, we said earlier in the year we're going to continue to flex as we knew that likely the furniture part of the business wasn't going to recover as soon as we thought. As it relates to pricing, let's just call it pricing versus promotions. We have an incredible sourcing platform. We have worked with vendors for decades. We design our own goods. We source them ourselves with our people overseas. And as a result, we get better prices. We have lots of loyalty. We have approachable prices with great quality. We know that. We've learned that many times in good business and in bad business. And we made the decision, as you know, to stop this up down pricing and this constant promotion. Once you're in that loop, you can't stop it, you have to comp it. And over the last several years, we have been reducing and reducing and reducing the level of promotions and it has been working. So the customer doesn't have to wait to see, if they're going to have a better price on that sofa in two weeks. They know the price is the price. But it's also incumbent on retailers like us to make sure that we give that great value the first time to the customers. So we think we're very, very competitively priced all in versus anyone with the same level of design and quality, which allows us to be less promotional. As Jeff said, we still have been reducing it every quarter. We have less of it to reduce as we lap these quarters, but there's still, opportunity to do a better job also in buying the winners and maximizing selling, because we're seeing great newness, results. And so, buying back into those things and when we buy back in getting better margins is another key part of our strategy. So, just to talk about that, we have been delivering record customer service. This customer service has built tremendous brand loyalty. But we still have room to go in specific areas, where we need to be even more efficient. So we are drilling down in the supply chain in every hub, in every furniture area. And remember, we just did a full conversion out of one facility to another and that is at the beginning of that cycle. We did that this year, into our new Arizona DC out of our CMO building Sonoma Cove. That's a big deal. There's a lot of efficiency in some of those areas. We don't believe that we are done with supply chain efficiency. We have also some continued opportunity in occupancy, where we are continuing to close less profitable stores that are in old centers and move them to better lifestyle centers and also reduce in some cases some brands and increase others. And we've seen really good results from our remodels. Retail is back and we have been really honing our retail execution and our retail footprint. And our new stores are doing quite well. So that's another example of in the same size box, can we do more dollars per square foot? We believe we can. And that is also going to help us, with our occupancy leverage. In terms of ad costs, this is an area that is a strength of ours, and we use it competitively to gain share, both in the short-term and gain customers for the long-term. The work that we're doing with influencers and collaborators is driving brand heat and bringing new customers into brands and driving traffic to our stores. So you're going to continue to see us drive collaborations higher, which is really good to drive ad costs actually and also sales. Those are the big buckets. Payroll is obviously another very large bucket, and there's opportunity to both continue to be more efficient in areas in our company, but then also to fund other areas that we believe are sales driving and we're in the early innings of testing there. We're assuming housing turnover remains muted, which is why, we've been working so hard to improve our business despite it, okay? And you've seen us have consecutively improved our comps and we have improved our furniture comps too. There's no doubt, based on what we're seeing that there's opportunity to continue to improve them in my mind. We believe that the newness, the percent of newness to total will continue to yield better results for us in furniture, even if housing doesn't improve. Now if housing really collapses, obviously, that's not in our -- that's not something that is contemplated as huge collapse or a Black Swan event or something. But we think if it's a normalized environment, our operational execution, the things we can control will help us to improve our furniture business. On the flip side, you get big housing rebound, we'll see very good results in furniture. So I'm sorry that I don't have a date for you. I wish I did, but your guess is as good as mine of when housing turns around. Great, Jonathan. Yes, newness and innovation are key parts of our strategy to return to growth in 2024, and we've seen a strong response to newness. I should say, 2024 and beyond. And West Elm has been really benefiting from the increase in newness across all categories, particularly in furniture and they've seen double-digit positive comps in their new furniture introductions. And they've also really increased substantially the amount of product in the holiday assortments, which is also an important opportunity for them. I've mentioned before that when you look at the scale of West Elm and then you compare the department to Pottery Barn percent to total, you see some clear areas of opportunity. And the non-furniture business is a big area of opportunity in West Elm. So we've been really pushing newness there. Pottery Barn is also seeing good responsiveness, especially in furniture and seasonal decorating, kids and team really seeing the big pop and baby and dorm and the collaborations that we brought and the new collaborations and building on LoveShackFancy have been seeing tremendous consumer response. And in Williams-Sonoma, the have premium electrics cookware newness and seasonal that's only found there and we've seen great results in Sonoma from our exciting holiday lineup and the newness that we brought in. So in terms of quantifying this, it's double-digit increases. It's across categories. It's a very competitive area. And the numbers, although they may be indicative of how important it is to us, it's more on the quality of the newness. So making sure that it's truly incremental newness and that we have reason to believe that it's going to work and not just getting over assorted. And I think we're really balancing that well, and it's going to be a key part of staying ahead and giving us pricing power to continually design our own products and bring them to market. I'll just start by saying we're absolutely committed to the stance of running the business without promotional pricing. And we have continued to reduce the amount from last year. We have always said we'll take markdowns. We do take markdowns. And so of course, in a better sales environment, you'd have markdowns. You might actually have scarcity. So you could see that happen over time where we're actually chasing goods and there are less clearance goods. We are definitely seeing improvements in our regular priced comps, which is great and our clearance inventory is in great shape, too. As Jeff said, inventory is pretty clean. And we like that. That does mean that there's less clearance sales. And I will just point out that in Q3, there are some brands that had more promotional comp roll-off than others like Pottery Barn had more to cut than we would have liked. And we made the decision, as we've said before and we've said we're going to always choose to go after the operating earnings and to not go up-down pricing. And so I do expect that because we've reduced this kind of behavior, substantially, the go forward is going to be a lot cleaner and easier to understand for all of us. Yes, sure. Yes, that's true. Regular price is outperforming because we're reducing the promotional substantially. And as much as reduced the last year to the year before, we have continued to reduce it. And so as I said, it's good for margins, it's actually good for the customer because we don't have them having to wait. They can trust us on the pricing integrity. Well, I'd just say that we're not topping the probe is the first answer. And that definitely gave us some sales that you could pull forward, call them what you will but lower quality sales. And then secondly, furniture is still relatively weak, right? So as much as we're talking about improvements in furniture, and we have some categories that are positive, furniture has been weak. And so this is the opportunity. We've been focused on the areas we knew would be stronger, which are life stage pieces of our business and holiday decorating, but can you imagine what happens when the furniture picks up. And we've used the word coil spring about our platform. We have said that when this picks up, we've been doing. We've been focused on operating margin with a down sales environment. So can you imagine the kind of operating margin improvements we could have if sales pick up, even if there are some negatives next year, even if tariffs cost us something, even if there's other cost increases, there should be sales leverage on that operating margin. Yes. I mean, it's not a linear relationship. There's not like a box that one number goes in the other number comes out because there's a lot of choices. And so -- and you can't predict all the variables, you've seen it's like a game of life for a next thing you know you've got something new you have to deal with that you didn't expect and that you have to invest in -- and with growth, there's always different opportunities. You can be more competitive on ad comp. So we have a lot of brands here in different states, not all brands have the same operating margin. We may decide that push a few of our smaller brands heavier. And the most important thing of all I'd say is being competitive for our consumers. We want to give them the best quality, the best designs at the best value. And we think we fit the sweet spot of the industry with what we're doing, which is why I think we have better results. Because they love our product. I mean, there's all these things that we talk about on these calls that end of the day the customer votes, right? And they go based on what they see and what the price is. And we've built this loyalty over years that makes them come back. They trust us to shop online on big ticket. A lot of people can't get them to do that. But because they see our stores in their minds eye, they can sit on the self-op, they will pull the trigger and buy it online. And that is something that not a lot of people can say because of our channel excellence and our customer service, we have built up so much goodwill with our customers that's been so important to driving our results even in a tough environment. Okay. Well, thank you. Thank you all, again, for joining our call this morning. And all of us here at Williams-Sonoma wish you a very enjoyable holiday season.

            "name": "Jeff Howie",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. We're proud to report results that surpassed expectations on both the top and the bottom-line, marked by sequential improvement in top-line trends, ongoing market share gains and robust earnings performance. Our results this quarter reinforced the five key drivers underpinning our profitability. First, our e-commerce sales mix with its higher operating margin sustained at 66% of total revenues. Second, our retail optimization strategy delivering 3% less occupancy expense than last year, inclusive of additional technology and supply chain investments. Third, our emphasis on full price selling contributed to our 130 basis point improvement to last year in merchandise margin, even as we gained market share. Fourth, our ongoing opportunity to achieve cost savings from supply chain efficiency, producing a 100 basis point improvement to last year in selling margin. And fifth, our ability to control costs to manage our bottom line profitability. Our results this quarter demonstrate the flexibility, strength and durability of our operating model to drive market share gains and deliver highly profitable earnings in almost any environment. Now, let's dive into the numbers. I'll start with our Q3 results and then provide an update on guidance for 2024. Net revenues finished above expectation, coming in at $1.8 billion with a comp of negative 2.9%. We gained market share, as we outperformed the industry, which declined by approximately 7%, even as we continued to reduce our overall level of promotion in the quarter. Our Q3 comps improved in Q2, reflected a better performance in furniture and continued growth in our non-furniture category. From a cadence perspective, our trends across the quarter were choppy, reflecting the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Moving down to income statement. Gross margin exceeded expectations, coming in at 46.7%, 230 basis points higher than last year. There were three drivers behind this improvement: merchandise margins, supply chain efficiencies and occupancy costs. Let's start with merchandise margins, which improved 130 basis points to last year. This improvement was driven by lower input costs and our commitment to full price balance. Next, supply chain efficiencies contribute 100 basis points to the year-over-year improvement in gross margin. We continue to realize cost savings across the supply chain, driven by more consistent operations from less promotional excellence. These savings are reflected in improved efficiencies in manufacturing, warehousing and delivery expense. More importantly, these operational gains are enhancing our customer service. Key metrics including returns, accommodations, damages, replacements, out-of-market shipping and multiple deliveries per order are all better than pre-pandemic levels. And finally, occupancy costs, which were down 3% from last year and flat as a percent of revenue. We continue to see our retail optimization strategy deliver leverage in retail occupancy offset by our investments in our world-class technology and our supply chain. Overall, our higher gross margin this quarter exceeded our expectations. Turning now to SG&A, which came in at 28.9% of revenue or 150 basis points higher than last year from higher employment expense and advertising spend, partially offset by lower general expenses. Employment expense was 160 basis points higher year-over-year, mostly from higher performance based incentive compensation due to our strong EPS performance and from higher employee benefits costs during the quarter. Advertising expense deleveraged 20 basis points, as we continued to invest in the higher levels of ad spend. Our advertising model is a powerful competitive advantage. Our multi brand portfolio allows us to test the ROAS of our incremental spending, while our hands on approach maximizes the effectiveness of our investment and keeps valuable insights in house. General expenses leveraged 30 basis points from timing of administrative expenses. On the bottom line, our earnings exceeded expectations. Operating income came in at $321 million, up 2% to last year. Operating margin finished at 17.8%, which was 80 basis points above last year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.96, up $0.13 or 7% better than last year. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $827 million with no debt outstanding. This was after we both invested $83 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth and we returned $606 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividend. Speaking of share repurchases, year-to-date, we have repurchased $707 million or 4% of our outstanding shares. Merchandise inventory ended the quarter at $1.45 billion, up 3.8% to last year. Our inventory levels are well-positioned to support the upcoming holiday season and our inventory levels are up only 15%, compared to 2019 with revenues up 25% over that time period. Summing up our Q3 results, we're proud to have delivered another quarter of results that exceeded expectations. I'd like to thank our talented, dedicated team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. for their exceptional work in achieving these results. Now, let's turn to our '24 outlook. First, a reminder, that fiscal year 2024 is a 53 week year for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. so the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. We will report comps on a 53 week versus 53 week comparable basis. All other year-over-year comparisons will be 53 week versus 52 weeks. We anticipate the additional week will contribute 150 basis points to revenue on the year and 10 basis points to annual operating margin, both of which are embedded in our guidance. Now, let's talk to our updated guidance. We are raising our full year guidance to reflect our strong Q3 results and our optimism about Q4 with our improving furniture trends and the strong performance of seasonal products all year. However, considering the holiday calendarships, economic uncertainty and slow housing markets, our guidance contemplates a range of possible outcomes. On the top-line, we are raising our full year '24 net revenue guidance to be in the range of down 3% to down 1.5% with comps between down 4.5% to down 3%. The midpoint of our guide reflects the continuation of Q3 trends into Q4. We believe the high-end of our guide implies a strong holiday season and the low-end of our guide reflects the potential for a greater impact from the macroeconomic environment on our Q4 results. On the bottom-line, we are raising our full year operating margin guidance 40 basis points, based upon our Q3 outperformance. With the 40 basis point increase, our full year '24 operating margin will now be in the range of 18.4% to 18.8%, which includes a 60 basis point benefit from the full year impact from the Q1 2024 out of period adjustment. Without the Q1 out of period adjustment, our full year operating margin will now be in the range of 17.8% to 18.2%. We continue to anticipate our Q4 operating margins will be materially in line with 2023 results, without the benefit of the 53rd week on the quarter. Additionally, we expect our full year interest income to be approximately $50 million and our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. Turning to our 2024 capital allocation plan, we anticipate investing $250 million in capital expenditures to support the long-term growth of our business. Of this amount, 75% will be focused on strengthening our e-commerce leadership and enhancing our supply chain efficiency. As we communicated quarterly, we're committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We will continue to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share. In conjunction with our earnings release today, we announced that our Board of Directors has approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Combined with our existing authorization, we now have nearly $1.3 billion in share repurchase authorization available to opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns for our shareholders. Wrapping up Laura's and my comments on Q3. We're proud to deliver results exceeding expectations on both the top and the bottom-line. For the remainder of '24, we're focused on our three key priorities: returning to growth, elevating our world-class customer service and driving earnings. We're confident the flexibility, strength and durability of our business model will drive market share gains and deliver highly profitable earnings in almost any environment. As we look beyond '24, we will provide guidance for fiscal year '25 in March as per our standard practice. Looking further into the future, we are reiterating our long-term guidance of mid to high single-digits revenue growth with operating margin in the mid to high teens. We're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these five reasons that remain consistent. Our ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishings industry, the strength of our in house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first, but not digital only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet. With that, I'll open the call for questions. Good morning, Christina and thanks for asking that question. I know it's probably on top of everybody's mind. But look, Q3 operating margin exceeded expectations for three reasons. First, merchandise margins were stronger than we anticipated, really driven by lower input costs and our focus on full price selling. I think Laura touched on this. We continue to see a positive customer response to our consistent pricing, our focus on selling and service and the newness and the breadth of product assortment that we offer. Second, the supply chain efficiencies, which I've been talking about all year, also came in better attributable to our commitment to full price selling, really smoothing out the peaks and troughs driven by promotional activity. This is delivering significant cost savings for more consistent operations across manufacturing, warehousing and delivery expenses and have to really complement our entire supply chain organization for their diligence and really the way they've attacked the supply chain and really gone after these cost savings. The third thing on why we beat the op margin in the quarter is, we deleveraged advertising expense less in Q2 than in Q1. We continue to evaluate that spend and adjust weekly as we see the effectiveness. And I think it's the Q3 results is really a testimony to how we continue to deliver strong profitability despite the tough environment for home furnishings. As far as the second part of your question is, why wouldn't that continue into Q2? Thank you. Q4. Our guidance is based upon the facts and trends we know today. And there is a few factors in Q4 that make it very unusual. The first one is the holiday calendar shifts. And you hear us talk about that today. With the late Thanksgiving and the shorter holiday shopping period, it makes reading the business really difficult. And then, the second piece is we started lapping the reduction in promos, there's less upside than it was in prior quarters. Finally, our guide reflects the potential for greater impact in the environment in the slow housing market. But, here's the thing, we guide top-line revenues and bottom-line operating margin because it gives us the flexibility to respond to any changes in the business. To the extent there might be an upside in one line, we'll take a look and see where we might offset that in others. But it gives us the flexibility to pull levers, as the business ebbs and flows. As you've seen in Q3 and other quarters this year, we know the levers to pull to deliver results. Yes. Thanks, Kate. Yes, our inventory at the end of the quarter was up 4% to last year. Notably, our inventory levels are only up 15% versus 2019 compared with revenue growth of over 25% of that time. In terms of your question about did we pull forward some regarding the port strike activity, that wasn't really a big factor for us. This is really about getting well-positioned for holiday and being in stock. If you've been in any of our stores, you've been on the website, you can see that we're in stock and we're well-positioned for holiday. That's reflected in the guidance ranges that we provided. In terms of China tariffs and our outlook on that, first, there's a lot of uncertainty in terms of what's happening there. Just want to remind everyone that it's not our first time at this. We've always been a leader and proactively responded to changes in the trade environment. There's a lot of change since the last time this came up. First, we've significantly reduced our China sourced goods from 50% to 25% over the last few years. So exposure is significantly less than the last time in 2018 that we saw this activity. Second, and I think this is something that we don't talk enough about, the U.S. is already a major manufacturing hub for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. Much of our upholstery is manufactured domestically at our facilities in North Carolina and Mississippi. Our lighting from Rejuvenation is manufactured in Oregon and a large portion of the Williams-Sonoma assortment is produced domestically. In Peppermint Bark, everyone's favorite ski this time of the year is made here in the San Francisco Bay Area. Third, we're prepared to reduce our exports to China further if tariffs increase. We've mapped out a category-by-category plan to reduce China sourcing if conditions warrant and we're currently evaluating and quantifying the impact from additional tariffs. We have a wide range of mitigation options. In fact, everything is on the table. We'll probably move some things to other countries we may at some point in '25 front load some goods. I'm sure the vendors will pay some and there may be some that the consumers absorb as well. But that is really a lot of uncertainty right now. We're working through that. And as the landscape changes, we have the scale and strategy to pivot. But here's a really big strategic thing that I want you to take away and that is our vertically integrated supply chain is a competitive advantage. 90% of the products we sell our proprietary design and exclusively made for our brands. We operate our own in-house, best-in-class global sourcing operation with 12 overseas offices, it's our own boots on the ground managing sourcing decisions, production and shipping. We are the 11th largest container importer in the United States, so we have scale and relationships. Others do not. Punch line being as the tariff landscape changes, we have the scale and strategy to pivot. Yes. Our trade business did grow 4% in the quarter and it's been up all year. And it's really a function of the outstanding performance that our retail teams have done engaging with the trade community. A lot of trade is the local interior designer that works with the designers within our stores. And we set out a goal early this year to really ask our store retail teams to reengage with that interior designer community. And to their credit, our retail teams have taken that off and they're doing a really good job. And that really explains the 4% increase in this quarter and why we're seeing that trade business pop a little bit. I think it's important to note that while trade is a component of the B2B business, it's really the contract side of the business that we are really excited about. And that had another outstanding quarter, growing 17% in Q3. And this accounts for about 36% of our overall volume in the quarter. And it's where we really have a competitive advantage and bringing the scale of our brand, the variety of assortment, our supply chain and really becoming a disruptor in that $80 billion business-to-business market, where we think we compete favorably and have a lot of opportunity to gain market share. Chuck, we think a lot of it can be sticky. We're pretty confident in our operating margin. And I think it goes back to the five drivers I talked about and what's really happening within gross margin. E-commerce sales mix really at 66% is sustaining. I think everyone knows that we have a substantially higher operating margin and less occupancy expense in our e-commerce business. The retail optimization strategy, our second big driver is also kicking in. Again, elevating that the profitability of our retail chain and also comes with less occupancy. A big part of the improvement since 2019 has been our pricing power. That accounts for about 390 of the basis points of that about 1,000. And that comes from our merchandise margin team, the benefit of our focus on full price selling and the strength of our in-house design proprietary products. That obviously, given our results compared to the competition are resonating with consumers. And the last is the supply chain efficiencies. You've heard Laura and I talk about how all of our metrics or KPIs that we look at are performing better than pre-pandemic levels. And here, this is our own internal version of the 4 minute mile. If you're not familiar with that story, there's -- for years, it was thought that human beings couldn't run a 4 minute mile. It has even said there's no way that can happen. And as soon as one person was able to break it, everyone was able to run a 4 minute mile. Well, that's the same thing for us. For years, we thought that these -- KPIs had to run at a certain level and that's just the way our business ran. And post-pandemic, as we try to get back to those, we ask a simple question of why are those metrics at those levels. And to our supply chain team's credit, they said, well, we think we can do better. Laura and I said, yes, let's see you do that. And not only do they achieve those levels, but as soon as they go through those levels, they said, you know what, there's actually even more here. So this is an ongoing opportunity for us. And we think we're excited about what that can bring. I think the key point here is since 2019, we've transformed our profitability and can sustain these operating margins at a higher level."

A question-and-answer session will follow the conclusion of the prepared remarks. I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Brooks: Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including our revised guidance for fiscal '24 and our long-term outlook. We believe these statements reflect our best estimates. However, we cannot make any assurances that these statements will materialize and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call. Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier this morning. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our filings with the SEC. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our Investor Relations website. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer.\nLaura Alber: Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Before we review our Q2 results, I want to take a minute to recognize our team for their continued contributions. We recently held our General Managers Conference in Arizona. It was our first leadership conference since the pandemic and all of us have been inspired by the level of passion, dedication and talent of our store management and field teams. Today, we are reporting strong results for the second quarter of 2024, which were driven by our Q2 improved top line trends, market share gains and continued delivery on our commitment to profitability. In Q2, our comp came in at negative 3.3% and we exceeded profitability estimates with an operating margin of 16.2% and earnings per share of $1.74, reflecting the 2-for-1 stock split we completed in July. We are pleased with our strong operating results and the operational improvements that produced these results. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our margin profile even in a difficult market. There is no doubt that the Home Furnishings market is challenged due to the uncertainty in the economy, coupled with slow housing. This leads us to believe that we may not see the back half acceleration that we expected despite all of the hard work we've done to improve our product offer and our customer experience. Therefore, we believe, it is prudent to reduce our top line outlook for the balance of the year, while continuing to deliver on our commitment to profitability, and in fact, we are raising our bottom line guidance. We are now expecting full year revenues to come in at range of down 4% to down 1.5%, but we are raising our guidance on operating margin to be in the range of 17.4% to 17.8%. Now let me review progress on our three key priorities that we outlined with you back in March: first, returning to growth; second, elevating our world-class customer service; and third, driving margin. I'll start with an update on returning to growth. Our improved top line trend outperformed the industry decline in the second quarter and we maintained our commitment to not offering site wide promotions. A key element of our return to growth strategy is our focus on innovation on our product lines across brands, including substantially more newness across our assortments. And our unique in-house design capabilities and vertically-integrated sourcing organization allows us to offer this high-quality design innovation at compelling price points. The next key component of our return to growth strategy is our commitment to improving our channel experiences. Our investment in our proprietary e-commerce technology serves as a competitive advantage versus our peers. From product discovery and selection to personalization, content, customer care and the final mile, our team is constantly thinking about how to elevate and evolve our best-in-class e-commerce experience. In the quarter, we've been focused on expanding our online content and providing more inspiration in the shop path to drive conversion. And of course, we cannot forget our best-in-class retail business. We have continued to improve our in-store experience with inspirational new products, improved in-stock inventory levels and next level design services, including our new design tool that allows for 3D rendering. As our teams reminded us at our General Managers Conference this year, we really do have the best team in retail, and our retail optimization efforts continue transforming our store fleet to be positioned in the most profitable, inspiring and strategic locations. Now let's talk through progress on our second and third key priorities, which go hand-in-hand. We continue to make progress improving our world-class customer service and driving margin contributing significantly to the operating margin we reported today. One of the foundational principles upon which this company is built is that the customer is at the center of everything we do and their satisfaction is key to our operating performance. Without our customers, truly nothing else matters. And in Q2, we continued to make meaningful improvements in our customer service metrics. The supply chain team continues to reduce costs, by limiting out-of-market and multiple shipments, fewer customer accommodations, lower returns and damages and reduced replacements. And our ongoing commitment to not running site-wide promotions and the reduction of our promotional offerings have improved margins. We are focused on delivering a compelling, value equation to our customers, which in turn maximizes our full price selling. Now, I'd like to update you on the performance of our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 7.1% comp in Q2. Improvements in trends were driven by our compelling product assortments in coastal decorating and entertaining and seasonal holidays. We saw success in our new summer furniture launches and are optimistic about our fall furniture newness with a focus on proprietary finishes and design. Looking ahead to the back half, we have a strong holiday lineup that is off to a great start. There is no one else like us in the market with the incredible assortment of seasonal decorating for Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and Hanukkah and we are building on successful new programs that we have launched. The Pottery Barn Children's Business ran at positive 1.5% comp in Q2, a continuation of our positive comp trend in the first quarter of the year. Innovation across our product offering and improvement in the shopping experience have been key to delivering this growth. In these life-stage brands, back-to-school was a highlight with Dorm driving double-digits growth. In this space, we continue to attract new customers with our market-leading design, excellent quality and sustainability promise. We have bolstered the shopping experience with a suite of digital shopping tools and expanded in-store services, including three Dorm design services and convenient shipping options to any of our stores near campuses. Product collaborations also continue to drive sales with existing and new customers. We're especially pleased with our recent collaboration with Roller Rabbit and we are seeing continued success with LoveShackFancy. Now, let's review West Elm, which ran a negative 4.8% comp in Q2. The brand continues to see success in new product introductions, with both summer and fall newness driving double digits positive comp to last year. And this month, we are thrilled to drop our first catalog in the brand since holiday 2021. Additionally, West Elm launched a very exciting second collaboration with the fashion brand, Rhode, following a successful debut last year. This new collection features 120 pieces, including a re-launch of past favorites combined with new textiles, tabletop, lighting, decorative accessories, bath rugs and a collection of items designed for college dorms. This collaboration is on track to do more than double the initial launch last year. Given the positive trends in newness and exciting collaborations in the pipeline, we have a sizable opportunity in West Elm as it rebalances more inventory into these new products. The Williams-Sonoma brand ran a negative 0.8% comp in Q2. In the quarter, we benefited from the performance of our new and exclusive products, offset by some tough compares in electrics. Sales from summer newness were up double digits to last year and we're seeing strength in new and premium products found only at Williams-Sonoma. The strategy to offer our customers\u2019 quality product they can't find anywhere else is working, and we are excited about our robust second half lineup of in-house design products and exclusives. The Williams-Sonoma brand remains focused on delivering immersive culinary experiences in store, online and at key events across the country. In store, we've inspired thousands of customers through our Sunday Skills series and demos teaching customers from how to sous it to how to make ice cream. Our Tools for Change campaign supporting No Kid Hungry, celebrated its 10th Anniversary this July. To date, we're proud to have raised over $16 million to help No Kid Hungry and end childhood hunger in America. We're grateful to all the chefs and celebrities that have contributed designs to our spatulas over the years. As we listen to the second half, we will continue inspiring our customers to cook, host and entertain for the holidays. This fall, the brand will launch the art of entertaining, where customers can benefit from expert advice on everything from setting a table to hosting a dinner party to floral arranging techniques and to napkin folding tricks. We believe this focus on holidays and celebrations will not just drive volume in key categories, but will also cement the brand as the ultimate celebration destination in retail for new and existing customers. And lastly, we're excited about the momentum of our Williams-Sonoma Home business which ran at slight positive comp in Q2. Now I'd like to update you on our other initiatives. Business-to-business continued its momentum in Q2 growing 11.5%, with record quarterly contract volume growing 21.6%, while trade grew 7.1%. The hospitality space remains strong with notable wins at the Sheraton Boston, the Hilton Beverly Hills, Renaissance Las Vegas and under canvas for the Yosemite location. We have launched a new brand standard program with IHG's, Hotel Indigo brand being named a preferred vendor for lighting and upholstery categories. We're also seeing strong momentum in the multifamily space including growing partnerships with Korman Communities and the Discovery Land Company. And we are thrilled to partner with St. Jude to develop custom beds and nightstands for their Ranch for Children project in Nevada. Now, I'd like to talk about our global business. While we continue to navigate global macroeconomic pressures, our strategic initiatives are delivering positive results across key strategic markets including India, Canada and Mexico. The Canadian market continues to show strength, driven by growth from enhanced design services, emerging brands and omni-channel services. In Mexico, we are optimistic about our brand's performance in the market with strength driven by all brands with the most significant contribution coming from PB Kids. We'll be opening two new stores by the end of the year and three more set to open in early 2025. Finally, India remains a key area of growth for us. We're excited to expand the West Elm brand with two additional locations in new markets by the end of the year. Overall, our assortment, market and service strategies are the differentiators for continued growth in our global markets. Lastly, I'd like to update you on our emerging brands. Rejuvenation delivered another double-digits quarter. We're very optimistic about Rejuvenation's performance with four consecutive quarters of positive comps. Their unwavering focus on delivering the highest quality products has allowed them to gain market share. The trend of home updates, particularly in kitchens and bathrooms continues with notable growth in cabinet and bath hardware and lighting. Additionally, our growth categories including window hardware, textiles, home furnishings and organization solutions, also performed well providing our customers with the perfect finishing touches to complete their spaces. Mark and Graham, our monogrammed gifting business also drove a high double-digits growth in Q2. They saw success with our coastal and beach products for the home and on the go and had strong gifting sales in golf and personalized games. They've recently launched the Monogram Wedding Shoppe as well as Mark and Graham Kids, which will be an exciting incremental growth strategy for the brand. Finally, GreenRow, our newest brand, continues to grow and expand its assortment of vintage-inspired colorful furnishings that are sustainably sourced and designed to last. This month, GreenRow launched a new collection of thoughtfully made products over 150 new items and a new catalog. The brand continues to innovate and create unique and differentiated products that fill a void in the market. We look forward to continued growth and exciting new products and partnerships in the coming months for GreenRow. In summary, we are pleased with our strong operating results. Our revised outlook today reflects our prudent view of the top-line and the confidence we have in our profitability profile. Despite the macro uncertainty, we remain focused on our key priorities for 2024 that are driving the results we announced today. During the last few years, we as a company have navigated, learned, optimized and built all in preparation for our next chapter of growth. We have a strong omni-channel platform with an exclusive lifestyle offering and a sophisticated distribution network with additional capacity. With that, I will turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers and our outlook in more detail.\nJeff Howie: Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to deliver another quarter of strong results, highlighted by our Q2 improved top-line trend, market share gains and earnings that continue to exceed expectations. Laura touched on our three key priorities for fiscal year '24. One, returning to growth, fueled by product innovation and channel experience. Two, elevating our world-class service, which produces both customer retention and expense savings. And three, driving earnings as we continue to deliver strong profitability. These three priorities connect directly to the five key drivers underpinning our strong profitability in Q2. First, our e-commerce sales mix with its higher operating margins sustaining at 66% of total revenues. Second, our retail optimization strategy delivering 3% less occupancy expense inclusive of additional technology and supply chain investments. Third, the pricing power of our in house designed proprietary products and our emphasis on full price selling contributing to a 380 basis point improvement in merchandise margins. Fourth, our supply chain efficiency from our relentless focus on customer service and operational excellence, producing 180 basis points improvement in selling margins. And fifth, our ability to control costs, as we continue to manage variable employment costs materially in line with top-line trends. Given our strong second quarter results, we're confident, we'll continue to gain market share and deliver strong earnings even in this uncertain environment. Now, let's dive into the numbers. I'll start with our Q2 results and then provide an update on guidance for '24. Net revenues finished at $1.79 billion slightly below our expectations. We gained market share as our comp of negative 3.3% outperformed the industry, which declined by approximately 10%. Importantly, we accomplished this EBIT, as we reduced our overall level of promotions in the quarter. Our Q2 comps improved from Q1, reflective of better performance in furniture and continued growth in our non-furniture categories. From a cadence perspective, our trends across the quarter were choppy and inconsistent, reflecting the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Moving down the income statement, gross margin came in at 46.2%, 550 basis points higher than last year and substantially exceeding expectations. There were three drivers to this 550 basis point improvement, merchandise margins, supply chain efficiencies and occupancy costs. Let's start with merchandise margins, which improved 380 basis points. This improvement was driven by our ongoing commitment to full price selling, lower input costs and the residual benefit from lower inbound freight, as we lap last year's pandemic-related ocean freight runoff. Next, supply chain efficiencies contributed 180 basis points. Our commitment to full price selling is smoothing out the peaks and troughs created by promotional activity. This is yielding improved customer service, reduced customer lead times, and significant cost savings for more efficient operations. Key customer service metrics, including returns, accommodations, damages, replacements, out-of-market shipping and multiple deliveries per order are all performing better than pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, we are seeing cost savings across the supply chain for more consistent operations, including warehouse, manufacturing and delivery expenses. Finally, occupancy costs, which were down 3% from last year deleveraged 10 basis points. We continue to optimize our retail fleet, while we invest in our world-class technology stack and our supply chain. During the quarter, we began operating our new Arizona distribution center. This fully-automated facility will replace an outdated distribution center, improve service time to our customers and lower employment and shipping costs. Included in our occupancy cost this quarter were the cost of running both the new and old buildings, which will continue for the balance of fiscal year '24. Wrapping up gross margin, we delivered substantially higher gross margin this quarter. Turning now to SG&A, which came in at 30% of revenues with 390 basis points higher than last year, from higher employment expense and advertising spend. Employment expense was 200 basis points higher year-over-year, mostly from higher performance-based incentive compensation due to our strong EPS performance year-to-date. In Q2, we continue to manage variable employment costs across our stores, distribution centers and customer care centers, materially in line with top-line trends. Advertising expense deleveraged 150 basis points, as we continue to invest into higher levels of advertising spend. Our multi-brand portfolio allows us to test the return of our incremental spend and our own hands-on keyboard approach, allows our investment to go further and keeps our learnings in house. Our advertising model is a key competitive advantage in the home furnishing industry. On the bottom-line, our earnings once again exceeded expectations. Operating income came in at $290 million with operating margin at 16.2%, which was 160 basis points above last year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.74, up $0.18 or 12% year-over-year. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.3 billion with no debt outstanding. This was after we invested $31 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth and we returned $203 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends. Merchandise inventory ended the quarter of $1.2 billion, down 4.1% to last year. Our inventory levels are in line with our top line trends and are well-positioned to support our business. Summing up our Q2 results. We're proud to have delivered yet another quarter of earnings exceeding expectations. I'd like to thank our team at Williams-Sonoma Inc. for delivering these great results. Our recent General Manager's Conference reminded me how our talented, dedicated team is the best in retail and the key to our success. Now let's turn to our '24 outlook. 2024 continues to be a challenging environment for home furnishings due to macroeconomic uncertainty and the slow housing market. This leads us to believe, it's prudent to reduce our top-line outlook for the balance of the year, while raising our operating margin guidance, as we continue to deliver on our commitment to profitability. It's important to note that, our lower sales outlook is offset by our raised operating margin, producing materially similar implied EPS guidance. On the top-line, we now expect full year '24 net revenues to be in the range of down 4% to down 1.5% with comps between down 5.5% to down 3%. Our updated guidance reflects the macroeconomic uncertainty combined with our choppy and inconsistent trends. With this backdrop in mind, we're providing this updated range of outcomes for our top-line. The midpoint of our guide reflects a continuation of the first half economic and consumer dynamics through the back half of '24. The high end of the guide implies some acceleration in industry trends, coupled with increased traction of our growth initiatives. The low end of our guide reflects the recognition that the macroeconomic environment may have a greater impact on our results in the back half of '24. On the bottom-line, we are raising our full year operating margin guidance 40 basis points, based upon our Q2 outperformance. We continue to anticipate our operating margins in the back half will be materially in line with 2023 results. With a 40 basis point increase, we are raising our full year 2024 operating margin to range of 18.0% to 18.4%, which includes a 60 basis point benefit from the full year impact from the Q1 out-of-period adjustment. Without the Q1 out-of-period adjustment, our full year operating margin will now be in the range of 17.4% to 17.8%. Additionally, we expect our full year interest income to be approximately $45 million and our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25.5%. As a reminder, 2024 is a 53-week year for Williams-Sonoma Inc. The fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. We anticipate the additional week will contribute 150 basis points to revenue growth and 10 basis points to operating margins, both of which are embedded in our guidance. We will report comps on a 53-week versus 53-week comparable basis. All other year-over-year compares will be 53-weeks versus 52-weeks. Our capital allocation plan for 2024 remain unchanged. We expect to spend $225 million in capital expenditures to invest in the long-term growth of our business. 75% of this capital spend will be dedicated to driving our e-commerce leadership and supply chain efficiency. As we've communicated quarterly, we're committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We will continue to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share and have $826 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization, we will continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns for our shareholders. As we look further into the future beyond '24, we are reiterating our long-term guidance of mid-to-high single-digits revenue growth with operating margins in the mid-to-high teens. We're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these five reasons that remain consistent. Our ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishing industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first, but not digital only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet. With that, I'll open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett.\nChuck Grom: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you guys could talk about the cadence of sales throughout the quarter across banners? And also any early readings on back-to-school, back-to-college in recent weeks?\nLaura Alber: The cadence of sales for us isn't really a relevant indicator. I know you all love to ask the question and also how this quarter is going, but it doesn't really amount to much in terms of predicting where we're going to be. Remember, as we look to the back half, we have a big ramp in seasonal businesses. And that is not - so what's happening now is not the same as what could happen then. And back-to-school is a great example. Innovation is a key part of our strategy and especially in our life stage and seasonal holidays, where we're seeing great response and back-to-school is no different. It's actually one of our highlights. We've really seen our initiatives, particularly in Dorm, really gain traction, and we're really gaining share in the Dorm market serving the customer with very high-quality products. It's significantly positive. We're chasing inventory, its high margin, and it's driven by both the product in bedding, also our no nail solutions, bath and flooring. It's also driven by our exclusive collaborations such as LoveShackFancy and Roller Rabbit, which has been fantastic for that demo, and then our channel functionality. So, for example, Dorm functionality launched earlier on the site this year, which we think was really good for our customers to be able to consider, what they would buy before they actually get into school. And we had a shareable Dorm wish list, a bedding visualizer and then retail. We really pushed Dorm at retail both in our kids' stores, our teen stores and we did a small setup in our Pottery Barn stores to really help drive awareness to build that market share. We've also worked with partners and influencers to drive awareness and driving traffic off the Pottery Barn website to the dorm and back-to-school shop has been another critical part of what we're doing.\nChuck Grom: I just actually just moved my daughter into college, and I could tell you the Dorm business is very real. Jeff, just one for you, looking ahead into the back half of the year, any thoughts on the phasing of comps in the third and fourth quarter and any impact with the five fewer shopping days this year?\nJeff Howie: Yes, let me start with the shorter holiday season. Our quick answer on that is that the impact is already embedded in our guidance. There's a lot of puts-and-takes on this one for us. For one, a shorter holiday season, each day has to work harder, especially at retail. But this year's calendar with Christmas moving from Monday to Wednesday is more favorable for e-commerce. I think everyone knows, our mix is 66% e-commerce. So that is actually a good guide for us. Then when you think about the back half for us, this year is a 53-week year, so our fourth quarter has 14 weeks in it. Punchline on this is, there's a lot of puts-and-takes for shorter holiday seasons, but it's in our guidance. As we think about the back half, as I said in my prepared remarks, the way we set up our guidance is the midpoint of our guide reflects the continuation of the first half economic and consumer dynamics to the back half. The high end of our guide implies some acceleration in industry trends, coupled with increased traction of our growth initiatives. And if holiday proves out to be better, there could even be upside there. The low end of our guide recognizes the macroeconomic environment may have a greater impact on our results in the back half, but it's so uncertain, we provided really wide range of guidance with those possible outcomes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird.\nPeter Benedict: First one, just maybe, Jeff, around advertising. I mean, historically, I think you guys run in the 6.5% to 7% of sales, at least on an annual basis for advertising. I know it's delevered in the 1st part of this year. Just curious how you're thinking about the increased investment in advertising right now, when you need to see the return on that, and just maybe should we expect a period where you may be above that 7% range for a bit, as we go through this kind of period of softer demand? That's my first question.\nLaura Alber: Thanks, Peter. Our multi-brand portfolio is clearly an advantage in a lot of ways, but particularly in marketing. Our cross-brand customers performed significantly better than other customers. In fact, they're 4x more valuable. And we've really been committed, as you all know, to not running a promotional business. There's a lot of people out there that probably would push a few more comp points by running markdowns. We've chosen not to do that. We know having done this for a long time that the long-term investment in the fundamentals is more important than the short-term markdowns that give you an immediate pop and create all sorts of peaks and valleys, which aren't good for operations. Advertising investment done correctly, builds customer growth. And so, they also drive short-term sales. So it's a short-term sales and a long-term play with new customers. And like anything else we do, we are constantly looking for opportunities to spend the last dollar more effectively, and that changes season-by-season, brand-by-brand and marketing program by marketing program. Our loyalty program is another key part of this and very effective. These again are our best customers, and we have the credit card program and we also have the non-credit card key rewards program, which has been very effective. I'd say, the last thing that we are doing that is, I think a competitive advantage and something that we're doing more of than we did last year, substantially is amplifying our creator-led content. So creator-led content, YouTube, TikTok, Meta, it's helping us reach new audiences and it's very effective. It's an area that we're building in-house, and we're really excited about our leadership position as we go forward, because we think this is very, very relevant for our customers.\nPeter Benedict: My follow-up question is around kind of freight costs in that environment. I'm just curious maybe your view as we maybe turn to '25, freight rates have been coming up. How does that kind of play into maybe the margin structure as you think about next year? And remind us just maybe your exposure to China and with all the talk of potential tariffs, that type of thing, just maybe level side us on that front?\nJeff Howie: Yes, Peter, good morning. Couple of questions in there. First one on ocean freight, we're not seeing an impact from higher spot market rates on our ocean freight. We're mostly insulated from the fluctuations in the spot market with our contracted rates. Here is the thing, as you know, one of our competitive advantages is our global supply chain. We're the 11th largest container importer in the United States. We have scale and relationships, others do not. So while there may be challenges in the broader market, especially with smaller competitors, it's not been a factor for us. Any impact is already embedded in our results and our guidance. As far as China goes, we significantly reduced our China-sourced goods from the last time this came up back in 2018. Back then, it was 50% of all of our imports were from China. Now that number is down to 25%. And of that 25%, a third of them already have a Trump tariff on them, which we've been paying and are still on them. The fact that, if this does come up and tariffs are expanded, we're prepared to reduce it further. We've mapped out a category-by-category plan to reduce China sourcing if the landscape changes. I think the important point here is 90% of our products are proprietary, designed and exclusively made for our brands, and we operate our own in house best-in-class global sourcing operation with 12 overseas offices. It's our own boots on the ground, managing sourcing decisions, production and shipping. If the landscape changes, we're well-positioned to pivot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Cristina Fernandez with Telsey Advisory Group.\nCristina Fernandez: Hi, good morning. I wanted to see if you can talk about any changes in customer behavior that you saw this quarter or so far here in August. Several retailers have talked about the consumer being more hesitant, less involved during non-peak periods, more resistant to price? Are you seeing any of those factors in your trends?\nLaura Alber: Thanks for the question, Christina. We're constantly setting all the customer metrics to find anything that we can read into and build upon. It's interesting, furniture actually picked up from Q1, not as much as we wanted it to, but it's better than it was. The other areas are still better than furniture. Leading to the strategy of really focused on the seasonal holidays, where no one else really plays and these life stages, while the consumer is still not really buying a lot of new houses. In terms of price points, interesting question. We have a lot of newness. It's working. It's very exciting, particularly in West Elm, where we have the most amount of newness. It's not in low price points. It's in the medium to high price points and that's also really, I think a good piece of information for us. We are giving the customer great value. So we're not trying to develop things at higher price points. We're trying to develop the best value products at every price point. I've said it before, but the truth is where we have a lot of innovation, our prices are the best in the market and no one has tried to copy us yet on the newness, which is why we're pushing newness as a key strategy in the back half as a percent to total. As we continue to have these seasons click by and get confidence on the newness, we can buy more into it. We usually have a pretty long cycle on that product growing before it declines.\nCristina Fernandez: And then my follow-up is for Jeff. On the operating margin for the quarter, I think last call you had talked about being flattish. It was up 160 basis points. Where did the upside come from this quarter and why wouldn't some of those continue in the back half?\nJeff Howie: Yes, thanks for asking that, Christina. Q2 operating margin exceeded our expectations for three reasons. The first is in merchandise margins, which were stronger than anticipated driven by our focus on full price selling. We continue to see positive customer response to our consistent pricing and focus on selling and service versus price. The second thing is our supply chain efficiencies also came in better, really attributable to our commitment to full price selling, smoothing out the peaks and troughs driven by promotional activity. This is delivering significant cost savings from more consistent operations across our manufacturing, operating and delivery expenses. And third, we deleverage advertising expense less in Q2 than in Q1. As Laura said before, we continue to evaluate our spend and adjust weekly as we see the effectiveness. Here's what I'd like you to remember as we continue to deliver strong profitability despite the tough environment for home furnishings.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: So the first question I want to ask is just with respect to industry-wide promotions. You've done a great job of holding the line on site-wide promotions at Williams-Sonoma, but throughout the space, we keep on hearing about signals of a more promotional environment. So the question I'm asking is, are you seeing a more promotional environment broadly? And then are you able to quantify what impacts, if any, that's happened upon your business at this point?\nLaura Alber: Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian. We continue to see consistent high levels of promotions in the marketplace in also the forms from site-wide promotions, free shipping, reduction of prices across the board, double rewards, all of it. And we have played those games and know that they don't work, and you're competing with yourself more than you are with your peers and your competitors. It's really important that you give your customer great value. They look at that price and they know what other things cost similarly to it in the market. But the up and down to get a short-term pop that drives a short-term comp is not a good way to run your business. And so we are committed, as I said before, to running our business without those high levels of promotion. And actually, as much as we've been saying this for the past couple of years, we're still pushing this out of our base. And so in Q1 and Q2, we significantly improved our regular price percent to total, and our regular price comps are significantly better than the markdown comps.\nBrian Nagel: Then the second question I have, recognizing we're not necessarily talking about the cadence of the business through the quarter, but -- and it sounds like given your commentary and the adjustments to the top line guidance in the balance here, the business is weakened, or at least tracking weaker than you initially anticipated. Can you help us understand if there's any specific areas you seeing incremental weakness within demand?\nLaura Alber: So the reality is our guidance, as Jeff mentioned, has a wide range. And it's that we expected the back half to accelerate. I think we all thought we'd have an interest rate cut or at least 1 or 2 by now, which we haven't seen, right? So instead of hoping for housing to turn around, we put the range together to reflect if the back half is little to the first half. And that seems, I know, conservative because of the multiyear comps getting easier in the back half. But we just thought it was prudent, given the uncertainty in the macro, to reduce the top line so that we're not pressured to take promos to hit the number. We want to run this business for the long term, and that's what we've been doing, and you're seeing the continued performance on the bottom line. And I'll just say this, we've said before, can you imagine what this thing looks like when you get some positive comps. And the best way for me to describe it is our operating model is a coiled spring.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.\nSimeon Gutman: I have a question, I guess, this is [Ajol\u2019s] question. Any difference in posture thinking about the mix between sales and promotion in terms of stimulating sales and given that the backdrop seems to be getting more promotional?\nLaura Alber: Absolutely not, but we are on offense with our product innovation and our marketing.\nJeff Howie: And Simeon, I would just add, I talked about it in my prepared remarks and answering Christina's question, but by not running the promos like we did in smoothing out the peaks and troughs of the promotional activity, it's really driving improved customer service, shorter lead times and much more efficient operations across our entire supply chain, which is really flowing through to the bottom-line.\nSimeon Gutman: And if I can ask a quick follow-up. The runway for merch margin specifically related to supply chain or transport, I don't know if I missed -- I may have missed it earlier in the call, but I thought, by the second quarter, it would sort of reach it's, I don't know, it's peak or it's max, and then it would start to wane. Is that still about the right way to think about it?\nJeff Howie: It is the right way to think about it. And while we don't guide to specific lines, we are guiding that our operating margin in the back half will be flat with 2023 really because of some of the benefits that we had in the front half [Technical Difficulty] we were up against the impact of the pandemic-related ocean freight runoff. That was worth about 200 basis points, good guide in the first half. And then our focus on full price selling really kicked in, in the back half of '23. So we have that upside by focusing on that in the front half. And in fact, if we look at our percentage of full-price selling in Q2 of '24, it's about the same rate as it was in Q3 '23. So that dissipates as well. So like we said, we were up against some easier compares in the front half on the margin line that starts to dissipate in the back half, which is why we're giving that guidance on operating margin for the back half.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Maksim Rakhlenko with TD Cowen.\nMaksim Rakhlenko: So first, Laura, can you discuss any learnings about your shoppers\u2019 reactions as you pull back on promotions? Are shoppers reacting how you thought that they would? For instance, is your PB shopper may be a little bit more price conscious than you thought, or any other call-outs?\nLaura Alber: Yes, as I said earlier, there's not lot to read there because the newness that's in the mid-price points are really working. We're not seeing a trade down. Furnitures is better than it was, but future is still soft, right? And it's a big portion of both the West Elm and Pottery Barn businesses, which is why the complexion is very different in those versus the more life stage kids and teen brand and also Williams-Sonoma. So yes, there's nothing really to read into that. What we do see is that they're not waiting for promotions to the point that they don't -- they're not worried that they're going to feel done if they don't want to the promotion, they can buy it when they need it. And our sales associates are thrilled that they can sell with confidence and not always be looking into a promo calendar to see when the next sale is.\nJeff Howie: Yes. I think Laura on the fact that -- yes, when we run promotions, we're really competing with ourselves a lot of time. And I think many of you heard me talk about the concept of shift versus lift and how much of the promotions are really incremental versus just moving it around and incentivizing the customer to wait for it to go on sale. So now we can really focus on serving the customers, selling to them, helping them with their design project. And the customer is not waiting for that next promotion, they're engaging on the design side.\nMaksim Rakhlenko: Got It. That's helpful. And then, Jeff, maybe can you bridge the full year EBIT margin guide of 17.4% to 17.8%, and then the long-term margin guide of mid to high-teens? Sort of what would need to happen and the key drivers in a bull versus bear case?\nJeff Howie: Well, look, our long-term operating margin guidance is mid to high teens. And our guidance for this year puts us right back in the middle of that range. Certainly, sales are accelerating. We expect possibly some more margin expansion, but we've provided a range because there's a lot of variables in there. And we're pretty confident in our ability to sustain this profitability. We've demonstrated it -- last year, we delivered at $64 million. This year, we're guiding in the mid-17. So this is sustainable, and we're confident in our operating margin going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker.\nMarni Shapiro: Congrats on some great execution in a choppy environment. Laura, I wanted to focus on some of the newness that you keep highlighting because it still -- not only is there a lot of new products like Roller Rabbit, for example, but it's the way you're attacking it. So I know like at UNC, you had an entire event at one of the buildings with Roller Rabbit or with Rhodes, I was just ground in social media about it. That was really, really great. And it feels like that mix between your merchandising and your marketing has really come together. So I'm curious, was that a change? Or am I just getting hit with it? Is it bringing new shoppers into these brands? Is it bringing them in with more frequency? And how should we think about this for the back half of the year?\nLaura Alber: Thank you so much for the question. Yes, newness and innovation are really key parts of our strategy to drive growth, and we've seen a really strong response to newness. In West Elm, we've talked about newnesses checking across all categories, in particular in furniture. And in fact, we've seen double-digit positive comps in both West Elm summer and fall new furniture introductions. Now why you're not seeing that roll into the bigger number yet is because it's still a small percent of total because you want to make sure your newness is working before you bet the farm on it. We've had some great collaborations in West Elm. I touched on Rhodes. Rhodes this year is double last year. We introduced [indiscernible], who's an amazing shaft who has incredible furniture designs that we've introduced and that's also been a great one. In Pottery Barn, we're seeing a good response to our newness there too, especially in furniture and the seasonal decorating, which we're launching earlier than we've ever launched before. I am so thrilled to see people scooping up Christmas this early. They also have some great new collaborations in the hopper and are going to have an increased amount of collaborations next year. Kids and team have always been, in our company, our leader in collaborations and just amazing from the license programs that we run, the [indiscernible] to incredible designers like [indiscernible] and LoveShackFancy. They've really been able to hit the nail on the head with what their consumer wants at every life stage. And kids is different than teens, but we're covering both, and you can really see that we're on trend by the results in dorm. Williams-Sonoma, the branded product in Williams-Sonoma doing incredibly well. I'll give you 1 very specific example in Williams-Sonoma, which is our Williams-Sonoma branded cutlery. Higher margin, obviously, than the names out there that we all are familiar with and really rivaling them in volume. And there's also a lot of exclusives that we have and launch leads that we have with our key electrics partners and premium cookware. The Tucci collaboration, by the way, continues to be phenomenal, and we are not done with the innovation that Tucci is going to be bringing, not just for the back half, but through next year. And so we're excited about our -- we really excited about our back half lineup in Williams-Sonoma. We can't go into -- I mean I'd really like to talk about some of those things a little bit more, but I I'm always cautious about competition and not giving away too much information. But the punchline is, we have seen a very strong response to newness and collaborations. And Marni, you are right. We are doing things differently with our creator-led content about collaborations. When you combine a collaboration with an influencer on TikTok, you have magic. And we are continuing to build that scale and really draw in new customers through those channels. So thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.\nSeth Basham: My first question is just making sure I understand some of the moving pieces of the margin outlook, obviously, expecting a lower sales performance through the balance of the year, but you're holding your back half margin guidance. So Jeff, maybe you could give us some color as to where you see the upside, so to speak, on margins relative to a couple of months ago? What areas, whether it be deployments of gross margin or SG&A?\nJeff Howie: Seth. So on the operating margin outlook for the back half, we've consistently said all year that we anticipate that our back half operating margins would be flat year-over-year. What we've done this quarter is we've raised based upon our Q2 outperformance. In terms of the puts and takes on margin, we don't necessarily guide the individual lines, but we will give you some color commentary like I did before. The gross margin, some of the benefits that we had coming at us in the front half start to wind down in the back half. That includes the supply chain headwinds we're up against in the first half, which, as I said before, it was worth about 200 basis points. And then we start lapping the improved promos in the back half. So we see that as being essentially flat. And then just overall, this is true for our entire guidance is the macroeconomic uncertainty. We're taking a very prudent approach to our back half guidance given the macroeconomic backdrop. And if things are better, and we see some better performance in holiday, we could surprise the upside. But at the same time, if the macroeconomic environment is more challenging, we'll be more at the low end of our guidance.\nSeth Basham: That's helpful color. So just to make sure I understood you, you're looking for gross margins to be flattish year-over-year in the back half [indiscernible] SG&A the same. What areas of SG&A do you have the opportunity to reduce in a slower sales environment? Are you talking primarily variable labor and advertising? Or is there anything else?\nJeff Howie: Yes. I mean, look, Seth, we don't guide individual lines, and we do that just got top line and operating margins that give us the flexibility to pull the levers we need to deliver results. And as you've seen, we know how to deliver results. In terms of [indiscernible] we have, certainly, ad cost is flexible, as Laura mentioned before. We evaluate this on almost a weekly basis depending upon the returns we're seeing and the effectiveness of the advertising. And then our employment, like I've said many times before and in my prepared remarks, our employment is largely variable. The majority of our employment is in our stores, our distribution centers and our customer care centers, and we can flex that in line with top line trends as things evolve. So I think the punchline here is, we're guiding flat operating margin guidance in the context of a very uncertain macroeconomic environment, and we're taking a very prudent approach with this guidance. And we're giving ourselves the flexibility to pull levers as we need to deliver the results.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi.\nSteven Zaccone: I was going to focus a little bit more on the medium to longer term because understandably, the macro is challenging for the category. But as we start to see demand recover, right? We're at a point where this business has done very well on a merchandise margin and overall selling margin. What's the opportunity going forward? Presumably, you've pulled back from promotions in the business, why can't the gross margin rate for this business to be much higher as you start to see demand recover?\nLaura Alber: Great question. I would say that housing is clearly a big driver of furniture sales. And we all know housing is about the worst it's been. But at the same time, there's a lot of people calling to the bottom here. And hopefully, we see an interest rate and multiple cuts in the next six months. Could take a little bit of time for that to flow through, but when people feel better, they tend to shop more, especially in our categories for their homes. And I really -- I said it before, but we want flexibility because we always want to give the customer greater value, right? So we don't want to overprice products. We want to make sure that our brands are accessible. We want people to be able to come and shop with us and across our brands not be so expensive that it's a very small group of people. So we hold that back to say there is a point at which you don't want to raise the margin too high and not be competitive. On the other hand, we're delivering this incredible margin against negative sales, negative sales a couple of years running here. So can you imagine what this looks like when the sales are flat to positive? I said it before, operating model is a coiled spring. It's very exciting to be sitting here knowing that we have built an organization with structural margin profitability profiles and a lot of innovation and capacity to grow much bigger than we are today without huge step-up investments.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will turn the call to Laura for closing remarks.\nLaura Alber: Yes. Well, thank you all for joining us. We are entering our favorite time of the year, which is the holidays. And I'll remind you that Halloween is right around the corner, as is Thanksgiving, Christmas and Hanukkah and the New Year. So I hope if you are out there in our stores and seeing all the great product lineups, we are very excited about what we have out there, and I look forward to talking to you next time. So thank you for your support. Appreciate it.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your line.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Before we review our Q2 results, I want to take a minute to recognize our team for their continued contributions. We recently held our General Managers Conference in Arizona. It was our first leadership conference since the pandemic and all of us have been inspired by the level of passion, dedication and talent of our store management and field teams. Today, we are reporting strong results for the second quarter of 2024, which were driven by our Q2 improved top line trends, market share gains and continued delivery on our commitment to profitability. In Q2, our comp came in at negative 3.3% and we exceeded profitability estimates with an operating margin of 16.2% and earnings per share of $1.74, reflecting the 2-for-1 stock split we completed in July. We are pleased with our strong operating results and the operational improvements that produced these results. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our margin profile even in a difficult market. There is no doubt that the Home Furnishings market is challenged due to the uncertainty in the economy, coupled with slow housing. This leads us to believe that we may not see the back half acceleration that we expected despite all of the hard work we've done to improve our product offer and our customer experience. Therefore, we believe, it is prudent to reduce our top line outlook for the balance of the year, while continuing to deliver on our commitment to profitability, and in fact, we are raising our bottom line guidance. We are now expecting full year revenues to come in at range of down 4% to down 1.5%, but we are raising our guidance on operating margin to be in the range of 17.4% to 17.8%. Now let me review progress on our three key priorities that we outlined with you back in March: first, returning to growth; second, elevating our world-class customer service; and third, driving margin. I'll start with an update on returning to growth. Our improved top line trend outperformed the industry decline in the second quarter and we maintained our commitment to not offering site wide promotions. A key element of our return to growth strategy is our focus on innovation on our product lines across brands, including substantially more newness across our assortments. And our unique in-house design capabilities and vertically-integrated sourcing organization allows us to offer this high-quality design innovation at compelling price points. The next key component of our return to growth strategy is our commitment to improving our channel experiences. Our investment in our proprietary e-commerce technology serves as a competitive advantage versus our peers. From product discovery and selection to personalization, content, customer care and the final mile, our team is constantly thinking about how to elevate and evolve our best-in-class e-commerce experience. In the quarter, we've been focused on expanding our online content and providing more inspiration in the shop path to drive conversion. And of course, we cannot forget our best-in-class retail business. We have continued to improve our in-store experience with inspirational new products, improved in-stock inventory levels and next level design services, including our new design tool that allows for 3D rendering. As our teams reminded us at our General Managers Conference this year, we really do have the best team in retail, and our retail optimization efforts continue transforming our store fleet to be positioned in the most profitable, inspiring and strategic locations. Now let's talk through progress on our second and third key priorities, which go hand-in-hand. We continue to make progress improving our world-class customer service and driving margin contributing significantly to the operating margin we reported today. One of the foundational principles upon which this company is built is that the customer is at the center of everything we do and their satisfaction is key to our operating performance. Without our customers, truly nothing else matters. And in Q2, we continued to make meaningful improvements in our customer service metrics. The supply chain team continues to reduce costs, by limiting out-of-market and multiple shipments, fewer customer accommodations, lower returns and damages and reduced replacements. And our ongoing commitment to not running site-wide promotions and the reduction of our promotional offerings have improved margins. We are focused on delivering a compelling, value equation to our customers, which in turn maximizes our full price selling. Now, I'd like to update you on the performance of our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 7.1% comp in Q2. Improvements in trends were driven by our compelling product assortments in coastal decorating and entertaining and seasonal holidays. We saw success in our new summer furniture launches and are optimistic about our fall furniture newness with a focus on proprietary finishes and design. Looking ahead to the back half, we have a strong holiday lineup that is off to a great start. There is no one else like us in the market with the incredible assortment of seasonal decorating for Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and Hanukkah and we are building on successful new programs that we have launched. The Pottery Barn Children's Business ran at positive 1.5% comp in Q2, a continuation of our positive comp trend in the first quarter of the year. Innovation across our product offering and improvement in the shopping experience have been key to delivering this growth. In these life-stage brands, back-to-school was a highlight with Dorm driving double-digits growth. In this space, we continue to attract new customers with our market-leading design, excellent quality and sustainability promise. We have bolstered the shopping experience with a suite of digital shopping tools and expanded in-store services, including three Dorm design services and convenient shipping options to any of our stores near campuses. Product collaborations also continue to drive sales with existing and new customers. We're especially pleased with our recent collaboration with Roller Rabbit and we are seeing continued success with LoveShackFancy. Now, let's review West Elm, which ran a negative 4.8% comp in Q2. The brand continues to see success in new product introductions, with both summer and fall newness driving double digits positive comp to last year. And this month, we are thrilled to drop our first catalog in the brand since holiday 2021. Additionally, West Elm launched a very exciting second collaboration with the fashion brand, Rhode, following a successful debut last year. This new collection features 120 pieces, including a re-launch of past favorites combined with new textiles, tabletop, lighting, decorative accessories, bath rugs and a collection of items designed for college dorms. This collaboration is on track to do more than double the initial launch last year. Given the positive trends in newness and exciting collaborations in the pipeline, we have a sizable opportunity in West Elm as it rebalances more inventory into these new products. The Williams-Sonoma brand ran a negative 0.8% comp in Q2. In the quarter, we benefited from the performance of our new and exclusive products, offset by some tough compares in electrics. Sales from summer newness were up double digits to last year and we're seeing strength in new and premium products found only at Williams-Sonoma. The strategy to offer our customers' quality product they can't find anywhere else is working, and we are excited about our robust second half lineup of in-house design products and exclusives. The Williams-Sonoma brand remains focused on delivering immersive culinary experiences in store, online and at key events across the country. In store, we've inspired thousands of customers through our Sunday Skills series and demos teaching customers from how to sous it to how to make ice cream. Our Tools for Change campaign supporting No Kid Hungry, celebrated its 10th Anniversary this July. To date, we're proud to have raised over $16 million to help No Kid Hungry and end childhood hunger in America. We're grateful to all the chefs and celebrities that have contributed designs to our spatulas over the years. As we listen to the second half, we will continue inspiring our customers to cook, host and entertain for the holidays. This fall, the brand will launch the art of entertaining, where customers can benefit from expert advice on everything from setting a table to hosting a dinner party to floral arranging techniques and to napkin folding tricks. We believe this focus on holidays and celebrations will not just drive volume in key categories, but will also cement the brand as the ultimate celebration destination in retail for new and existing customers. And lastly, we're excited about the momentum of our Williams-Sonoma Home business which ran at slight positive comp in Q2. Now I'd like to update you on our other initiatives. Business-to-business continued its momentum in Q2 growing 11.5%, with record quarterly contract volume growing 21.6%, while trade grew 7.1%. The hospitality space remains strong with notable wins at the Sheraton Boston, the Hilton Beverly Hills, Renaissance Las Vegas and under canvas for the Yosemite location. We have launched a new brand standard program with IHG's, Hotel Indigo brand being named a preferred vendor for lighting and upholstery categories. We're also seeing strong momentum in the multifamily space including growing partnerships with Korman Communities and the Discovery Land Company. And we are thrilled to partner with St. Jude to develop custom beds and nightstands for their Ranch for Children project in Nevada. Now, I'd like to talk about our global business. While we continue to navigate global macroeconomic pressures, our strategic initiatives are delivering positive results across key strategic markets including India, Canada and Mexico. The Canadian market continues to show strength, driven by growth from enhanced design services, emerging brands and omni-channel services. In Mexico, we are optimistic about our brand's performance in the market with strength driven by all brands with the most significant contribution coming from PB Kids. We'll be opening two new stores by the end of the year and three more set to open in early 2025. Finally, India remains a key area of growth for us. We're excited to expand the West Elm brand with two additional locations in new markets by the end of the year. Overall, our assortment, market and service strategies are the differentiators for continued growth in our global markets. Lastly, I'd like to update you on our emerging brands. Rejuvenation delivered another double-digits quarter. We're very optimistic about Rejuvenation's performance with four consecutive quarters of positive comps. Their unwavering focus on delivering the highest quality products has allowed them to gain market share. The trend of home updates, particularly in kitchens and bathrooms continues with notable growth in cabinet and bath hardware and lighting. Additionally, our growth categories including window hardware, textiles, home furnishings and organization solutions, also performed well providing our customers with the perfect finishing touches to complete their spaces. Mark and Graham, our monogrammed gifting business also drove a high double-digits growth in Q2. They saw success with our coastal and beach products for the home and on the go and had strong gifting sales in golf and personalized games. They've recently launched the Monogram Wedding Shoppe as well as Mark and Graham Kids, which will be an exciting incremental growth strategy for the brand. Finally, GreenRow, our newest brand, continues to grow and expand its assortment of vintage-inspired colorful furnishings that are sustainably sourced and designed to last. This month, GreenRow launched a new collection of thoughtfully made products over 150 new items and a new catalog. The brand continues to innovate and create unique and differentiated products that fill a void in the market. We look forward to continued growth and exciting new products and partnerships in the coming months for GreenRow. In summary, we are pleased with our strong operating results. Our revised outlook today reflects our prudent view of the top-line and the confidence we have in our profitability profile. Despite the macro uncertainty, we remain focused on our key priorities for 2024 that are driving the results we announced today. During the last few years, we as a company have navigated, learned, optimized and built all in preparation for our next chapter of growth. We have a strong omni-channel platform with an exclusive lifestyle offering and a sophisticated distribution network with additional capacity. With that, I will turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers and our outlook in more detail. The cadence of sales for us isn't really a relevant indicator. I know you all love to ask the question and also how this quarter is going, but it doesn't really amount to much in terms of predicting where we're going to be. Remember, as we look to the back half, we have a big ramp in seasonal businesses. And that is not - so what's happening now is not the same as what could happen then. And back-to-school is a great example. Innovation is a key part of our strategy and especially in our life stage and seasonal holidays, where we're seeing great response and back-to-school is no different. It's actually one of our highlights. We've really seen our initiatives, particularly in Dorm, really gain traction, and we're really gaining share in the Dorm market serving the customer with very high-quality products. It's significantly positive. We're chasing inventory, its high margin, and it's driven by both the product in bedding, also our no nail solutions, bath and flooring. It's also driven by our exclusive collaborations such as LoveShackFancy and Roller Rabbit, which has been fantastic for that demo, and then our channel functionality. So, for example, Dorm functionality launched earlier on the site this year, which we think was really good for our customers to be able to consider, what they would buy before they actually get into school. And we had a shareable Dorm wish list, a bedding visualizer and then retail. We really pushed Dorm at retail both in our kids' stores, our teen stores and we did a small setup in our Pottery Barn stores to really help drive awareness to build that market share. We've also worked with partners and influencers to drive awareness and driving traffic off the Pottery Barn website to the dorm and back-to-school shop has been another critical part of what we're doing. Thanks, Peter. Our multi-brand portfolio is clearly an advantage in a lot of ways, but particularly in marketing. Our cross-brand customers performed significantly better than other customers. In fact, they're 4x more valuable. And we've really been committed, as you all know, to not running a promotional business. There's a lot of people out there that probably would push a few more comp points by running markdowns. We've chosen not to do that. We know having done this for a long time that the long-term investment in the fundamentals is more important than the short-term markdowns that give you an immediate pop and create all sorts of peaks and valleys, which aren't good for operations. Advertising investment done correctly, builds customer growth. And so, they also drive short-term sales. So it's a short-term sales and a long-term play with new customers. And like anything else we do, we are constantly looking for opportunities to spend the last dollar more effectively, and that changes season-by-season, brand-by-brand and marketing program by marketing program. Our loyalty program is another key part of this and very effective. These again are our best customers, and we have the credit card program and we also have the non-credit card key rewards program, which has been very effective. I'd say, the last thing that we are doing that is, I think a competitive advantage and something that we're doing more of than we did last year, substantially is amplifying our creator-led content. So creator-led content, YouTube, TikTok, Meta, it's helping us reach new audiences and it's very effective. It's an area that we're building in-house, and we're really excited about our leadership position as we go forward, because we think this is very, very relevant for our customers. Thanks for the question, Christina. We're constantly setting all the customer metrics to find anything that we can read into and build upon. It's interesting, furniture actually picked up from Q1, not as much as we wanted it to, but it's better than it was. The other areas are still better than furniture. Leading to the strategy of really focused on the seasonal holidays, where no one else really plays and these life stages, while the consumer is still not really buying a lot of new houses. In terms of price points, interesting question. We have a lot of newness. It's working. It's very exciting, particularly in West Elm, where we have the most amount of newness. It's not in low price points. It's in the medium to high price points and that's also really, I think a good piece of information for us. We are giving the customer great value. So we're not trying to develop things at higher price points. We're trying to develop the best value products at every price point. I've said it before, but the truth is where we have a lot of innovation, our prices are the best in the market and no one has tried to copy us yet on the newness, which is why we're pushing newness as a key strategy in the back half as a percent to total. As we continue to have these seasons click by and get confidence on the newness, we can buy more into it. We usually have a pretty long cycle on that product growing before it declines. Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian. We continue to see consistent high levels of promotions in the marketplace in also the forms from site-wide promotions, free shipping, reduction of prices across the board, double rewards, all of it. And we have played those games and know that they don't work, and you're competing with yourself more than you are with your peers and your competitors. It's really important that you give your customer great value. They look at that price and they know what other things cost similarly to it in the market. But the up and down to get a short-term pop that drives a short-term comp is not a good way to run your business. And so we are committed, as I said before, to running our business without those high levels of promotion. And actually, as much as we've been saying this for the past couple of years, we're still pushing this out of our base. And so in Q1 and Q2, we significantly improved our regular price percent to total, and our regular price comps are significantly better than the markdown comps. So the reality is our guidance, as Jeff mentioned, has a wide range. And it's that we expected the back half to accelerate. I think we all thought we'd have an interest rate cut or at least 1 or 2 by now, which we haven't seen, right? So instead of hoping for housing to turn around, we put the range together to reflect if the back half is little to the first half. And that seems, I know, conservative because of the multiyear comps getting easier in the back half. But we just thought it was prudent, given the uncertainty in the macro, to reduce the top line so that we're not pressured to take promos to hit the number. We want to run this business for the long term, and that's what we've been doing, and you're seeing the continued performance on the bottom line. And I'll just say this, we've said before, can you imagine what this thing looks like when you get some positive comps. And the best way for me to describe it is our operating model is a coiled spring. Absolutely not, but we are on offense with our product innovation and our marketing. Yes, as I said earlier, there's not lot to read there because the newness that's in the mid-price points are really working. We're not seeing a trade down. Furnitures is better than it was, but future is still soft, right? And it's a big portion of both the West Elm and Pottery Barn businesses, which is why the complexion is very different in those versus the more life stage kids and teen brand and also Williams-Sonoma. So yes, there's nothing really to read into that. What we do see is that they're not waiting for promotions to the point that they don't -- they're not worried that they're going to feel done if they don't want to the promotion, they can buy it when they need it. And our sales associates are thrilled that they can sell with confidence and not always be looking into a promo calendar to see when the next sale is. Thank you so much for the question. Yes, newness and innovation are really key parts of our strategy to drive growth, and we've seen a really strong response to newness. In West Elm, we've talked about newnesses checking across all categories, in particular in furniture. And in fact, we've seen double-digit positive comps in both West Elm summer and fall new furniture introductions. Now why you're not seeing that roll into the bigger number yet is because it's still a small percent of total because you want to make sure your newness is working before you bet the farm on it. We've had some great collaborations in West Elm. I touched on Rhodes. Rhodes this year is double last year. We introduced [indiscernible], who's an amazing shaft who has incredible furniture designs that we've introduced and that's also been a great one. In Pottery Barn, we're seeing a good response to our newness there too, especially in furniture and the seasonal decorating, which we're launching earlier than we've ever launched before. I am so thrilled to see people scooping up Christmas this early. They also have some great new collaborations in the hopper and are going to have an increased amount of collaborations next year. Kids and team have always been, in our company, our leader in collaborations and just amazing from the license programs that we run, the [indiscernible] to incredible designers like [indiscernible] and LoveShackFancy. They've really been able to hit the nail on the head with what their consumer wants at every life stage. And kids is different than teens, but we're covering both, and you can really see that we're on trend by the results in dorm. Williams-Sonoma, the branded product in Williams-Sonoma doing incredibly well. I'll give you 1 very specific example in Williams-Sonoma, which is our Williams-Sonoma branded cutlery. Higher margin, obviously, than the names out there that we all are familiar with and really rivaling them in volume. And there's also a lot of exclusives that we have and launch leads that we have with our key electrics partners and premium cookware. The Tucci collaboration, by the way, continues to be phenomenal, and we are not done with the innovation that Tucci is going to be bringing, not just for the back half, but through next year. And so we're excited about our -- we really excited about our back half lineup in Williams-Sonoma. We can't go into -- I mean I'd really like to talk about some of those things a little bit more, but I I'm always cautious about competition and not giving away too much information. But the punchline is, we have seen a very strong response to newness and collaborations. And Marni, you are right. We are doing things differently with our creator-led content about collaborations. When you combine a collaboration with an influencer on TikTok, you have magic. And we are continuing to build that scale and really draw in new customers through those channels. So thank you. Great question. I would say that housing is clearly a big driver of furniture sales. And we all know housing is about the worst it's been. But at the same time, there's a lot of people calling to the bottom here. And hopefully, we see an interest rate and multiple cuts in the next six months. Could take a little bit of time for that to flow through, but when people feel better, they tend to shop more, especially in our categories for their homes. And I really -- I said it before, but we want flexibility because we always want to give the customer greater value, right? So we don't want to overprice products. We want to make sure that our brands are accessible. We want people to be able to come and shop with us and across our brands not be so expensive that it's a very small group of people. So we hold that back to say there is a point at which you don't want to raise the margin too high and not be competitive. On the other hand, we're delivering this incredible margin against negative sales, negative sales a couple of years running here. So can you imagine what this looks like when the sales are flat to positive? I said it before, operating model is a coiled spring. It's very exciting to be sitting here knowing that we have built an organization with structural margin profitability profiles and a lot of innovation and capacity to grow much bigger than we are today without huge step-up investments. Yes. Well, thank you all for joining us. We are entering our favorite time of the year, which is the holidays. And I'll remind you that Halloween is right around the corner, as is Thanksgiving, Christmas and Hanukkah and the New Year. So I hope if you are out there in our stores and seeing all the great product lineups, we are very excited about what we have out there, and I look forward to talking to you next time. So thank you for your support. Appreciate it."

            "name": "Jeff Howie",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to deliver another quarter of strong results, highlighted by our Q2 improved top-line trend, market share gains and earnings that continue to exceed expectations. Laura touched on our three key priorities for fiscal year '24. One, returning to growth, fueled by product innovation and channel experience. Two, elevating our world-class service, which produces both customer retention and expense savings. And three, driving earnings as we continue to deliver strong profitability. These three priorities connect directly to the five key drivers underpinning our strong profitability in Q2. First, our e-commerce sales mix with its higher operating margins sustaining at 66% of total revenues. Second, our retail optimization strategy delivering 3% less occupancy expense inclusive of additional technology and supply chain investments. Third, the pricing power of our in house designed proprietary products and our emphasis on full price selling contributing to a 380 basis point improvement in merchandise margins. Fourth, our supply chain efficiency from our relentless focus on customer service and operational excellence, producing 180 basis points improvement in selling margins. And fifth, our ability to control costs, as we continue to manage variable employment costs materially in line with top-line trends. Given our strong second quarter results, we're confident, we'll continue to gain market share and deliver strong earnings even in this uncertain environment. Now, let's dive into the numbers. I'll start with our Q2 results and then provide an update on guidance for '24. Net revenues finished at $1.79 billion slightly below our expectations. We gained market share as our comp of negative 3.3% outperformed the industry, which declined by approximately 10%. Importantly, we accomplished this EBIT, as we reduced our overall level of promotions in the quarter. Our Q2 comps improved from Q1, reflective of better performance in furniture and continued growth in our non-furniture categories. From a cadence perspective, our trends across the quarter were choppy and inconsistent, reflecting the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Moving down the income statement, gross margin came in at 46.2%, 550 basis points higher than last year and substantially exceeding expectations. There were three drivers to this 550 basis point improvement, merchandise margins, supply chain efficiencies and occupancy costs. Let's start with merchandise margins, which improved 380 basis points. This improvement was driven by our ongoing commitment to full price selling, lower input costs and the residual benefit from lower inbound freight, as we lap last year's pandemic-related ocean freight runoff. Next, supply chain efficiencies contributed 180 basis points. Our commitment to full price selling is smoothing out the peaks and troughs created by promotional activity. This is yielding improved customer service, reduced customer lead times, and significant cost savings for more efficient operations. Key customer service metrics, including returns, accommodations, damages, replacements, out-of-market shipping and multiple deliveries per order are all performing better than pre-pandemic levels. Moreover, we are seeing cost savings across the supply chain for more consistent operations, including warehouse, manufacturing and delivery expenses. Finally, occupancy costs, which were down 3% from last year deleveraged 10 basis points. We continue to optimize our retail fleet, while we invest in our world-class technology stack and our supply chain. During the quarter, we began operating our new Arizona distribution center. This fully-automated facility will replace an outdated distribution center, improve service time to our customers and lower employment and shipping costs. Included in our occupancy cost this quarter were the cost of running both the new and old buildings, which will continue for the balance of fiscal year '24. Wrapping up gross margin, we delivered substantially higher gross margin this quarter. Turning now to SG&A, which came in at 30% of revenues with 390 basis points higher than last year, from higher employment expense and advertising spend. Employment expense was 200 basis points higher year-over-year, mostly from higher performance-based incentive compensation due to our strong EPS performance year-to-date. In Q2, we continue to manage variable employment costs across our stores, distribution centers and customer care centers, materially in line with top-line trends. Advertising expense deleveraged 150 basis points, as we continue to invest into higher levels of advertising spend. Our multi-brand portfolio allows us to test the return of our incremental spend and our own hands-on keyboard approach, allows our investment to go further and keeps our learnings in house. Our advertising model is a key competitive advantage in the home furnishing industry. On the bottom-line, our earnings once again exceeded expectations. Operating income came in at $290 million with operating margin at 16.2%, which was 160 basis points above last year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.74, up $0.18 or 12% year-over-year. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.3 billion with no debt outstanding. This was after we invested $31 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth and we returned $203 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends. Merchandise inventory ended the quarter of $1.2 billion, down 4.1% to last year. Our inventory levels are in line with our top line trends and are well-positioned to support our business. Summing up our Q2 results. We're proud to have delivered yet another quarter of earnings exceeding expectations. I'd like to thank our team at Williams-Sonoma Inc. for delivering these great results. Our recent General Manager's Conference reminded me how our talented, dedicated team is the best in retail and the key to our success. Now let's turn to our '24 outlook. 2024 continues to be a challenging environment for home furnishings due to macroeconomic uncertainty and the slow housing market. This leads us to believe, it's prudent to reduce our top-line outlook for the balance of the year, while raising our operating margin guidance, as we continue to deliver on our commitment to profitability. It's important to note that, our lower sales outlook is offset by our raised operating margin, producing materially similar implied EPS guidance. On the top-line, we now expect full year '24 net revenues to be in the range of down 4% to down 1.5% with comps between down 5.5% to down 3%. Our updated guidance reflects the macroeconomic uncertainty combined with our choppy and inconsistent trends. With this backdrop in mind, we're providing this updated range of outcomes for our top-line. The midpoint of our guide reflects a continuation of the first half economic and consumer dynamics through the back half of '24. The high end of the guide implies some acceleration in industry trends, coupled with increased traction of our growth initiatives. The low end of our guide reflects the recognition that the macroeconomic environment may have a greater impact on our results in the back half of '24. On the bottom-line, we are raising our full year operating margin guidance 40 basis points, based upon our Q2 outperformance. We continue to anticipate our operating margins in the back half will be materially in line with 2023 results. With a 40 basis point increase, we are raising our full year 2024 operating margin to range of 18.0% to 18.4%, which includes a 60 basis point benefit from the full year impact from the Q1 out-of-period adjustment. Without the Q1 out-of-period adjustment, our full year operating margin will now be in the range of 17.4% to 17.8%. Additionally, we expect our full year interest income to be approximately $45 million and our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25.5%. As a reminder, 2024 is a 53-week year for Williams-Sonoma Inc. The fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. We anticipate the additional week will contribute 150 basis points to revenue growth and 10 basis points to operating margins, both of which are embedded in our guidance. We will report comps on a 53-week versus 53-week comparable basis. All other year-over-year compares will be 53-weeks versus 52-weeks. Our capital allocation plan for 2024 remain unchanged. We expect to spend $225 million in capital expenditures to invest in the long-term growth of our business. 75% of this capital spend will be dedicated to driving our e-commerce leadership and supply chain efficiency. As we've communicated quarterly, we're committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We will continue to pay our quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share and have $826 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization, we will continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns for our shareholders. As we look further into the future beyond '24, we are reiterating our long-term guidance of mid-to-high single-digits revenue growth with operating margins in the mid-to-high teens. We're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these five reasons that remain consistent. Our ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishing industry, the strength of our in-house proprietary design, the competitive advantage of our digital first, but not digital only channel strategy, the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet. With that, I'll open the call for questions. Yes, let me start with the shorter holiday season. Our quick answer on that is that the impact is already embedded in our guidance. There's a lot of puts-and-takes on this one for us. For one, a shorter holiday season, each day has to work harder, especially at retail. But this year's calendar with Christmas moving from Monday to Wednesday is more favorable for e-commerce. I think everyone knows, our mix is 66% e-commerce. So that is actually a good guide for us. Then when you think about the back half for us, this year is a 53-week year, so our fourth quarter has 14 weeks in it. Punchline on this is, there's a lot of puts-and-takes for shorter holiday seasons, but it's in our guidance. As we think about the back half, as I said in my prepared remarks, the way we set up our guidance is the midpoint of our guide reflects the continuation of the first half economic and consumer dynamics to the back half. The high end of our guide implies some acceleration in industry trends, coupled with increased traction of our growth initiatives. And if holiday proves out to be better, there could even be upside there. The low end of our guide recognizes the macroeconomic environment may have a greater impact on our results in the back half, but it's so uncertain, we provided really wide range of guidance with those possible outcomes. Yes, Peter, good morning. Couple of questions in there. First one on ocean freight, we're not seeing an impact from higher spot market rates on our ocean freight. We're mostly insulated from the fluctuations in the spot market with our contracted rates. Here is the thing, as you know, one of our competitive advantages is our global supply chain. We're the 11th largest container importer in the United States. We have scale and relationships, others do not. So while there may be challenges in the broader market, especially with smaller competitors, it's not been a factor for us. Any impact is already embedded in our results and our guidance. As far as China goes, we significantly reduced our China-sourced goods from the last time this came up back in 2018. Back then, it was 50% of all of our imports were from China. Now that number is down to 25%. And of that 25%, a third of them already have a Trump tariff on them, which we've been paying and are still on them. The fact that, if this does come up and tariffs are expanded, we're prepared to reduce it further. We've mapped out a category-by-category plan to reduce China sourcing if the landscape changes. I think the important point here is 90% of our products are proprietary, designed and exclusively made for our brands, and we operate our own in house best-in-class global sourcing operation with 12 overseas offices. It's our own boots on the ground, managing sourcing decisions, production and shipping. If the landscape changes, we're well-positioned to pivot. Yes, thanks for asking that, Christina. Q2 operating margin exceeded our expectations for three reasons. The first is in merchandise margins, which were stronger than anticipated driven by our focus on full price selling. We continue to see positive customer response to our consistent pricing and focus on selling and service versus price. The second thing is our supply chain efficiencies also came in better, really attributable to our commitment to full price selling, smoothing out the peaks and troughs driven by promotional activity. This is delivering significant cost savings from more consistent operations across our manufacturing, operating and delivery expenses. And third, we deleverage advertising expense less in Q2 than in Q1. As Laura said before, we continue to evaluate our spend and adjust weekly as we see the effectiveness. Here's what I'd like you to remember as we continue to deliver strong profitability despite the tough environment for home furnishings. And Simeon, I would just add, I talked about it in my prepared remarks and answering Christina's question, but by not running the promos like we did in smoothing out the peaks and troughs of the promotional activity, it's really driving improved customer service, shorter lead times and much more efficient operations across our entire supply chain, which is really flowing through to the bottom-line. It is the right way to think about it. And while we don't guide to specific lines, we are guiding that our operating margin in the back half will be flat with 2023 really because of some of the benefits that we had in the front half [Technical Difficulty] we were up against the impact of the pandemic-related ocean freight runoff. That was worth about 200 basis points, good guide in the first half. And then our focus on full price selling really kicked in, in the back half of '23. So we have that upside by focusing on that in the front half. And in fact, if we look at our percentage of full-price selling in Q2 of '24, it's about the same rate as it was in Q3 '23. So that dissipates as well. So like we said, we were up against some easier compares in the front half on the margin line that starts to dissipate in the back half, which is why we're giving that guidance on operating margin for the back half. Yes. I think Laura on the fact that -- yes, when we run promotions, we're really competing with ourselves a lot of time. And I think many of you heard me talk about the concept of shift versus lift and how much of the promotions are really incremental versus just moving it around and incentivizing the customer to wait for it to go on sale. So now we can really focus on serving the customers, selling to them, helping them with their design project. And the customer is not waiting for that next promotion, they're engaging on the design side. Well, look, our long-term operating margin guidance is mid to high teens. And our guidance for this year puts us right back in the middle of that range. Certainly, sales are accelerating. We expect possibly some more margin expansion, but we've provided a range because there's a lot of variables in there. And we're pretty confident in our ability to sustain this profitability. We've demonstrated it -- last year, we delivered at $64 million. This year, we're guiding in the mid-17. So this is sustainable, and we're confident in our operating margin going forward. Seth. So on the operating margin outlook for the back half, we've consistently said all year that we anticipate that our back half operating margins would be flat year-over-year. What we've done this quarter is we've raised based upon our Q2 outperformance. In terms of the puts and takes on margin, we don't necessarily guide the individual lines, but we will give you some color commentary like I did before. The gross margin, some of the benefits that we had coming at us in the front half start to wind down in the back half. That includes the supply chain headwinds we're up against in the first half, which, as I said before, it was worth about 200 basis points. And then we start lapping the improved promos in the back half. So we see that as being essentially flat. And then just overall, this is true for our entire guidance is the macroeconomic uncertainty. We're taking a very prudent approach to our back half guidance given the macroeconomic backdrop. And if things are better, and we see some better performance in holiday, we could surprise the upside. But at the same time, if the macroeconomic environment is more challenging, we'll be more at the low end of our guidance. Yes. I mean, look, Seth, we don't guide individual lines, and we do that just got top line and operating margins that give us the flexibility to pull the levers we need to deliver results. And as you've seen, we know how to deliver results. In terms of [indiscernible] we have, certainly, ad cost is flexible, as Laura mentioned before. We evaluate this on almost a weekly basis depending upon the returns we're seeing and the effectiveness of the advertising. And then our employment, like I've said many times before and in my prepared remarks, our employment is largely variable. The majority of our employment is in our stores, our distribution centers and our customer care centers, and we can flex that in line with top line trends as things evolve. So I think the punchline here is, we're guiding flat operating margin guidance in the context of a very uncertain macroeconomic environment, and we're taking a very prudent approach with this guidance. And we're giving ourselves the flexibility to pull levers as we need to deliver the results."

[Operator Instructions]\n I would now like to turn the call over to Jeremy Brooks, Chief Accounting Officer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJeremy Brooks: Good morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to future events and financial performance, including our updated guidance for fiscal '24 and our long-term outlook. We believe these statements reflect our best estimates. However, we cannot make any assurances these statements will materialize  and actual results may differ significantly from our expectations. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after today's call. \n Additionally, for the first quarter of last year, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure appears in Exhibit 1 to the press release we issued earlier this morning. \n Also, for the first quarter of this year, we will refer to our GAAP results, both with and without the benefit of an out-of-period adjustment that we recorded during the first quarter. We believe providing these disclosures is useful to understanding our quarterly financial results. Jeff will share the details of this adjustment later in his prepared remarks. This call should also be considered in conjunction with our filings with the SEC. And finally, a replay of this call will be available on our Investor Relations website. \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Laura Alber, our President and Chief Executive Officer. \nLaura Alber: Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Before we review our Q1 results, I want to take a moment to thank all of our teams around the globe for their consistent contributions to our company. We could not continue to produce strong earnings without their cross-functional collaboration and dedication. \n We are pleased to deliver strong results in the first quarter of 2024, driven by an improving top line trend and continued strength in our profitability. In Q1, our comps came in above expectations at negative 4.9%, and we exceeded profitability estimates with an operating margin of 19.5% and earnings per share of $4.07. \n It is important to note that the results of the first quarter include a benefit of $49 million, resulting from the reversal of freight-related accruals that we determined were not required, which contributed 290 basis points to our operating margin and $0.59 to our EPS. Jeff will walk you through this in more detail, but it is worth noting that even without the impact of this benefit, we significantly exceeded profitability expectations. As a result of our outperformance, we are raising our outlook on operating margin to now be in the range of 17.6% to 18% or 17% to 17.4%, when excluding the impact of the freight accrual reversal. \n The strong results for the quarter are a result of our focus on our 3 key priorities in 2024: returning to growth; elevating our world-class customer service; and driving margin. I'll start first with returning to growth. We are pleased with the improvement in our top line trends and our market share gains in Q1. We are keenly focused on innovation in our product line across brands. And our unique in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated sourcing organizations allows us to offer this high-quality design innovation at compelling price points. \n Another key component of our return-to-growth strategy is our marketing capabilities. Our in-house digital marketing optimization backed by our world-class customer analytics and our first-party data collection serves as a competitive advantage for our company. In the quarter, we increased our ad spend and invested in both our paid marketing and our proven social strategy. This investment allowed us to drive sales improvement to acquire new customers and to gain market share. \n Additionally, we are continuing to improve our online experience through our investment in our proprietary e-commerce technology. From product discovery and selection to personalization to concept to customer care and to the final mile, our team is constantly thinking about how we can improve our best-in-class e-commerce experience. \n And one way we do this is through AI. We believe our leadership in AI will be another competitive advantage. And it's important to not forget that as focused as we are on our digital capabilities, we are passionate about our service and our best-in-class retail business. We have improved our in-store experience with inspirational products, improved in-stock inventory levels and next level in-store services. Our teams are the best in retail, and our retail optimization efforts are transforming our fleet to be positioned in the most profitable, inspiring and strategic locations. \n Moving to our second and third key priorities in 2024, which are inextricably intertwined. We continue to make progress improving our world-class customer service and driving margins. The customer is at the center of everything we do, and their satisfaction is key to our operating performance. \n We are pleased with our high Net Promoter Scores, both in-store and in home, but we see more opportunity to improve. We know that providing our associates with new tools and training has a direct impact on our customer experience. And we are thrilled to bring back our annual store manager conference in Q2 of this year. This multi-day offsite meeting is an opportunity for all of our store managers to participate in strategic training. \n The improvement in customer service also comes from supply chain efficiencies. We are reducing costs by limiting out of market and multiple shipments, fewer customer accommodations, lower returns and damages and reduce replacements. These improvements will continue to contribute meaningfully to our profitability in 2024 and beyond. And our ongoing commitment to not running site-wide promotions and the reduction of our promotional offerings have also improved margins. We are focused on delivering our compelling value equation to our customers, which in turn, maximizes our full price selling. \n Now I'd like to update you on the performance of our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 10.8% comp in Q1. We continue to see softness in higher ticket furniture sales in Pottery Barn, but we've seen quarter-over-quarter improvement. We're having success in our proprietary print and pattern across textiles and easy decorating updates continue to drive sales. Highlights include newness in our Bloom shop, frames and decor. Our strength in seasonal celebrations also continues to resonate with our customers. \n In March, we launched our first ever global collaboration with international icon, Deepika Padukone. Her popularity drove 1 billion impressions for the Pottery Barn brand. Customers also embrace the launch of our Coastal Lookbook, and they positively engaged with our newly developed apps. In the back half of this year, we're excited to introduce new innovation, both in-store with compelling new floor sets and online with improved digital shopping experience. \n The Pottery Barn children's business ran a positive 2.8% comp in Q1. Across these life-stage businesses, we drove widespread comp trend improvement in the business. We've seen excellent customer response to our new product introductions with collaborations being a particular highlight. Our recent launches with partners such as LoveShackFancy and Lilly Pulitzer have driven sales and attracted new customers by tapping into relevant fashion and home decor trends. \n In Baby, we're seeing double-digit registry growth and excellent customer response to our expanded essentials and gifting. In dorm, we recently launched our biggest collection to date with expanded XL twin bedding options, new no-nails wall decor and innovative storage solutions. In addition to the expanded assortment, we are excited to roll out improved dorm product selection functionality. And customers can also ship dorm products to any one of our company-owned stores near their college campus. \n Moving to West Elm. In Q1, West Elm drove sequential improvement in its top line trend, running a negative 4.1% comp in the quarter. We're encouraged to see improvement in West Elm's demand trend even as we materially pull back on promotions. We are seeing strength in our new product sales with our spring units driving positive comp to last year, with particularly strong performance out of furniture, kids and decorative accessories. \n Summer newness is also off to a great start with double and triple-digit newness comps. Given the positive trends in newness, we have a sizable opportunity in West Elm as it rebalances more inventory into these new products. \n The Williams-Sonoma brand ran a positive 0.9% comp in Q1. This is the second consecutive quarter the Williams-Sonoma brand ran a positive comp with the Williams-Sonoma Kitchen business running a positive comp for the fourth consecutive quarter. During Q1, we inspired customers with exclusive and innovative products. We benefited from new introductions of Williams-Sonoma branded products in categories like bakeware, cutlery and food. The favorable customer response to these items continues to reinforce the opportunity we have to the Williams-Sonoma branded business. \n In March, our co-branded collaborations drove media attention and results. Our popular collaboration with Aerin Lauder was expanded to include new items for both Williams-Sonoma and Williams-Sonoma Home. We also partnered with Trisha Yearwood to make our best-selling cocktail collaboration the official drink of our new 55,000 square foot bar and restaurant in Nashville that she built with her husband, Garth Brooks. \n Now I'd like to update you on our other initiatives. Business-to-business grew 10% in Q1, driving record-breaking demand in the quarter. We saw improvement in our trade business, running a positive 6% on the quarter, along with continued momentum in our contract business, which represents about 1/3 of the B2B business up 18%. We're encouraged by our diverse book of businesses ranging from sofas for UT San Diego dorms to corporate gifting for Pebble Beach Company. We also saw continued growth for our existing large project customers such as Marriott, Dave & Buster's and Jamestown properties. \n Now I'd like to talk about our global business. Despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures impacting our global business, we're pleased with the performance in key markets, including India, Canada and Mexico. In India, we are continuing to see strong growth from increased marketing and brand awareness campaigns across the brands. In Canada, our business is thriving in both the retail and direct-to-consumer channels, driven by enhanced omnichannel strategy, wider product selection and the expansion of our business-to-business program across all brands in the market. \n And in Mexico, the market showed strength driven by a focus on the design business and expanded assortment fueled by our improved stock position. We will continue to leverage the knowledge gained from these markets to enhance the global customer experience in our new and emerging markets. \n Lastly, I'd like to update you on emerging brands. Rejuvenation delivered another double-digit quarter. We saw all categories drive growth and continue to see success with both consumer and trade customers. The brand remains focused on delivering high-quality products that support your home remodel and refresh projects. \n The strongest performance comes from bath, hardware and lighting, while we also see strength in several of our new growth categories like textiles, organization, window hardware and outdoor. Customers continue to update their homes, specifically in the kitchen and bath spaces and add the finishing touches with Rejuvenation. We are excited by the momentum in this brand and the growth potential this year and beyond. \n Mark and Graham, our monogram gifting business, also drove a double-digit comp growth in Q1. The brand is increasingly recognized as an inspirational lifestyle brand experiencing continued growth as a go-to destination for gifts, including graduations and weddings. Q2 has started strong with a positive reception to the brand's Mother's Day and Father's Day gift selections.\n And finally, GreenRow, our newest brand, continues to grow and expand its assortment of vintage-inspired colorful furnishings that are sustainably sourced and designed to last. The second catalog dropped this month with a focus on print and pattern. We are seeing a very positive response to its unique offerings in the market and look forward to seeing additional assortment expansions and partnerships in the coming months. Being successful in exciting emerging brands demonstrate our ability to develop new businesses that expand our portfolio and address white space in the market. \n In summary, we are extremely proud of our results. During the last few years, we, as a company, have navigated, learned, optimized and built all in preparation for our next chapter of growth. We have a strong omnichannel platform with an exclusive lifestyle offering and a sophisticated distribution network with additional capacity. We recognize that there is continued uncertainty with the environment and the consumer. \n But because we operate in a highly fragmented market, we will continue to gain share by inspiring and servicing our customers. We remain committed to driving our 3 key priorities in 2024: one, returning to growth; two, elevating our world-class customer service; and three, driving margins. \n And with that, I will turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers and our outlook in more detail. \nJeff Howie: Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to deliver these strong Q1 results. We've seen sequential improvement in our top line trend and we continue to exceed expectations on the bottom line. \n As Laura said, our results this quarter reflect 3 keys we've laid out for fiscal year '24. First, returning to growth, fueled by our brand strategies, emerging brand opportunities, business-to-business expansion and global footprint; second, elevating our world-class service, which drives both customer retention and expense savings; and finally, third, driving earnings as we continue to deliver strong profitability. \n These 3 themes resonate across our earnings today. And given our strong Q1 results, we're confident we can deliver long-term growth and even stronger earnings as the customer shifts back to home. \n Now let's dive into the numbers. I'll start with our Q1 results and then provide an update on guidance for '24. Net revenues finished at $1.66 billion, in line with our expectations. Our comp of negative 4.9% sequentially improved quarter-over-quarter. We saw better performance across both furniture and nonfurniture categories even as we reduced our overall level of promotions from last year. From a cadence perspective, our trends were relatively consistent across the quarter. \n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin came in at 48.3%, which includes a $49 million or 290 basis point benefit from an out-of-period adjustment. Subsequent to filing our 10-K, we identified that we over accrued freight expense across fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023 by $49 million. Following the prescribed accounting rules, we determined the over accrual was not material to any prior period and not material to our projected full year '24 results. Therefore, we recorded the correction in Q1 as an out-of-period adjustment that benefited our results this quarter. Without the out-of-period adjustment, gross margin came in at 45.4%, 680 basis points higher than last year and substantially exceeding expectations. \n There were 3 drivers to the 680 basis point improvement. First, merchandise margins improved 470 basis points, driven by lower ocean freight as we benefited from lapping last year's pandemic-related ocean freight runoff and our ongoing commitment to full-price selling. \n Second, supply chain efficiencies contributed 240 basis points, driven by lower than pre-pandemic returns, accommodations, damages, replacements, out-of-market shipping and multiple deliveries per order. These supply change efficiencies are yielding a notable improvement in customer service and cost savings. \n And third, occupancy costs, although down 3% from last year, deleveraged 30 basis points. We continue to optimize our retail fleet, while we invest in our world-class technology stack and our supply chain. Wrapping up our gross margin, we delivered substantially higher gross margin this quarter, driven by better merchandise margins, supply chain efficiencies and lower occupancy costs. \n Turning now to SG&A. SG&A expense came in at 28.8% of revenues or 310 basis points higher than last year, driven by higher advertising spend, and incentive compensation. Advertising expense deleveraged 170 basis points as we continue to invest into higher levels of advertising spend to drive sales at an efficient return. Our multi-brand portfolio allows us to test the return of this incremental spend. Our own hands-on-keyboard approach allows our investment to go further, keeps our learnings in-house and gives us a competitive advantage in the home furnishings industry. \n Employment expense was 100 basis points higher year-over-year, driven entirely by higher performance-based incentive compensation. Without incentive compensation, employment was flat year-over-year on a rate basis. In Q1, we continue to manage variable employment costs across our stores, distribution centers and customer care centers in accordance with top line trends. \n On the bottom line, our earnings significantly exceeded expectations. Including the benefit from the out-of-period adjustment, operating income came in at $323.8 million; operating margin was 19.5%; and diluted earnings per share was $4.07. The out-of-period adjustment increased operating income by $49 million; operating margin by 290 basis points; and earnings per share by $0.59. \n Without the out-of-period adjustment, our earnings still significantly exceeded expectations. Operating income came in at $274.8 million; operating margin was 16.6%, 370 basis points above last year; and diluted earnings per share was $3.48, up $0.84 or 32% year-over-year. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.3 billion with no debt outstanding. This was after we invested $40 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth, and we returned $107 million to our shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Merchandise inventories ended the quarter at $1.2 billion, down 13% to last year. Overall, our inventories are well positioned to support our business. \n Summing up our Q1 results. We're proud to have delivered another quarter of earnings substantially exceeding expectations. I'd like to thank our talented dedicated team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. for delivering these outstanding results. \n Now let's turn to our '24 outlook. Given our Q1 results, we are reiterating our revenue guidance and raising our operating margin guidance for fiscal year '24. On the top line, we continue to expect full year '24 net revenues to be in the range of down 3% to up 3%, with comps between down 4.5% to up 1.5%. We anticipate sequential improvement across the year, with the first half tougher than the second half as our top line comparisons get easier and our growth drivers accelerate. \n On the bottom line, we are raising our guidance based upon our Q1 results, but anticipate our operating margins going forward will be relatively in line with '23 results. We are raising our operating margin guidance to a range of 17.6% to 18%, which includes a 60 basis point benefit from the full year impact of the out-of-period adjustment.\n Without the out-of-period adjustment, we expect our full year operating margin will be in the range of 17% to 17.4%, a raise of 50 basis points due to our strong Q1 results. Additionally, we expect our full year interest income to be approximately $40 million and our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25.5%. \n As a reminder, 2024 is a 53-week year for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. So the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. We anticipate the additional week will contribute 150 basis points to revenue growth and 10 basis points to operating margins, both of which are embedded in our guidance. We will report comps on a 53-week versus 53-week comparable basis. All other year-over-year compares will be 53 weeks versus 52 weeks. \n Our capital allocation plans for '24 remain unchanged. We expect to spend $225 million in capital expenditures to invest in the long-term growth of our business. 75% of this capital spend will be dedicated to drive our e-commerce leadership and supply chain efficiency. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and ongoing share repurchases. \n For dividends, in March, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend payout of 26% or $0.23 to $1.13 per share. Fiscal year '24 will be the 15th consecutive year of increased dividend payouts, which we are both proud of and remain committed to. For share repurchases, we have $956 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization through which we will opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns to our shareholders. \n As we look further into the future beyond '24, we are reiterating our long-term guidance of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth with operating margins in the mid- to high teens. We're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these 5 reasons that remain consistent: our ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishings industry; the strength of our in-house proprietary design; the competitive advantage of our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy; the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives; and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet. \n With that, I'll open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. \nKatharine McShane: I have one kind of bigger picture question and then one question with regards to the accounting that was stated today. So first, we wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the big ticket trends you're seeing. I know you noted better performance in furniture. But we're curious to build down on that a little bit more in terms of what you saw in Q1 versus maybe what you were seeing in Q4. \n And then with regards to the accounting, we're wondering with regards to the COGS change, why it's only '21 through '23 and why there's not an impact to Q1 '24. \nLaura Alber: Kate, it's Laura. In terms of big ticket, Q4 is not a big furniture time of the year. Of course, the comps are comparable. We don't bring in a lot of newness in Q4. But we are seeing improvements in our furniture business, and high ticket has always been one of those things -- you have to remember, we have electrics in high ticket, we have a lot of other types of products in high ticket that aren't furniture. But we haven't seen a trend in high  softness, we've seen more of a furniture softness trend that appears to be better. \n We have some really wonderful selling on new products in the spring and summer season that are both in Pottery Barn and in West Elm. And then also, we're seeing better performance out of our kids furniture business, where we introduced new finishes, which make a huge difference to these furniture collections and also they have categories in the children's home furnishings business that naturally have a lot of growth. For example, dorm and then also Baby. And those are more life stage versus housing related. So we're seeing more firmness there. \nJeff Howie: All right, Kate, I'll take the second question on the accounting. So you asked why it's only '21 through '23 and not '24. I think for some context, what really drove the out-of-period adjustment was the supply chain volatility that happened during the pandemic, which really hit years '21 through '23. And just to remind everyone, the pandemic put tremendous pressure on international supply chains. We faced disruption, delays, material cost swings, contract renegotiations, changes in terms by vendors, balance renegotiations, and all these pressures added a layer of complexity to the already imprecise process we use to estimate freight expense. So it was really pandemic-driven and it would not have impacted Q1 '24, because as we cleaned up our balance sheet and reconciled our approval, it would just cancel itself out in Q1. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Horvers: So my first question is, what your early reads are on the outdoor category. Obviously, that's a bigger portion of the second quarter versus Sonoma really shining around the Easter holiday and it looks like April was pretty tough on the weather. So would you expect some of that outdoor category to shift into the second quarter?\n And sort of related to Kate's question, as you think about like the sequential improvement in the business, mix will have an effect. So does the weather shift maybe to 2Q sort of offset the fact that the mix of Williams-Sonoma is lower in the second quarter? \nLaura Alber: Chris, it's Laura. The outdoor category gets consistent -- is consistent with the performance of our furniture categories, okay? It's not -- it's about the same. And the curve, if you're referring to the curve of sales, it's more like before the pandemic than when the pandemic happened, immediately after when it was an early rush to get the home furniture -- to get the outdoor furniture. Now it's a more normalized curve, and we have a really pretty good handle on where we think this is going to end up, and it's embedded in our guidance. \nJeff Howie: I would also just add, Chris, that I know there's been a lot of talk out there in the industry about the impact of weather. We're not really seeing that impact. I think because we are predominantly online, the weather doesn't impact us the same way. So we don't see that as an impact on a shift between quarters, as you alluded to. \nChristopher Horvers: Got it. And then just on the margin. I know you don't guide by quarters, but typically, the back half of the year is a much higher operating margin period than the first half of the year. And you don't guide by quarter, but it would imply -- it would seem to imply that you don't get that historical uptick in the back half based on where you guided the year. \n It seems like you, in large part, just passed along the first quarter beat on the margin side. So is that a fair assessment of how you approach the year guidance? And was there anything unique in the first quarter then that is perhaps not sustainable? \nJeff Howie: Yes, Chris. I think you hit the nail on the head in that, there were some unique things in Q1, and it really comes down to what we're up against from a last year compare basis. Let's remember that in Q1 last year, Q1 '22 was the high point of our supply chain headwinds, which really benefited us the most in Q1, and we're quickly coming to the end of that benefit. And we're lapping starting in Q2 and even stronger in Q3 and Q4, more benefits that we had last year from those headwinds.\n Additionally, we also started to lap the benefit we saw last year from our focus on full price selling and supply chain efficiencies. And while we feel great about our results, let's remember, it's early in the year. There's a lot of uncertainty. So that's why we're guiding our full year operating margins to be essentially flat year-over-year Q2 through Q4. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez with Telsey Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernandez: Congratulations on the good results. I wanted to ask also a big picture question around demand. You call out trade in B2B up 6%. I think that hasn't been up in a few quarters. And the bigger -- sort of the furniture trends getting slightly better, do you feel it's a function of your consumer that's more fluent, feeling better about spending on the home or just more company-specific initiatives that are driving those results? \nLaura Alber: No, I think that we -- I know that we've been focused on what we can control. And as we've said in the beginning of the year and last year, we're not planning and we are not dependent what's going to happen in the macro. I mean, who knows what's going to happen in the macro. We're paying attention to what we can control, which is innovation. And innovation -- the right product, the right price, shown beautifully. We've improved the photography in our brands. We've improved the website functionality, and we're looking very closely at how we improve what happens in our stores. \n Our stores are billboards for our brands. And when you go in now, you're expecting to be able to take things home the minute you go in, not wait for things. And so we've stocked them higher and we've made sure that there's enough newness in our stores to drive excitement again. And those are some of the things that we're really seeing improve our results.\n As far as B2B goes, remember, there's 2 parts to this business, trade and contract. And the contract business is less dependent on housing and consumer. And we have some great wins in the verticals that we're focused on, both in hospitality, sports and entertainment. And the key point here is that B2B is really a very important strategic initiative for us and a huge part of our growth in the future, because it's such a fractured market and nobody has much share and it is quite big. \n And it leverages our brands, our ability to design for individual clients, our global sourcing capabilities and our ability to service people with single deliveries versus having things come from a bunch of different suppliers. So we continue to be very confident about B2B and it is less affected by what's going on with housing. \nCristina Fernandez: And then as a follow-up, you called out some of the growth initiatives accelerating through the year, given your confidence to hit the full year guide. Can you talk about which initiatives are more impactful as we move through the year? \nLaura Alber: Sure. I think the first one, our brands are amazing, high-quality. We design our own products and we have our own proprietary website, West Elm, and the return to growth in West Elm is a big part of our focus. And I could not be more excited about what we're seeing in terms of West Elm reads on newness and where the team is going, the high-quality collaborations that we have in the back year -- half of the year. And also just building on what's working now and getting back in stock and being more confident with this new modern aesthetic that we are giving to our customers.\n The other part of West Elm that I think is very important to note is, it's been predominantly a big furniture business. And we know that for repeat purchases and excitement, you want to have things that people can buy to update their health for a dinner party or just to change the way the living room looks with new pillows. And so we've been very focused on smalls, when I say that, the things that are easier to buy, easy updates for the home. And we're going to continue to push that percent to total which is good for new customer acquisition. So West Elm is a key part of our growth strategy in the back half. \n Of course, I'm really excited about what we're seeing with our new Williams-Sonoma launches. I don't know if you've been able to go to our website, but we have a new gorgeous navy Jura collection, which is exclusive to us in the market. And another example of extremely impactful collaborations is our collaboration with Shondaland and Netflix's Bridgerton, which is doing very well. And as you know, Bridgerton is the most watched show right now on Netflix. So we're excited to have hit that nail on the head.\n Our kids and teen businesses, collaborations are a big part of that comp growth, and we have more in store and building on those. And of course, the carve-out of Baby and dorm, so good. And then in Pottery Barn, we're seeing some really nice new collection selling, as I referenced earlier, that we're building on for the fall season. And very beautiful floor sets for fall and then, of course, holiday, where we own decorating and entertaining. Not anybody else does what we do in a high-quality way for the holidays. \n So those are our big brands. And then, of course, our emerging brands, I touched on. Really nice momentum, very different aesthetically, serving a different way to entertain and decorate. And we've seen double-digit comp growth in those brands and are really pushing the growth for those in the future. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. \nDaniel Silverstein: This is Dan Silverstein on for Michael. \nMichael Lasser: I'm sorry, we -- yes, yes, yes. Sorry, we got our lines crossed. This is Michael Lasser. Our question is, if you continue to outperform by the magnitude that you did in the first quarter, would you look to reinvest that back into demand-driving initiatives or would you let it flow to the bottom line? \nLaura Alber: We're always investing in demand-driving initiatives. We're very aggressive about that. And the key is where it really drives incremental sales versus trading sales or just spending more money. So we're very disciplined in how we look at our investments. That's why we have industry-leading ROIC. And the obvious places you invest, as you saw us do was in ad costs. That's the biggest thing.\n In terms of big investments, we've mentioned our supply chain is built for more volume than we have. And our proprietary e-commerce platform is -- they are -- it doesn't require the kind of step up investment that other people had to put in because it's -- we've been doing it for so long. We have such a big percent of total in e-commerce already. So it's not a new thing for us. It's something that we can just build incremental adds to that are helpful to the customer experience.\n So it's -- when you say incremental investment to drive demand in the short term, that is ad costs. Promos are not something in our vernacular anymore. We do take markdowns, but that is the demand-driving way that other people take and it is not one that is sustainable in our opinion. \nMichael Lasser: Very helpful. Two follow-ups on that. Can you quantify how much you will be investing in advertising this year, either as a percentage of sales or the dollar amount? And where does full-price selling stand today across the different brands versus where that same percentage was prior to the pandemic? \nLaura Alber: We're fighting over your question. Yes. So in terms of ad costs, I wish we knew. It's so dynamic and we're so lucky to have this amazing team that's so sophisticated at looking at the different ad cost streams and reading the results. And it's a lot about the bids from others and where the demand is going and where it's not because what is true today might not be true in a month. So we have a monthly long full-day meeting where we review every brand and every stream. And we put our investments down where we're seeing returns. We test in one brand and roll it out to others. \n Jeff can put this more in context, if you want, on the ad cost? \nJeff Howie: Yes. I think it's also just important to remember, as you know, we guide the top line revenues and bottom line operating margin because it gives us flexibility to respond to changes in the business. And as everyone's seen, we know the levers to pull to deliver results. So while we'll go through the year, it's a very uncertain environment, who knows how the year shapes out, but we can adjust our levers as we see the trends develop to deliver results for our shareholders. \nLaura Alber: And then in terms of full price selling -- did you want me to... \nMichael Lasser: Yes, yes, for sure. Yes. \nLaura Alber: Thank you. That is a number we haven't given, but it's significant over last year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone with Citi. \nSteven Zaccone: Laura, I wanted to ask a macro question. We've seen some improved data points in the furnishing space. and you've mentioned the furniture softness appears to be getting better. So I'm curious for your assessment of like replacement cycles in the industry and this concept of like easy wins with people purchasing on smaller ticket items. Do you think we're starting to see some glimpses of replacement cycle and spending on the home. Curious of your assessment. \nLaura Alber: I have no idea. I think that everyone believes that the interest rates are never going to change, they're going to be more likely to buy than if they believe they're going to go down, they're going to wait. That's one theory I have. But that's just a theory. You can't prove anything.\n What I know is that where we have innovative products that's priced right, we're winning. And that's exciting to see because that makes me feel like we're more in control than at the whim of the macro. I mean, but imagine like right now, we produced these results in Q1 with the soft housing environment. Imagine what it could be like when it turns. But when that's going to happen, your guess is as good as mine. \nSteven Zaccone: Okay. Fair enough. Jeff, a question for you. On gross margin, you've had a lot of strength. Could we talk a little bit about the multiyear opportunity from here? Maybe following up on Michael's question, full-price selling is up relative to last year. Is there opportunity for that to still go higher from here? \nJeff Howie: Well, as you know, as I said before, we don't guide to specific lines and our overall operating margin guidance for the balance of the year is essentially to be flat year-over-year. There is more opportunity potentially in gross margin, particularly from supply chain efficiencies and higher full-price selling. But we are starting to lap the benefit we had last year from coming up against the headwinds I talked so much about. \n And as Laura mentioned, we have levers to pull, and there's a chance that if our gross margin was higher, then there's more opportunity to reinvest back in the business to drive the top line if we see efficient returns from that investment. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham with Wedbush. \nSeth Basham: Congrats on continued strong results. My question is a follow-up on the last one. Just thinking about all the supply chain margin benefits that you've gotten over the last couple of quarters. Can you give us a little bit more insight into the key drivers there and the initiatives you have to further improve your outbound supply chain in the U.S.? \nLaura Alber: Yes, absolutely. Our goal is perfect order, damage-free, on time. And although we have really improved things from the pandemic and, in some cases, hit customer service records, there's still a lot of room to go. And that is the focus of our supply chain team. We did have, as you know, last year, a lot of increases in inbound freight detention demurrage. We're no longer incurring those dramatically high costs.\n In terms of service, the team is really focused on a very low return replacement rate, and we are digging into and root-causing every single incident that we have to make sure that, that is not happening again, and that's going to continue to go throughout the year and beyond. And getting the inventory in the right place helps us incur less out-of-market multiple shipments. And honestly, there's still room to do more of that as we further optimize our inventory buys by DC. \n And honestly, there are redundancies that we're finding and better ways to ship things with our use of AI, looking at orders and figuring out whether we want to optimize for speed or cost or what we want to do for that individual customer in an automated way. \n So we're making -- we've made investments in supply chain. You know that we opened our Arizona DC. I'm pleased to tell you that it's up and running. And that should give us an advantage at time in the back half when we hit our peak season this year and closer to our West Coast customers. So we have, in previous quarters absorbed some of those costs. \n And truthfully, a lot of people ship apparel and floor goods as well. There's not a lot of people who can ship furniture well and do it efficiently. And it's not only a huge margin driver for us, and we do it well. It's also incredibly good for customer service. And I've always said, the person who can deliver the order will win this whole market because it is a very frustrating experience to not receive your furniture on time and damage-free, and it's very difficult to do. So I'm thrilled with our progress, but truth is, there's still a lot more to do to hit that perfect order. \nSeth Basham: That's really helpful color. And then my follow-up question is just on the incentive compensation margin headwind this quarter. Was part of that accrual associated with the out-of-period adjustment or is it for the underlying results? And how should we think about incentive compensation year-over-year for the balance of the year based on your guidance? \nJeff Howie: Great question, Seth. So the incentive compensation did not include any benefit from the out-of-period adjustment. It was simply our beat in Q1 versus our budget, so we had to take up the accrual. And any additional results from incentive compensation are essentially embedded in our guidance. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Max Rakhlenko with TD Cowen. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: Congrats on the nice results. So first, can you speak to your level of confidence in Williams-Sonoma's ability to regain lost market share on the upswing? And if peers do remain promotional even when demand improves, how will that impact your own strategy as it could make regaining some of that market share tougher? \nLaura Alber: No, Max, as you know, this is such a fractured market. And there's not really anybody who owns very much share that hasn't moved that much. But the thing that I'm very confident about is the amount that's still done in retail stores, mom-and-pops versus online. And it's going to be very hard for people to scale online like we have already. And so that is the big key competitive moat that we have as we look to the future, because I know that it won't be such a low number that is transacted online in the future. When that happens, it's coming to us. So I worry less about some of these other things that people bring up. \n And I also know that there's no one who's really designing their own product from soups to nuts like we do in a lifestyle format, which is the other huge advantage that we have. And that gives us pricing power. It's not that we're trying to overprice things, in fact, our value is fantastic. And in each of our brands, you can look at some of the new bestsellers and the price is so sharp because the competitive set has nothing like it or it's only done in the highest end designer markets.\n So without going through our competitive bestsellers with everybody on the call, including our competition, I will tell you that the things that are really working, you cannot find a similar product in the market anywhere close to our prices. So I don't worry as much about the up-down pricing because I think our consumers -- especially our consumer is extremely smart. They shop around, and they know what they're getting and they also know the quality differential. \nJeff Howie: I would also just add in that we compete not just on price, we compete on quality as well. But even more importantly, we compete on service. And these investments we're making in service really resonate with the customer and help with customer retention and are as strong a driver of our customers' purchase decisions as price is. \nMaksim Rakhlenko: Got it. That's super helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, but any color on quarter-to-date, how has May gone for you guys? Is it more of the same with stability? Or are you potentially seeing any further improvement? \nLaura Alber: Yes. So quarter-to-date, difference than last quarter, we're only like 3 weeks in. So when we gave Q4, we had 6 weeks, and we were more confident talking about it. And our big weeks are ahead of us. So we're still very confident in our guidance, but I wouldn't read too much into the first 3 weeks, which is why I don't want to comment on it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. \nBrian Nagel: Congrats on another really nice quarter. Very nicely done. So the question I have -- look, I think it's -- I'll move it to one question, but maybe bigger picture. So here, we're watching your model unfold here. I mean, sales, top line trends, are -- you're still soft, maybe getting better but still soft, but you continue to have these operating margin increases. \n So I guess the question I have here is, as you look out recognizing you don't know for certain when -- at what point the top line trends will renormalize, get back to the normalized growth rates for your company, your brands, but is there any reason to believe that you -- as that happens, you wouldn't continue to get a significant leverage through that P&L? \nJeff Howie: I understand the question, Brian. Thanks for asking it. I wish it was easy to say that for every 100 basis points of comp, x basis points would drop to the bottom line. Certainly, my Monday morning meetings would go a lot easier. But it's just not that way, there's a lot of different levers in the business. And time will tell, which is why our long-term guidance is mid- to high-teens operating margins, and we still feel comfortable in that range. \nBrian Nagel: Okay. So -- I appreciate that, Jeff. Maybe I will slip in one more question, just broader sector-wise. Again, you've done a nice -- very nice job managing your promotions. What are you seeing promotionally out there that you're competing with, so to say? Is it still aggressive? Is it getting more aggressive? Any change on that? \nLaura Alber: Yes, it's very aggressive. I looked -- when we look across the board, you can see that a lot of the specialty smaller brands are 20% off the whole site, just take a browse through the names. And I'm talking everything. And then some of the bigger specialties have 20% off the whole category, not just things that are still moving, but the whole category. \n People are playing with shipping. They're playing with double rewards. They have e-mail offers in the department stores that are 25% off if you give me your e-mail. So it is extremely aggressive out there and particularly in certain categories where that is the only thing people know how to do. And that's -- I don't -- that's the way it's been. I don't remember a time in my career that it hasn't been promotional. It is what it is. It doesn't appear to be getting less at all. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. \nOliver Wintermantel: Yes. And I just want to get back to the long-term guidance and then the guide for this year on your mid to high teens long-term operating margin and then this year's guide of 17% to 17.4% without the adjustment. That sounds very, very consistent. Is that the messaging? Or how can you -- can you maybe explain how you think about your longer-term margin versus today's margin guide for the year? \nJeff Howie: Yes. When we think about our current operating margin guidance, our long term operating margin guidance, I think the key point is our operating margin is sustainable. That's been one of the questions if we think back over the past 18, 24 months, is where is the operating margin going? In 2023, we established a 15% operating margin floor. We delivered 16.4%. And this year, we started the guide at 16.5% to 16.8%. Now we're guiding 17% to 17.4% without the operating margin -- sorry, without the out-of-period adjustment. \n But look, we are at a level that is sustainable. And I think that's the key message as we've structurally improved our margin. Margins for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. in the mid- to high teens is sustainable over the long term. And it's what is our guidance, and it's what we've been able to achieve. \nOliver Wintermantel: Got it. And then just to follow up on inventories down 13%. Was that mostly dollars or units? \nJeff Howie: Well, we report in dollars, in cost dollars. So it was a dollar metric. And overall, our message is our inventories are well positioned to support our business trends. \nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. \nSimeon Gutman: My first question, it's back on gross margin. So you are lapping some supply chain savings. This quarter, you still had a significant gain in the merch margin? And just to clarify, there aren't supply chain or shipping in there. And what drove the merch margin? And if it is the fewer promos, why shouldn't that level hold and we see merch margin gains continue throughout 2024? \nJeff Howie: Simeon. So let's think about this. In Q1 of this year, we lapped 300 basis points of supply chain headwinds from last year. So there's about 380 basis points between that and the 680 that we reported, excluding the out-of-period adjustment. So it was not just merchandise margins, there were some that were merchandise margins and there were some that were supply chain efficiency. \n Certainly, in the merchandise margins, we did benefit from lower ocean freight year-over-year. But there is also merchandise margins -- in there is also full price selling. We did continue to reduce promotions versus last year in the quarter. And while there's still some that we can reduce later on, we're starting to lap our efforts last year.\n And in supply chain efficiencies, the other piece in here is we started -- we over delivered there, but we also started to lap that improvement year-over-year as we progressed through the year. So there's diminishing margin returns here. But look, we feel great about our results. We're starting to lap harder compares in the bottom line, but it's early in the year, and there's a lot of uncertainty. \nSimeon Gutman: And then just a follow-up to that. The IMUs or the markups in some of the newness, if that over-indexes, is that a good guide to gross margin or about the same? \nJeff Howie: It's probably about the same. And there's puts and takes between gross margin and SG&A. But it goes back to how we give our guidance. We guide the top and the bottom line. We're guiding that the next 3 quarters will be essentially flat year-over-year and that there are levers we can pull within there to drive results. \nLaura Alber: And the newness doesn't come in higher margins than something we've been running. Actually, when we rebuy a new product, we're able to often renegotiate their costs because we're buying more on those efficiencies in the supply chain when we buy more. So that would come a little bit later as we increase the orders. \n And I will just say another component that is in our numbers is the reduction in costs across the board from our vendors, our vendor partners and really focusing on our efforts to be more accurate on our inventory buys so they can be more efficient in their factories. So that's also been a component of what's been going on and one that should be stable through the back half of the year.\n Thank you. Well, thanks to all of you for joining us. And I hope you have a wonderful summer, and we look forward to talking to you in the fall. Take care. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Laura Alber",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Before we review our Q1 results, I want to take a moment to thank all of our teams around the globe for their consistent contributions to our company. We could not continue to produce strong earnings without their cross-functional collaboration and dedication. \n We are pleased to deliver strong results in the first quarter of 2024, driven by an improving top line trend and continued strength in our profitability. In Q1, our comps came in above expectations at negative 4.9%, and we exceeded profitability estimates with an operating margin of 19.5% and earnings per share of $4.07. \n It is important to note that the results of the first quarter include a benefit of $49 million, resulting from the reversal of freight-related accruals that we determined were not required, which contributed 290 basis points to our operating margin and $0.59 to our EPS. Jeff will walk you through this in more detail, but it is worth noting that even without the impact of this benefit, we significantly exceeded profitability expectations. As a result of our outperformance, we are raising our outlook on operating margin to now be in the range of 17.6% to 18% or 17% to 17.4%, when excluding the impact of the freight accrual reversal. \n The strong results for the quarter are a result of our focus on our 3 key priorities in 2024: returning to growth; elevating our world-class customer service; and driving margin. I'll start first with returning to growth. We are pleased with the improvement in our top line trends and our market share gains in Q1. We are keenly focused on innovation in our product line across brands. And our unique in-house design capabilities and vertically integrated sourcing organizations allows us to offer this high-quality design innovation at compelling price points. \n Another key component of our return-to-growth strategy is our marketing capabilities. Our in-house digital marketing optimization backed by our world-class customer analytics and our first-party data collection serves as a competitive advantage for our company. In the quarter, we increased our ad spend and invested in both our paid marketing and our proven social strategy. This investment allowed us to drive sales improvement to acquire new customers and to gain market share. \n Additionally, we are continuing to improve our online experience through our investment in our proprietary e-commerce technology. From product discovery and selection to personalization to concept to customer care and to the final mile, our team is constantly thinking about how we can improve our best-in-class e-commerce experience. \n And one way we do this is through AI. We believe our leadership in AI will be another competitive advantage. And it's important to not forget that as focused as we are on our digital capabilities, we are passionate about our service and our best-in-class retail business. We have improved our in-store experience with inspirational products, improved in-stock inventory levels and next level in-store services. Our teams are the best in retail, and our retail optimization efforts are transforming our fleet to be positioned in the most profitable, inspiring and strategic locations. \n Moving to our second and third key priorities in 2024, which are inextricably intertwined. We continue to make progress improving our world-class customer service and driving margins. The customer is at the center of everything we do, and their satisfaction is key to our operating performance. \n We are pleased with our high Net Promoter Scores, both in-store and in home, but we see more opportunity to improve. We know that providing our associates with new tools and training has a direct impact on our customer experience. And we are thrilled to bring back our annual store manager conference in Q2 of this year. This multi-day offsite meeting is an opportunity for all of our store managers to participate in strategic training. \n The improvement in customer service also comes from supply chain efficiencies. We are reducing costs by limiting out of market and multiple shipments, fewer customer accommodations, lower returns and damages and reduce replacements. These improvements will continue to contribute meaningfully to our profitability in 2024 and beyond. And our ongoing commitment to not running site-wide promotions and the reduction of our promotional offerings have also improved margins. We are focused on delivering our compelling value equation to our customers, which in turn, maximizes our full price selling. \n Now I'd like to update you on the performance of our brands. Pottery Barn ran a negative 10.8% comp in Q1. We continue to see softness in higher ticket furniture sales in Pottery Barn, but we've seen quarter-over-quarter improvement. We're having success in our proprietary print and pattern across textiles and easy decorating updates continue to drive sales. Highlights include newness in our Bloom shop, frames and decor. Our strength in seasonal celebrations also continues to resonate with our customers. \n In March, we launched our first ever global collaboration with international icon, Deepika Padukone. Her popularity drove 1 billion impressions for the Pottery Barn brand. Customers also embrace the launch of our Coastal Lookbook, and they positively engaged with our newly developed apps. In the back half of this year, we're excited to introduce new innovation, both in-store with compelling new floor sets and online with improved digital shopping experience. \n The Pottery Barn children's business ran a positive 2.8% comp in Q1. Across these life-stage businesses, we drove widespread comp trend improvement in the business. We've seen excellent customer response to our new product introductions with collaborations being a particular highlight. Our recent launches with partners such as LoveShackFancy and Lilly Pulitzer have driven sales and attracted new customers by tapping into relevant fashion and home decor trends. \n In Baby, we're seeing double-digit registry growth and excellent customer response to our expanded essentials and gifting. In dorm, we recently launched our biggest collection to date with expanded XL twin bedding options, new no-nails wall decor and innovative storage solutions. In addition to the expanded assortment, we are excited to roll out improved dorm product selection functionality. And customers can also ship dorm products to any one of our company-owned stores near their college campus. \n Moving to West Elm. In Q1, West Elm drove sequential improvement in its top line trend, running a negative 4.1% comp in the quarter. We're encouraged to see improvement in West Elm's demand trend even as we materially pull back on promotions. We are seeing strength in our new product sales with our spring units driving positive comp to last year, with particularly strong performance out of furniture, kids and decorative accessories. \n Summer newness is also off to a great start with double and triple-digit newness comps. Given the positive trends in newness, we have a sizable opportunity in West Elm as it rebalances more inventory into these new products. \n The Williams-Sonoma brand ran a positive 0.9% comp in Q1. This is the second consecutive quarter the Williams-Sonoma brand ran a positive comp with the Williams-Sonoma Kitchen business running a positive comp for the fourth consecutive quarter. During Q1, we inspired customers with exclusive and innovative products. We benefited from new introductions of Williams-Sonoma branded products in categories like bakeware, cutlery and food. The favorable customer response to these items continues to reinforce the opportunity we have to the Williams-Sonoma branded business. \n In March, our co-branded collaborations drove media attention and results. Our popular collaboration with Aerin Lauder was expanded to include new items for both Williams-Sonoma and Williams-Sonoma Home. We also partnered with Trisha Yearwood to make our best-selling cocktail collaboration the official drink of our new 55,000 square foot bar and restaurant in Nashville that she built with her husband, Garth Brooks. \n Now I'd like to update you on our other initiatives. Business-to-business grew 10% in Q1, driving record-breaking demand in the quarter. We saw improvement in our trade business, running a positive 6% on the quarter, along with continued momentum in our contract business, which represents about 1/3 of the B2B business up 18%. We're encouraged by our diverse book of businesses ranging from sofas for UT San Diego dorms to corporate gifting for Pebble Beach Company. We also saw continued growth for our existing large project customers such as Marriott, Dave & Buster's and Jamestown properties. \n Now I'd like to talk about our global business. Despite ongoing macroeconomic pressures impacting our global business, we're pleased with the performance in key markets, including India, Canada and Mexico. In India, we are continuing to see strong growth from increased marketing and brand awareness campaigns across the brands. In Canada, our business is thriving in both the retail and direct-to-consumer channels, driven by enhanced omnichannel strategy, wider product selection and the expansion of our business-to-business program across all brands in the market. \n And in Mexico, the market showed strength driven by a focus on the design business and expanded assortment fueled by our improved stock position. We will continue to leverage the knowledge gained from these markets to enhance the global customer experience in our new and emerging markets. \n Lastly, I'd like to update you on emerging brands. Rejuvenation delivered another double-digit quarter. We saw all categories drive growth and continue to see success with both consumer and trade customers. The brand remains focused on delivering high-quality products that support your home remodel and refresh projects. \n The strongest performance comes from bath, hardware and lighting, while we also see strength in several of our new growth categories like textiles, organization, window hardware and outdoor. Customers continue to update their homes, specifically in the kitchen and bath spaces and add the finishing touches with Rejuvenation. We are excited by the momentum in this brand and the growth potential this year and beyond. \n Mark and Graham, our monogram gifting business, also drove a double-digit comp growth in Q1. The brand is increasingly recognized as an inspirational lifestyle brand experiencing continued growth as a go-to destination for gifts, including graduations and weddings. Q2 has started strong with a positive reception to the brand's Mother's Day and Father's Day gift selections.\n And finally, GreenRow, our newest brand, continues to grow and expand its assortment of vintage-inspired colorful furnishings that are sustainably sourced and designed to last. The second catalog dropped this month with a focus on print and pattern. We are seeing a very positive response to its unique offerings in the market and look forward to seeing additional assortment expansions and partnerships in the coming months. Being successful in exciting emerging brands demonstrate our ability to develop new businesses that expand our portfolio and address white space in the market. \n In summary, we are extremely proud of our results. During the last few years, we, as a company, have navigated, learned, optimized and built all in preparation for our next chapter of growth. We have a strong omnichannel platform with an exclusive lifestyle offering and a sophisticated distribution network with additional capacity. We recognize that there is continued uncertainty with the environment and the consumer. \n But because we operate in a highly fragmented market, we will continue to gain share by inspiring and servicing our customers. We remain committed to driving our 3 key priorities in 2024: one, returning to growth; two, elevating our world-class customer service; and three, driving margins. \n And with that, I will turn it over to Jeff to walk you through the numbers and our outlook in more detail. Kate, it's Laura. In terms of big ticket, Q4 is not a big furniture time of the year. Of course, the comps are comparable. We don't bring in a lot of newness in Q4. But we are seeing improvements in our furniture business, and high ticket has always been one of those things -- you have to remember, we have electrics in high ticket, we have a lot of other types of products in high ticket that aren't furniture. But we haven't seen a trend in high  softness, we've seen more of a furniture softness trend that appears to be better. \n We have some really wonderful selling on new products in the spring and summer season that are both in Pottery Barn and in West Elm. And then also, we're seeing better performance out of our kids furniture business, where we introduced new finishes, which make a huge difference to these furniture collections and also they have categories in the children's home furnishings business that naturally have a lot of growth. For example, dorm and then also Baby. And those are more life stage versus housing related. So we're seeing more firmness there. Chris, it's Laura. The outdoor category gets consistent -- is consistent with the performance of our furniture categories, okay? It's not -- it's about the same. And the curve, if you're referring to the curve of sales, it's more like before the pandemic than when the pandemic happened, immediately after when it was an early rush to get the home furniture -- to get the outdoor furniture. Now it's a more normalized curve, and we have a really pretty good handle on where we think this is going to end up, and it's embedded in our guidance. No, I think that we -- I know that we've been focused on what we can control. And as we've said in the beginning of the year and last year, we're not planning and we are not dependent what's going to happen in the macro. I mean, who knows what's going to happen in the macro. We're paying attention to what we can control, which is innovation. And innovation -- the right product, the right price, shown beautifully. We've improved the photography in our brands. We've improved the website functionality, and we're looking very closely at how we improve what happens in our stores. \n Our stores are billboards for our brands. And when you go in now, you're expecting to be able to take things home the minute you go in, not wait for things. And so we've stocked them higher and we've made sure that there's enough newness in our stores to drive excitement again. And those are some of the things that we're really seeing improve our results.\n As far as B2B goes, remember, there's 2 parts to this business, trade and contract. And the contract business is less dependent on housing and consumer. And we have some great wins in the verticals that we're focused on, both in hospitality, sports and entertainment. And the key point here is that B2B is really a very important strategic initiative for us and a huge part of our growth in the future, because it's such a fractured market and nobody has much share and it is quite big. \n And it leverages our brands, our ability to design for individual clients, our global sourcing capabilities and our ability to service people with single deliveries versus having things come from a bunch of different suppliers. So we continue to be very confident about B2B and it is less affected by what's going on with housing. Sure. I think the first one, our brands are amazing, high-quality. We design our own products and we have our own proprietary website, West Elm, and the return to growth in West Elm is a big part of our focus. And I could not be more excited about what we're seeing in terms of West Elm reads on newness and where the team is going, the high-quality collaborations that we have in the back year -- half of the year. And also just building on what's working now and getting back in stock and being more confident with this new modern aesthetic that we are giving to our customers.\n The other part of West Elm that I think is very important to note is, it's been predominantly a big furniture business. And we know that for repeat purchases and excitement, you want to have things that people can buy to update their health for a dinner party or just to change the way the living room looks with new pillows. And so we've been very focused on smalls, when I say that, the things that are easier to buy, easy updates for the home. And we're going to continue to push that percent to total which is good for new customer acquisition. So West Elm is a key part of our growth strategy in the back half. \n Of course, I'm really excited about what we're seeing with our new Williams-Sonoma launches. I don't know if you've been able to go to our website, but we have a new gorgeous navy Jura collection, which is exclusive to us in the market. And another example of extremely impactful collaborations is our collaboration with Shondaland and Netflix's Bridgerton, which is doing very well. And as you know, Bridgerton is the most watched show right now on Netflix. So we're excited to have hit that nail on the head.\n Our kids and teen businesses, collaborations are a big part of that comp growth, and we have more in store and building on those. And of course, the carve-out of Baby and dorm, so good. And then in Pottery Barn, we're seeing some really nice new collection selling, as I referenced earlier, that we're building on for the fall season. And very beautiful floor sets for fall and then, of course, holiday, where we own decorating and entertaining. Not anybody else does what we do in a high-quality way for the holidays. \n So those are our big brands. And then, of course, our emerging brands, I touched on. Really nice momentum, very different aesthetically, serving a different way to entertain and decorate. And we've seen double-digit comp growth in those brands and are really pushing the growth for those in the future. We're always investing in demand-driving initiatives. We're very aggressive about that. And the key is where it really drives incremental sales versus trading sales or just spending more money. So we're very disciplined in how we look at our investments. That's why we have industry-leading ROIC. And the obvious places you invest, as you saw us do was in ad costs. That's the biggest thing.\n In terms of big investments, we've mentioned our supply chain is built for more volume than we have. And our proprietary e-commerce platform is -- they are -- it doesn't require the kind of step up investment that other people had to put in because it's -- we've been doing it for so long. We have such a big percent of total in e-commerce already. So it's not a new thing for us. It's something that we can just build incremental adds to that are helpful to the customer experience.\n So it's -- when you say incremental investment to drive demand in the short term, that is ad costs. Promos are not something in our vernacular anymore. We do take markdowns, but that is the demand-driving way that other people take and it is not one that is sustainable in our opinion. We're fighting over your question. Yes. So in terms of ad costs, I wish we knew. It's so dynamic and we're so lucky to have this amazing team that's so sophisticated at looking at the different ad cost streams and reading the results. And it's a lot about the bids from others and where the demand is going and where it's not because what is true today might not be true in a month. So we have a monthly long full-day meeting where we review every brand and every stream. And we put our investments down where we're seeing returns. We test in one brand and roll it out to others. \n Jeff can put this more in context, if you want, on the ad cost? And then in terms of full price selling -- did you want me to... Thank you. That is a number we haven't given, but it's significant over last year. I have no idea. I think that everyone believes that the interest rates are never going to change, they're going to be more likely to buy than if they believe they're going to go down, they're going to wait. That's one theory I have. But that's just a theory. You can't prove anything.\n What I know is that where we have innovative products that's priced right, we're winning. And that's exciting to see because that makes me feel like we're more in control than at the whim of the macro. I mean, but imagine like right now, we produced these results in Q1 with the soft housing environment. Imagine what it could be like when it turns. But when that's going to happen, your guess is as good as mine. Yes, absolutely. Our goal is perfect order, damage-free, on time. And although we have really improved things from the pandemic and, in some cases, hit customer service records, there's still a lot of room to go. And that is the focus of our supply chain team. We did have, as you know, last year, a lot of increases in inbound freight detention demurrage. We're no longer incurring those dramatically high costs.\n In terms of service, the team is really focused on a very low return replacement rate, and we are digging into and root-causing every single incident that we have to make sure that, that is not happening again, and that's going to continue to go throughout the year and beyond. And getting the inventory in the right place helps us incur less out-of-market multiple shipments. And honestly, there's still room to do more of that as we further optimize our inventory buys by DC. \n And honestly, there are redundancies that we're finding and better ways to ship things with our use of AI, looking at orders and figuring out whether we want to optimize for speed or cost or what we want to do for that individual customer in an automated way. \n So we're making -- we've made investments in supply chain. You know that we opened our Arizona DC. I'm pleased to tell you that it's up and running. And that should give us an advantage at time in the back half when we hit our peak season this year and closer to our West Coast customers. So we have, in previous quarters absorbed some of those costs. \n And truthfully, a lot of people ship apparel and floor goods as well. There's not a lot of people who can ship furniture well and do it efficiently. And it's not only a huge margin driver for us, and we do it well. It's also incredibly good for customer service. And I've always said, the person who can deliver the order will win this whole market because it is a very frustrating experience to not receive your furniture on time and damage-free, and it's very difficult to do. So I'm thrilled with our progress, but truth is, there's still a lot more to do to hit that perfect order. No, Max, as you know, this is such a fractured market. And there's not really anybody who owns very much share that hasn't moved that much. But the thing that I'm very confident about is the amount that's still done in retail stores, mom-and-pops versus online. And it's going to be very hard for people to scale online like we have already. And so that is the big key competitive moat that we have as we look to the future, because I know that it won't be such a low number that is transacted online in the future. When that happens, it's coming to us. So I worry less about some of these other things that people bring up. \n And I also know that there's no one who's really designing their own product from soups to nuts like we do in a lifestyle format, which is the other huge advantage that we have. And that gives us pricing power. It's not that we're trying to overprice things, in fact, our value is fantastic. And in each of our brands, you can look at some of the new bestsellers and the price is so sharp because the competitive set has nothing like it or it's only done in the highest end designer markets.\n So without going through our competitive bestsellers with everybody on the call, including our competition, I will tell you that the things that are really working, you cannot find a similar product in the market anywhere close to our prices. So I don't worry as much about the up-down pricing because I think our consumers -- especially our consumer is extremely smart. They shop around, and they know what they're getting and they also know the quality differential. Yes. So quarter-to-date, difference than last quarter, we're only like 3 weeks in. So when we gave Q4, we had 6 weeks, and we were more confident talking about it. And our big weeks are ahead of us. So we're still very confident in our guidance, but I wouldn't read too much into the first 3 weeks, which is why I don't want to comment on it. Yes, it's very aggressive. I looked -- when we look across the board, you can see that a lot of the specialty smaller brands are 20% off the whole site, just take a browse through the names. And I'm talking everything. And then some of the bigger specialties have 20% off the whole category, not just things that are still moving, but the whole category. \n People are playing with shipping. They're playing with double rewards. They have e-mail offers in the department stores that are 25% off if you give me your e-mail. So it is extremely aggressive out there and particularly in certain categories where that is the only thing people know how to do. And that's -- I don't -- that's the way it's been. I don't remember a time in my career that it hasn't been promotional. It is what it is. It doesn't appear to be getting less at all. And the newness doesn't come in higher margins than something we've been running. Actually, when we rebuy a new product, we're able to often renegotiate their costs because we're buying more on those efficiencies in the supply chain when we buy more. So that would come a little bit later as we increase the orders. \n And I will just say another component that is in our numbers is the reduction in costs across the board from our vendors, our vendor partners and really focusing on our efforts to be more accurate on our inventory buys so they can be more efficient in their factories. So that's also been a component of what's been going on and one that should be stable through the back half of the year.\n Thank you. Well, thanks to all of you for joining us. And I hope you have a wonderful summer, and we look forward to talking to you in the fall. Take care."

            "name": "Jeff Howie",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to deliver these strong Q1 results. We've seen sequential improvement in our top line trend and we continue to exceed expectations on the bottom line. \n As Laura said, our results this quarter reflect 3 keys we've laid out for fiscal year '24. First, returning to growth, fueled by our brand strategies, emerging brand opportunities, business-to-business expansion and global footprint; second, elevating our world-class service, which drives both customer retention and expense savings; and finally, third, driving earnings as we continue to deliver strong profitability. \n These 3 themes resonate across our earnings today. And given our strong Q1 results, we're confident we can deliver long-term growth and even stronger earnings as the customer shifts back to home. \n Now let's dive into the numbers. I'll start with our Q1 results and then provide an update on guidance for '24. Net revenues finished at $1.66 billion, in line with our expectations. Our comp of negative 4.9% sequentially improved quarter-over-quarter. We saw better performance across both furniture and nonfurniture categories even as we reduced our overall level of promotions from last year. From a cadence perspective, our trends were relatively consistent across the quarter. \n Moving down the income statement. Gross margin came in at 48.3%, which includes a $49 million or 290 basis point benefit from an out-of-period adjustment. Subsequent to filing our 10-K, we identified that we over accrued freight expense across fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023 by $49 million. Following the prescribed accounting rules, we determined the over accrual was not material to any prior period and not material to our projected full year '24 results. Therefore, we recorded the correction in Q1 as an out-of-period adjustment that benefited our results this quarter. Without the out-of-period adjustment, gross margin came in at 45.4%, 680 basis points higher than last year and substantially exceeding expectations. \n There were 3 drivers to the 680 basis point improvement. First, merchandise margins improved 470 basis points, driven by lower ocean freight as we benefited from lapping last year's pandemic-related ocean freight runoff and our ongoing commitment to full-price selling. \n Second, supply chain efficiencies contributed 240 basis points, driven by lower than pre-pandemic returns, accommodations, damages, replacements, out-of-market shipping and multiple deliveries per order. These supply change efficiencies are yielding a notable improvement in customer service and cost savings. \n And third, occupancy costs, although down 3% from last year, deleveraged 30 basis points. We continue to optimize our retail fleet, while we invest in our world-class technology stack and our supply chain. Wrapping up our gross margin, we delivered substantially higher gross margin this quarter, driven by better merchandise margins, supply chain efficiencies and lower occupancy costs. \n Turning now to SG&A. SG&A expense came in at 28.8% of revenues or 310 basis points higher than last year, driven by higher advertising spend, and incentive compensation. Advertising expense deleveraged 170 basis points as we continue to invest into higher levels of advertising spend to drive sales at an efficient return. Our multi-brand portfolio allows us to test the return of this incremental spend. Our own hands-on-keyboard approach allows our investment to go further, keeps our learnings in-house and gives us a competitive advantage in the home furnishings industry. \n Employment expense was 100 basis points higher year-over-year, driven entirely by higher performance-based incentive compensation. Without incentive compensation, employment was flat year-over-year on a rate basis. In Q1, we continue to manage variable employment costs across our stores, distribution centers and customer care centers in accordance with top line trends. \n On the bottom line, our earnings significantly exceeded expectations. Including the benefit from the out-of-period adjustment, operating income came in at $323.8 million; operating margin was 19.5%; and diluted earnings per share was $4.07. The out-of-period adjustment increased operating income by $49 million; operating margin by 290 basis points; and earnings per share by $0.59. \n Without the out-of-period adjustment, our earnings still significantly exceeded expectations. Operating income came in at $274.8 million; operating margin was 16.6%, 370 basis points above last year; and diluted earnings per share was $3.48, up $0.84 or 32% year-over-year. \n On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.3 billion with no debt outstanding. This was after we invested $40 million in capital expenditures supporting our long-term growth, and we returned $107 million to our shareholders through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. Merchandise inventories ended the quarter at $1.2 billion, down 13% to last year. Overall, our inventories are well positioned to support our business. \n Summing up our Q1 results. We're proud to have delivered another quarter of earnings substantially exceeding expectations. I'd like to thank our talented dedicated team at Williams-Sonoma, Inc. for delivering these outstanding results. \n Now let's turn to our '24 outlook. Given our Q1 results, we are reiterating our revenue guidance and raising our operating margin guidance for fiscal year '24. On the top line, we continue to expect full year '24 net revenues to be in the range of down 3% to up 3%, with comps between down 4.5% to up 1.5%. We anticipate sequential improvement across the year, with the first half tougher than the second half as our top line comparisons get easier and our growth drivers accelerate. \n On the bottom line, we are raising our guidance based upon our Q1 results, but anticipate our operating margins going forward will be relatively in line with '23 results. We are raising our operating margin guidance to a range of 17.6% to 18%, which includes a 60 basis point benefit from the full year impact of the out-of-period adjustment.\n Without the out-of-period adjustment, we expect our full year operating margin will be in the range of 17% to 17.4%, a raise of 50 basis points due to our strong Q1 results. Additionally, we expect our full year interest income to be approximately $40 million and our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25.5%. \n As a reminder, 2024 is a 53-week year for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. So the fourth quarter will consist of 14 weeks. We anticipate the additional week will contribute 150 basis points to revenue growth and 10 basis points to operating margins, both of which are embedded in our guidance. We will report comps on a 53-week versus 53-week comparable basis. All other year-over-year compares will be 53 weeks versus 52 weeks. \n Our capital allocation plans for '24 remain unchanged. We expect to spend $225 million in capital expenditures to invest in the long-term growth of our business. 75% of this capital spend will be dedicated to drive our e-commerce leadership and supply chain efficiency. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders in the form of increased quarterly dividend payouts and ongoing share repurchases. \n For dividends, in March, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend payout of 26% or $0.23 to $1.13 per share. Fiscal year '24 will be the 15th consecutive year of increased dividend payouts, which we are both proud of and remain committed to. For share repurchases, we have $956 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization through which we will opportunistically repurchase our stock to deliver returns to our shareholders. \n As we look further into the future beyond '24, we are reiterating our long-term guidance of mid- to high single-digit revenue growth with operating margins in the mid- to high teens. We're confident we'll continue to outperform our peers and deliver shareholder growth for these 5 reasons that remain consistent: our ability to gain market share in the fragmented home furnishings industry; the strength of our in-house proprietary design; the competitive advantage of our digital-first but not digital-only channel strategy; the ongoing strength of our growth initiatives; and the resiliency of our fortress balance sheet. \n With that, I'll open the call for questions. All right, Kate, I'll take the second question on the accounting. So you asked why it's only '21 through '23 and not '24. I think for some context, what really drove the out-of-period adjustment was the supply chain volatility that happened during the pandemic, which really hit years '21 through '23. And just to remind everyone, the pandemic put tremendous pressure on international supply chains. We faced disruption, delays, material cost swings, contract renegotiations, changes in terms by vendors, balance renegotiations, and all these pressures added a layer of complexity to the already imprecise process we use to estimate freight expense. So it was really pandemic-driven and it would not have impacted Q1 '24, because as we cleaned up our balance sheet and reconciled our approval, it would just cancel itself out in Q1. I would also just add, Chris, that I know there's been a lot of talk out there in the industry about the impact of weather. We're not really seeing that impact. I think because we are predominantly online, the weather doesn't impact us the same way. So we don't see that as an impact on a shift between quarters, as you alluded to. Yes, Chris. I think you hit the nail on the head in that, there were some unique things in Q1, and it really comes down to what we're up against from a last year compare basis. Let's remember that in Q1 last year, Q1 '22 was the high point of our supply chain headwinds, which really benefited us the most in Q1, and we're quickly coming to the end of that benefit. And we're lapping starting in Q2 and even stronger in Q3 and Q4, more benefits that we had last year from those headwinds.\n Additionally, we also started to lap the benefit we saw last year from our focus on full price selling and supply chain efficiencies. And while we feel great about our results, let's remember, it's early in the year. There's a lot of uncertainty. So that's why we're guiding our full year operating margins to be essentially flat year-over-year Q2 through Q4. Yes. I think it's also just important to remember, as you know, we guide the top line revenues and bottom line operating margin because it gives us flexibility to respond to changes in the business. And as everyone's seen, we know the levers to pull to deliver results. So while we'll go through the year, it's a very uncertain environment, who knows how the year shapes out, but we can adjust our levers as we see the trends develop to deliver results for our shareholders. Well, as you know, as I said before, we don't guide to specific lines and our overall operating margin guidance for the balance of the year is essentially to be flat year-over-year. There is more opportunity potentially in gross margin, particularly from supply chain efficiencies and higher full-price selling. But we are starting to lap the benefit we had last year from coming up against the headwinds I talked so much about. \n And as Laura mentioned, we have levers to pull, and there's a chance that if our gross margin was higher, then there's more opportunity to reinvest back in the business to drive the top line if we see efficient returns from that investment. Great question, Seth. So the incentive compensation did not include any benefit from the out-of-period adjustment. It was simply our beat in Q1 versus our budget, so we had to take up the accrual. And any additional results from incentive compensation are essentially embedded in our guidance. I would also just add in that we compete not just on price, we compete on quality as well. But even more importantly, we compete on service. And these investments we're making in service really resonate with the customer and help with customer retention and are as strong a driver of our customers' purchase decisions as price is. I understand the question, Brian. Thanks for asking it. I wish it was easy to say that for every 100 basis points of comp, x basis points would drop to the bottom line. Certainly, my Monday morning meetings would go a lot easier. But it's just not that way, there's a lot of different levers in the business. And time will tell, which is why our long-term guidance is mid- to high-teens operating margins, and we still feel comfortable in that range. Yes. When we think about our current operating margin guidance, our long term operating margin guidance, I think the key point is our operating margin is sustainable. That's been one of the questions if we think back over the past 18, 24 months, is where is the operating margin going? In 2023, we established a 15% operating margin floor. We delivered 16.4%. And this year, we started the guide at 16.5% to 16.8%. Now we're guiding 17% to 17.4% without the operating margin -- sorry, without the out-of-period adjustment. \n But look, we are at a level that is sustainable. And I think that's the key message as we've structurally improved our margin. Margins for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. in the mid- to high teens is sustainable over the long term. And it's what is our guidance, and it's what we've been able to achieve. Well, we report in dollars, in cost dollars. So it was a dollar metric. And overall, our message is our inventories are well positioned to support our business trends. Simeon. So let's think about this. In Q1 of this year, we lapped 300 basis points of supply chain headwinds from last year. So there's about 380 basis points between that and the 680 that we reported, excluding the out-of-period adjustment. So it was not just merchandise margins, there were some that were merchandise margins and there were some that were supply chain efficiency. \n Certainly, in the merchandise margins, we did benefit from lower ocean freight year-over-year. But there is also merchandise margins -- in there is also full price selling. We did continue to reduce promotions versus last year in the quarter. And while there's still some that we can reduce later on, we're starting to lap our efforts last year.\n And in supply chain efficiencies, the other piece in here is we started -- we over delivered there, but we also started to lap that improvement year-over-year as we progressed through the year. So there's diminishing margin returns here. But look, we feel great about our results. We're starting to lap harder compares in the bottom line, but it's early in the year, and there's a lot of uncertainty. It's probably about the same. And there's puts and takes between gross margin and SG&A. But it goes back to how we give our guidance. We guide the top and the bottom line. We're guiding that the next 3 quarters will be essentially flat year-over-year and that there are levers we can pull within there to drive results."
