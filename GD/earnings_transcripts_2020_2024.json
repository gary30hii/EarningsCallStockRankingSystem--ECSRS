Please also, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full-year 2020 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning. Thank you, Howard. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, net earnings of $1 billion and earnings per diluted share of $3.49. This is, in most respects, a very solid quarter, even though we missed consensus by $0.05. I have more to say about that shortly. Despite the adverse impact of the pandemic, we achieved most of our operational and financial goals added dramatically to our backlog and had a very good cash quarter. The results in comparisons with prior periods are rather straightforward and set out in our press release. Because of the adverse impact to the economy caused by COVID-19, I'll devote less time to the quarter-over-quarter comparisons and spend more time on the sequential improvement that tells a compelling story of recovery. I'll go through that in some detail as I give you my thoughts on the business segments. As we indicated that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest, it is quite remarkable that we came within $0.02 of the very strong pre-pandemic fourth quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that revenue is up 11.1%, operating earnings are up 20.6%, net earnings are up 20.1% and earnings per share are up 20.3%. So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance even compared to the year-ago quarter, but really good sequentially. For the full year, we had revenue of $37.9 billion, down from 3.6% from the prior year, net earnings of $3.17 billion and earnings diluted shares of $11, once again modestly below consensus. Our business was strengthened by significant growth in the backlog to a year-end record high of $89.5 billion. The same is true of total estimated contract value at $134.7 billion. The total company book-to-bill was 1.1:1 for the year, led by the particularly strong order performance of Electric Boat. The strong order intake across the Board positions the Company well for 2021 and beyond. Our cash performance for the quarter and the year was stronger than expected with a conversion rate of 91% of net income for the year. Jason will have more fulsome comments on this subject in his remarks.  Let me review the quarter, paying particular attention to sequential comparisons and the full year in the context of each group and provide some color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.4 billion is up 23.3% over the third quarter on the strength of the delivery of 40 aircraft, 34 of which were large cabin. While this was the strongest delivery quarter of the year, it fell short of our expectations by three aircraft, two of which delivered after the first of the year, for reasons related to customer preference. The third aircraft had a willing customer, but it was not ready for delivery by year end, that one's on us.\nJason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is our cash performance for the quarter and the year. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated just over $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, approximately 220% of net income. That resulted in free cash flow for the year of $2.9 billion, a cash conversion rate of 91%, nicely ahead of our anticipated 80% to 85% of net income. To put this in context, our cash from operations for the year of $3.9 billion was less than $20 million shy of the highest annual operating cash flow we've ever had, notwithstanding the impact of COVID on our operations in 2020. In fact, our free cash performance for the year was just short of achieving our original pre-COVID cash forecast, so really a remarkable outcome. This was the result of outstanding performance across the business to close out the year, most notably in the Aerospace group, which began to draw down its inventory that we've been discussing for some time. And the Technologies group, which continues to generate superb cash flows, as Phebe mentioned, in this case, in excess of 150% of imputed net income for the year. And as you'll recall, at this time last year, we negotiated a path forward on our large international contract in Combat Systems, including a revised progress payment schedule that liquidates their receivables balance over the next three years. As part of that agreement, we received two payments of $500 million each last year and we received the next progress payment earlier this month in accordance with the revised schedule. So that OWC will continue to unwind as we've discussed on past calls. Of course, Marine Systems continues with its significant facilities improvements in support of the unprecedented growth on the horizon. To that point, we had capital expenditures of $345 million in the fourth quarter for a full year total of nearly $1 billion or 2.5% of sales. You may recall, we had expected our CapEx to peak in 2020 at roughly 3% of sales due to these shipyard investments. As you might expect, given the impact of the pandemic, we've managed the timing of this CapEx spend prudently, and the result is three years, '19, '20 and '21, at roughly 2.5% of sales. This timing fully supports our Columbia and Block V build plant at Electric Boat. We then expect to trend back down and return to the more typical 2% range by 2023, consistent with our previous expectations.\nPhebe Novakovic: With that, I'll turn to our expectations for 2021. So let me provide our operating forecast initially by business group and then on a company-wide rollout. In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be about $8 billion, essentially flat with 2020. Operating margins will be about 12.5%, leading to operating earnings of $1 billion, maybe slightly more. So what is driving this forecast, and in particular, the lower margins in 2021 when revenue is similar to 2020? You will recall that I told you last quarter, we will deliver 13 fewer G550 as that airplane is no longer in production. This leaves us with 13 fewer aircraft, not including the three slips from 2020. So all up, 10 fewer aircraft, this reduction in revenue will be made up by a roughly $500 million increase in services across Jet Aviation and Gulfstream at about 10% lower operating margin. There are a lot of other puts and takes, but this gives you the big picture for the lower anticipated margins. By the way, our forecasted production delivery considers our backlog, our fourth quarter orders and our take on current demand. I fully expect 2022 will have better revenue and earnings, stimulated by the entry into service the G700 in the fourth quarter and improving demand across the product lines as the economy recovers. In Combat Systems, we expect revenue of about $7.3 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million over 2020. We expect the operating margin to be about 14.5% and operating earnings to exceed last year by $20 million or 2%. We look for revenue, earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. After several years of good revenue growth, 2021 and 2022 will have modest growth. Growth should resume in 2023 and beyond as several developmental programs move into production. The Marine group is expected to have revenue of approximately $10.3 billion, an increase of over $300 million. Operating margin in 2021 is anticipated to be around 8.3%, driven in large part by increased work on the first two cost-plus Columbia submarines, which have conservative initial booking rates. We anticipate growth at each of the yards. The long-term driver of growth here is the submarine work, which will expand significantly. Our biggest upside opportunity in this group is to outperform the forecasted revenue line. We expect revenue in the Technologies group of $13.2 billion, $580 million more than 2020. This is a growth of 4.5% with GDIT growing at a rate of 7.1%. Mission Systems will be essentially flat with organic growth of 3%, offset by the SATCOM divestiture. We expect earnings of $1.25 billion, about $50 million more than 2020. This implies an overall margin of 9.5% with GDIT returning to 7% or more. So for 2021, company-wide, we expect to see approximately $39 billion of revenue, up over $1 billion from 2020 and operating margin at 10.5%. This all rolls up to a forecast range of $11 to $11.05 per fully diluted share basis, we expect EPS to play out much like it has in prior years with Q1 about $2.20 and progressively stronger quarters thereafter. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 16% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperformed many operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. I should leave you with this one final thought. Our strong cash flow in anticipation of a 95% to 100% conversion rate in 2021, leaves us with the ability to engage in a share repurchase program this year to enhance the EPS figures I have just given you. We will see how that plays out. I'll be more specific about this after the end of the first quarter. Back to you, Howard.\nHoward Rubel: Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask each participant one question and one follow-up question so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\nOperator: Absolutely.  today's first question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJon Raviv: Phebe, if you could just sort of talk -- I know you mentioned that you want to have this for the end of the first quarter, but you're starting a repo again in 4Q, looking at a much better conversion rate this year. Just sort of big picture on where free cash flow conversion goes this year and ahead, especially if you see a big recovery, a bigger recovery in 2022 and then kind of what the levers are for capital allocation as the year progresses with those debt repayments, but also saying that you might have some excess as well?\nPhebe Novakovic: Let me ask Jason to give you a little specificity there.\nJason Aiken: Yes. So John, I think at a macro level, the best way to think about this is we have to think about this is we have every expectation that we will see year-over-year increases in our free cash flow. As you saw, we had a nice outperformance of our expectation in the fourth quarter to wrap up a pretty strong 2020. That set us off on this course a little quicker than we expected. A lot of that was Gulfstream doing a great job getting some of that inventory to start to turn, and so working some of that operating working capital. As Phebe alluded to, GDIT also had an outstanding performance in the fourth quarter. I think we expect to see those trends really continue. I mean, basically, the core fundamental underlying performance of each of the businesses, but then buoy by the further improvement in OWC. The one we talked about or I alluded to briefly on the call is the continued unwinding of the unbilled receivables balance in Combat Systems. I mentioned we did receive the third major progress payment here earlier this month of January. That's encouraging to see that that program continues at pace. And so between that program unwinding, the working down of the working capital over the next couple of years at Gulfstream and of course, the winding down of the CapEx at Marine Systems, we expect to see that year-on-year growth in free cash flow, obviously, to support further capital deployment, at which I'll turn back over to Phebe to address.\nPhebe Novakovic: So look, we've been real clear over the years that we invest in our business depending on the need and the expected return on that invested capital. The one element of capital deployment that should be repeatable, achievable, each and every -- and sustainable each and every year are dividends. We'll be discussing that with our Board. Obviously, debt repayment and then share repurchase. And let me just leave it at that. We have more work to do with our Board. But you can expect us to be good stewards of capital.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: I asked this question a little sheepishly, but I wanted to go back to something you said about Aerospace. And you said, if you've been following our R&D spending, you know there's more to come on this subject. I like to think that I'm following it, but maybe if you could speak to that in a little more detail and what that means?\nPhebe Novakovic: So as you and I agree that I gave you as much detail as I intend to here. So why don't we find another question to discuss together?\nSeth Seifman: Okay, maybe on the cash flow then. Jason, it looks like we're moving from 2 9 in 2020 to maybe about 3 1 in 2021. Can you talk about the key moving pieces there, especially working capital and they ended the year with a very low receivables balance, and sort of, is working capital overall going to be a contributor and so to the extent it can continue to decline?\nJason Aiken: Yes. I think to cut to the chase. I think you put your finger on it. It is the continued working of that OWC. It's partially receivables, you saw some good movement there in the fourth quarter of last year, but that should continue as well as the inventory side of things. We'll get to unloading these test articles, a Gulfstream over the balance of this year and into early next year. So that will be a big help as well. And that will continue in terms of the OWC turn, not just through the balance of this year, but it will be a big mover in 2022 and 2023 as well.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. So Phebe, you mentioned Q4 initial deliveries of the G700. I think at one point, it looked like G700 was going to be early in the year. I know a lot has happened obviously with MAX and COVID. How confident are you that you can really hit that delivery bogey? And what does that assume in terms of certification?\nPhebe Novakovic: So Cai, I think if we go back and look at the record, we've been pretty consistent that it would be toward the end of 2022. And the test program, all the test points, the expectation of the airplane throughout its test program has met all of our design specification. So the program is going very, very well. And we will work with the FAA on certification prior to the entry into service. But the progress of the test program supports end of year 2022.\nCai von Rumohr: What I mean you said you're going to expect an up year in '22. How many G700s? What if the G700 slips into '23, is it an up year or a down year?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, look, our expectations are predicated on a recovery in the market that will drive fundamentally all of Gulfstream's performance. But we're pretty much counting on the 700. And if it is, it would be by a quarter or so, but I don't believe that that's the case at the moment. And so what we do is in work with our FAA teammate and made the best estimates that we can for one, we believe this is going to enter into service. We're not going to get into the number of production and deliveries by model we never have or not going to. But that airplane is coming, and it comes with nice margin performance and good cash. So our expectation, I think, is reasonable given all the fat patterns we have an evidence at the moment. And if it changes, of course, we'll let you know, but we have nothing to believe at the moment that it will change.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Phebe, you mentioned that there's been some commentary around the G650 and the market demand for this aircraft. I was wondering if you could give us some idea of what the sort of slot availability is for this plane, looking out over the next 12 months or two years? And whether you're seeing any sign of the G700 cannibalizing the market?\nPhebe Novakovic: So the 650, as I've noted, continued to be in demand. It is a powerful airplane. There's nothing close to it in its market. We are not going to get into open slots. We've never really done that with any specificity, and we're not going to start now. Just suffice it to say, we don't build strings and white tails. But look, we've talked about this a couple of times and just to refresh, the 700 and the 650 have materially different missions and there are at different price points and the customers well understand the distinction. And I think the parable to think about to amplify that point is that when we announced the 700, 650 demand increased because of the clarity provided in that market space. So that was a -- it was additive, not subtractive. So we believe that, that pattern will continue given the differentiation between the two airplanes. Does that help you?\nRobert Stallard: Yes. And just as a follow-up. On the G650, you did bring the rate down there modestly. Do you see that now as a sustainable rate over the next few years? Or could it actually head higher again?\nPhebe Novakovic: We are comfortable with the rate that we're looking at the moment. But look, you've seen us sufficiently agile to adjust on the up. I don't expect that at the moment. We still have very good demand. Our rate supports that demand and the demand supports that rate. And we anticipate a nice steady order book and production schedule for the time to come. So we're really pleased with that airplane.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Phebe, I just wanted to touch on Marine and the growth that you're forecasting there. I think you said there's potential upside, but looks like your forecast about 3% top line growth. I know it's on a tough comp. Can you just talk about where the potential upside could come from? How much Columbia is accounting for of that growth? And would you expect Marine's growth rate to reaccelerate once we get beyond 2021?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, the growth is -- can be on any given year, a bit lumpy, but the trajectory is there, supported by that backlog. I think this year, in 2020, I think Colombia accounted for 50% of that growth. But the way to think about this in crudely approximately from a trajectory perspective is, we're looking between $400 million to $500 million of growth a year. And then that will continue to accelerate as we pull through more production. So in the moment for 2021, as I alluded to in my remarks, the opportunity there is for increased revenue. And that happens in these shipyards by increased throughput. We pull work in, depending on the work cadence, the schedule, the planning, the availability. So that is in the moment. If any upside comes to growth in 2021, it will be based on that. But you are quite right, we -- that comparison base is off for this year is very, very strong growth. But there's nothing to suggest that there's any particular issue here. It's simply just the timing and the mix.\nDavid Strauss: Right, the $400 million to $500 million that you just referenced, is that the annual revenue increase that you're expecting out of Columbia per year for the next couple of years?\nPhebe Novakovic: No, the whole group.\nDavid Strauss: Okay, got it. And then on Combat, can you -- may be split it out kind of what you're seeing on the U.S. side versus Europe? And are you having any issues in Europe given some of the shutdowns that we've seen over there? \nPhebe Novakovic: Well, let's talk about the U.S. As we've talked about, we are the premier systems integrator for combat systems platforms in the United States. And all of our key franchise programs are in the process of modernization, upgrading, and we anticipate that to go forward. If you think about army modernization, it comes in two flavors. One is upgrading a critical or fighting vehicles and equipment to meet the modern battlefield. And if you think about that, the Stryker of today and the Abrams of today are in all respects different than their predecessors. They look the same, but in all other respects, these are increasingly lethal, increasingly capable, agile platforms. And that gives them relevance to the war fight today and the war fight envisioned in the joint forces combat scenarios of the U.S. military. So those modernization upgrades will continue.  And then the second category of army modernization is in their new start programs. And they've got a number of them as we look out into the horizon. Again, given our capability set, given our proven long-term delivery, we deliver things on time at cost. That puts us in very good stead, along with the Technologies investments we've been making over the last four, five, six years. We are producing some really powerful platforms that will be critical to the future fight. So, I feel good about that. On top of that, in the U.S., our ordinance and armaments business continues to grow. They are critical subcomponents, on almost every major weapons missile system in the U.S. So, these are very, very strong, high leverage, deep backlog, deep customer intimacy programs in the United States. When you look outside the United States, we are continuing to see growth. We've got the Ajax program that has just begun its testing. So, we've got quite a bit of ways to go there. And when you think about our European land system, just to give you a little perspective, there are over 7,000 in-service lab-type vehicles that come out of -- has come out of our European business. That installed base is enormous. And it's an enormous competitive advantage. Some of those systems are older and they need to be upgraded. And we continue to see demand out of multiple parts of Europe. So, we expect ELS to grow and the world hasn't got any safer and that reality of the threat environment drives the demand. So, I hope that gives you a little bit of color here.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Phebe, I noticed when you call out 0.96 book-to-bill, that's a gross number. So, it looks like there were like $244 million of cancellations in the quarter, if you could specify what they actually were?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, look, we still have a very low default rate that's really not meaningful either in the moment for us or going forward. So, we're not going to give you a model by model. I can tell you nothing particularly surprised us. And it signifies for us at the moment, really nothing on a going-forward basis. Does that help?\nGeorge Shapiro: Not as much as I'd like.\nPhebe Novakovic: I'm sure. Do you think I want to start to  backlog. You .\nGeorge Shapiro: I can figure, but I figured I'd ask anyway. And then my other question is the sequential backlog at Technologies dropped like 6% and this sector continued to disappoint again in revenues, as you mentioned. So, what's really going on there? I mean, I mean we've seen this for quite a while at this time.\nPhebe Novakovic: So, look we had anticipated going into 2020 that we would see the growth that we had expected. COVID derailed it back a bit. But as we do our planning and think through how we are going to manage COVID going forward and the advance of COVID, at some point in the year, we see that growth in supported by that backlog. And again, I think Jason gave you a very fulsome explanation of how we treat our backlog, and we do that differently than anybody else. And I think we sometimes get penalized for it, but we have the backlog to support growth that we are anticipating.\nJason Aiken: And George, just to add another fine point, and I alluded to this a little earlier, but I want to make sure it's clear. This business, in particular, I think, is the most relevant to pay attention to that total potential contract value versus the -- strictly the traditional firm-funded backlog. And the reason is, I think I mentioned this earlier, this business year in and year out, 50% or more, and in fact, I think in 2020 was 60% of their annual orders and revenue value, comes out of that bucket of value that we articulate as IDIQ/options potential contract value. So that's very different than the pure-play platform businesses that have the traditional contracting firm backlog and so on. And so, I don't think it can be overlooked and in fact, it should be emphasized and should be the focal point of analysis on where that value is coming from and to Phebe's point, what's supportive of our expectations of growth for that business. \nGeorge Shapiro: But even Jason, on that basis, it was still down somewhat sequentially, if I looked at the total number that you gave.\nJason Aiken: So there's pieces of that, there's Mission Systems and GDIT in there. GDIT was actually up, I believe, in fact, I think in like 10% or 11%, between you and me. And again, to reiterate what I discussed earlier, when we get these large programs, think of DOs as an example, it's a potential $4.4 billion program, not even a small fraction of that went into even that IDIQ bucket. So major resolution of a significant headline award, so you're not yet seeing manifest in the backlog or even in the IDIQ bucket, but will over time support the fundamental underpinnings of the growth that we're alluding to, so a pretty conservative approach to it, but we think appropriate, and you'll see measured out over time as those programs progress.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Doug Harned at Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDoug Harned: In the GDIT emission systems, I mean, once upon a time they were together and you split them up, and now they're coming back again. Could you talk a little bit about the evolution of your thinking about these businesses? And I know earlier, you talked about these integrated systems where they can work together. And perhaps you could highlight some of the programs that of the programs that are opportunities for you in that kind of work?\nPhebe Novakovic: So we have -- look, you would expect us to remain agile to changing trends in the marketplace. And what we were observing is that while our services business and even the older incarnation of Mission Systems work closely together across a number of programs. Increasingly, in the last three years, we're seeing more and more of that. They're working together on bids. They're submitting bids together. And that -- what I've liked about that, these are two separate businesses managed separately. They understand each other. The guys who at Mission Systems know how to run their product portfolio, and the guys at GDIT know how to manage their IT work together business in the last three years, we're are opportunities for you in are two separate businesses managed separately. They services business. And I think those areas of expertise, it's very important to keep them separate from a management point of view. To have them come together to work more seamlessly, we believe this reporting structure helped. But no other respects are we changing anything. So we have a -- Howard, can give you a pretty definitive list, but Jason could give you a few of just the indicative kinds of programs we're looking at.\nJason Aiken: Doug, it's going to come across if we get into this in too much detail sounding like a bunch of alphabet soup just based on the nature of these businesses. But suffice it to say, it is an increasing portfolio of opportunities where they're going to market together, including work on areas like supercomputing, which they're doing for NOAA, broader-based end-to-end enterprise network services, for example, like what they're working on for FAA, work on ground-based strategic deterrent, so on and so forth as well as a number of items for classified customers in FAA. They've got work for the Air Force. Again, the list could go on and on, if I name the programs, it wouldn't necessarily mean anything because they're all code names, but it is an increasing portfolio where they are getting pull-through overlap and commonality in these offerings.\nDoug Harned: Okay. And then also one more thing that gets into the details here on programs. If we go back to combat, Phebe, you talked about the trajectory here and flattening period, probably growth in 2023, where do you see that growth coming from? You mentioned some things, but if you had to say, this is why I'm confident in 2023 growth, would it be from some specific U.S. programs? Would it be ELS? Could it be other international? What are the things that get you most confident on that longer-term trajectory?\nPhebe Novakovic: So look, we've got -- I think, longer term, we're looking at additional Stryker configurations. If you think about the Stryker, it is a very versatile very versatile platform. And we've seen the Army in working with us, finding innovative and increasingly more fight critical variance of Stryker. So we have the SHORAD and like -- so we have the SHORAD system coming. We are looking at electronic warfare, medical. And there's a whole series of other increasingly, some of them sensitive, Stryker have -- their brigades have increased their numbers by about maybe 4%, 5%. So each brigade is going to get over time more Strykers in these various configurations. So that's important to that program. We also see the Abrams continuing its modernization. And then we believe we have additional out-year international opportunities, largely through FMS. So we see some growth in Canada, Morocco, Poland, Czech Republic. So all of that contributes -- that's all within the U.S. All of that contributes to our assumptions about growth in this portfolio. Outside the United States, I tried to give you some context about the large embedded fleet and the need to upgrade that fleet. And that, along with the Spanish program, we may see some additional vehicles under that Spanish program, it's soon to call that. So we are really assuming that. But those are the elements that we are -- and by the way, there are new programs, developmental programs that are out for competition, and we like where we stand in those. I will just say one thing about MPS. We developed all 12 prototypes for the testing and evaluation. And I believe we are the only ones to do so even within the COVID environment. That's a discipline will do for you, disciplined product excellence and manufacturing operating excellence. So that is the pipeline that we see in our future.\nHoward Rubel: Operator, this is Mr. Rubel. We have time for one last question and I'll turn it back to you to do that and then give us final instructions.\nOperator: Absolutely, sir. Today's final question comes from Ron Epstein with BofA. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: Sorry about that. I was on mute. So just maybe a bigger picture question. When we listen to the earnings calls of the group, every company tells us that they're well positioned relative to the defense budget. And I'm not saying you're not. But my question is this, if the budget flattens with the change in administration and the deficit and so on and so forth, where do you expect to see some pressure in the budget? How do you dodge that? I mean it seems like you are, but like where would you not want to be? Does that make sense?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, let me tell you, I never speak to anybody else's portfolio, but a couple of observations. It's been my experience that the best antidote for budget reductions, are well-performing, well-supported programs of record. We have all of those. Almost every single one of our programs are on schedule at or below cost. That is when the budget tiers get their night out. Those are almost always the last fall. So that's, I think, a longer perspective to look at. But look, if you look at the U.S. Navy, submarines are its top priority and the Columbia in particular. And why is that? It's because submarines remain a singular competitive advantage, a critical competitive advantage for the United States with near-peer competitors and peer competitors. So I am quite confident that given my belief that the defense budget is driven by the threats that are key elements of our Marine group, growth will be nicely supported. We believe that the Navy will continue to need destroyers The DDG-51 is proving to be a very versatile program platform that can take additional missions. And then with our auxiliary yard out at ASCO, with the exception of the nuclear powered carriers, and nuclear submarines, all these navy's fleets needs gas and the gas needs to get there safely, fastly and pumped efficiently, and that's our new oiled program. So with respect to the Army, I gave you a little bit of color before, but the Army has been quite clear, even in a constrained budget. They will maintain their modernization priorities. They have been both privately and publicly quite articulate about that. And then in terms of the shorter cycle businesses, in the old days, when you were dialing for dollars as a budget tier, you go to the O&M accounts and start cutting the IT budgets, that's not possible anymore. These IT systems are critical to the mission of these agencies, whether that's within DoD or outside DoD. So that as a source of funds is increasingly less likely. And I think, frankly, insulated, given the criticality of IT and then within -- to the war fight and DoD into other missions. And then within our Mission Systems, there's a beauty to having a diverse portfolio of long franchise programs. And I will tell you that we're quite secure in many of those franchise programs because they are, in some cases, unique and in some cases, tied to high-growth nationally critical areas to think against submarines. So, I think it's a height of hubris to assume that any organization is immune from constraints in budget. But performance matters criticality to the war fit matters. And when I look across our portfolio, I'm pretty comfortable that we are in very good stead.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is our cash performance for the quarter and the year. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated just over $2.2 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, approximately 220% of net income. That resulted in free cash flow for the year of $2.9 billion, a cash conversion rate of 91%, nicely ahead of our anticipated 80% to 85% of net income. To put this in context, our cash from operations for the year of $3.9 billion was less than $20 million shy of the highest annual operating cash flow we've ever had, notwithstanding the impact of COVID on our operations in 2020. In fact, our free cash performance for the year was just short of achieving our original pre-COVID cash forecast, so really a remarkable outcome. This was the result of outstanding performance across the business to close out the year, most notably in the Aerospace group, which began to draw down its inventory that we've been discussing for some time. And the Technologies group, which continues to generate superb cash flows, as Phebe mentioned, in this case, in excess of 150% of imputed net income for the year. And as you'll recall, at this time last year, we negotiated a path forward on our large international contract in Combat Systems, including a revised progress payment schedule that liquidates their receivables balance over the next three years. As part of that agreement, we received two payments of $500 million each last year and we received the next progress payment earlier this month in accordance with the revised schedule. So that OWC will continue to unwind as we've discussed on past calls. Of course, Marine Systems continues with its significant facilities improvements in support of the unprecedented growth on the horizon. To that point, we had capital expenditures of $345 million in the fourth quarter for a full year total of nearly $1 billion or 2.5% of sales. You may recall, we had expected our CapEx to peak in 2020 at roughly 3% of sales due to these shipyard investments. As you might expect, given the impact of the pandemic, we've managed the timing of this CapEx spend prudently, and the result is three years, '19, '20 and '21, at roughly 2.5% of sales. This timing fully supports our Columbia and Block V build plant at Electric Boat. We then expect to trend back down and return to the more typical 2% range by 2023, consistent with our previous expectations. Yes. So John, I think at a macro level, the best way to think about this is we have to think about this is we have every expectation that we will see year-over-year increases in our free cash flow. As you saw, we had a nice outperformance of our expectation in the fourth quarter to wrap up a pretty strong 2020. That set us off on this course a little quicker than we expected. A lot of that was Gulfstream doing a great job getting some of that inventory to start to turn, and so working some of that operating working capital. As Phebe alluded to, GDIT also had an outstanding performance in the fourth quarter. I think we expect to see those trends really continue. I mean, basically, the core fundamental underlying performance of each of the businesses, but then buoy by the further improvement in OWC. The one we talked about or I alluded to briefly on the call is the continued unwinding of the unbilled receivables balance in Combat Systems. I mentioned we did receive the third major progress payment here earlier this month of January. That's encouraging to see that that program continues at pace. And so between that program unwinding, the working down of the working capital over the next couple of years at Gulfstream and of course, the winding down of the CapEx at Marine Systems, we expect to see that year-on-year growth in free cash flow, obviously, to support further capital deployment, at which I'll turn back over to Phebe to address. Yes. I think to cut to the chase. I think you put your finger on it. It is the continued working of that OWC. It's partially receivables, you saw some good movement there in the fourth quarter of last year, but that should continue as well as the inventory side of things. We'll get to unloading these test articles, a Gulfstream over the balance of this year and into early next year. So that will be a big help as well. And that will continue in terms of the OWC turn, not just through the balance of this year, but it will be a big mover in 2022 and 2023 as well. And George, just to add another fine point, and I alluded to this a little earlier, but I want to make sure it's clear. This business, in particular, I think, is the most relevant to pay attention to that total potential contract value versus the -- strictly the traditional firm-funded backlog. And the reason is, I think I mentioned this earlier, this business year in and year out, 50% or more, and in fact, I think in 2020 was 60% of their annual orders and revenue value, comes out of that bucket of value that we articulate as IDIQ/options potential contract value. So that's very different than the pure-play platform businesses that have the traditional contracting firm backlog and so on. And so, I don't think it can be overlooked and in fact, it should be emphasized and should be the focal point of analysis on where that value is coming from and to Phebe's point, what's supportive of our expectations of growth for that business. So there's pieces of that, there's Mission Systems and GDIT in there. GDIT was actually up, I believe, in fact, I think in like 10% or 11%, between you and me. And again, to reiterate what I discussed earlier, when we get these large programs, think of DOs as an example, it's a potential $4.4 billion program, not even a small fraction of that went into even that IDIQ bucket. So major resolution of a significant headline award, so you're not yet seeing manifest in the backlog or even in the IDIQ bucket, but will over time support the fundamental underpinnings of the growth that we're alluding to, so a pretty conservative approach to it, but we think appropriate, and you'll see measured out over time as those programs progress. Doug, it's going to come across if we get into this in too much detail sounding like a bunch of alphabet soup just based on the nature of these businesses. But suffice it to say, it is an increasing portfolio of opportunities where they're going to market together, including work on areas like supercomputing, which they're doing for NOAA, broader-based end-to-end enterprise network services, for example, like what they're working on for FAA, work on ground-based strategic deterrent, so on and so forth as well as a number of items for classified customers in FAA. They've got work for the Air Force. Again, the list could go on and on, if I name the programs, it wouldn't necessarily mean anything because they're all code names, but it is an increasing portfolio where they are getting pull-through overlap and commonality in these offerings."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Phebe Novakovic",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you, Howard. Earlier today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.5 billion, net earnings of $1 billion and earnings per diluted share of $3.49. This is, in most respects, a very solid quarter, even though we missed consensus by $0.05. I have more to say about that shortly. Despite the adverse impact of the pandemic, we achieved most of our operational and financial goals added dramatically to our backlog and had a very good cash quarter. The results in comparisons with prior periods are rather straightforward and set out in our press release. Because of the adverse impact to the economy caused by COVID-19, I'll devote less time to the quarter-over-quarter comparisons and spend more time on the sequential improvement that tells a compelling story of recovery. I'll go through that in some detail as I give you my thoughts on the business segments. As we indicated that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest, it is quite remarkable that we came within $0.02 of the very strong pre-pandemic fourth quarter 2019. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that revenue is up 11.1%, operating earnings are up 20.6%, net earnings are up 20.1% and earnings per share are up 20.3%. So all in all, a solid quarter with good performance even compared to the year-ago quarter, but really good sequentially. For the full year, we had revenue of $37.9 billion, down from 3.6% from the prior year, net earnings of $3.17 billion and earnings diluted shares of $11, once again modestly below consensus. Our business was strengthened by significant growth in the backlog to a year-end record high of $89.5 billion. The same is true of total estimated contract value at $134.7 billion. The total company book-to-bill was 1.1:1 for the year, led by the particularly strong order performance of Electric Boat. The strong order intake across the Board positions the Company well for 2021 and beyond. Our cash performance for the quarter and the year was stronger than expected with a conversion rate of 91% of net income for the year. Jason will have more fulsome comments on this subject in his remarks.  Let me review the quarter, paying particular attention to sequential comparisons and the full year in the context of each group and provide some color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.4 billion is up 23.3% over the third quarter on the strength of the delivery of 40 aircraft, 34 of which were large cabin. While this was the strongest delivery quarter of the year, it fell short of our expectations by three aircraft, two of which delivered after the first of the year, for reasons related to customer preference. The third aircraft had a willing customer, but it was not ready for delivery by year end, that one's on us. With that, I'll turn to our expectations for 2021. So let me provide our operating forecast initially by business group and then on a company-wide rollout. In Aerospace, we expect revenue to be about $8 billion, essentially flat with 2020. Operating margins will be about 12.5%, leading to operating earnings of $1 billion, maybe slightly more. So what is driving this forecast, and in particular, the lower margins in 2021 when revenue is similar to 2020? You will recall that I told you last quarter, we will deliver 13 fewer G550 as that airplane is no longer in production. This leaves us with 13 fewer aircraft, not including the three slips from 2020. So all up, 10 fewer aircraft, this reduction in revenue will be made up by a roughly $500 million increase in services across Jet Aviation and Gulfstream at about 10% lower operating margin. There are a lot of other puts and takes, but this gives you the big picture for the lower anticipated margins. By the way, our forecasted production delivery considers our backlog, our fourth quarter orders and our take on current demand. I fully expect 2022 will have better revenue and earnings, stimulated by the entry into service the G700 in the fourth quarter and improving demand across the product lines as the economy recovers. In Combat Systems, we expect revenue of about $7.3 billion, an increase of approximately $100 million over 2020. We expect the operating margin to be about 14.5% and operating earnings to exceed last year by $20 million or 2%. We look for revenue, earnings and margin rate to grow quarter-over-quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter. After several years of good revenue growth, 2021 and 2022 will have modest growth. Growth should resume in 2023 and beyond as several developmental programs move into production. The Marine group is expected to have revenue of approximately $10.3 billion, an increase of over $300 million. Operating margin in 2021 is anticipated to be around 8.3%, driven in large part by increased work on the first two cost-plus Columbia submarines, which have conservative initial booking rates. We anticipate growth at each of the yards. The long-term driver of growth here is the submarine work, which will expand significantly. Our biggest upside opportunity in this group is to outperform the forecasted revenue line. We expect revenue in the Technologies group of $13.2 billion, $580 million more than 2020. This is a growth of 4.5% with GDIT growing at a rate of 7.1%. Mission Systems will be essentially flat with organic growth of 3%, offset by the SATCOM divestiture. We expect earnings of $1.25 billion, about $50 million more than 2020. This implies an overall margin of 9.5% with GDIT returning to 7% or more. So for 2021, company-wide, we expect to see approximately $39 billion of revenue, up over $1 billion from 2020 and operating margin at 10.5%. This all rolls up to a forecast range of $11 to $11.05 per fully diluted share basis, we expect EPS to play out much like it has in prior years with Q1 about $2.20 and progressively stronger quarters thereafter. Let me emphasize that this plan is purely from operations. It assumes a 16% tax provision and assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with year-end figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperformed many operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. I should leave you with this one final thought. Our strong cash flow in anticipation of a 95% to 100% conversion rate in 2021, leaves us with the ability to engage in a share repurchase program this year to enhance the EPS figures I have just given you. We will see how that plays out. I'll be more specific about this after the end of the first quarter. Back to you, Howard. Let me ask Jason to give you a little specificity there. So look, we've been real clear over the years that we invest in our business depending on the need and the expected return on that invested capital. The one element of capital deployment that should be repeatable, achievable, each and every -- and sustainable each and every year are dividends. We'll be discussing that with our Board. Obviously, debt repayment and then share repurchase. And let me just leave it at that. We have more work to do with our Board. But you can expect us to be good stewards of capital. So as you and I agree that I gave you as much detail as I intend to here. So why don't we find another question to discuss together? So Cai, I think if we go back and look at the record, we've been pretty consistent that it would be toward the end of 2022. And the test program, all the test points, the expectation of the airplane throughout its test program has met all of our design specification. So the program is going very, very well. And we will work with the FAA on certification prior to the entry into service. But the progress of the test program supports end of year 2022. Well, look, our expectations are predicated on a recovery in the market that will drive fundamentally all of Gulfstream's performance. But we're pretty much counting on the 700. And if it is, it would be by a quarter or so, but I don't believe that that's the case at the moment. And so what we do is in work with our FAA teammate and made the best estimates that we can for one, we believe this is going to enter into service. We're not going to get into the number of production and deliveries by model we never have or not going to. But that airplane is coming, and it comes with nice margin performance and good cash. So our expectation, I think, is reasonable given all the fat patterns we have an evidence at the moment. And if it changes, of course, we'll let you know, but we have nothing to believe at the moment that it will change. So the 650, as I've noted, continued to be in demand. It is a powerful airplane. There's nothing close to it in its market. We are not going to get into open slots. We've never really done that with any specificity, and we're not going to start now. Just suffice it to say, we don't build strings and white tails. But look, we've talked about this a couple of times and just to refresh, the 700 and the 650 have materially different missions and there are at different price points and the customers well understand the distinction. And I think the parable to think about to amplify that point is that when we announced the 700, 650 demand increased because of the clarity provided in that market space. So that was a -- it was additive, not subtractive. So we believe that, that pattern will continue given the differentiation between the two airplanes. Does that help you? We are comfortable with the rate that we're looking at the moment. But look, you've seen us sufficiently agile to adjust on the up. I don't expect that at the moment. We still have very good demand. Our rate supports that demand and the demand supports that rate. And we anticipate a nice steady order book and production schedule for the time to come. So we're really pleased with that airplane. So, the growth is -- can be on any given year, a bit lumpy, but the trajectory is there, supported by that backlog. I think this year, in 2020, I think Colombia accounted for 50% of that growth. But the way to think about this in crudely approximately from a trajectory perspective is, we're looking between $400 million to $500 million of growth a year. And then that will continue to accelerate as we pull through more production. So in the moment for 2021, as I alluded to in my remarks, the opportunity there is for increased revenue. And that happens in these shipyards by increased throughput. We pull work in, depending on the work cadence, the schedule, the planning, the availability. So that is in the moment. If any upside comes to growth in 2021, it will be based on that. But you are quite right, we -- that comparison base is off for this year is very, very strong growth. But there's nothing to suggest that there's any particular issue here. It's simply just the timing and the mix. No, the whole group. Well, let's talk about the U.S. As we've talked about, we are the premier systems integrator for combat systems platforms in the United States. And all of our key franchise programs are in the process of modernization, upgrading, and we anticipate that to go forward. If you think about army modernization, it comes in two flavors. One is upgrading a critical or fighting vehicles and equipment to meet the modern battlefield. And if you think about that, the Stryker of today and the Abrams of today are in all respects different than their predecessors. They look the same, but in all other respects, these are increasingly lethal, increasingly capable, agile platforms. And that gives them relevance to the war fight today and the war fight envisioned in the joint forces combat scenarios of the U.S. military. So those modernization upgrades will continue.  And then the second category of army modernization is in their new start programs. And they've got a number of them as we look out into the horizon. Again, given our capability set, given our proven long-term delivery, we deliver things on time at cost. That puts us in very good stead, along with the Technologies investments we've been making over the last four, five, six years. We are producing some really powerful platforms that will be critical to the future fight. So, I feel good about that. On top of that, in the U.S., our ordinance and armaments business continues to grow. They are critical subcomponents, on almost every major weapons missile system in the U.S. So, these are very, very strong, high leverage, deep backlog, deep customer intimacy programs in the United States. When you look outside the United States, we are continuing to see growth. We've got the Ajax program that has just begun its testing. So, we've got quite a bit of ways to go there. And when you think about our European land system, just to give you a little perspective, there are over 7,000 in-service lab-type vehicles that come out of -- has come out of our European business. That installed base is enormous. And it's an enormous competitive advantage. Some of those systems are older and they need to be upgraded. And we continue to see demand out of multiple parts of Europe. So, we expect ELS to grow and the world hasn't got any safer and that reality of the threat environment drives the demand. So, I hope that gives you a little bit of color here. So, look, we still have a very low default rate that's really not meaningful either in the moment for us or going forward. So, we're not going to give you a model by model. I can tell you nothing particularly surprised us. And it signifies for us at the moment, really nothing on a going-forward basis. Does that help? I'm sure. Do you think I want to start to  backlog. You . So, look we had anticipated going into 2020 that we would see the growth that we had expected. COVID derailed it back a bit. But as we do our planning and think through how we are going to manage COVID going forward and the advance of COVID, at some point in the year, we see that growth in supported by that backlog. And again, I think Jason gave you a very fulsome explanation of how we treat our backlog, and we do that differently than anybody else. And I think we sometimes get penalized for it, but we have the backlog to support growth that we are anticipating. So we have -- look, you would expect us to remain agile to changing trends in the marketplace. And what we were observing is that while our services business and even the older incarnation of Mission Systems work closely together across a number of programs. Increasingly, in the last three years, we're seeing more and more of that. They're working together on bids. They're submitting bids together. And that -- what I've liked about that, these are two separate businesses managed separately. They understand each other. The guys who at Mission Systems know how to run their product portfolio, and the guys at GDIT know how to manage their IT work together business in the last three years, we're are opportunities for you in are two separate businesses managed separately. They services business. And I think those areas of expertise, it's very important to keep them separate from a management point of view. To have them come together to work more seamlessly, we believe this reporting structure helped. But no other respects are we changing anything. So we have a -- Howard, can give you a pretty definitive list, but Jason could give you a few of just the indicative kinds of programs we're looking at. So look, we've got -- I think, longer term, we're looking at additional Stryker configurations. If you think about the Stryker, it is a very versatile very versatile platform. And we've seen the Army in working with us, finding innovative and increasingly more fight critical variance of Stryker. So we have the SHORAD and like -- so we have the SHORAD system coming. We are looking at electronic warfare, medical. And there's a whole series of other increasingly, some of them sensitive, Stryker have -- their brigades have increased their numbers by about maybe 4%, 5%. So each brigade is going to get over time more Strykers in these various configurations. So that's important to that program. We also see the Abrams continuing its modernization. And then we believe we have additional out-year international opportunities, largely through FMS. So we see some growth in Canada, Morocco, Poland, Czech Republic. So all of that contributes -- that's all within the U.S. All of that contributes to our assumptions about growth in this portfolio. Outside the United States, I tried to give you some context about the large embedded fleet and the need to upgrade that fleet. And that, along with the Spanish program, we may see some additional vehicles under that Spanish program, it's soon to call that. So we are really assuming that. But those are the elements that we are -- and by the way, there are new programs, developmental programs that are out for competition, and we like where we stand in those. I will just say one thing about MPS. We developed all 12 prototypes for the testing and evaluation. And I believe we are the only ones to do so even within the COVID environment. That's a discipline will do for you, disciplined product excellence and manufacturing operating excellence. So that is the pipeline that we see in our future. Well, let me tell you, I never speak to anybody else's portfolio, but a couple of observations. It's been my experience that the best antidote for budget reductions, are well-performing, well-supported programs of record. We have all of those. Almost every single one of our programs are on schedule at or below cost. That is when the budget tiers get their night out. Those are almost always the last fall. So that's, I think, a longer perspective to look at. But look, if you look at the U.S. Navy, submarines are its top priority and the Columbia in particular. And why is that? It's because submarines remain a singular competitive advantage, a critical competitive advantage for the United States with near-peer competitors and peer competitors. So I am quite confident that given my belief that the defense budget is driven by the threats that are key elements of our Marine group, growth will be nicely supported. We believe that the Navy will continue to need destroyers The DDG-51 is proving to be a very versatile program platform that can take additional missions. And then with our auxiliary yard out at ASCO, with the exception of the nuclear powered carriers, and nuclear submarines, all these navy's fleets needs gas and the gas needs to get there safely, fastly and pumped efficiently, and that's our new oiled program. So with respect to the Army, I gave you a little bit of color before, but the Army has been quite clear, even in a constrained budget. They will maintain their modernization priorities. They have been both privately and publicly quite articulate about that. And then in terms of the shorter cycle businesses, in the old days, when you were dialing for dollars as a budget tier, you go to the O&M accounts and start cutting the IT budgets, that's not possible anymore. These IT systems are critical to the mission of these agencies, whether that's within DoD or outside DoD. So that as a source of funds is increasingly less likely. And I think, frankly, insulated, given the criticality of IT and then within -- to the war fight and DoD into other missions. And then within our Mission Systems, there's a beauty to having a diverse portfolio of long franchise programs. And I will tell you that we're quite secure in many of those franchise programs because they are, in some cases, unique and in some cases, tied to high-growth nationally critical areas to think against submarines. So, I think it's a height of hubris to assume that any organization is immune from constraints in budget. But performance matters criticality to the war fit matters. And when I look across our portfolio, I'm pretty comfortable that we are in very good stead."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  Please also note, today's event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you, Rocco  and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter 2020 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thanks, Howard and good morning. Before I address the company's quite good performance in the quarter, let me briefly update you on COVID-19's continuing impact. As we discussed last quarter, we're working hard to protect our people. We adhere to CDC guidelines, encourage social distancing and have a mandatory mask policy. We continue to have lower infection rates in our surrounding communities. To-date of our 100,000 employees, we've had about 1,800 cases. 1,500 of whom have fully recovered and are back to work while many of the others are working from home, during their quarantine. In short, the pandemic remains an issue. But we've dealt with the help of our workforce in effective way and continue to do so. As we turn to our results in the quarter, I'll spend less time on quarter over year ago quarter and year-to-date comparisons that are well stated in Exhibit's A and B to the press release. And instead focus my remarks on operations, the significant sequential improvement and meaningful development in the quarter. Regarding the company's third quarter performance as you can discern from our press release. We've recorded earnings of $2.90 per diluted share on revenue of $9,430 million operating earnings of $1.08 billion and net income of $834 million all very significant improvements over the second quarter. As one would expect, revenue was down $330 million or 3.4% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $132 million or 10.9% and net earnings were down $79 million. For the temps  businesses alone the year-to-date revenue is up $98 million and operating earnings are down only $51 million. All up, the defense business has been seriously impacted but is holding up and recovering well as you will see in the details. As you all are aware most of the revenue and earnings shortfall this year to-date has occurred in our aerospace segment which saw significant write-off last quarter associated with reductions and force at both Gulfstream and jet aviation. However, there's mostly good news for both companies this quarter which I'll get into shortly. But before I get into the details of the operating level particularly at aerospace and GDIT where we experience significant improvement. I want to spend a moment on the resilience and strength of the company's backlog. Total backlog of $81.5 billion is down $1.1 billion against the end of last quarter. Funded backlog at $60.2 billion is down only $950 million. However, total estimated contract of $132 billion is down only $336 million against the end of last quarter. While these numbers are down slightly, they represent a solid and enduring backlog.\nJason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I'll start with some comments on our cash performance in the quarter and our latest thinking on how the year is shaping up. Cash from operations in the quarter was $1.1 billion and our free cash flow was $903 million, 108% conversion rate. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $11.9 billion down almost $400 million from the second quarter. As anticipated when we started the year, the cash performance has stepped up markedly in each sequential quarter this year and consistent with that original expectation we have a big fourth quarter ahead of us. That said, our forecast for the quarter is right in line with what the fourth quarter has looked like in each of the past three years, so not an unusual task at this point. So with that at backdrop, we continue to target free cash flow for the year to be in 80% to 85% of net income range. The biggest variables in achieving that mark will be Gulfstream order activity and our ongoing efforts to support our supply chain as we settle on production and delivery rates for next year. You heard Phebe's remarks on that subject so assuming things continue to trend favorably as we've seen of late, we've got a path to close on our cash target for the year. On the defense side, our Pentagon customer continues to lean forward with accelerated contract payments to support the industrial base and we in turn continue to do the same for our supply chain. Through the end of the third quarter, we've received approximately $400 million of accelerated payments from our customers and advanced more than $1.7 billion to our suppliers. To the extent, we eventually see additional relief from our US government customer in the form of incremental contract funds to offset the ongoing impact of COVID to our business. We'll include the benefit of that relief in our results only when it's authorized and funds are made available. As I mentioned earlier, our net debt is down to just below $12 billion and our interest expense in the quarter was $118 million versus $114 million in the third quarter of 2019. That brings the interest expense for the first nine months of the year to $357 million roughly unchanged from $350 million for the same period in 2019. At this point, we expect interest expense for the year to be approximately $480 million.\nHoward Rubel: Thanks Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Rocco , would you please remind participants how to enter the queue.\nOperator: Absolutely.  Today first question comes from Ron Epstein with BoA. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: I'm sorry there'll be a bunch of questions on Gulfstream, so I'll just start with defense. Right, I'll leave those for other folks. In the naval business I know there's been some discussions, some whispers about a III Virginia-class. What do you think of that? Is that a possibility? And what that means for you guys, if that happens? And then I have one follow-up after that.\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes, so we've been talking to our Navy customer about the ability of - essentially the supply chain and the facilities to ramp up production and as you can imagine, we're developing plans to do that as well. But you'll note that in all of the recent discussions about US National Security strategy and particularly the Navy's articulation of the criticality of the size of its fleet submarines figure prominently in all of those conversations because they remain a national competitive advantage for the United States. So we'll continue to work with our customer and we'll see where that takes us at the moment. We're not planning for that increase. But if the nation needs it, we'll accommodate it.\nRon Epstein: And then my follow-up is kind of dovetail's in one of our comments. When you look at there's been discussion, I guess Secretary Esper was talking about 550-foot  Navy, a portion of that is unmanned under sea vehicles. What opportunities that present for General Dynamics?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well let's think about in two parts. In the first instance, it's the job of our shipyards to integrate those capabilities into the existing platforms and we're very good as you can imagine that integrating mission payloads into our ships and our submarines. With respect to individual lines of business within the unmanned world. Mission systems has a number of lines of business that have been very active for quite some time in the undersea domain and unmanned under sea domain, so I would imagine those continue to grow. It's all going to be about performance and their performance throughout testing has been outstanding. So I think there's a lot more to come on that.\nRon Epstein: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: The aerospace impact of $541 million of COVID. What do you base that on? Is that deliveries you plan to do, that you didn't do? And then given that it looks like the decremental margins on the revenue you missed were 22%. Would the profitability value soon  the profitability would have been even better if you've gotten most deliveries?\nPhebe Novakovic: So think about what we did, very quickly in response to COVID. We lowered our production. We did it in two respects. One, to better meet demand but very importantly to allow the supply chain to catch up so that is really what has driven all of the - overriding factor that's driven all of the performance at Gulfstream. Now within that, we've also quite predictably and as we've told right sized that business and we'll continue to do so. So that we manage our margins and nearly push them to be as high as they can. So I think Gulfstream has done a remarkable job in bringing down its cost both for restructuring and then cost savings and productivity. So with respect to the profitability of Gulfstream I think we've seen really some good discipline actions to size the business supportingly  and then continue to perform superbly on the manufacturing line.\nCai von Rumohr: And then the last one, Jason mentioned he had $400 million at advances COVID cares related and yet you advanced a $1.70 billion  supplier or so, so that's a delta or like a $1.3 billion when do you expect to recover that? When do you expect that to burn down to near zero?\nJason Aiken: So Cai, keep in mind that's an accumulative number that's been building throughout the year and so that sort of paves in and then it gets phased out and paid in and phased out overtime. That said, you'll note if you look at our cash flow statement and our exhibits our receivables and unbilled receivables in the quarter as well as payables and on the supply side. Continue to be a bit of an OWC  headwind for us and that's really all attributable to lot of that timing. So I think you'll see that phased out as this pandemic starts to abate and the customer sort of moves its payment practices back to normal and we'll in kind sort of move back to normal cadence from our perspective. In the meantime, our priority is to make sure that our supply chain which is, we're all in a symbiotic relationship here and what's good one for is good for other, we've got to continue to support the elements of that supply chain that needed particularly on the smaller business side and so we're going to continue to do that as the impact of the pandemic continues.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: First of all, perhaps on GDIT. You had quite a few comments there Phebe about the demand environment, the bidding that this business has been doing. Have we finally turned the corner in this division? And can we expect revenues to accelerate from here and to hold onto this operating margin?\nPhebe Novakovic: The operating margin - we'll take that in inverse orders was severely decremented last quarter by a loss that we had on a legacy GDIT program as well as the impact of COVID. And if you recall, we had significant number of our workforce to were covered under the CARES Act and Jason I don't know if you recall those numbers, but it was a lot of revenue that carried in the earnings .\nJason Aiken: About $150 million in the quarter.\nPhebe Novakovic: So those are considerable headwinds GDIT has from the very get go, had superior industry leading and not by a little, but by a lot EBITDA margins and I would expect that performance to continue. Here's a predicate that we finally turned the corner. We can quibble over the predicate. But let me just give you some idea of what's going on the order front at GDIT. In the quarter our overall win rate is an excess of 75%, our re-compete win rate was over 90% and I think it is really just a positive factor that in the third quarter with our largest quarter over 50% of the awards coming from competitive new work. And so I think that's an important indicator of this business on a going forward basis. We had a number of nice enduring wins in the quarter. our performance has been very, very strong on our existing contracts. So I very much like where this business is and again, they've continued to have outstanding cash performance.\nRobert Stallard: Okay and then on the aerospace division. I was wondering if you could give us any clarity on the order intake in terms of whether any differences by model or by region that were notable in the third quarter.\nPhebe Novakovic: Well I think I noted in my remarks that the 650 led the order book. That has been an extraordinarily successful airplane and continues to endure and successfully endure. So internationally, we saw more of a pickup. I was pretty I think fulsome in my remarks about the demand environment. But we saw good order activity internationally.\nRobert Stallard: That's great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nCarter Copeland: Phebe, I wondered if you might talk a little bit about the performance at EB. I'm pretty intrigued by the margins given the COVID cost that you've outlined year-to-date. I mean obviously those come through the reimbursement of those, the treatment there, just implies you guys have found some performance efficiencies there. I wondered if you could speak to that.\nPhebe Novakovic: So electric boat had continued to find and will continue to find performance improvement as well as cost cutting. This is a very efficient yard that's getting better and better at what they do. So I expect their performance to continue and as I noted in my remarks, we're - all of that top line growth we're going to push for margin expansion. We're going to see bottom line growth that the more that we can accelerate that bottom line growth, the better and that's all about productivity and efficiency at electric boat and they've done a superb job in the last four quarters even within this environment of driving productivity improvements. If you think about it and this is just not with respect to the shipyard, but across all of our operating divisions. The COVID has amplified the underlying strength of the operations in this business to the extent that they're driven by disciplined, continuous improvement that helped manage any crisis including this pandemic. So we're continuing to see each and every one of our businesses improved their bottom line performance on the operating side. Now we've long talked about that the strong operations are the key to financial success that and good contract bidding. So I think you'll continue to see this march toward productivity improvements in electric boat is leading the win. More to come.\nCarter Copeland: Okay, great. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nRichard Safran: Phebe, just a quick. You discussed portfolio shaping in your opening comments. so I wanted to get your thoughts on future portfolio shaping. Are you considering any further divestitures or additions to the portfolio? Do you think that there are any holes in the portfolio right now that you need to fill? Just any color you can provide on just how you're thinking about it right now?\nPhebe Novakovic: Richard, I know how much you like that but you know I think - portfolio shaping is only effectively discussed after the fact. So we're always looking for opportunities to improve and focus our activities. But it's really no comment in the moment. There's really nothing on our horizon at the moment. We're sticking to our operations doing what we do best.\nRichard Safran: Okay and as a follow-up at mission. You noted expansion into naval air and electronic systems. I want to know if you could elaborate on that a bit more versus share gains, new contract wins versus expansion into new markets, just any color you could provide there.\nPhebe Novakovic: These are really within our four, that we've had continuing contract wins and that is a business where we've done a fair amount of portfolio shaping because they've got some nice growth in looking at in front of them. I talked about those cyber defense, tactical communications we have, a decades long history and expertise and in the nuclear triad that will continue to grow and missile fire control as well as short position navigation and timing. In a world where on the battlefield GSP reliability is questionable, that's a key and critical factor. That we have developed over quite some time and very strong expertise and so I think it's important when you see these really critical important franchises that you divest yourself of non-business  and that's exactly what we've done.\nRichard Safran: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDoug Harned: Phebe you mentioned earlier about leveraging the breadth of GD of a corporation for opportunities and there were some things that really stood right into that like unmanned, under sea. But when I think of General Dynamics over the long history, I thought of the units it's operating very independently driven by numbers within the unit. Does this suggest that you're thinking differently about how you manage from the corporate center?\nPhebe Novakovic: So look I believe in centers of excellence at the business units in which they concentrate on the really value creation levers at their disposal. That said, we have a long history of our units working together and mission systems in particular. They've heavily embedded in combat systems platform within the marine group and within GDIT. So we're moving increasingly in response to the market I might add increasingly working on joint activities between those two businesses and they worked well together, they blend well together. So there's no fundamental change in how we see our business across our portfolio. I really do think people excel when they stick to what they know, but when we have opportunities to augment that value creation through partnerships across the units, we've done - so we've done for over 20 years.\nDoug Harned: One of the opportunities could be in the area of 5G and you've won contracts both at GDIT and at mission systems related to that. Is this something that we should expect to see as a strong growth area and when might we see, if that's the case?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well I think the department is still working through - how to operationalize 5G? it is an enormous capability advantage for our Warfighter and we have been a part of both their planning and thinking it, at our customer levels for some time. And the way we define how we operate both in the moment and gloom for to how to meet our customer needs so as their need and the clarity around it's used, with respect to 5G in this instance gets increasingly clear. We'll be there to work with them.\nDoug Harned: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks for the color on Gulfstream as you looked out to 2021 deliveries. With regard to that, I think your forecasting $1.13 billion in EBIT in 2020, would you still expect some Gulfstream EBIT growth in 2021 despite lower deliveries?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, let us continue to work that. But in addition to efficiency, the number of airplanes delivered really drive EBIT. So we've got a long way to go in determining what the final plan is. But I try to be very specific in my remarks about how to think about the delivery plan that we have at least at its current notional level. It's really the 550 has gone away and we're not able in this demand environment to replace it with new airplanes. But our new airplane models that we have anticipated. So the production is going to be very similar on our existing fleet, with a little bit of decrement on the mid-sized cabin. So I think that's all we can say in the moment about any specificity around the future.\nDavid Strauss: Okay and as a follow-up I guess Jason on free cash flow as we think about next year. How much potentially could that conversion number bump up? I mean is 100% conversion next year out of the question at this point.\nJason Aiken: I don't want to say anything is out of the question, David. I think what we're focused on is growing free cash flow year-over-year and obviously the two major muscle movers there, that have really been all part of the operating working capital side of that story on the one, the combat systems international program we've told you, I think a good bit about that throughout this year and this is on a trajectory, it sort of set on a path with timing to eventually unwind that working capital over the next three years and then the other side obviously is Gulfstream with the inventory build that really is largely associated with three different aircraft models with test aircraft and the unwinding of that both those test aircraft as well as just general inventory build into the new aircraft models is all going to be predicated on the macroeconomic recovery and when that production rate gets back into full stride and starts to unwind that. So I don't want to put too many caveats around it. But I think the most important takeaway is we expect to see growing free cash flow year-over-year and we'll work out the details as to whether we get to 2% or above 100% as we were projecting before the pandemic.\nDavid Strauss: Okay, thanks very much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Robert Springarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRobert Springarn: Two quick ones, Phebe for you. I know you talked about Gulfstream demand but I just wanted to ask from one other angle. Has the customer mix lately since COVID changed between the number of high net worth individuals versus corporate buyers, so that's the first question on Gulfstream?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well let me address that, I talked about that in my remarks. That I think there's a lot of uncertainty with respect to the economy, political uncertainty and then we still have highly restricted travel restrictions across the world. So that is an issue. That's going to affect corporate buyers, but as I also noted we're seeing international pick up is nice and high net worth individuals continue to be in the market. So as the economy's recovery. We'll see diminution in inflection rate. We'll see a pickup in all of that.\nRobert Springarn: But see what I'm getting at is, is the virus causing people I guess the high net worth group to want to travel privately, where they might not have before?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well I think it's driving motive to people is very difficult. But the high net worth individuals have always been an important part of our portfolio and they remain so.\nRobert Springarn: Okay and I had a quick one for Jason and that's just on mission systems and applied margin in Q4. It sounds like the guidance holds in the mid-14, so just what's driving that fourth quarter?\nJason Aiken: I think what you're looking at there is mostly a mix issue for that business. As Phebe talked about as well with some of that portfolio shaping some of that is to get out of non-core businesses and by association in many cases, some less than desired margin businesses, so that has an uplift effect as well. So I think they're expecting to see a little bit of rebound and some pent-up demand that they've experienced over the past several months that will drive some of that product flow through which will bring some strong mix based incremental margin in the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you and our next question today comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Couple of quick questions was the book-to-bill of the 650 in the quarter above one.\nPhebe Novakovic: Well let's not parse that out for you, but it was quite wholesome. As I said that's a spectacular airplane that continues to be in demand.\nGeorge Shapiro: Okay and then just one for you Jason, can you clarify a little bit the impact on the free cash from the $400 million that you received and you gave out $1.8 billion. I mean if I look at the balance sheet in Q3 it looks like between the working capital would have been $410 million worse  with receivables and unbilled receivables and etc. and so I'm just trying to reconcile what the actual impact on the cash in a quarter was from your earlier comment.\nJason Aiken: Just to clarify George, I think the numbers you're quoting from the cash flow statement are pretty much en pointe as it relates to the impact of OWC in the quarter. the numbers on the payment advances and accelerations from our customers and to our suppliers. Keep in mind, that's not accumulative $1.3 billion of implied pent up cash on the balance sheet as of the end of the quarter. as we're accelerating, this is what I was trying to get into on an earlier question. As we're accelerating cash to suppliers, we're helping keep them going on an ongoing basis from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. so if they've got implicit receivables that are due 60 days from now and we're accelerating that to paying immediately. Well 60 days later that payment was due and so that kind of comes off the balance sheet naturally. But cumulatively we've been accelerating overtime for call it the past five, six months in excess of $1.7 billion to those suppliers. So you've got to kind of reconcile that with the in the quarter what was the net billed of OWC which speaks to the numbers you were speaking to coming off the cash flow statement. so that's kind of how you reconcile those two concepts.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Phebe, it wasn't too long ago that you used to provide kind of backlog duration by platform at Gulfstream. Would you be willing to provide that now just given some of the changes in build rates that you're seeing? Thank you.\nPhebe Novakovic: That was appropriate when we had all existing long-term airplanes that had been in the backlog for some time. This is a whole new fleet and we're not going to start that until these have been in our production for some time. It is a material difference in the kinds of airplanes that we have, these are all new model and frankly as you all know we are the only airplane manufacturer with - we are truly clean sheet airplanes and it's best just to focus on how well we're doing in selling those. I think it is an important indicator that by the end of the fourth quarter, we're going to have 90 of these 500s and 600s in customers hand and let's not forget also we've got over 450, G650s out in the fleet. It's pretty impressive, if you ask me.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, yes understood. And then just on GDIT. I think the traditional metric that folks look at to kind of understand growth as book-to-bill and book-to-bill there, for you all is okay, is that expected .\nPhebe Novakovic:  on revenue. I think it's quite nice.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay, so that's what you expect from that business going forward. There's not an expectation that book-to-bill improves materially there?\nPhebe Novakovic: We're going to have some variances over the quarter. but you know look there's - I wouldn't say that we don't expect book-to-bill to stay the same in perpetuity. It's all going to depend on the win rates in any given quarter and when the customer start deciding all of this enormous pent up backlog proposals, they've got in front of them. And as you can well imagine the velocity in which these contracting decisions are made on the part of the contracts or the part of the customers have slowed down by COVID. So we'll get through all of that and the key areas for us to win more than our fair share and this business is doing I think quite well in that regard.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nHoward Rubel: Operator, we'll take one more question please.\nOperator: Absolutely and our final question today will come from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Phebe, I wonder if you could talk a little bit. I know you don't give multi-year guidance. But maybe in kind of a qualitative way. Thinking about the growth in marine that's going to be driven by Columbia, just so we have maybe some way to size the magnitude of that in the coming years and have some guardrails around it and are aware of the timing of any kind of occasionally we see, picks up and growth as programs move from development to production and kind of when those happen. Any additional color around that?\nPhebe Novakovic: So I think the way to think about the future and while this will be somewhat lumpy on a going forward quarterly basis. The fact that 50% of our growth this year has been in Columbia. I think it's a nice indicator of what this is going to mean to us in the future. Electric boats alone size will be double in the next five to six years. It's already quite a large business and it will continue to grow. This is a - as we've been talking about for sometime an enormous program of critical national importance and we've geared up to both the  to support it as well as prepared all of our manufacturing processes to support it. I'll give you one little note that to give you a sense of what's going to propel this growth. We go into production on Columbia with 80% of the construction drawings done compared to 43% on Virginia and Virginia was one-month successful program the department has ever seen. So that tells that all of the growth that's embedded in those current budget numbers and future year budget numbers within the Department of the Navy are going to be able to be capitalized by us in nice, nice top line growth and then as I noted. We'll continue to work on margin expansion. So we'll give you a sense of what next year looks like and overtime as we really get into the - in the fourth quarter call and overtime. If we really get into full rate production on Columbia. You'll get also lot of clarity on what the future looks like.\nSeth Seifman: Great, that's all from me today. Thanks very much.\nOperator: I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Rubel.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you very much for joining our call today and as a reminder. Please refer to the General Dynamics website for the third quarter earnings release, highlights presentation and outlook. If you have any additional questions. I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I'll start with some comments on our cash performance in the quarter and our latest thinking on how the year is shaping up. Cash from operations in the quarter was $1.1 billion and our free cash flow was $903 million, 108% conversion rate. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet and a net debt position of $11.9 billion down almost $400 million from the second quarter. As anticipated when we started the year, the cash performance has stepped up markedly in each sequential quarter this year and consistent with that original expectation we have a big fourth quarter ahead of us.

            "name": "Phebe Novakovic",
            "content": "Thanks, Howard and good morning. Before I address the company's quite good performance in the quarter, let me briefly update you on COVID-19's continuing impact. As we discussed last quarter, we're working hard to protect our people. We adhere to CDC guidelines, encourage social distancing and have a mandatory mask policy. We continue to have lower infection rates in our surrounding communities. To-date of our 100,000 employees, we've had about 1,800 cases. 1,500 of whom have fully recovered and are back to work while many of the others are working from home, during their quarantine. In short, the pandemic remains an issue. But we've dealt with the help of our workforce in effective way and continue to do so. As we turn to our results in the quarter, I'll spend less time on quarter over year ago quarter and year-to-date comparisons that are well stated in Exhibit's A and B to the press release. And instead focus my remarks on operations, the significant sequential improvement and meaningful development in the quarter. Regarding the company's third quarter performance as you can discern from our press release. We've recorded earnings of $2.90 per diluted share on revenue of $9,430 million operating earnings of $1.08 billion and net income of $834 million all very significant improvements over the second quarter. As one would expect, revenue was down $330 million or 3.4% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $132 million or 10.9% and net earnings were down $79 million. For the temps  businesses alone the year-to-date revenue is up $98 million and operating earnings are down only $51 million. All up, the defense business has been seriously impacted but is holding up and recovering well as you will see in the details. As you all are aware most of the revenue and earnings shortfall this year to-date has occurred in our aerospace segment which saw significant write-off last quarter associated with reductions and force at both Gulfstream and jet aviation. However, there's mostly good news for both companies this quarter which I'll get into shortly. But before I get into the details of the operating level particularly at aerospace and GDIT where we experience significant improvement. I want to spend a moment on the resilience and strength of the company's backlog. Total backlog of $81.5 billion is down $1.1 billion against the end of last quarter. Funded backlog at $60.2 billion is down only $950 million. However, total estimated contract of $132 billion is down only $336 million against the end of last quarter. While these numbers are down slightly, they represent a solid and enduring backlog. Yes, so we've been talking to our Navy customer about the ability of - essentially the supply chain and the facilities to ramp up production and as you can imagine, we're developing plans to do that as well. But you'll note that in all of the recent discussions about US National Security strategy and particularly the Navy's articulation of the criticality of the size of its fleet submarines figure prominently in all of those conversations because they remain a national competitive advantage for the United States. So we'll continue to work with our customer and we'll see where that takes us at the moment. We're not planning for that increase. But if the nation needs it, we'll accommodate it. Well let's think about in two parts. In the first instance, it's the job of our shipyards to integrate those capabilities into the existing platforms and we're very good as you can imagine that integrating mission payloads into our ships and our submarines. With respect to individual lines of business within the unmanned world. Mission systems has a number of lines of business that have been very active for quite some time in the undersea domain and unmanned under sea domain, so I would imagine those continue to grow. It's all going to be about performance and their performance throughout testing has been outstanding. So I think there's a lot more to come on that. So think about what we did, very quickly in response to COVID. We lowered our production. We did it in two respects. One, to better meet demand but very importantly to allow the supply chain to catch up so that is really what has driven all of the - overriding factor that's driven all of the performance at Gulfstream. Now within that, we've also quite predictably and as we've told right sized that business and we'll continue to do so. So that we manage our margins and nearly push them to be as high as they can. So I think Gulfstream has done a remarkable job in bringing down its cost both for restructuring and then cost savings and productivity. So with respect to the profitability of Gulfstream I think we've seen really some good discipline actions to size the business supportingly  and then continue to perform superbly on the manufacturing line. The operating margin - we'll take that in inverse orders was severely decremented last quarter by a loss that we had on a legacy GDIT program as well as the impact of COVID. And if you recall, we had significant number of our workforce to were covered under the CARES Act and Jason I don't know if you recall those numbers, but it was a lot of revenue that carried in the earnings . So those are considerable headwinds GDIT has from the very get go, had superior industry leading and not by a little, but by a lot EBITDA margins and I would expect that performance to continue. Here's a predicate that we finally turned the corner. We can quibble over the predicate. But let me just give you some idea of what's going on the order front at GDIT. In the quarter our overall win rate is an excess of 75%, our re-compete win rate was over 90% and I think it is really just a positive factor that in the third quarter with our largest quarter over 50% of the awards coming from competitive new work. And so I think that's an important indicator of this business on a going forward basis. We had a number of nice enduring wins in the quarter. our performance has been very, very strong on our existing contracts. So I very much like where this business is and again, they've continued to have outstanding cash performance. Well I think I noted in my remarks that the 650 led the order book. That has been an extraordinarily successful airplane and continues to endure and successfully endure. So internationally, we saw more of a pickup. I was pretty I think fulsome in my remarks about the demand environment. But we saw good order activity internationally. So electric boat had continued to find and will continue to find performance improvement as well as cost cutting. This is a very efficient yard that's getting better and better at what they do. So I expect their performance to continue and as I noted in my remarks, we're - all of that top line growth we're going to push for margin expansion. We're going to see bottom line growth that the more that we can accelerate that bottom line growth, the better and that's all about productivity and efficiency at electric boat and they've done a superb job in the last four quarters even within this environment of driving productivity improvements. If you think about it and this is just not with respect to the shipyard, but across all of our operating divisions. The COVID has amplified the underlying strength of the operations in this business to the extent that they're driven by disciplined, continuous improvement that helped manage any crisis including this pandemic. So we're continuing to see each and every one of our businesses improved their bottom line performance on the operating side. Now we've long talked about that the strong operations are the key to financial success that and good contract bidding. So I think you'll continue to see this march toward productivity improvements in electric boat is leading the win. More to come. Richard, I know how much you like that but you know I think - portfolio shaping is only effectively discussed after the fact. So we're always looking for opportunities to improve and focus our activities. But it's really no comment in the moment. There's really nothing on our horizon at the moment. We're sticking to our operations doing what we do best. These are really within our four, that we've had continuing contract wins and that is a business where we've done a fair amount of portfolio shaping because they've got some nice growth in looking at in front of them. I talked about those cyber defense, tactical communications we have, a decades long history and expertise and in the nuclear triad that will continue to grow and missile fire control as well as short position navigation and timing. In a world where on the battlefield GSP reliability is questionable, that's a key and critical factor. That we have developed over quite some time and very strong expertise and so I think it's important when you see these really critical important franchises that you divest yourself of non-business  and that's exactly what we've done. So look I believe in centers of excellence at the business units in which they concentrate on the really value creation levers at their disposal. That said, we have a long history of our units working together and mission systems in particular. They've heavily embedded in combat systems platform within the marine group and within GDIT. So we're moving increasingly in response to the market I might add increasingly working on joint activities between those two businesses and they worked well together, they blend well together. So there's no fundamental change in how we see our business across our portfolio. I really do think people excel when they stick to what they know, but when we have opportunities to augment that value creation through partnerships across the units, we've done - so we've done for over 20 years. Well I think the department is still working through - how to operationalize 5G? it is an enormous capability advantage for our Warfighter and we have been a part of both their planning and thinking it, at our customer levels for some time. And the way we define how we operate both in the moment and gloom for to how to meet our customer needs so as their need and the clarity around it's used, with respect to 5G in this instance gets increasingly clear. We'll be there to work with them. Well, let us continue to work that. But in addition to efficiency, the number of airplanes delivered really drive EBIT. So we've got a long way to go in determining what the final plan is. But I try to be very specific in my remarks about how to think about the delivery plan that we have at least at its current notional level. It's really the 550 has gone away and we're not able in this demand environment to replace it with new airplanes. But our new airplane models that we have anticipated. So the production is going to be very similar on our existing fleet, with a little bit of decrement on the mid-sized cabin. So I think that's all we can say in the moment about any specificity around the future. Well let me address that, I talked about that in my remarks. That I think there's a lot of uncertainty with respect to the economy, political uncertainty and then we still have highly restricted travel restrictions across the world. So that is an issue. That's going to affect corporate buyers, but as I also noted we're seeing international pick up is nice and high net worth individuals continue to be in the market. So as the economy's recovery. We'll see diminution in inflection rate. We'll see a pickup in all of that. Well I think it's driving motive to people is very difficult. But the high net worth individuals have always been an important part of our portfolio and they remain so. Well let's not parse that out for you, but it was quite wholesome. As I said that's a spectacular airplane that continues to be in demand. That was appropriate when we had all existing long-term airplanes that had been in the backlog for some time. This is a whole new fleet and we're not going to start that until these have been in our production for some time. It is a material difference in the kinds of airplanes that we have, these are all new model and frankly as you all know we are the only airplane manufacturer with - we are truly clean sheet airplanes and it's best just to focus on how well we're doing in selling those. I think it is an important indicator that by the end of the fourth quarter, we're going to have 90 of these 500s and 600s in customers hand and let's not forget also we've got over 450, G650s out in the fleet. It's pretty impressive, if you ask me. on revenue. I think it's quite nice. We're going to have some variances over the quarter. but you know look there's - I wouldn't say that we don't expect book-to-bill to stay the same in perpetuity. It's all going to depend on the win rates in any given quarter and when the customer start deciding all of this enormous pent up backlog proposals, they've got in front of them. And as you can well imagine the velocity in which these contracting decisions are made on the part of the contracts or the part of the customers have slowed down by COVID. So we'll get through all of that and the key areas for us to win more than our fair share and this business is doing I think quite well in that regard. So I think the way to think about the future and while this will be somewhat lumpy on a going forward quarterly basis. The fact that 50% of our growth this year has been in Columbia. I think it's a nice indicator of what this is going to mean to us in the future. Electric boats alone size will be double in the next five to six years. It's already quite a large business and it will continue to grow. This is a - as we've been talking about for sometime an enormous program of critical national importance and we've geared up to both the  to support it as well as prepared all of our manufacturing processes to support it. I'll give you one little note that to give you a sense of what's going to propel this growth. We go into production on Columbia with 80% of the construction drawings done compared to 43% on Virginia and Virginia was one-month successful program the department has ever seen. So that tells that all of the growth that's embedded in those current budget numbers and future year budget numbers within the Department of the Navy are going to be able to be capitalized by us in nice, nice top line growth and then as I noted. We'll continue to work on margin expansion. So we'll give you a sense of what next year looks like and overtime as we really get into the - in the fourth quarter call and overtime. If we really get into full rate production on Columbia. You'll get also lot of clarity on what the future looks like."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you, Chad and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2020 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainty. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard and good morning all. Before I address the company's performance in the quarter, let me briefly discuss how COVID-19 is continuing to impact us. We continue in a professional and proactive way to create a safe work environment for our people adhering to CDC guidelines, encouraging social distancing and instituting a company-wide mandatory mask policy. We temperature screen our employees and send those home who fail. These procedures have ensured that we have lower infection rates than the locales in which we operate. Of our over 100,000 employees globally we have had 515 cases to-date less than one half of 1%. As you would expect we continue to incur significant  in addition  considerable program impacts which we estimate to be around $127 million by the end of the second quarter. The most significant impact appears that later in my remarks. On the good news front with respect to Congress all of our major programs are well supported in the congressional markups of the defense funding bills. As we turn to our results in the quarter, I will date comparisons that are well stated in the exhibits to the press release and focus my remarks on the operations and the significant non-recurring items in the quarter. Regarding the company's second quarter performance as you can discern from my press release we reported earnings of $2.18 per fully diluted share on revenues of $9.26 billion operating earnings of $841 million and net income of $625 million. As one would expect revenue was down $291 million or 3% against the second quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $249 million or $22.8% and net earnings were down $181 million. The defense side of the business was down very modestly against the year ago quarter and even less year-to-date. For the defense business in the first half revenue is down only six tenths of a percent and operating earnings are down 3.7% on a 30 basis point lower operating margin. Most of the revenue and earnings challenges in shortfall occurred at GDIT and in our aerospace segment which was particularly impacted by jet aviation. I will comment on this in considerable detail later in my remarks. We experience solid growth at combat systems and marine systems in both the quarter and the first half along with declines in revenue at GDIT and mission systems in part caused by the divestiture of our  business mission systems. However, mission systems had growth and operating earnings for both the quarter and the half on significantly improved operating margins.\nJason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I will start with some observations about our balance sheet and liquidity position following our first full quarter of operations influenced by the pandemic. We generated free cash flow of $622 million in the quarter a 100% net earnings conversion and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion. Importantly, operating working capital remained essentially flat during the quarter even as we've advanced in excess of $1.1 billion to our suppliers to support their liquidity compared with approximately $360 million advanced to us by our customers over the same period.\nPhebe Novakovic: Now let me do my best to give you an updated forecast as I promised at the end of the first quarter in an effort to be as granular as possible in the midst of significant uncertainty. Our aerospace forecast given to you at the end of the last quarter appears to be holding fairly well. We expect about $100 million less in revenue than forecast 90 days ago roughly $8.4 billion and operating earnings of $1.13 billion that is about $20 million less than I gave you 90 days ago. Given everything at work here these are very modest changes. With respect to the defense businesses the impact is now more apparent. We're holding our full-year targets for combat systems for both revenue and earnings. Marine systems has about $200 million of sales pressure but it is holding its earning target even assuming an extended strike at Bath. Mission systems is also holding its revenue and earnings forecast with the exception of the $150 million of divested revenue that Jason discussed. Finally, GDIT has identified between $300 million and $400 million of revenue degradation and $130 million reduction in forecasted earnings including the $40 million charge on the international program I discussed previously. So on a company-wide basis we see annual revenue of about $38.4 billion and operating earnings of about $4.2 billion. This rolls to an EPS of $11 to $11.10 about a $0.30 reduction from what we forecasted at the end of the first quarter. All in all we weathered the storm of the second quarter reasonably well. This will be the low point of the year as we and many of the analysts had anticipated. Finally, as you can see from the highlights pro forma chart we've provided with the earnings release absent COVID the underlying operations of the company are quite solid with double-digit first half EPS growth. That concludes my remarks and I will turn the call back to Howard for questions.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you Phebe. As a reminder we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate.  could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.\nOperator: Absolutely sir.  Today's first question comes from Peter Arment with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Jason, Phebe last quarter you highlighted a lot of details around just kind of the health of the Gulfstream backlog. You also mentioned a couple defaults that you expected that might come back. Maybe you could just give us an update on what you're seeing regarding kind of the health of the customers and what are you seeing on the -- regarding the sales cycle? I know you mentioned that there was quite challenge this quarter.\nPhebe Novakovic : So our backlog is holding up pretty strongly which is in marked contrast to 2008-09 for example where the backlog experienced some significant erosion. While it's very difficult to sell airplanes in fact impossible over the telephone. We were in constant contact with our customers who expressed the same needs and the same requirements as they had going into -- going into this downturn but look implied in your question I think is a little bit about the demand environment. So let me talk to you a little bit about that. As I said we've continued to talk to our customers and we continue to see their interests much the same. We rebuild our backlog but this isn't we've held our backlog and rebuilt our pipeline but this is an interesting downturn. Unlike previous downturns, this one is not driven by anything in the economy itself or in the economies of the world itself. It's driven by an exogenous force impacting the economies with closure and summonses of entire sectors and certainly slowdowns among many others. So that means I believe that it is very hard to predict with any level of certainty and assurance what that economic recovery looks like across the world including most particularly the United States. So when we look at where we are right now at Gulfstream we've seen the beginning of it what would appear to be an increase in demand but it's way too soon to be able to tell the slope of that recovery.\nPeter Arment: Yes. And just as a follow-up to that Phebe is there any, has there been any pickup in defaults or is it still been holding as expected?\nPhebe Novakovic : Holding as expected but I think we had five in the quarter but holding up pretty darn well. We haven't seen many defaults. That as I said differentiates this downturn from all of the other two or the two that I lived through the 2001 tech bubble and then 08/09.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead. Well, I apologize. It looks like our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: Hey, good morning guys. Phebe could you give us an update on what's going on at Bath Iron Works because I know there was some labor stuff and some work disruption if you could update us there?\nPhebe Novakovic : So we are working quite closely with the federal appointed mediator. So I think it's best to be somewhat quiet at this time, silent at this time but I would note that across our company we have many-many union partners and in all respects we have very strong decades-long positive working relationships with them. This union appears unfortunately be the one exception. So we just need to work through this and as I said because we're working with the mediator, I think we're best to sort of say nothing at the point but in any case, given their size and the fact that they all are smart shipyard they really had an immaterial impact on the quarter.\nRon Epstein: Got you and then maybe the one follow-up on land systems. Have you seen much of an impact yet are you expecting to see much of an impact on the COVID, on the international portion of that business be it that for some countries the spending that they're doing to stimulate their economies potentially COVID impact on spending?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So if you're talking about in the quarter, I think it was pretty clear about what those impacts were but in terms of the demand, first of all that we don't see any of our in production vehicles being impacted in the slightest. I mean these are highly performing programs that are very much in demand by our international customers. On a going forward basis, we still see that the demand, it's interesting, it's been my and you and I have talked about this it's been my long-held view that whether it's in the United States or in any of our allied nations that demand is really driven by the threat of the perception of threat and in all respects, I think there's a general consensus that the threat has not dissipated. In fact arguably some of our potential adversaries have become, have raised additional questions. So I think with respect to our overseas markets, I see a fair amount of stability right now. We'll see going forward but not hearing a lot at the grassroots level on any pending economic or any pending in defense cuts.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. So Phebe, good for Gulfstream given the $42 million in severance, kind of as I go through the mix, I have a little trouble getting to your number was there a big cut back in R&D and SG&A or were the accrual rates on any of the newer programs 500/600 increased in the quarter.\nPhebe Novakovic : So look we are, in the quarter we had the severance. We had lower R&D. We expect that to continue in the year really as a result of some of the right sizing we're doing and we had disadvantageous as I noted in my remarks mix. There were several 650s to international customers that because of, it entirely because of COVID travel related restrictions we couldn't deliver. So I think if you add those up along with the pre-owned you'll see that sort of gets you to the number. That helps?\nCai von Rumohr: A little bit. Last question when you look at --\nPhebe Novakovic : Come on Cai, I miss the question somehow.\nCai von Rumohr: Well, no I mean, so R&D was a lot lower is that I mean because you did have the disadvantageous mix? What I am trying to say is that I was surprised the profit was as strong as it was given the severance and I guess you answered it when you said lower?\nPhebe Novakovic : Well, okay I am sorry. I misunderstood. So the underlying operations are quite effective and in fact on a production level we are really humming nicely. So I think that was a significant contribution. I know it was a significant contribution to our costs. Like we've been -- as you know we took some charges that we needed to take. We had some mix issues but this company performed beautifully operationally and that's reflected in and what we consider to be in the environment a pretty good margin.\nCai von Rumohr: And just a quick follow-up, when you look at demand for your products, can you give us some characterization in terms of where is the interest coming? For example, is it coming from international, from domestic, high net worth corporate buyers? Any color would be great.\nPhebe Novakovic : So as I noted, Europe and the far East has been pretty active. In the United States, we talk to all of our customers and potential customers quite frequently but we've been a little slower to get back into the order execution phase though the interest remains quite intense and their needs are the same; nothing has changed about that. This is just a question of timing. We've got to get some of the economic uncertainty behind us but look, we entered this downturn in a very strong position with the best portfolio of products unmatched by any with a great service, the best in the industry service and support business and by far the strongest financial position. So given that nothing is materially changed that we can see in the nature of the orders on a going forward basis, we expect to emerge out of this stronger even than when we went in.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Hey thanks very much and good morning. Jason, I was wondering what's the appropriate level of working capital for across General Dynamics that you guys can potentially settle out on at some point in the future and ideally if you could express it as a percentage of sales?\nJason Aiken: Yes. I don't know that I'd peg it as a percentage of sales so much that it's clearly at this point at an elevated state. We probably I think over the past couple years about what we're seeing in the combat systems group, particularly on the large international program as you're well aware at the beginning of this year. We'll see that continue I think in a more accelerated way over the next two three years. So that'll have a good tailwind to it in terms of reducing the working capital level and then the other big piece of course is Gulfstream. As we've talked about when you're in a mode of introducing new models that naturally comes with a working capital build associated with the test articles as well as the initial production ramp and inventory of those models and then as you get them into full rate production you start to see that inflection point and see that turn. We had been expecting that to happen this year but of course with the disruptions that we've seen associated with the pandemic that has caused the production and delivery schedule to move a little bit to the right and as a result I think the inflection point with the working capital moves a little bit to the right but we ought to see that start to come down reasonably starting at some point in the next year and compounding that with the combat systems\u2019 improvements in working capital, I think those two big muscle movers will see us having a good favorable impact to our free cash flow performance over the next two three years.\nSeth Seifman: All right. Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, maybe you could talk to the second half implied margin transit at aerospace obviously pretty robust bounce back and maybe talk about what that means for \u201821? Is this 15% that you're talking about in the second half, a road map to \u201821 in any way?\nPhebe Novakovic : So our margin performance this year and frankly into next will benefit significantly by the charges that we took and paid for in the quarter. So that is a significant benefit. We also see a more advantageous mix to our deliveries particularly if I am assuming that we don't get a worsening of international travel restrictions or we get zero abatement in them. So a path where we implied we've got a clear path to 70 to 75 deliveries as I said our operations are performing well. We have a plan to deliver each and every one of those airplanes. So we're comfortable in the moment that trajectory while steep is quite achievable. So going into \u201821 all the benefit from this year's cost reductions and rationalization will clearly benefit \u201821 margins.\nMyles Walton: So you could maintain the second half margins into \u201821 or maybe is that  --\nPhebe Novakovic : Well, it's going to be a little lumpy and we're not going to, I am not going to start parsing \u201821 but you can imagine that they will benefit from them.\nMyles Walton: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJon Raviv: Hey. Thank you. Good morning. Jason, following up on the cash generation question, can you talk about how the rest of the year shapes up and kind of what brings you into that range and then also obviously things should get better going forward to get back that the more consistent 100% with all that cash coming towards you though, what is the capital allocation thought and decision process going forward,  purchase any in second quarter but how's the capital allocation conversation going at this point?\nJason Aiken: So as it relates to the outlook on cash I think you'll see this year frankly look quite similar to the way it's looked over the past couple years. It's a fairly steady and steep improvement in the free cash performance in the third and fourth quarters. That's become a more frankly typical pattern for us over the past several years and so you'll see a, I think a particularly strong fourth quarter and again, I think that has to do with some of that working capital starting to unwind in the fourth quarter and I think as I described in the earlier question we expect to see some of that working capital unwind in a more meaningful way into 2021 and frankly even \u201822 and \u201823. So those are really the underpinnings of where we see the free cash flow start to get to back -- not only back to 100% but we've been expecting it to get up above 100% as we look at it in the next couple years and it really is all about unwinding those elements of working capital. As it relates to capital deployment I will turn it back over to Phebe perhaps to answer that question. \nPhebe Novakovic : So I think in the moment in periods of great uncertainty preserving liquidity is the most important thing. We did not buy any shares in the quarter and we'll hold pat for now. With respect to that we'll continue to honor the dividend as we've told you for years. Our dividend is the one part of capital deployment that is repeatable and predictable. So that's all I think we're going to say about capital deployment at the moment.\nJon Raviv: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDoug Harned: Good morning. Thank you. Phebe, when you talk about right sizing the operations at Gulfstream in order to get the margins, get improved margins, how do you think about this medium to longer term? In other words, you're right sizing to a level but I would expect you certainly want the flexibility to take that rate up when demand re-emerges. So how do you balance the two things?\nPhebe Novakovic: So let me give you a little bit of color on how we set in any given year, the production rate and then we can talk a little bit more in detail. So and if we talk specifically about \u201921, the production rate in \u201821 will depend on the number of airplanes we have in the backlog for delivery in \u201821. The number of airplanes particularly in the third quarter of 2020 that we sell for delivery into third were into 2021 and then our -- how we see demand when we set our plan and all of this is done in the fall and it's part of a multi, it's been a long standing discipline process that we have had for a very long time. So look, that will give us some time if we need to increase our production schedule. We've got some flexibility around that our production plan for next year but it is way too soon to speculate about that but in any case is right sizing, I think that we've done are in many instances permanent. This was a good opportunity to just cut costs and I don't expect under any scenario for all of those costs to come back when revenue increases.\nDoug Harned: So this is something that would allow you to hopefully move margins up higher. One of the things that also, I wonder if we could understand a little better is when you think about the G700 and compare that to the G500, the G650, can you talk about how you're leveraging past designs, manufacturing processes and should we see margins rise on the G700 more quickly than these other new programs?\nPhebe Novakovic : I would expect that. That is unlike the other two a modification of an existing airplane. So all those lessons learned on the 650 we can apply to the 700 and you can expect us to do quite well as we come down a learning curve which will be obviously less steep. We know how to build this type of airplane. We've done it before.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nPhebe Novakovic : Hi David.\nDavid Strauss: Phebe, on GDIT, what proportion of the business contracts or people actually need access to customer facilities and can actually just do the work from home?\nPhebe Novakovic : So let me put it to you this way. We've got about 10% of our workforce that is either idle or underutilized and a significant portion of that workforce is in classified area which has been a long-standing series of relationships we've had for many-many years and a good solid partnership that we have with our customers but as it's impossible to do classified work from home. So as our customers sort through how they judiciously and prudently bring back employees in this COVID environment and then how we manage now we augment all of that will sort of depend on going forward where we are. Now right now those costs are being covered by the CARES Act but with no margins. So they've been very dilutive to margin but ultimately this will resolve and it all depends on when our customers believe that they can get back and working at full steam once that some of the COVID uncertainties have been eliminated.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. Great. And could you give a little bit more color on the loss of jet? I guess what was unique about this situation jet as compared to I guess, the rest of your service business and then also the exposure to pre-owned that loss there? How does that mitigate going forward? Thanks.\nPhebe Novakovic : So jet was really about absorption. That was a headwind that we tend not to have in our other businesses. Revenue went down very, very quickly, there's only so and we can only take the fixed costs out so fast by any given schedule but as I said that will return. That was a one-time impact and they had disproportionately more higher severance charges given the nations in which they work. So that's I think an important element of that. And with respect to the pre-owned, we discipline our inventory of pre-owned very, very, very clearly and with very strict structures. So I don't see us having much material risk on this. This was in the quarter. We're not expecting any on a going forward basis but we'll let you know.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Hey thank you. Good morning. Phebe, can you talk a little bit about how the virus is impacting the fractional biz jet market? How it has impacted so far and any potential changes that you see in the landscape going forward out of this? Thank you.\nPhebe Novakovic : Look let the operators of the fractional businesses talk about that but on a going forward basis we do not see any structural change in this market. We simply don't and we see no evidence to suggest that there would be.\nHunter Keay: Okay and I will just squeeze one more and just to follow up on the comment about the 700 margins. Are you suggesting that margins just to clarify can exceed peak margins on 650 --\nPhebe Novakovic : I think that's a little too early to declare victory but let's just put it this way. Everything about this airplane is performing exactly as we hoped in fact better. We have over 100 hours of test on that airplane and it is all indications, all character in all respects is outperforming in some of our specifications. So why does that matter because we really understand this airplane and I think it's premature to say we understand how to build it but it's very premature to say at this juncture that we're going to eclipse those margins but as we get closer to the in-service we get this through tests, we get it through the certification process and we'll have a little bit more color about the timing of the margins and earnings associated with that airplane going forward but this is going to be a very good airplane for us.\nOperator: Thank you and our next question today comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.\nPete Skibitski:  Good morning guys.\nPhebe Novakovic : Good morning.\nPete Skibitski: Phebe, it looks like you're expecting some back half of your margin expansion at combat relative the first half. I am just wondering is that the Spanish facilities coming online or is there some mixed benefit potentially and --\nPhebe Novakovic : So we always ramp in the last half of the year. That's that businesses pattern but really as you quite accurately point out it's at our European land systems but we've got those facilities up and they're at near peak production. So that's behind us with respect to that.\nPete Skibitski: Okay and just, I have lost track of this but the big Spanish and Morocco combat vehicle programs, when you expect to have those under contract if they're not yet?\nPhebe Novakovic : Well, I have learned not to speculate on the timing of sovereign governments. I had decisions but I will tell you that we're going to get this and it'll be a nice addition to the backlog.\nPete Skibitski: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.\nHoward Rubel: And then operator we'll take one more question. This upcoming one will be our last please.\nOperator: Yes sir. And our final question today will come from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Yes. Thanks so much. Good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic : Good morning.\nRobert Stallard: Phebe, just a couple of quick ones on aerospace. I was wondering if you could tell us what you've been seeing on some of the more short cycle parts of this division such as the aftermarket services in terms of trends in recent months or the FBOs and then secondly pricing. You commented on what you've seen in this down cycle versus previous cycles, how is pricing held up this time versus what you've seen in the past?\nPhebe Novakovic : Well, let me answer that in the inverse order. We have seen really no degradation in pricing and as you well know we consider price pressure. So we do not compete on price. We never have and that doesn't change in this kind of environment. So our pricing is holding up pretty well. With respect to the shorter cycle aerospace businesses look those are really volume driven and entirely at the FBO it's volume driven. So the more flying hours we get across all models of airplane the better the FBOs do. Service; services was down but only slightly. It may be a little bit mercurial through the rest of the year but we will have nice performance on service and we expect the mix to improve as well. It was hard for in the second quarter for people to get some of their airplanes in for scheduled maintenance. Most of the scheduled maintenance we did but some of these guys -- it was they couldn't travel. So hard to get the airplane that will resolve.\nRobert Stallard: Thank you. \nHoward Rubel: Thank you. Operator we now end this call and thank you all for joining us today. As a reminder please refer to General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and our highlights presentation. If you have any other questions I can be reached 703-876-3117. \nOperator: Thank you sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I will start with some observations about our balance sheet and liquidity position following our first full quarter of operations influenced by the pandemic. We generated free cash flow of $622 million in the quarter a 100% net earnings conversion and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.3 billion. Importantly, operating working capital remained essentially flat during the quarter even as we've advanced in excess of $1.1 billion to our suppliers to support their liquidity compared with approximately $360 million advanced to us by our customers over the same period. Yes. I don't know that I'd peg it as a percentage of sales so much that it's clearly at this point at an elevated state. We probably I think over the past couple years about what we're seeing in the combat systems group, particularly on the large international program as you're well aware at the beginning of this year. We'll see that continue I think in a more accelerated way over the next two three years. So that'll have a good tailwind to it in terms of reducing the working capital level and then the other big piece of course is Gulfstream. As we've talked about when you're in a mode of introducing new models that naturally comes with a working capital build associated with the test articles as well as the initial production ramp and inventory of those models and then as you get them into full rate production you start to see that inflection point and see that turn. We had been expecting that to happen this year but of course with the disruptions that we've seen associated with the pandemic that has caused the production and delivery schedule to move a little bit to the right and as a result I think the inflection point with the working capital moves a little bit to the right but we ought to see that start to come down reasonably starting at some point in the next year and compounding that with the combat systems' improvements in working capital, I think those two big muscle movers will see us having a good favorable impact to our free cash flow performance over the next two three years. So as it relates to the outlook on cash I think you'll see this year frankly look quite similar to the way it's looked over the past couple years. It's a fairly steady and steep improvement in the free cash performance in the third and fourth quarters. That's become a more frankly typical pattern for us over the past several years and so you'll see a, I think a particularly strong fourth quarter and again, I think that has to do with some of that working capital starting to unwind in the fourth quarter and I think as I described in the earlier question we expect to see some of that working capital unwind in a more meaningful way into 2021 and frankly even \u201822 and \u201823. So those are really the underpinnings of where we see the free cash flow start to get to back -- not only back to 100% but we've been expecting it to get up above 100% as we look at it in the next couple years and it really is all about unwinding those elements of working capital. As it relates to capital deployment I will turn it back over to Phebe perhaps to answer that question."

            "name": "Phebe Novakovic",
            "content": "Thank you, Howard and good morning all. Before I address the company's performance in the quarter, let me briefly discuss how COVID-19 is continuing to impact us. We continue in a professional and proactive way to create a safe work environment for our people adhering to CDC guidelines, encouraging social distancing and instituting a company-wide mandatory mask policy. We temperature screen our employees and send those home who fail. These procedures have ensured that we have lower infection rates than the locales in which we operate. Of our over 100,000 employees globally we have had 515 cases to-date less than one half of 1%. As you would expect we continue to incur significant  in addition  considerable program impacts which we estimate to be around $127 million by the end of the second quarter. The most significant impact appears that later in my remarks. On the good news front with respect to Congress all of our major programs are well supported in the congressional markups of the defense funding bills. As we turn to our results in the quarter, I will date comparisons that are well stated in the exhibits to the press release and focus my remarks on the operations and the significant non-recurring items in the quarter. Regarding the company's second quarter performance as you can discern from my press release we reported earnings of $2.18 per fully diluted share on revenues of $9.26 billion operating earnings of $841 million and net income of $625 million. As one would expect revenue was down $291 million or 3% against the second quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $249 million or $22.8% and net earnings were down $181 million. The defense side of the business was down very modestly against the year ago quarter and even less year-to-date. For the defense business in the first half revenue is down only six tenths of a percent and operating earnings are down 3.7% on a 30 basis point lower operating margin. Most of the revenue and earnings challenges in shortfall occurred at GDIT and in our aerospace segment which was particularly impacted by jet aviation. I will comment on this in considerable detail later in my remarks. We experience solid growth at combat systems and marine systems in both the quarter and the first half along with declines in revenue at GDIT and mission systems in part caused by the divestiture of our  business mission systems. However, mission systems had growth and operating earnings for both the quarter and the half on significantly improved operating margins. Now let me do my best to give you an updated forecast as I promised at the end of the first quarter in an effort to be as granular as possible in the midst of significant uncertainty. Our aerospace forecast given to you at the end of the last quarter appears to be holding fairly well. We expect about $100 million less in revenue than forecast 90 days ago roughly $8.4 billion and operating earnings of $1.13 billion that is about $20 million less than I gave you 90 days ago. Given everything at work here these are very modest changes. With respect to the defense businesses the impact is now more apparent. We're holding our full-year targets for combat systems for both revenue and earnings. Marine systems has about $200 million of sales pressure but it is holding its earning target even assuming an extended strike at Bath. Mission systems is also holding its revenue and earnings forecast with the exception of the $150 million of divested revenue that Jason discussed. Finally, GDIT has identified between $300 million and $400 million of revenue degradation and $130 million reduction in forecasted earnings including the $40 million charge on the international program I discussed previously. So on a company-wide basis we see annual revenue of about $38.4 billion and operating earnings of about $4.2 billion. This rolls to an EPS of $11 to $11.10 about a $0.30 reduction from what we forecasted at the end of the first quarter. All in all we weathered the storm of the second quarter reasonably well. This will be the low point of the year as we and many of the analysts had anticipated. Finally, as you can see from the highlights pro forma chart we've provided with the earnings release absent COVID the underlying operations of the company are quite solid with double-digit first half EPS growth. That concludes my remarks and I will turn the call back to Howard for questions. So our backlog is holding up pretty strongly which is in marked contrast to 2008-09 for example where the backlog experienced some significant erosion. While it's very difficult to sell airplanes in fact impossible over the telephone. We were in constant contact with our customers who expressed the same needs and the same requirements as they had going into -- going into this downturn but look implied in your question I think is a little bit about the demand environment. So let me talk to you a little bit about that. As I said we've continued to talk to our customers and we continue to see their interests much the same. We rebuild our backlog but this isn't we've held our backlog and rebuilt our pipeline but this is an interesting downturn. Unlike previous downturns, this one is not driven by anything in the economy itself or in the economies of the world itself. It's driven by an exogenous force impacting the economies with closure and summonses of entire sectors and certainly slowdowns among many others. So that means I believe that it is very hard to predict with any level of certainty and assurance what that economic recovery looks like across the world including most particularly the United States. So when we look at where we are right now at Gulfstream we've seen the beginning of it what would appear to be an increase in demand but it's way too soon to be able to tell the slope of that recovery. Holding as expected but I think we had five in the quarter but holding up pretty darn well. We haven't seen many defaults. That as I said differentiates this downturn from all of the other two or the two that I lived through the 2001 tech bubble and then 08/09. So we are working quite closely with the federal appointed mediator. So I think it's best to be somewhat quiet at this time, silent at this time but I would note that across our company we have many-many union partners and in all respects we have very strong decades-long positive working relationships with them. This union appears unfortunately be the one exception. So we just need to work through this and as I said because we're working with the mediator, I think we're best to sort of say nothing at the point but in any case, given their size and the fact that they all are smart shipyard they really had an immaterial impact on the quarter. Yes. So if you're talking about in the quarter, I think it was pretty clear about what those impacts were but in terms of the demand, first of all that we don't see any of our in production vehicles being impacted in the slightest. I mean these are highly performing programs that are very much in demand by our international customers. On a going forward basis, we still see that the demand, it's interesting, it's been my and you and I have talked about this it's been my long-held view that whether it's in the United States or in any of our allied nations that demand is really driven by the threat of the perception of threat and in all respects, I think there's a general consensus that the threat has not dissipated. In fact arguably some of our potential adversaries have become, have raised additional questions. So I think with respect to our overseas markets, I see a fair amount of stability right now. We'll see going forward but not hearing a lot at the grassroots level on any pending economic or any pending in defense cuts. So look we are, in the quarter we had the severance. We had lower R&D. We expect that to continue in the year really as a result of some of the right sizing we're doing and we had disadvantageous as I noted in my remarks mix. There were several 650s to international customers that because of, it entirely because of COVID travel related restrictions we couldn't deliver. So I think if you add those up along with the pre-owned you'll see that sort of gets you to the number. That helps? Come on Cai, I miss the question somehow. Well, okay I am sorry. I misunderstood. So the underlying operations are quite effective and in fact on a production level we are really humming nicely. So I think that was a significant contribution. I know it was a significant contribution to our costs. Like we've been -- as you know we took some charges that we needed to take. We had some mix issues but this company performed beautifully operationally and that's reflected in and what we consider to be in the environment a pretty good margin. So as I noted, Europe and the far East has been pretty active. In the United States, we talk to all of our customers and potential customers quite frequently but we've been a little slower to get back into the order execution phase though the interest remains quite intense and their needs are the same; nothing has changed about that. This is just a question of timing. We've got to get some of the economic uncertainty behind us but look, we entered this downturn in a very strong position with the best portfolio of products unmatched by any with a great service, the best in the industry service and support business and by far the strongest financial position. So given that nothing is materially changed that we can see in the nature of the orders on a going forward basis, we expect to emerge out of this stronger even than when we went in. So our margin performance this year and frankly into next will benefit significantly by the charges that we took and paid for in the quarter. So that is a significant benefit. We also see a more advantageous mix to our deliveries particularly if I am assuming that we don't get a worsening of international travel restrictions or we get zero abatement in them. So a path where we implied we've got a clear path to 70 to 75 deliveries as I said our operations are performing well. We have a plan to deliver each and every one of those airplanes. So we're comfortable in the moment that trajectory while steep is quite achievable. So going into \u201821 all the benefit from this year's cost reductions and rationalization will clearly benefit \u201821 margins. Well, it's going to be a little lumpy and we're not going to, I am not going to start parsing \u201821 but you can imagine that they will benefit from them. So I think in the moment in periods of great uncertainty preserving liquidity is the most important thing. We did not buy any shares in the quarter and we'll hold pat for now. With respect to that we'll continue to honor the dividend as we've told you for years. Our dividend is the one part of capital deployment that is repeatable and predictable. So that's all I think we're going to say about capital deployment at the moment. So let me give you a little bit of color on how we set in any given year, the production rate and then we can talk a little bit more in detail. So and if we talk specifically about '21, the production rate in \u201821 will depend on the number of airplanes we have in the backlog for delivery in \u201821. The number of airplanes particularly in the third quarter of 2020 that we sell for delivery into third were into 2021 and then our -- how we see demand when we set our plan and all of this is done in the fall and it's part of a multi, it's been a long standing discipline process that we have had for a very long time. So look, that will give us some time if we need to increase our production schedule. We've got some flexibility around that our production plan for next year but it is way too soon to speculate about that but in any case is right sizing, I think that we've done are in many instances permanent. This was a good opportunity to just cut costs and I don't expect under any scenario for all of those costs to come back when revenue increases. I would expect that. That is unlike the other two a modification of an existing airplane. So all those lessons learned on the 650 we can apply to the 700 and you can expect us to do quite well as we come down a learning curve which will be obviously less steep. We know how to build this type of airplane. We've done it before. Hi David. So let me put it to you this way. We've got about 10% of our workforce that is either idle or underutilized and a significant portion of that workforce is in classified area which has been a long-standing series of relationships we've had for many-many years and a good solid partnership that we have with our customers but as it's impossible to do classified work from home.

This was in the quarter. We're not expecting any on a going forward basis but we'll let you know. Look let the operators of the fractional businesses talk about that but on a going forward basis we do not see any structural change in this market. We simply don't and we see no evidence to suggest that there would be. I think that's a little too early to declare victory but let's just put it this way. Everything about this airplane is performing exactly as we hoped in fact better. We have over 100 hours of test on that airplane and it is all indications, all character in all respects is outperforming in some of our specifications.

Good morning. So we always ramp in the last half of the year. That's that businesses pattern but really as you quite accurately point out it's at our European land systems but we've got those facilities up and they're at near peak production. So that's behind us with respect to that. Well, I have learned not to speculate on the timing of sovereign governments.

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you, Chad and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics' first quarter 2020 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainty. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Before I address the company's performance in the quarter, let me take a moment to discuss General Dynamics' response to COVID-19 and its impact on us. We've been designated a national critical infrastructure company and as such are required to continue full operations, which we have done. I am proud of our patriotic employees who have continued to work hard to fulfill their mission in support of our armed forces as we face this crises together. Our men and women in uniform continue to serve and we must as well. Ensuring a safe work environment for our workforce has been and remains our top priority. We have 39,000 employees tele-working from home unfortunately our large manufacturing sites cannot do that. At these sites, we follow CDC recommended guidelines and practice social distancing where possible. We have increased shift work and the use of PPE. We are conducting temperature screening where feasible. As additional screening and ultimately testing become available, we will aggressively implement those as well. Our leadership teams have been and will continue to be in the workplace leading our people. This is early in the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on our business. So far we've experienced some deterioration in efficiency driven by absenteeism at a couple of our facilities. We expect absenteeism to decline as we see the rate of infection slow. We're also incurring rather significant cost to sanitize the work environment in our facilities and to provide additional PPE. We've also seen definite weaknesses in the supply chain particularly with respect to some of Gulfstream suppliers. Gulfstream is working closely with the suppliers who have also been hurt by the disruptions of the commercial airplane OEMs. Hopefully, we can sort our way through these issues, but some of them are difficult. The Department of Defense is accelerating payment to us to support the defense industrial base. We believe that this will prove to be very helpful. Regarding the company's first quarter performance, as you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.43 per diluted share on revenue of $8.75 billion and operating earnings of $941 million and net income of $706 million. Revenue was down $512 million or 5.5% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $73 million or 7.2% and net earnings were down only $39 million or 5.2%.\nJason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe and good morning. The first thing I would like to note is a key accomplishment on the financing front in the quarter. In anticipation of the pending maturity of $2.5 billion of notes in May of this year and given the extreme volatility we've seen in the markets since the outbreak of the pandemic we issued $4 billion of fixed-rate notes in late March at very attractive rates. While this financing was part of our planning pre-COVID-19, the additional liquidity enhances our financial flexibility during the pandemic, particularly in light of the fact that our free cash flow is weighted toward the second half of the year. To that point, our free cash flow in the quarter was negative $851 million. The cash performance in the quarter was impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak most notably at Gulfstream due to delayed customer payments associated with the net 11 airplanes we weren\u2019t able to deliver. As Phebe noted, customer orders were also postponed in the last two weeks of the quarter. On the defense side, we've seen accelerated payments coming from some of our customers starting in the month of April in the form of increased progress payment rates and other contract mechanism, but we've passed those monies on to our suppliers to help sustain our supply base. In fact as of last week, we had received approximately $55 million in accelerated payments from our customers and advanced almost $300 million to our suppliers on an accelerated basis. After all this we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $5.3 billion and a net debt position of $12.7 billion down slightly from this time last year. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $107 million down from $117 million in the first quarter of 2019 on a lower average outstanding commercial paper balance. But for the year, we're revising our interest forecast up to approximately $490 million to reflect the additional borrowing I discussed earlier. Q2 will be the peak interest expense for the year. As Phebe noted, we had ample liquidity including $5 billion in lines of credit which we renewed during the first quarter and we expect the outstanding debt balance to come down over the next couple of quarters as we repay the $2.5 billion maturing in May as well as our commercial paper balance. On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures of $185 million in the quarter were consistent with year ago. We expect CapEx for the year to be down somewhat from our original forecast as we manage that spend in light of the circumstances but still in the range of 2.5% of sales on a reduced sales number. In the quarter we paid $295 million in dividends and spent $500 million on the repurchase of 3.4 million of our shares. This covers the dilution from stock option exercises the we were unable to address last year due to cash constraints plus the anticipated dilution for the current year. For the year we now expect free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 85% of net income versus the 85% to 90% we previously forecasted, reflecting the reductions in Gulfstream aircraft production and delivery rates, partially offset by the reduced capital expenditures, cost savings across the company and somewhat lower cash taxes. Speaking of taxes, our effective tax rate was 16.7% for the quarter benefiting from several factors including lower international taxes and increased research and development tax credits. For the year we're lowering our anticipated tax rate from 17.5% to 17%. As Phebe mentioned in her remarks, we finished the quarter with total backlog of $85.7 billion, that's up 24% over this time last year and total potential contract value including options and ideology IDIQ contracts was $124 billion up 20% over the year ago quarter. And just one last thought for you as you consider the quarterly progression throughout the year. Obviously there's more uncertainty than we would normally have at this point in the year but as you might expect, we anticipate the second quarter being the low point in EPS in the range of $0.25 to $0.30 below the first quarter with a steady ramp in the second half to achieve the updated targets that Phebe discussed. Howard, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.\nHoward Rubel: Thanks Jason. As a reminder we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Chad could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\nOperator: Thank you.  And our first question will come from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Hi. Good morning. Sorry I was on mute. So I realize this is probably very difficult given where we are in the unprecedented nature of the situation. I think the deliveries you talked about at Gulfstream this year coming out a backlog I think was probably fairly consistent with maybe where people thought and maybe even a bit better. As we look out beyond this year and we think about what might happen to the backlog as we move through the year and as you deliver out backlog, is there any way to kind of I don\u2019t know if there any way to bound that or maybe any way to talk about some of the distinct aspects of this pressure that Gulfstream is seeing now versus periods of pressure in the past?\nPhebe Novakovic: So let me address that in two parts. Our reduction in production this year was driven most exclusively by probations in the supply chain. Some of our suppliers entered this crisis somewhat impaired both from exposure to the commercial aviation market and some financial difficulties. The crisis exacerbated that and even before they saw hit, they were having some difficulty keeping up with our original production rate. So we took down production which we believe helps de-risk the current environment and frankly de-risks some of '21 if in fact we see weakening demand. But look with respect to this year's production you can only go as fast as your weakest link in your chain. So that's part one. Part two, which really I think teaming out a bit is how we demand in this environment. And as I think we eluded to we fully expect business aviation to recover in due course. The question is specific timing but this will again be a robust market for us and will lead with a strong portfolio of new products. If you think about it one of the outcomes that could occur as a result of this particular crisis is the business can ill afford to rely on those commercial airline providers who are either financially weak or unpredictable. So the fundamental case for business aviation remains the same if not somewhat strengthened by this crisis and frankly I think there is a case to be made that much will inert of business aviation as a result of this particular crisis. But there is an important reality I think for all of us to comprehend understand this market and that is in all markets up or down we have the distinct advantage in product, service and cost that leads the competition to compete only on price and availability.\nOperator: The next question will come from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on what you might seen in the shorter cycle business jet off the market and the FBOs this quarter and partly in April as well, whether this could be a lead indicator of where the demand environment is going.\nPhebe Novakovic: Sure, I think is a particularly unusual environment and that it was worldwide and the fact that all human beings, not just particular sectors. So hence the imposition of travel restrictions both in the United States and elsewhere, that really drove our flying hours. So we saw a considerable decrease in the number of flying hours that we believe will resume when some of these -- some of the travel restrictions begin to ease and people are still a little bit safer in traveling. I'll tell you the loading at most of our service centers remains solid. We've implemented some rolling furloughs at a couple of our smaller sites, scheduling inspections and planned maintenance continue at a good pace but some of the discretionary work I think referred for avionics upgrades have fallen back a bit, but again once we resume normal or begin to approach normal flying cadence that we anticipate that some of this will likewise resolve.\nOperator: And the next question will come from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.\nGeorge Shapiro: One for Jason and then one for you Phebe. The one for Jason and maybe you mentioned but if you did, I missed it. If you can reconcile, you have in the back your gross orders and then if you just look at backlog, I guess that's a net number. Is the roughly $300 difference primarily cancellations, which you gave the list in the back there or what is it? And then for you Phebe, in terms of the expectation for deliveries for the year, I assume the second quarter is going to be a lot weaker than the rest of the year and also where the status of the Eisai certification for the 600, thanks?\nPhebe Novakovic: Okay. Well, we had four defaults in the quarter. A chunk of those were not for 2020 airplanes. Their customers we expect to see back. With respect to the second quarter, I think deliveries will be stronger, but as you can imagine with the reduction in production we are taking cost out of our business and we'll have some charges around those particularly in any of the risk charges in the moment and so that could -- that depresses second quarter a bit. But deliveries could be we expect them to be higher once and depending on how fast and at what sequence and in what areas these travel restrictions lift. It's very hard if you think about it, it is we need those travel restrictions to kind of abate because people typically come to pick up their airplanes in Savanna or we fly -- we fly them elsewhere to effectually transfer and that's extremely difficult and kind of constrained environment. But as we see some of the rolling reopening both in the United States and outside the United States, we expect some of those deliveries to revolve nicely.\nOperator: And our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning. Just Phebe one on the implied Gulfstream decremental margins, I think you took down revenue by about $1.5 billion and you EBIT expectation by about $400 million applying some more mid to high 20 decremental margins. How much of this is driven by just reduced productivity because of production issues, work related issues and supplier issues? The decremental margins are a bit higher than I thought we would see?\nPhebe Novakovic: Some of that is based on efficiency particularly as we learn to optimize operating in a CDC driven environment, but some of it is also mix.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. And then a follow up on capital deployment, obviously you have the debt pay down here in May. You guys deal with commercial paper, but how are you thinking about share repurchase in the current environment given maybe political headwinds to doing that versus where your stock price currently sits, thanks?\nPhebe Novakovic: I think you're quite right to point out the political concerns, the concerns in the policy arena about stock buybacks but from my perspective in periods of great uncertainty and volatility, maintaining your liquidity and the strength of your balance sheet is key. So we're going to stay on stock repurchases at the moment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nCarter Copeland: Phebe, I know each one of these downturns are demand flips in aerospace has its own sort of unique fingerprint and I wondered if you might just kind of help give us some color on what this one is like in terms of your customer conversation I would imagine that the big majority of your customers the Fortune 500 companies out there going through some sort of exercise on the timing of expenditures on aircraft when the tapping revolvers and what not. I just -- how does that discussion, how is that going and then how does that evolve in terms of the timing of those, what I would assume are continued purchases in the future, thanks.\nPhebe Novakovic: So one of these elements that is distinctly different from the last time that we experienced in the 2008 timeframe, the great recession was that interest remains very active, whereas in the recession it simply stopped because of the impact on multiple key sectors. Here it's really been about more about simply timing. How soon does the economy reopen and how soon can we get travel restrictions back. So the conversations are continuing. That hasn\u2019t stopped, but in terms of translating that activity into orders, some of that is going to take some time as we see how all of the reduction in travel restrictions as well as the stabilization in the economy occur, but we see this more as a question of timing in this environment. As of the moment the backlog is holding up very nicely, which results are distinctly different from the last time, but we're always mindful that if you have worldwide economic crises of the large economies that become really dire, backlog is an issue that we're going to have to follow very carefully and we're being very mindful. This is a company that has been through this kind of environment before albeit for very different reasons and manifesting itself at different ways.\nCarter Copeland: And is it fair to characterize the decisions you will make from a production standpoint to get to the lower deliveries s temporary in nature whether it's furloughs or timing related, I guess are you protecting upside in your production capacity for when things return to normal? Is that the right way to think about what you're doing?\nPhebe Novakovic: I think the right way to think about it is that when you have changes in your environment, you have to react fairly quickly, postulating the best possible outflow -- postulating the best as you can what various outcomes are like and what we have done is in the moment sized our production so that our supply chain can keep up with it, but also recognizing that it prepares us if in fact demand does increasingly weaken in next year to manage that risk as we'll. So I think we have found our risk as well as we possibly can in the moment, understanding where what we see.\nOperator: The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: Thank you very much. So number of dealers we've talked to expect as you indicate the demand should pick up later in the year as kind of COVID impact abates, but one of the concerns they have is that basically there's been a weakening in terms of the preowned market. The pricing there is starting to erode and may go down and in particular with the G650 where you have a large install base that preowned G650s would compete with your production. Are you seeing or to what extent are you concerned about potential pricing pressures from the preowned market, thanks?\nPhebe Novakovic: We have yet to see any. We done see any significant build up of like new preowned Gulfstream and we've seen no impact on price. That preowned inventory for each of our large cabin including the 650 is well below the market standard threshold. So at the moment, we either have a lot of preowned inventory in our house nor do we see that it is impacted our current demand, nor our current -- our current pricing. So this again is very different than what we saw in the 2008, 2009 timeframe. Preowned is simply not an issue in the moment.\nCai von Rumohr: Thanks so much and one follow-up would be can you give us an update on how you are doing G500, G600 production and the expectation or certification of the G700 in late 2021?\nPhebe Novakovic: So let's go in reverse order the G700 continues to performance test -- it's test pattern. So we have about 100 hours under our belt and airplane is performing extremely well. The G500 and G600, of course are going to be some of the change in the production that we have set for the year, some the mix issue but the demand for both of those programs has been wholesome and is increasing. And I think George asked the question that I failed to answer on EASA, and you tease it that as well indirectly. EASA had been slowed by the impact of the MAX. And while I can't speak to them directly in terms of their timing, this has no doubt impacted them as well but we'll get through that and these airplanes, the more that they're in the market, the more people see exactly what these airplanes can do for them and they're pretty impressed.\nOperator: The next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Phebe, is 100% of the Gulfstream delivery and revenue outlook reduction that you\u2019ve made here today, is 100% of that from supply chain disruption and inability to fly to deliver airplane disruption and none of it from demand impact?\nPhebe Novakovic: Really isn\u2019t demand driven. I think I noted two factors a couple of times, but let me just reiterate as I think I've discussed some fulsome detail but supply chain, but we also have some efficiency issues within these plants within our assembly manufacturing plant as we learn to optimize production under the social distancing rules, additional PPE cleaning as shift work as we've increased the number of shifts. So as we began to optimize that over time in production environment, that will also allow us to mitigate any impacts from some of the inherent inefficiency there, but that was also an issue, but overwhelmingly the predominant issue here was the supply chain. And frankly as I said if you think about it in terms of you simply seen significantly weakening demand. We have done a nice job to de-risk some of '21 and I think that's where you could potentially see demand and one of the salutary benefits of the actions that we're taking today, do provide some risk mitigation for '21. So that's why I've said a couple times, we believe that we've founded our risk in all respects at the moment.\nNoah Poponak: Have you seen any -- not just through Q1 but year to date, have you seen any cancellations or deferrals in the existing backlog?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yeah I mentioned earlier, we had four and all of whom we have while three of whom we expect to come back but that is all that we've seen today and the backlog of how they're continuing to hold up very nicely. But we recognize that this will de-risk any additional impacts to the backlog, but so far we're not hearing noises coming out of the customer base and the backlog of any note at the moment.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: Maybe changing gears a little bit to your navy business, the navy has accelerated its procurement of systems, I mean if you talk to the procurement leadership in the navy and they\u2019ll tell you how they're very proud of the amount of work they put under contract in a short period of time. How are you seeing that in your naval business and how do you expect that to flow through the rest of the year?\nPhebe Novakovic: So our navy procurement people have been really leaders and beacons of stability and foresight during this entire crisis. They have increased the velocity at which we've gotten contract awards, we particularly see that on the repair side. Our new ship construction is our large big contracts. I wouldn't expect to see any additional particular increase in velocity on those but we have on the shorter cycle businesses and they have been very, very supportive in understanding the need to undergird the defense industrial supply chain.\nRon Epstein: And then as one follow-on, you mentioned a couple times in your prepared remarks and even in some of the questions that you\u2019ve got some concerns over the supply chain. How do you see that playing out particularly if you\u2019ve got a smaller let's call it a mom-and-pop supplier who is largely commercial aerospace that don\u2019t do much defense work and their supplying into Gulfstream? How are you trying to mitigate that risk?\nPhebe Novakovic: So if you can imagine these are all sensitive negotiations. We're working closely with all. We know all of our challenge suppliers are at the moment, working closely with them to get -- to provide on-site mitigation and support where we can and ultimately if we have to bring it in house we will. But we have managed through this and will continue to do so, but there is risk here. It's not without the risk for reasons that I think you all can understand as well as we can.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJon Raviv: Turning to IT for a moment, any visibility or perspective on when we might see some of those nice backlog trends translate into growth when some of those items that you slide might dissipate. And then also can you talk about how IT is supporting the customer in the current environment and how it can be oriented to support new priorities coming out of the coronavirus crisis?\nPhebe Novakovic: So one of the elements of GDIT is an enormous agility coupled with their customer intimacy. So as our customers adjust both on the defense Intel and federal civilian environments. We'll work very closely with them on new opportunities. I think one of the challenges is that our customer needs to get back up and in a regular cadence and regular order and that will then drive our ability to attend these sites. While many of our people can work from home. A lot of them have to be on site with the customer and so once the customer gets up in full bore operations, that will drive then additional revenue on our part but look these GDIT has had been very successful in winning additional business that ultimately begins to translate into revenue and profitable revenue at that. So I think we need to particularly on IT get everybody back and working and then have a sense if we have any timing issues from some incremental backed-up impact from the revenue side from just this a bit of a hiatus that some of our customers have taken. But they're positioned for good growth with their backlog. They had superb winning capture rates. So they fit very nicely and comfortably right now in their market space.\nJon Raviv: And just as a follow-up can you talk about how customer conversations in that business might be developing in the current environment where there might be more focus on this aggregated workforces further acceleration of the cloud, further IT monetization, larger implementation of CDC, NIH type work packages. So any sort of thinking about how the national priorities might shift or accelerate coming out of this.\nPhebe Novakovic: I don\u2019t know that we have seen anything that one could realistically discern a trend from. I think it's too early. As far as the distributed workforce I think that's way too early. I think we have to look at the efficiency metrics on how that actually plays out as they say a lot of our people need to be on customer sites. But we haven't seen a wholesale strategic or structural shift in the way that our customer is thinking about, either the cloud or its mission in a post COVID environment. I suspect naturally there will be some. Again as we think about how long do we keep social distancing, how long do we keep distancing, how long the integrated shifts and rolling shifts. So I think, some of that will play out, but so far I haven't seen a material of structural change in how our customer is thinking about their mission.\nHoward Rubel: And then we have one final question, operator.\nOperator: And that question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Jason, maybe this one is for you, given the free cash flow, can you revisit some of the dynamics of the 85% to 90% conversion in 2020 it seems the Canada payments are intact. So that's still about a $1 billion and what are other changes to working capital perhaps with either progress payments or inventories? Is it fair to assume that Gulfstream was may be $500 million or so of inventories in Q1 given you couldn\u2019t deliver 11 aircrafts?\nJason Aiken: Sure. I think you\u2019ve picked up on a number instantly on a number of the drivers here. The two $500 million payments on the Canadian program were inherent in our forecasts of those coming in is certainly welcome news to solidify that element of the outlook. When you think about the defense side of the business and some of the accelerated contract payments progress payment rates have moved from 80% to 90% and some other advance mechanisms we're seeing. As I mentioned most if not all of that is essentially flowing through to the supply chain. So that's really sort of a net pass when it comes to the outlook. So bottom line really when you think about the overall impact, it really is at Gulfstream and it's that portion of the production out or I should say the production rate down. When you think about it, we were expecting to start this year with sort of the inflection point on working through some of the inventory working capital at Gulfstream between the test airplane deliveries and getting 500 and 600 up to a more steady state production level with these production shifts that sort of pushes that out call it 6 to 12 months and so the inflection point on that working capital drawdown at Gulfstream will just push out some somewhat. So that's really the driver in the difference on the free cash flow conversion.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you and Chad thank you and everyone else for being on this call today. As a reminder please refer to the General Dynamics' website for the first quarter earnings release and highlights presentation which contains our summary outlook. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has not concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Thank you, Phebe and good morning. The first thing I would like to note is a key accomplishment on the financing front in the quarter. In anticipation of the pending maturity of $2.5 billion of notes in May of this year and given the extreme volatility we've seen in the markets since the outbreak of the pandemic we issued $4 billion of fixed-rate notes in late March at very attractive rates. While this financing was part of our planning pre-COVID-19, the additional liquidity enhances our financial flexibility during the pandemic, particularly in light of the fact that our free cash flow is weighted toward the second half of the year. To that point, our free cash flow in the quarter was negative $851 million. The cash performance in the quarter was impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak most notably at Gulfstream due to delayed customer payments associated with the net 11 airplanes we weren't able to deliver. As Phebe noted, customer orders were also postponed in the last two weeks of the quarter. On the defense side, we've seen accelerated payments coming from some of our customers starting in the month of April in the form of increased progress payment rates and other contract mechanism, but we've passed those monies on to our suppliers to help sustain our supply base. In fact as of last week, we had received approximately $55 million in accelerated payments from our customers and advanced almost $300 million to our suppliers on an accelerated basis. After all this we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $5.3 billion and a net debt position of $12.7 billion down slightly from this time last year. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $107 million down from $117 million in the first quarter of 2019 on a lower average outstanding commercial paper balance. But for the year, we're revising our interest forecast up to approximately $490 million to reflect the additional borrowing I discussed earlier. Q2 will be the peak interest expense for the year. As Phebe noted, we had ample liquidity including $5 billion in lines of credit which we renewed during the first quarter and we expect the outstanding debt balance to come down over the next couple of quarters as we repay the $2.5 billion maturing in May as well as our commercial paper balance. On the capital deployment front, capital expenditures of $185 million in the quarter were consistent with year ago. We expect CapEx for the year to be down somewhat from our original forecast as we manage that spend in light of the circumstances but still in the range of 2.5% of sales on a reduced sales number. In the quarter we paid $295 million in dividends and spent $500 million on the repurchase of 3.4 million of our shares. This covers the dilution from stock option exercises the we were unable to address last year due to cash constraints plus the anticipated dilution for the current year. For the year we now expect free cash flow to be in the range of 80% to 85% of net income versus the 85% to 90% we previously forecasted, reflecting the reductions in Gulfstream aircraft production and delivery rates, partially offset by the reduced capital expenditures, cost savings across the company and somewhat lower cash taxes. Speaking of taxes, our effective tax rate was 16.7% for the quarter benefiting from several factors including lower international taxes and increased research and development tax credits. For the year we're lowering our anticipated tax rate from 17.5% to 17%. As Phebe mentioned in her remarks, we finished the quarter with total backlog of $85.7 billion, that's up 24% over this time last year and total potential contract value including options and ideology IDIQ contracts was $124 billion up 20% over the year ago quarter. And just one last thought for you as you consider the quarterly progression throughout the year. Obviously there's more uncertainty than we would normally have at this point in the year but as you might expect, we anticipate the second quarter being the low point in EPS in the range of $0.25 to $0.30 below the first quarter with a steady ramp in the second half to achieve the updated targets that Phebe discussed. Howard, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. Sure. I think you've picked up on a number instantly on a number of the drivers here. The two $500 million payments on the Canadian program were inherent in our forecasts of those coming in is certainly welcome news to solidify that element of the outlook. When you think about the defense side of the business and some of the accelerated contract payments progress payment rates have moved from 80% to 90% and some other advance mechanisms we're seeing.

So that's really the driver in the difference on the free cash flow conversion."

            "name": "Phebe Novakovic",
            "content": "Thank you, Howard. Before I address the company's performance in the quarter, let me take a moment to discuss General Dynamics' response to COVID-19 and its impact on us. We've been designated a national critical infrastructure company and as such are required to continue full operations, which we have done. I am proud of our patriotic employees who have continued to work hard to fulfill their mission in support of our armed forces as we face this crises together. Our men and women in uniform continue to serve and we must as well. Ensuring a safe work environment for our workforce has been and remains our top priority. We have 39,000 employees tele-working from home unfortunately our large manufacturing sites cannot do that. At these sites, we follow CDC recommended guidelines and practice social distancing where possible. We have increased shift work and the use of PPE. We are conducting temperature screening where feasible. As additional screening and ultimately testing become available, we will aggressively implement those as well. Our leadership teams have been and will continue to be in the workplace leading our people. This is early in the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on our business. So far we've experienced some deterioration in efficiency driven by absenteeism at a couple of our facilities. We expect absenteeism to decline as we see the rate of infection slow. We're also incurring rather significant cost to sanitize the work environment in our facilities and to provide additional PPE. We've also seen definite weaknesses in the supply chain particularly with respect to some of Gulfstream suppliers. Gulfstream is working closely with the suppliers who have also been hurt by the disruptions of the commercial airplane OEMs. Hopefully, we can sort our way through these issues, but some of them are difficult. The Department of Defense is accelerating payment to us to support the defense industrial base. We believe that this will prove to be very helpful. Regarding the company's first quarter performance, as you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.43 per diluted share on revenue of $8.75 billion and operating earnings of $941 million and net income of $706 million. Revenue was down $512 million or 5.5% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $73 million or 7.2% and net earnings were down only $39 million or 5.2%. So let me address that in two parts. Our reduction in production this year was driven most exclusively by probations in the supply chain. Some of our suppliers entered this crisis somewhat impaired both from exposure to the commercial aviation market and some financial difficulties. The crisis exacerbated that and even before they saw hit, they were having some difficulty keeping up with our original production rate. So we took down production which we believe helps de-risk the current environment and frankly de-risks some of '21 if in fact we see weakening demand.

If you think about it one of the outcomes that could occur as a result of this particular crisis is the business can ill afford to rely on those commercial airline providers who are either financially weak or unpredictable. So the fundamental case for business aviation remains the same if not somewhat strengthened by this crisis and frankly I think there is a case to be made that much will inert of business aviation as a result of this particular crisis. But there is an important reality I think for all of us to comprehend understand this market and that is in all markets up or down we have the distinct advantage in product, service and cost that leads the competition to compete only on price and availability. Sure, I think is a particularly unusual environment and that it was worldwide and the fact that all human beings, not just particular sectors. So hence the imposition of travel restrictions both in the United States and elsewhere, that really drove our flying hours. So we saw a considerable decrease in the number of flying hours that we believe will resume when some of these -- some of the travel restrictions begin to ease and people are still a little bit safer in traveling. I'll tell you the loading at most of our service centers remains solid. We've implemented some rolling furloughs at a couple of our smaller sites, scheduling inspections and planned maintenance continue at a good pace but some of the discretionary work I think referred for avionics upgrades have fallen back a bit, but again once we resume normal or begin to approach normal flying cadence that we anticipate that some of this will likewise resolve. Okay. Well, we had four defaults in the quarter. A chunk of those were not for 2020 airplanes. Their customers we expect to see back. With respect to the second quarter, I think deliveries will be stronger, but as you can imagine with the reduction in production we are taking cost out of our business and we'll have some charges around those particularly in any of the risk charges in the moment and so that could -- that depresses second quarter a bit. But deliveries could be we expect them to be higher once and depending on how fast and at what sequence and in what areas these travel restrictions lift. It's very hard if you think about it, it is we need those travel restrictions to kind of abate because people typically come to pick up their airplanes in Savanna or we fly -- we fly them elsewhere to effectually transfer and that's extremely difficult and kind of constrained environment. But as we see some of the rolling reopening both in the United States and outside the United States, we expect some of those deliveries to revolve nicely. Some of that is based on efficiency particularly as we learn to optimize operating in a CDC driven environment, but some of it is also mix. I think you're quite right to point out the political concerns, the concerns in the policy arena about stock buybacks but from my perspective in periods of great uncertainty and volatility, maintaining your liquidity and the strength of your balance sheet is key.

As of the moment the backlog is holding up very nicely, which results are distinctly different from the last time, but we're always mindful that if you have worldwide economic crises of the large economies that become really dire, backlog is an issue that we're going to have to follow very carefully and we're being very mindful. This is a company that has been through this kind of environment before albeit for very different reasons and manifesting itself at different ways. I think the right way to think about it is that when you have changes in your environment, you have to react fairly quickly, postulating the best possible outflow -- postulating the best as you can what various outcomes are like and what we have done is in the moment sized our production so that our supply chain can keep up with it, but also recognizing that it prepares us if in fact demand does increasingly weaken in next year to manage that risk as we'll. So I think we have found our risk as well as we possibly can in the moment, understanding where what we see. We have yet to see any. We done see any significant build up of like new preowned Gulfstream and we've seen no impact on price. That preowned inventory for each of our large cabin including the 650 is well below the market standard threshold. So at the moment, we either have a lot of preowned inventory in our house nor do we see that it is impacted our current demand, nor our current -- our current pricing. So this again is very different than what we saw in the 2008, 2009 timeframe. Preowned is simply not an issue in the moment. So let's go in reverse order the G700 continues to performance test -- it's test pattern. So we have about 100 hours under our belt and airplane is performing extremely well. The G500 and G600, of course are going to be some of the change in the production that we have set for the year, some the mix issue but the demand for both of those programs has been wholesome and is increasing. And I think George asked the question that I failed to answer on EASA, and you tease it that as well indirectly. EASA had been slowed by the impact of the MAX. And while I can't speak to them directly in terms of their timing, this has no doubt impacted them as well but we'll get through that and these airplanes, the more that they're in the market, the more people see exactly what these airplanes can do for them and they're pretty impressed. Really isn't demand driven. I think I noted two factors a couple of times, but let me just reiterate as I think I've discussed some fulsome detail but supply chain, but we also have some efficiency issues within these plants within our assembly manufacturing plant as we learn to optimize production under the social distancing rules, additional PPE cleaning as shift work as we've increased the number of shifts. So as we began to optimize that over time in production environment, that will also allow us to mitigate any impacts from some of the inherent inefficiency there, but that was also an issue, but overwhelmingly the predominant issue here was the supply chain. And frankly as I said if you think about it in terms of you simply seen significantly weakening demand. We have done a nice job to de-risk some of '21 and I think that's where you could potentially see demand and one of the salutary benefits of the actions that we're taking today, do provide some risk mitigation for '21. So that's why I've said a couple times, we believe that we've founded our risk in all respects at the moment. Yeah I mentioned earlier, we had four and all of whom we have while three of whom we expect to come back but that is all that we've seen today and the backlog of how they're continuing to hold up very nicely. But we recognize that this will de-risk any additional impacts to the backlog, but so far we're not hearing noises coming out of the customer base and the backlog of any note at the moment. So our navy procurement people have been really leaders and beacons of stability and foresight during this entire crisis. They have increased the velocity at which we've gotten contract awards, we particularly see that on the repair side. Our new ship construction is our large big contracts. I wouldn't expect to see any additional particular increase in velocity on those but we have on the shorter cycle businesses and they have been very, very supportive in understanding the need to undergird the defense industrial supply chain. So if you can imagine these are all sensitive negotiations. We're working closely with all. We know all of our challenge suppliers are at the moment, working closely with them to get -- to provide on-site mitigation and support where we can and ultimately if we have to bring it in house we will. But we have managed through this and will continue to do so, but there is risk here. It's not without the risk for reasons that I think you all can understand as well as we can. So one of the elements of GDIT is an enormous agility coupled with their customer intimacy. So as our customers adjust both on the defense Intel and federal civilian environments. We'll work very closely with them on new opportunities. I think one of the challenges is that our customer needs to get back up and in a regular cadence and regular order and that will then drive our ability to attend these sites. While many of our people can work from home. A lot of them have to be on site with the customer and so once the customer gets up in full bore operations, that will drive then additional revenue on our part but look these GDIT has had been very successful in winning additional business that ultimately begins to translate into revenue and profitable revenue at that. So I think we need to particularly on IT get everybody back and working and then have a sense if we have any timing issues from some incremental backed-up impact from the revenue side from just this a bit of a hiatus that some of our customers have taken. But they're positioned for good growth with their backlog. They had superb winning capture rates. So they fit very nicely and comfortably right now in their market space. I don't know that we have seen anything that one could realistically discern a trend from. I think it's too early. As far as the distributed workforce I think that's way too early. I think we have to look at the efficiency metrics on how that actually plays out as they say a lot of our people need to be on customer sites. But we haven't seen a wholesale strategic or structural shift in the way that our customer is thinking about, either the cloud or its mission in a post COVID environment. I suspect naturally there will be some. Again as we think about how long do we keep social distancing, how long do we keep distancing, how long the integrated shifts and rolling shifts. So I think, some of that will play out, but so far I haven't seen a material of structural change in how our customer is thinking about their mission.

Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you, Operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full year 2021 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast which are available on the Investor Relations page on our Web site, investorrelations.gd.com. Now, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning, and thank you, Howard. Earlier today we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.3 billion, net earnings of $952 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.39. The sales in most respect consistent with our previous guidance sell-side consensus. The results in comparison with prior periods are rather straightforward and set out in our press release. I'll go through some of that detail quite briefly, as I give you my thoughts on the business segments. As we indicated, it would be, the final quarter is our strongest quarter of the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, earnings, operating margin, net earnings and return on sales improved quarter over the prior quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvements. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that revenue was up $724 million, operating earnings were up $106 million, and earnings per share up $0.32. So, all in all, a solid quarter with good operating performance. For the full year, we had revenue of $38.5 billion, up 1.4% from 2020; net earnings of $3.26 billion, up 2.8% and earnings per fully diluted share of $11.55, modestly better than consensus and up $0.55 over 2020. We ended the year with a total backlog of $87.6 billion and total estimated contract value of $127.5 billion. Our business was strengthened by significant growth in aerospace backlog to $16.3 billion. I'll have more to say about that when we get to the business segment comments. The total company book-to-bill is one-to-one for the quarter and the year, led by the powerful order performance of Gulfstream. Our cash performance for the quarter and the year is very strong. The conversion rates of the quarter is 136% of net income and 104% for the year. Jason will have more fulsome comments on this subject and backlog in his remarks. Now let me turn to reviewing the quarter and paying some attention to quarter-over-quarter and sequential comparisons as well as full year in the context of each group and provide colors appropriately. So, first Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.6 billion is up 5.1% over the year ago quarter on the delivery of 39 aircraft, 35 of which were large cabin. While this was the strongest delivery quarter of the year, it fell short of our expectation by one aircraft, which has flipped  into 2022. For the full year revenue of $8.1 4 billion is up modestly from the prior year even though we delivered 119 aircraft, 8 fewer aircraft than we did in 2020. The increase was driven by higher service revenue at Gulfstream and a nice increase in revenue at Jet Aviation. Fourth quarter Aerospace earnings of $354 million are down $47 million from year ago quarter, even though revenue was $125 million higher, resulting in a 270 basis point reduction in operating margin. The major source of the variance is a $50 million increase in net R&D costs driven by the certification on the G700 and G800 and accelerated work on the G400. The year ago quarter was also helped by a significant launch assistant payment that was an offset to gross R&D. Nevertheless, Aerospace operating earnings and margins are better-than-anticipated by consensus. The same can be said for the full year results. I should also point out that Aerospace margins improved throughout the year and that was true with respect to both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. At midyear last year, we told you we expect revenue of about $8.2 billion; operating margin around 12.4% with earnings of $1.01 billion. We finished the year with revenue of $8.14 billion; operating earnings of $1.03 billion and a 12.7% operating margin. In sum, we were slightly better on earnings and margin, but very close to our forecast on revenue.  the most important story in the quarter for Aerospace and frankly for the company was the extraordinary order activity of Gulfstream. Last quarter, I told you that orders in the third quarter boarded on the spectacular. This quarter, they were significantly better. Order activity in the quarter was beyond anything we had seen since 2008 with the introduction of the G650. Demand that turned very good in mid-February and continued through the second and third quarters was red hot in fourth quarter. Let me give you the particulars. The Aerospace group in dollar denominated orders had a book-to-bill of 1.7 to 1. Gulfstream alone was 1.8 to 1 and in unit terms, it was over 2x. Remember that these multiples are off of an increased denominator with 39 deliveries. This translates into a very significant backlog growth. Aerospace added $1.6 billion to backlog in the quarter and $4.7 billion for the year. As we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains robust and sales activity is brisk. The buildup in backlog and the pace of current demand leaves us with a rich problem, but a problem nonetheless. How do we satisfy the demand manifest in our current backlog supplemented by continuing brisk activity having previously turned down production? Can the supply chain support us? Are we ready? Well, the answer is we will increase production in 2022, but not to where it needs to be. Remember also that some of our increased production in '22 will be in building G700s, and G800s that will not deliver in '22, a prebuild, if you will. As it turns out, the long pull in the 10 is manufacturing wings, which we do ourselves. You may recall that we previously vertically integrated wing supply because of  in the supply chain. So, what do we need to do? We need to expand our new modern wing facility and acquire another set of tools and fixtures. All of this is underway and will be in place to satisfy our needs for '23 and beyond. This leads to the question of what are the implications of this for 2022 guidance. I'll address '22 guidance a little later. Further, given the robust and enduring backlog of Gulfstream, we also feel comfortable with giving you a look at what is anticipated for '23 and '24 as well. Finally, on the new product development front, all 5 G700 flight test aircraft are flying and have over 2,200 flight test hours. We have completed over 65% of all required testing. Next Combat Systems. Revenue in the quarter of $1.89 billion is up 3.7% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $281 million are off $28 million on a 90 basis point decrease in operating margin. Let me point out, however, that a 14.9% margin in the quarter is highly respectable. For the full year, revenue of $7.35 billion is up $128 million, a 1.8% increase after strong growth in 2019 and moderate growth in 2020. Operating earnings for the year of $1.07 billion are up $26 million, a 2.5% increase. By the way, this performance is in line with the guidance we provided earlier in the year. As we look forward for the next few years, we believe that Combat volume will soften somewhat in the increasingly constrained budget environment faced by the U.S Army. While our platform programs remain critical to the Army War fight, we may see some contraction in part offset by international growth in Abrams, and real combat vehicles. We will continue to drive margins as we always have. Remember that Combat Systems has had very good margins and much more constrained revenue environments. In short, this group has had a positive revenue growth for several years now, continued its history of strong margin performance, has good order activity and has a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. Next, Marine Systems. The Marine Systems growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was up less than 1% over the year ago quarter. However, revenue is up 8.8% sequentially and 5.5% for the full year. Similarly, operating earnings are down somewhat in the quarter, but up sequentially and for the full year. Once again, this is the highest full year of revenue and earnings ever for the Marine group. In our initial guidance to you, we anticipated revenue of about $10.3 billion, operating margin of 8.3% and operating earnings of $855 million. We came in above that for both revenue and earnings and spot on the predicted operating margin. Our shipyards have continued to perform well overcoming most of the challenges that COVID lay in our path. First, continuing to operate without ceasing throughout COVID, and more recently managing labor shortages, part shortages, supply chain disruptions, and increasing commodity prices. Importantly, on the latter point, our long-term shipbuilding contracts provide protection from material escalation. I'm happy to report that we are working very well with the Bath unions and workforce and together we have worked put the past behind us and concentrate on improving schedule and performance. As a result, Bath has begun to see improvement on both scores. In response to significant increased demand from our needy customer that you'll see in these results, we continue to invest in each of our yards, particularly at EB to prepare for Virginia Block V, and the Columbia ballistic missile submarine. Suffice it to say that we are poised to support our Navy customer, as they increase the size of the fleet and deliver value to our shareholders as we work through this very large backlog. Finally, the Technologies group which consists of GDIT and Mission Systems. Just to remind you, this is the group in the defense segment that had have the most impact from COVID-19 with the most remote participation from employees and the most difficulty accessing customer locations whose employees also have been working remotely. It is also where we have the most impact from this short supply of chips and other key components that mission systems. With that said, let's turn to the results and commentary on the Group and the specific businesses. For the quarter, Technologies had revenue of $2.98 billion, up 7.9% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings, however, of $334 million are up only 5.1% on a 30 basis point improvement margin. The operating margin of 11.2% is the strongest since the formation of this group. Revenue for the full year of $12.46 billion is up 1.5%, but earnings are up $64 million, or 5.3% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin. All considered the group performance showed good strength and earnings are in line with guidance from us. Revenue came in at $543 million below our guidance driven by mission system challenges that we have discussed last quarter, offset in part by 2.2% growth the GDIT. Margins at both companies were very good enabling us to meet our earnings forecast. So very good operating leverage in a very challenging environment. The group enjoyed a nice order quarter with significant wins and a book-to-bill of 1 to 1, a little bit stronger GDIT and a little bit lower at Mission Systems. Mission Systems did a very good job overcoming many of their supply chain challenges, was working hard to satisfy the pent-up demand that was driven by a significant backup of work orders in some customers sites and by supply chain shortages. Turning to IT. Our Fed and Civilian division had a particularly strong year in '21 and help drive a 60 basis point improvement in margin over 2020. And as been the case since the acquisition, GDIT's cash performance was outstanding. Well in excess of 100% of their imputed net income GDIT's backlog at the end of 2021 was $8.7 billion, 4% higher than yearend '2020. Book-to-bill was 1.1 to 1 on sales growth at 2.2%. This is notable in light of the dollar value of GDIT wins and snared and protests that went from about $800 million at the end of 2020 to a whopping $6 billion at the end of '21. While we expect these protests will resolve in our favor, protest resolution timing is outside our control. As we look into '22, we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities to pursue as customers focus on digital modernization, and over $32 billion of bids, largely all new work awaiting customer decisions. So, all in all, we expect a good year for the business. Let me turn the call over now to Jason Aiken, our CFO, for additional commentary and then return with our guidance for next year. Jason?\nJason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is our cash performance for the quarter and the year. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter or 136% of net income with strong cash performance across all four segments. That resulted in free cash flow for the year of $3.4 billion, a cash conversion rate of 104%. That was nicely ahead of our anticipated 95% to 100% of net income, and again reflective of solid performance across the company, but in particular, the strong order activity at Gulfstream. That strong performance enabled us to continue our balanced and robust capital deployment activities. To that point, capital expenditures were $385 million in the quarter or 3.7% of sales. That's up more than 10% from the prior year, and brings us to $887 million for the full year. Of course, Marine Systems continues to drive the elevated CapEx with facilities investments in support of the unprecedented growth the Group is experiencing now and for the next decade plus. The full year total for capital investments at 2.3% of sales is slightly below our original expectation of 2.5%. That's due strictly to the timing of the phasing of those projects. While our investments to support the Navy's submarine programs have peaked, we expect capital expenditures to remain somewhat elevated at about 2.5% of sales in 2022, slightly higher than 2021, before returning as we forecast for some time to our more typical 2% range in 2023 and beyond. We also paid $332 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.3 billion, and we repurchased 1.8 million shares of stock in the quarter, bringing us to just over 10 million shares for the year for $1.8 billion at just under $179 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $135 million in 2021 and we expect that to decrease to approximately $40 million in 2022 as a result of the ARPA funding release. As we've discussed for some time, we expect to continue to generate cash in the 100% plus conversion range in 2022 and beyond. Our outlook assumes the unfavorable impact of the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenditures for tax purposes beginning in 2022, as called for under current law. There's proposed legislation to delay the effective date of this requirement, but we'll have to wait and see if it's approved by Congress and signed into law. Assuming there is a deferral of the R&D capitalization provision, we would expect our free cash flow to be in the 110% conversion range. We ended the year with a cash balance of $1.6 billion and no commercial paper outstanding, leaving us with a net debt position of $9.9 billion, down approximately $300 million from last year and the first time we've ended the year with net debt below $10 billion since 2018. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $93 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $424 million. That compares to $120 million and 477 million in the respective 2020 periods. The year-over-year reduction in interest expense is due to the retirement of $1.5 billion of long-term debt back in May. Our next scheduled debt maturity is a $1 billion in the fourth quarter of this year. And based on the declining net debt balance, we expect interest expense to drop to approximately $380 million in 2022. Turning to income taxes, we had a 15.9% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and for the full year consistent with our previous guidance. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect the full year effective tax rate to remain around 16%. The rate for 2022 is not impacted by the R&D matter I discussed earlier because that legislation impacts cash taxes, not the effective tax rate. The 2022 rate also assuming there's no other enacted legislation impacting corporate tax rates. From a quarterly phasing perspective, we expect the first quarter rate to be lower due to the timing of certain tax items, so the rate for the remainder of the year will naturally be higher given the full year forecast. Quarter activity and backlog were once again a strong story with a 1 to 1 ratio for the company in the fourth quarter and for the full year. As Phebe mentioned, order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.7x book-to-bill on the quarter and 1.6x for the full year. As a result, the Group's backlog was up 40% in the past year. Technologies recorded a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 and within that group GDIT was 1.1x. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.6 billion and total estimated contract value which includes options and IDIQ contracts of over $127 billion. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you guidance for 2022 and wrap up remarks.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. And with that, I will turn to your expectations for 2022. So let me provide our operating forecasts for '22 initially by business group and then a company-wide roll up. In Aerospace, we expect 2022 revenue to be around $8.4 billion, up around 4% over 2021 with about 123 deliveries, up from 119 last year. Operating margin will be around 4.8%. So, a little color here about what is driving this forecast. Well anticipated deliveries are up only 4 units from '21, production of completed aircraft is considerably more than in 2021. Last year, we produced fewer than 119 aircraft that were delivered. We delivered a number of test aircraft that were either produced and completed in prior periods as well as a few demonstrators all up about 11 aircraft. In 2022, production we are building some G700s and G800 test articles that will not deliver this year. Finally, our ability to ramp up further in '22 is limited by the wing supply issue I described earlier, which will be remedied for '23. This leads me to a quick look at '23 and '24. In 2023, we expect to deliver 148 airplanes, 25 more than in 2022 and have revenue of approximately $2 billion more than '22, with margin improvement around 200 basis points. In '24, we expect to deliver around 170 airplanes, up another 22 driving another $1.6 billion of revenue over '23 and another 100 basis points of margin growth. So, all up over that 2-year near-term timeframe, we expect to see $3.6 billion of revenue growth over '22 and 300 basis points of higher operating margins. Mind you, none of this is supported by heroic assumptions about continuing demand. We assume a book-to-bill of around 1 to 1 during the period, a notable reduction from this year's demand. If demand is greater, it will impact favorably '24 and '25. In short, we fully expect Aerospace to be a significant growth engine for both revenue and earnings in 2023 and 2024. In Combat Systems, we expect revenue in the range of $7.15 billion to $7.25 billion, a modest reduction against '21. We expect operating margin to be about the same at 14.5%. Growth should resume later in our planned period as developmental programs move into production and several anticipated international orders should be received. The Marine Group is expected to have revenue of approximately $10.8 billion, a $300 million increase over '21. Operating margin in '22 is anticipated to improve to around 8.6%. The long-term driver of growth here is submarine work, which will expand as the supply chain improves its efficiency and delivers modules to the Groton waterfront in a more timely fashion. Our biggest upside opportunity in this group is to increase margins in the period. We expect revenue in Technologies in the range of $12.8 billion to $13 billion. This is a growth of around 2.5% to 4.5%. We expect operating margins around 10%. So, for 2022, company-wide, we expect to see approximate $39.2 billion to $39.45 billion of revenue, and an operating margin of 10.8%. This all goes up to a forecast range of $12 to $12.15 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect EPS to play out much like it has in prior years, with Q1 about $2.45 and progressively stronger quarters thereafter. Let me emphasize that this forecast is purely from operations that assumes a 16% tax provision, and it seems we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with yearend figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital.\nHoward Rubel: Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.\nOperator:  We take our first question from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: Yes, good morning, Phebe and .\nPhebe Novakovic: Hi, Ron.\nRon Epstein: I know you're going to get bombarded with Gulfstream questions. So, I'm not going to go there. I'll let everybody else do that. I just wanted to jump in -- yes, how about that. Maybe on Land Systems at first, right. I mean, the Ukraine and everything going on with Russia has been in the headlines, what does that mean for your international Land Systems business, particularly in Eastern Europe?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, for some time now, the Eastern European demand for combat vehicles has been at elevated level. But I have to tell you that speculation about the considerable tension in Eastern Europe and any subsequent impact on budgets is just still advised given the high threat environment. So, we are hopeful for a peaceful resolution. But that is a national security issue for the U.S and its allies.\nRon Epstein: Got it. And then maybe my follow-on question, if I can. And I shift back a little bit towards Gulfstream.\nPhebe Novakovic: Sure.\nRon Epstein: You mentioned in your prepared remarks, you've got a little bit of a bottleneck in wing production. Have you thought about re-outsourcing wing? Or do you look at the wing as to something you guys want to keep? Because it's a key part of the plan.\nPhebe Novakovic: Outsourcing, you sort of add a question given the problems in the supply chain on wings, which then drove us to internally source. And frankly, our wing production efficiency is not equal by any. This is just simply a question of expanding a wing facility just to touch and we need another set of tools. But we are very good at wing production. So, I think that that's a capability set that reduces a lot of risk and frankly, provides opportunity for the program.\nOperator: The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much, and congratulations on the good results. So, Phebe \u2026\nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you, Cai von.\nCai von Rumohr: \u2026 net R&D was up $50 million in the fourth quarter. What do you expect it to be up going forward? And as I look out there, the 100 bps margin uptick I haven't calculated exactly looks like less than a 25% incremental margin. So how come it's not better as we get out to 2024?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well R&D, we expect to be about $100 million for next year, but let Jason give you a little bit of color.\nJason Aiken: Yes, so as Phebe said, roughly $100 million increase in the Gulfstream R&D for 2022 as we continue to progress, as you'd expect to the flight test program on the G700. If you normalize for that delta, margins for next year would be roughly 14% for the Aerospace group. So that really does kind of answer the question on incremental margins I think from our perspective. Otherwise, we do continue to see, as you'd expect, the incremental profit from in-production airplanes 500 and 600 in particular, continuing to be additive to the group's margin. So \u2026\nCai von Rumohr: Sure. And the last one \u2026\nPhebe Novakovic: It is a pretty good margin in the out years.\nCai von Rumohr: They are. R&D credit, how big are you assuming?\nJason Aiken: So, as I said, we're looking without the R&D credit deferral, meaning assuming existing law persists, we'll be in the call at 100% plus conversion range. If the R&D credit is deferred -- current law is deferred, we're talking more in the 110% range. So that kind of gives you a size on what we're expecting.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes. Phebe, the four higher deliveries in '22 that you spoke about, are they G700 or what's the status? Because I know, you thought that you deliver some G700s in the fourth quarter.\nPhebe Novakovic: What we said I think is that we expected the certification in the fourth quarter with -- but I think the way I have, as I noted in my remarks, we're going to have some prebuild, about the 700s and the 800s, which we'll deliver shortly thereafter, the 700s little shortly thereafter the certification.\nJason Aiken: And a little more color on that, George. I mean, just to think about it, obviously, we talked about, as Phebe said, fourth quarter certification and EIS of the 700. But there's also obviously with 2021, you have 500 -- excuse me, 550s that were delivered in the early part of the year that doesn't replicate. So, the incremental four is an offset of that decline as well as the test airplanes that Phebe mentioned that we delivered last year and some demonstrators, but otherwise steady increases in all of the in-production models, particularly 600 and 500. So, I think overall, if you look at in-production airplanes 650, 600 and 500, 280, we're looking at somewhere in the 15% year-over-year increase in production in those models. So that should give you some color on what's driving that increase.\nGeorge Shapiro: Okay. And then one follow-up. There's a $211 million difference between when you have this gross orders, and effectively just the net orders. Now were there any cancellations, there reflecting the fact that some customers are getting the planes later than they would like to get or \u2026?\nPhebe Novakovic: No, I don't think there was any particular driver. We have, I think three cancellations, but for no particular reason other than idiosyncratic customer issues.\nOperator: The next question comes from Myles Walton from UBS. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, could you comment on the \u2026\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning, Myles.\nMyles Walton: \u2026 price environment for building out the backlog and I imagine you're now coming pretty close to lists on all of your programs. And maybe give us an impression of the skyline or the lead time for the large cabin miles at this point? Thanks.\nPhebe Novakovic: So, we've enjoyed some pricing pressure or some pricing increases and that's all good and wholesome, and we are quite comfortable where prices are. And our lead times within all production aircraft are well within the 24 or 18 months -- more than 18 months to 24 in that range that we like to see.\nMyles Walton: Okay, great. And 500 versus 600, can you just give a color on the two differences in demand there. And one might be particularly accretive on the 600, given the assembly commonality with the platform.\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes, so just to give you a little bit of background there, the 600 were the parade in the fourth quarter, followed by the 650 and the 500. The 600 margins are obviously quite nice and 500 are improving. And of course, 600, we've always enjoyed good or 650, we've always enjoyed good margins. So, we're seeing some very nice operating margins at the gross margins at the airplane level.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks very much. Phebe, maybe you can touch on some other issues. I just wonder if you can maybe give us some more clarity on the supply chain at this point and some of the obstacles you've been facing across the company whether they're getting any better.\nPhebe Novakovic: So, let me go group by group. In Combat, we haven't had seen any particular supply chain issues. At Gulfstream, we've managed the supply chain, and I think they were benefited by our reduction in production last year. So, we're quite comfortable with where they are. We reported pretty fulsomely on the Mission Systems challenges that they had with chip shortages and other key product material. And Electric Boat, in particular, we've seen some challenges in the submarine supply chain, largely manifests in Virginia scheduled variants. So, we\u2019ve pretty widely reported that, but we're continuing to work with the Navy and to kind of shore up that supply chain, so we can get normalized Virginia schedules.\nRobert Stallard: Okay. And then maybe a follow-up to Myles's question on the Aerospace lead times. I think you just said 24 months is what you're seeing, in some case. That sounds a bit longer than what we've maybe heard in recent years. Are you seeing any customers, essentially saying that's too long, and maybe going somewhere else to get their jets?\nPhebe Novakovic: No, we haven't. And as I said, 18 to 24, but 24 is only a handful of cases. But we haven't had any customers say well, I'll go elsewhere, because we're in the backlog, I'm going to go elsewhere cancel my order because I want my airplane faster. And frankly, we're ramping up production to accommodate that demand, that backlog and what we see is a nice solid demand going forward. So, we're quite comfortable where we are in our lead times.\nOperator: The next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi, good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nRobert Spingarn: Just sticky -- Phebe, sticking with supply chain and labor, can you frame the risk to entry into service for the three new aircraft programs, the 700, 800 and the 400? And how we should think about potential slippage or whether you've got that covered at this point?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well with respect to labor, we've seen some wage increases in engineering forced at Gulfstream, but we have covered those with some increasing prices to offset that. But we don't see any labor issues with respect to the delivery of these airplanes. And as I say the supply chain has been pretty stable here .\nRobert Spingarn: On labor affecting or clearances affecting technologies at all, is it limiting growth?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, GDIT, particularly in the tech industry, any company that got large exposure to tech here, experts has certainly have their challenges and mobility, but I will say GDIT is holding up very nicely, attrition is at pre-pandemic levels. So, we're holding our own, but very mindful, this is a valuable workforce and coveted by many.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDouglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you. At the Gulfstream, when you described a pretty high-class problem here in terms of demand. And when you get out to 2023 and 2024, though, you have a pretty diverse set of programs at that point. How do you look at this in terms of both your operations and the supply chain, just to manage that complexity?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, one thing that Gulfstream -- one of the many things that Gulfstream has been quite good at is managing its operations and having very strong operating leverage. And we have brought the supply chain along with us. So, all of our estimates that we're giving you fully accounting for what we expect the supply chain to be able to manage as well as our own operations. So, we're quite comfortable that we do not have an operating challenge.\nDouglas Harned: So, no, you're not really seeing any additional issues with this mix when you get out in that timeframe.\nPhebe Novakovic: No?\nOperator: The next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Phebe, I'll take a question \u2026\nPhebe Novakovic: Hi, Sheila.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: \u2026 in 24 months. I'll wait for it. Hi. So, I'm going to ask about Aero because it is a lot of the EPS expansion we have between '21 and '24. So, you've been so generous with your comments, but I can't quite square away Aerospace margins for 2022. And I was wondering if you could help a little bit with that just given pricing should be a tailwind. And I think mix improved from '21. You have a 500, 600 going up the curve. And I think you previously talked about the G700 being accretive to margins right away. So maybe, can you talk about what's changed? And how do we think about that improvement into '23 and '24? And I know you already guided, but if you could square it away a little bit more?\nJason Aiken: Yes, I mean, I think you've got a lot of the basic building blocks, we probably have to compare spreadsheets to see what's driving the ultimate outcome. I think the single biggest issue is probably the period-to-period fluctuation in our net R&D expenditures, right, between supporting the development programs and the net offsets that we get from time-to-time from suppliers. As I mentioned before, we've got about $100 million increase in R&D from -- in '22, relative to '21. So that if you normalize for that you're up from 12 -- 12.7 in 2021 to 14% plus in 2022. There's other puts and takes within that, as you know, pricing is a little better, the improvements along the manufacturing lines for 500 and 600 continue to get better growth in service business, obviously, which continues a pace year-over-year, while at good margins does come at margins that are in an aggregate dilutive to the overall group margin and certainly to new aircraft production margins. And so that's really the story I think, in terms of the puts and takes going into 2022. I think we can get into your details or your question maybe after the fact on '23 and '24. But I think 200 basis points improvement in '23 and another 100 basis point in '24. That kind of gives you that trajectory that we've talked about for some time about returning to the mid to high teens margins for the group. When you combine that with pretty significant top line growth that Phebe described, I think it's a pretty -- I think it's a pretty compelling story.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Can I just ask the follow-up on the R&D? Obviously, it peaks for G700 this year. When do we see that for the 400 and the 800? So, obviously, the 800 comes in -- into play shortly after the 700. So, you should kind of expect to see that following a similar pattern. I think we said the 400 enters service in 2025. So, keep in mind the 400 is an airplane that benefited significantly from commonality with the 500 and 600 in the way those airplanes were designed and engineered. So, we won't necessarily see as much of a blip associated with that, but all of this fits over time within the profile of our ongoing commitment to R&D and roughly 2% of sales for R&D. Again, it can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, but that's how you ought to see it play out.\nOperator: The next question is from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Yes. Good morning, Phebe, Jason. Nice results. Phebe, I wanted to ask you a question about Marine. How are they doing in terms of battling kind of the labor shortages out there. I know Pratt yesterday talked about having a shortage of welders, maybe what you could give some commentary how you're seeing that?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, we have worked for many years with our state and local governments to provide them pretty robust training programs that are still up and running. We are hiring this year at an accelerated rate over what we had anticipated, largely because of the backlog. In terms of hiring in COVID, obviously constrained. These are hiring levels for '22 at levels we have seen before and executed before. So, the question is all about the efficiency of your training programs. And we're pretty comfortable that once we get these people in the door, we can get them trained and have them go as new shipbuilders. They've got learning curves, obviously, as they get more proficient and become veterans, but we factored all of that in our thinking.\nPeter Arment: Appreciate that. And just as a follow-up to some -- just on Aerospace. It sounds like the customer base continues to expand, how would you kind of characterize it? Is it a lot of the corporates that are renewing? Are you seeing just a complete expansion during this kind of COVID -- post-COVID period?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, to give you a little bit of additional color on that, demand was quite good in the United States and also increased throughout the rest of the world we saw as we had begun to see earlier, a return to the Fortune 500 as well as private companies as well as smaller companies. So, it's pretty robust across the portfolio and the kinds of both individuals that we see, but also companies that we see. But I don't see any structural change here, if that's kind of what you're poking at in terms of .\nOperator: The next question \u2026\nPhebe Novakovic: Go ahead, I\u2019m sorry.\nOperator: The next -- apologies, the next question comes from Seth Seifman from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much \u2026\nPhebe Novakovic: Hi, Seth.\nSeth Seifman: \u2026 and good morning. Maybe if I could dig in for a couple of more Aerospace details. There any comments you could give about the services assumptions underlying the guidance, and also the CapEx impact and timing of completion of the additional wing capacity?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, I'll answer those in the inverse order, almost negligible CapEx. So, this is just simply a timing of -- timing issue of expanding an existing building somewhat and getting in place the tools and fixtures to effectuate the increased production. On the service side, we expect '22 to see some nice service growth at Gulfstream as well as Jet Aviation which have a nice year as well. And we expect service volume quite naturally to grow with the expanding fleet. And we have included those assumptions on a going forward basis.\nSeth Seifman: Great, thanks. And just as a follow-up, definitely heard earlier and appreciate the commentary about the multiyear outlook being conservative. I guess any other sort of support you can give to that characterization would be great. If we look at, I guess, if the backlog remains stable at about $16 billion, looking at like 1.3x coverage out in 2024. And if that's kind of what you're aiming for, and any other color that kind of gives you confidence in the conservatism of the outlook?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes, so think about it this way. What I wanted to explain is that the guidance that we are giving you for '23 and '24, was based on a 1 to 1 book-to-bill. Clearly, if it's better than that, we'll increase production accordingly. But for planning purposes, that's what we have assumed and I think that's prudent planning.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Strauss \u2026\nSeth Seifman: So maybe just -- go ahead.\nPhebe Novakovic: David?\nOperator: The next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. Phebe, can you hear me?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. Loud and clear.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. So, you give us a little bit of a longer-term outlook for Gulfstream. I want to ask about Marine and Combat. I think, Marine, you'd previously said expect kind of $400 million to $500 million in incremental revenue a year. Last year, you were at the high end of that, this year you're forecasting a little bit below that. So maybe if you could update us there on kind of the longer-term thinking. And then on Combat, I think you had said kind of low growth over the next couple of years. Now you're talking about a decline. So, what's the longer-term view, I guess, on Combat? And how much could the fiscal '22 budget that still yet to be decided, but it looks pretty good for you guys how that might influence things?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, let's talk about Marine. We have for some time said that we expected revenue growth in the $400 million to $500 million range. We still expect that. Next year is a little bit later, a $300 million increase and that's largely just workload timing. When I go to Combat -- so I think what we are anticipating is some decrease in pressure on the army budget. Look, we're  in '23, in particular, so we're pretty early on in the budget for that fiscal year. We don't have full OMB or tax back. But I think that the pressures on the army budget have been very well articulated. And while we expect that ultimately the funding levels for our platform programs will be sufficient and relatively stable, we will see some rather dramatic drop offs in O&M funded accounts, like maintenance, for example. So, we are factoring all of that into what I see is that increased army pressure. We're factoring all of that into our estimate for between 1% and 3% lower growth this year, but we anticipate growth returning as a number of these international orders come in a couple of years as well as new army start. So, I think we have given you a balanced and realistic view of combat.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. A quick follow-up, what are you assuming for CR this year in terms of what's -- what you're baked into your defense guidance?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, for this particular CR, given our portfolio and the prior year funding levels, we don't see a material impact of all, almost nothing.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: You already got me. Thank you.\nPhebe Novakovic: You\u2019ve already got David. I need to get .\nOperator: My apologies. We have Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMatt Akers: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. There was some commentary around the budget discussions about potentially going to the three a year on Virginia class. Could you comment on how feasible that is and sort of what further investments required? What kind of time frame that might be possible?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, we've been talking to our navy customer and clearly, some investments would be required. But I think, too, at the moment, we need to get the supply chain stabilized on the two-a-year cadence before we actually think about really ramping up to three. It is doable. We just need some time for that supply chain to adjust from the ravages of COVID.\nMatt Akers: Great, thanks. And I guess a couple of details within the cash flow outlook for '22. Can you say how big the impact of that prebuild is that you discussed at Gulfstream and then also can you just update what's the latest on the large international receivable? And is that meaningful as an impact for 2022?\nJason Aiken: Yes. I think on the Gulfstream side, while we are having, as Phebe mentioned, the ramp-up on the 700 and the prebuild on the 800, that's not a material impact that we see in terms of the headwind. Gulfstream wants to be a nice producer of cash again this year. Obviously, not quite to the extent that last year, we -- as we mentioned, we sold off the inventory, in particular, in the test airplanes. So, it won't have quite the trajectory it did last year, but it will still be a nice contributor on cash. So, don't see that as a headwind. On the international side, the international Canadian vehicle program we've talked about for some time remains on track. That program is in a great position, both in terms of the vehicle and the performance of the production line, and we continue to receive payments as scheduled for the renegotiated extension of that contract that occurred back in 2020. So, all in a good place in that regard.\nHoward Rubel: Operator, we will take one last question. Please go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. So, our final question then comes from Richard Safran from Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nRichard Safran: Hi. Good morning, Phebe, Jason and Howard. How are you?\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nRichard Safran: So, on Technologies, I was impressed by that $32 billion comment that you made. What percent of that is adjudicated in '22? Is it all of it? And would you be able to tell me how much of that is recompetes? And I asked because I'm assuming that recompetes come with a bit of a higher win probability.\nPhebe Novakovic: Those are largely new work in the $32 billion and the customer adjudicates that as they get to it. But I think we've recognized as well that not only is the customer decision cycle, but it's also their protests that affect the timing of any of these wins, and they're significant.\nRichard Safran: Yes. And just as a very quick follow-up here. Jason, I heard your opening comments about what you were going to do with debt. And I wanted to know, just to be clear, your fourth quarter maturities, is that the extent of debt reduction this year? And if you would, longer term, could you just tell me what your overall debt reduction target is? And when do you think you might be able to get there?\nJason Aiken: Yes. The $1 billion that matures in November of this year is the only maturity this year. So, you've got that right. In terms of the longer term, we will obviously play that out as it goes. We've indicated that we have a reasonable debt laddered out over the next several years that offers us the opportunity to continue to step down the debt in, call it, $1 billion to $1.5 billion increments over time. That said, we've never indicated we were going to go back to the essentially zero net debt that we had before the CSRA acquisition. So somewhere in that period with flexibility remaining open, we will decide where the right point is to settle out on that. And frankly, if there's an overarching sort of guiding light that we have around that, it's continuing to target and try to sustain a mid-A credit rating. And obviously, there's a lot of factors that go into that, but that's really sort of the compass that we have around the debt trajectory.\nHoward Rubel: Well, thank you all for joining our call today. And as a reminder, please refer to our website for the fourth quarter earnings release and our highlights presentation, which will now include our outlook. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you. Katie?\nOperator: Thank you all for joining. This now concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is our cash performance for the quarter and the year. As you can see from our press release exhibits, we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the fourth quarter or 136% of net income with strong cash performance across all four segments. That resulted in free cash flow for the year of $3.4 billion, a cash conversion rate of 104%. That was nicely ahead of our anticipated 95% to 100% of net income, and again reflective of solid performance across the company, but in particular, the strong order activity at Gulfstream. That strong performance enabled us to continue our balanced and robust capital deployment activities. To that point, capital expenditures were $385 million in the quarter or 3.7% of sales. That's up more than 10% from the prior year, and brings us to $887 million for the full year. Of course, Marine Systems continues to drive the elevated CapEx with facilities investments in support of the unprecedented growth the Group is experiencing now and for the next decade plus. The full year total for capital investments at 2.3% of sales is slightly below our original expectation of 2.5%. That's due strictly to the timing of the phasing of those projects. While our investments to support the Navy's submarine programs have peaked, we expect capital expenditures to remain somewhat elevated at about 2.5% of sales in 2022, slightly higher than 2021, before returning as we forecast for some time to our more typical 2% range in 2023 and beyond. We also paid $332 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.3 billion, and we repurchased 1.8 million shares of stock in the quarter, bringing us to just over 10 million shares for the year for $1.8 billion at just under $179 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $135 million in 2021 and we expect that to decrease to approximately $40 million in 2022 as a result of the ARPA funding release. As we've discussed for some time, we expect to continue to generate cash in the 100% plus conversion range in 2022 and beyond. Our outlook assumes the unfavorable impact of the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenditures for tax purposes beginning in 2022, as called for under current law. There's proposed legislation to delay the effective date of this requirement, but we'll have to wait and see if it's approved by Congress and signed into law. Assuming there is a deferral of the R&D capitalization provision, we would expect our free cash flow to be in the 110% conversion range. We ended the year with a cash balance of $1.6 billion and no commercial paper outstanding, leaving us with a net debt position of $9.9 billion, down approximately $300 million from last year and the first time we've ended the year with net debt below $10 billion since 2018. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $93 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $424 million. That compares to $120 million and 477 million in the respective 2020 periods. The year-over-year reduction in interest expense is due to the retirement of $1.5 billion of long-term debt back in May. Our next scheduled debt maturity is a $1 billion in the fourth quarter of this year. And based on the declining net debt balance, we expect interest expense to drop to approximately $380 million in 2022. Turning to income taxes, we had a 15.9% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and for the full year consistent with our previous guidance. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect the full year effective tax rate to remain around 16%. The rate for 2022 is not impacted by the R&D matter I discussed earlier because that legislation impacts cash taxes, not the effective tax rate. The 2022 rate also assuming there's no other enacted legislation impacting corporate tax rates. From a quarterly phasing perspective, we expect the first quarter rate to be lower due to the timing of certain tax items, so the rate for the remainder of the year will naturally be higher given the full year forecast. Quarter activity and backlog were once again a strong story with a 1 to 1 ratio for the company in the fourth quarter and for the full year. As Phebe mentioned, order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.7x book-to-bill on the quarter and 1.6x for the full year. As a result, the Group's backlog was up 40% in the past year. Technologies recorded a book-to-bill of 1 to 1 and within that group GDIT was 1.1x. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.6 billion and total estimated contract value which includes options and IDIQ contracts of over $127 billion. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Phebe to give you guidance for 2022 and wrap up remarks. Yes, so as Phebe said, roughly $100 million increase in the Gulfstream R&D for 2022 as we continue to progress, as you'd expect to the flight test program on the G700. If you normalize for that delta, margins for next year would be roughly 14% for the Aerospace group. So that really does kind of answer the question on incremental margins I think from our perspective. Otherwise, we do continue to see, as you'd expect, the incremental profit from in-production airplanes 500 and 600 in particular, continuing to be additive to the group's margin. So ... So, as I said, we're looking without the R&D credit deferral, meaning assuming existing law persists, we'll be in the call at 100% plus conversion range. If the R&D credit is deferred -- current law is deferred, we're talking more in the 110% range. So that kind of gives you a size on what we're expecting. And a little more color on that, George. I mean, just to think about it, obviously, we talked about, as Phebe said, fourth quarter certification and EIS of the 700. But there's also obviously with 2021, you have 500 -- excuse me, 550s that were delivered in the early part of the year that doesn't replicate. So, the incremental four is an offset of that decline as well as the test airplanes that Phebe mentioned that we delivered last year and some demonstrators, but otherwise steady increases in all of the in-production models, particularly 600 and 500. So, I think overall, if you look at in-production airplanes 650, 600 and 500, 280, we're looking at somewhere in the 15% year-over-year increase in production in those models. So that should give you some color on what's driving that increase. Yes, I mean, I think you've got a lot of the basic building blocks, we probably have to compare spreadsheets to see what's driving the ultimate outcome. I think the single biggest issue is probably the period-to-period fluctuation in our net R&D expenditures, right, between supporting the development programs and the net offsets that we get from time-to-time from suppliers. As I mentioned before, we've got about $100 million increase in R&D from -- in '22, relative to '21. So that if you normalize for that you're up from 12 -- 12.7 in 2021 to 14% plus in 2022. There's other puts and takes within that, as you know, pricing is a little better, the improvements along the manufacturing lines for 500 and 600 continue to get better growth in service business, obviously, which continues a pace year-over-year, while at good margins does come at margins that are in an aggregate dilutive to the overall group margin and certainly to new aircraft production margins. And so that's really the story I think, in terms of the puts and takes going into 2022. I think we can get into your details or your question maybe after the fact on '23 and '24. But I think 200 basis points improvement in '23 and another 100 basis point in '24. That kind of gives you that trajectory that we've talked about for some time about returning to the mid to high teens margins for the group. When you combine that with pretty significant top line growth that Phebe described, I think it's a pretty -- I think it's a pretty compelling story. Yes. I think on the Gulfstream side, while we are having, as Phebe mentioned, the ramp-up on the 700 and the prebuild on the 800, that's not a material impact that we see in terms of the headwind. Gulfstream wants to be a nice producer of cash again this year. Obviously, not quite to the extent that last year, we -- as we mentioned, we sold off the inventory, in particular, in the test airplanes. So, it won't have quite the trajectory it did last year, but it will still be a nice contributor on cash. So, don't see that as a headwind. On the international side, the international Canadian vehicle program we've talked about for some time remains on track. That program is in a great position, both in terms of the vehicle and the performance of the production line, and we continue to receive payments as scheduled for the renegotiated extension of that contract that occurred back in 2020. So, all in a good place in that regard. Yes. The $1 billion that matures in November of this year is the only maturity this year. So, you've got that right. In terms of the longer term, we will obviously play that out as it goes. We've indicated that we have a reasonable debt laddered out over the next several years that offers us the opportunity to continue to step down the debt in, call it, $1 billion to $1.5 billion increments over time. That said, we've never indicated we were going to go back to the essentially zero net debt that we had before the CSRA acquisition. So somewhere in that period with flexibility remaining open, we will decide where the right point is to settle out on that. And frankly, if there's an overarching sort of guiding light that we have around that, it's continuing to target and try to sustain a mid-A credit rating. And obviously, there's a lot of factors that go into that, but that's really sort of the compass that we have around the debt trajectory."

            "name": "Phebe Novakovic",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you, Howard. Earlier today we reported fourth quarter revenue of $10.3 billion, net earnings of $952 million and earnings per diluted share of $3.39. The sales in most respect consistent with our previous guidance sell-side consensus. The results in comparison with prior periods are rather straightforward and set out in our press release. I'll go through some of that detail quite briefly, as I give you my thoughts on the business segments. As we indicated, it would be, the final quarter is our strongest quarter of the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, earnings, operating margin, net earnings and return on sales improved quarter over the prior quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvements. On a sequential basis, suffice it to say that revenue was up $724 million, operating earnings were up $106 million, and earnings per share up $0.32. So, all in all, a solid quarter with good operating performance. For the full year, we had revenue of $38.5 billion, up 1.4% from 2020; net earnings of $3.26 billion, up 2.8% and earnings per fully diluted share of $11.55, modestly better than consensus and up $0.55 over 2020. We ended the year with a total backlog of $87.6 billion and total estimated contract value of $127.5 billion. Our business was strengthened by significant growth in aerospace backlog to $16.3 billion. I'll have more to say about that when we get to the business segment comments. The total company book-to-bill is one-to-one for the quarter and the year, led by the powerful order performance of Gulfstream. Our cash performance for the quarter and the year is very strong. The conversion rates of the quarter is 136% of net income and 104% for the year. Jason will have more fulsome comments on this subject and backlog in his remarks. Now let me turn to reviewing the quarter and paying some attention to quarter-over-quarter and sequential comparisons as well as full year in the context of each group and provide colors appropriately. So, first Aerospace. Aerospace revenue of $2.6 billion is up 5.1% over the year ago quarter on the delivery of 39 aircraft, 35 of which were large cabin. While this was the strongest delivery quarter of the year, it fell short of our expectation by one aircraft, which has flipped  into 2022. For the full year revenue of $8.1 4 billion is up modestly from the prior year even though we delivered 119 aircraft, 8 fewer aircraft than we did in 2020. The increase was driven by higher service revenue at Gulfstream and a nice increase in revenue at Jet Aviation. Fourth quarter Aerospace earnings of $354 million are down $47 million from year ago quarter, even though revenue was $125 million higher, resulting in a 270 basis point reduction in operating margin. The major source of the variance is a $50 million increase in net R&D costs driven by the certification on the G700 and G800 and accelerated work on the G400. The year ago quarter was also helped by a significant launch assistant payment that was an offset to gross R&D. Nevertheless, Aerospace operating earnings and margins are better-than-anticipated by consensus. The same can be said for the full year results. I should also point out that Aerospace margins improved throughout the year and that was true with respect to both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. At midyear last year, we told you we expect revenue of about $8.2 billion; operating margin around 12.4% with earnings of $1.01 billion. We finished the year with revenue of $8.14 billion; operating earnings of $1.03 billion and a 12.7% operating margin. In sum, we were slightly better on earnings and margin, but very close to our forecast on revenue.  the most important story in the quarter for Aerospace and frankly for the company was the extraordinary order activity of Gulfstream. Last quarter, I told you that orders in the third quarter boarded on the spectacular. This quarter, they were significantly better. Order activity in the quarter was beyond anything we had seen since 2008 with the introduction of the G650. Demand that turned very good in mid-February and continued through the second and third quarters was red hot in fourth quarter. Let me give you the particulars. The Aerospace group in dollar denominated orders had a book-to-bill of 1.7 to 1. Gulfstream alone was 1.8 to 1 and in unit terms, it was over 2x. Remember that these multiples are off of an increased denominator with 39 deliveries. This translates into a very significant backlog growth. Aerospace added $1.6 billion to backlog in the quarter and $4.7 billion for the year. As we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains robust and sales activity is brisk. The buildup in backlog and the pace of current demand leaves us with a rich problem, but a problem nonetheless. How do we satisfy the demand manifest in our current backlog supplemented by continuing brisk activity having previously turned down production? Can the supply chain support us? Are we ready? Well, the answer is we will increase production in 2022, but not to where it needs to be. Remember also that some of our increased production in '22 will be in building G700s, and G800s that will not deliver in '22, a prebuild, if you will. As it turns out, the long pull in the 10 is manufacturing wings, which we do ourselves. You may recall that we previously vertically integrated wing supply because of  in the supply chain. So, what do we need to do? We need to expand our new modern wing facility and acquire another set of tools and fixtures. All of this is underway and will be in place to satisfy our needs for '23 and beyond. This leads to the question of what are the implications of this for 2022 guidance. I'll address '22 guidance a little later. Further, given the robust and enduring backlog of Gulfstream, we also feel comfortable with giving you a look at what is anticipated for '23 and '24 as well. Finally, on the new product development front, all 5 G700 flight test aircraft are flying and have over 2,200 flight test hours. We have completed over 65% of all required testing. Next Combat Systems. Revenue in the quarter of $1.89 billion is up 3.7% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $281 million are off $28 million on a 90 basis point decrease in operating margin. Let me point out, however, that a 14.9% margin in the quarter is highly respectable. For the full year, revenue of $7.35 billion is up $128 million, a 1.8% increase after strong growth in 2019 and moderate growth in 2020. Operating earnings for the year of $1.07 billion are up $26 million, a 2.5% increase. By the way, this performance is in line with the guidance we provided earlier in the year. As we look forward for the next few years, we believe that Combat volume will soften somewhat in the increasingly constrained budget environment faced by the U.S Army. While our platform programs remain critical to the Army War fight, we may see some contraction in part offset by international growth in Abrams, and real combat vehicles. We will continue to drive margins as we always have. Remember that Combat Systems has had very good margins and much more constrained revenue environments. In short, this group has had a positive revenue growth for several years now, continued its history of strong margin performance, has good order activity and has a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. Next, Marine Systems. The Marine Systems growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was up less than 1% over the year ago quarter. However, revenue is up 8.8% sequentially and 5.5% for the full year. Similarly, operating earnings are down somewhat in the quarter, but up sequentially and for the full year. Once again, this is the highest full year of revenue and earnings ever for the Marine group. In our initial guidance to you, we anticipated revenue of about $10.3 billion, operating margin of 8.3% and operating earnings of $855 million. We came in above that for both revenue and earnings and spot on the predicted operating margin. Our shipyards have continued to perform well overcoming most of the challenges that COVID lay in our path. First, continuing to operate without ceasing throughout COVID, and more recently managing labor shortages, part shortages, supply chain disruptions, and increasing commodity prices. Importantly, on the latter point, our long-term shipbuilding contracts provide protection from material escalation. I'm happy to report that we are working very well with the Bath unions and workforce and together we have worked put the past behind us and concentrate on improving schedule and performance. As a result, Bath has begun to see improvement on both scores. In response to significant increased demand from our needy customer that you'll see in these results, we continue to invest in each of our yards, particularly at EB to prepare for Virginia Block V, and the Columbia ballistic missile submarine. Suffice it to say that we are poised to support our Navy customer, as they increase the size of the fleet and deliver value to our shareholders as we work through this very large backlog. Finally, the Technologies group which consists of GDIT and Mission Systems. Just to remind you, this is the group in the defense segment that had have the most impact from COVID-19 with the most remote participation from employees and the most difficulty accessing customer locations whose employees also have been working remotely. It is also where we have the most impact from this short supply of chips and other key components that mission systems. With that said, let's turn to the results and commentary on the Group and the specific businesses. For the quarter, Technologies had revenue of $2.98 billion, up 7.9% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings, however, of $334 million are up only 5.1% on a 30 basis point improvement margin. The operating margin of 11.2% is the strongest since the formation of this group. Revenue for the full year of $12.46 billion is up 1.5%, but earnings are up $64 million, or 5.3% on a 60 basis point improvement in operating margin. All considered the group performance showed good strength and earnings are in line with guidance from us. Revenue came in at $543 million below our guidance driven by mission system challenges that we have discussed last quarter, offset in part by 2.2% growth the GDIT. Margins at both companies were very good enabling us to meet our earnings forecast. So very good operating leverage in a very challenging environment. The group enjoyed a nice order quarter with significant wins and a book-to-bill of 1 to 1, a little bit stronger GDIT and a little bit lower at Mission Systems. Mission Systems did a very good job overcoming many of their supply chain challenges, was working hard to satisfy the pent-up demand that was driven by a significant backup of work orders in some customers sites and by supply chain shortages. Turning to IT. Our Fed and Civilian division had a particularly strong year in '21 and help drive a 60 basis point improvement in margin over 2020. And as been the case since the acquisition, GDIT's cash performance was outstanding. Well in excess of 100% of their imputed net income GDIT's backlog at the end of 2021 was $8.7 billion, 4% higher than yearend '2020. Book-to-bill was 1.1 to 1 on sales growth at 2.2%. This is notable in light of the dollar value of GDIT wins and snared and protests that went from about $800 million at the end of 2020 to a whopping $6 billion at the end of '21. While we expect these protests will resolve in our favor, protest resolution timing is outside our control. As we look into '22, we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities to pursue as customers focus on digital modernization, and over $32 billion of bids, largely all new work awaiting customer decisions. So, all in all, we expect a good year for the business. Let me turn the call over now to Jason Aiken, our CFO, for additional commentary and then return with our guidance for next year. Jason? Thanks, Jason. And with that, I will turn to your expectations for 2022. So let me provide our operating forecasts for '22 initially by business group and then a company-wide roll up. In Aerospace, we expect 2022 revenue to be around $8.4 billion, up around 4% over 2021 with about 123 deliveries, up from 119 last year. Operating margin will be around 4.8%. So, a little color here about what is driving this forecast. Well anticipated deliveries are up only 4 units from '21, production of completed aircraft is considerably more than in 2021. Last year, we produced fewer than 119 aircraft that were delivered. We delivered a number of test aircraft that were either produced and completed in prior periods as well as a few demonstrators all up about 11 aircraft. In 2022, production we are building some G700s and G800 test articles that will not deliver this year. Finally, our ability to ramp up further in '22 is limited by the wing supply issue I described earlier, which will be remedied for '23. This leads me to a quick look at '23 and '24. In 2023, we expect to deliver 148 airplanes, 25 more than in 2022 and have revenue of approximately $2 billion more than '22, with margin improvement around 200 basis points. In '24, we expect to deliver around 170 airplanes, up another 22 driving another $1.6 billion of revenue over '23 and another 100 basis points of margin growth. So, all up over that 2-year near-term timeframe, we expect to see $3.6 billion of revenue growth over '22 and 300 basis points of higher operating margins. Mind you, none of this is supported by heroic assumptions about continuing demand. We assume a book-to-bill of around 1 to 1 during the period, a notable reduction from this year's demand. If demand is greater, it will impact favorably '24 and '25. In short, we fully expect Aerospace to be a significant growth engine for both revenue and earnings in 2023 and 2024. In Combat Systems, we expect revenue in the range of $7.15 billion to $7.25 billion, a modest reduction against '21. We expect operating margin to be about the same at 14.5%. Growth should resume later in our planned period as developmental programs move into production and several anticipated international orders should be received. The Marine Group is expected to have revenue of approximately $10.8 billion, a $300 million increase over '21. Operating margin in '22 is anticipated to improve to around 8.6%. The long-term driver of growth here is submarine work, which will expand as the supply chain improves its efficiency and delivers modules to the Groton waterfront in a more timely fashion. Our biggest upside opportunity in this group is to increase margins in the period. We expect revenue in Technologies in the range of $12.8 billion to $13 billion. This is a growth of around 2.5% to 4.5%. We expect operating margins around 10%. So, for 2022, company-wide, we expect to see approximate $39.2 billion to $39.45 billion of revenue, and an operating margin of 10.8%. This all goes up to a forecast range of $12 to $12.15 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect EPS to play out much like it has in prior years, with Q1 about $2.45 and progressively stronger quarters thereafter. Let me emphasize that this forecast is purely from operations that assumes a 16% tax provision, and it seems we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady with yearend figures so as to avoid dilution from option exercises. So much like last year, beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan, achieving a lower effective tax rate and the effective deployment of capital. Hi, Ron. Well, for some time now, the Eastern European demand for combat vehicles has been at elevated level. But I have to tell you that speculation about the considerable tension in Eastern Europe and any subsequent impact on budgets is just still advised given the high threat environment. So, we are hopeful for a peaceful resolution. But that is a national security issue for the U.S and its allies. Sure. Outsourcing, you sort of add a question given the problems in the supply chain on wings, which then drove us to internally source. And frankly, our wing production efficiency is not equal by any. This is just simply a question of expanding a wing facility just to touch and we need another set of tools. But we are very good at wing production. So, I think that that's a capability set that reduces a lot of risk and frankly, provides opportunity for the program. Thank you, Cai von. Well R&D, we expect to be about $100 million for next year, but let Jason give you a little bit of color. It is a pretty good margin in the out years. What we said I think is that we expected the certification in the fourth quarter with -- but I think the way I have, as I noted in my remarks, we're going to have some prebuild, about the 700s and the 800s, which we'll deliver shortly thereafter, the 700s little shortly thereafter the certification. No, I don't think there was any particular driver. We have, I think three cancellations, but for no particular reason other than idiosyncratic customer issues. Good morning, Myles. So, we've enjoyed some pricing pressure or some pricing increases and that's all good and wholesome, and we are quite comfortable where prices are. And our lead times within all production aircraft are well within the 24 or 18 months -- more than 18 months to 24 in that range that we like to see. Yes, so just to give you a little bit of background there, the 600 were the parade in the fourth quarter, followed by the 650 and the 500. The 600 margins are obviously quite nice and 500 are improving. And of course, 600, we've always enjoyed good or 650, we've always enjoyed good margins. So, we're seeing some very nice operating margins at the gross margins at the airplane level. So, let me go group by group. In Combat, we haven't had seen any particular supply chain issues. At Gulfstream, we've managed the supply chain, and I think they were benefited by our reduction in production last year. So, we're quite comfortable with where they are. We reported pretty fulsomely on the Mission Systems challenges that they had with chip shortages and other key product material. And Electric Boat, in particular, we've seen some challenges in the submarine supply chain, largely manifests in Virginia scheduled variants. So, we've pretty widely reported that, but we're continuing to work with the Navy and to kind of shore up that supply chain, so we can get normalized Virginia schedules. No, we haven't. And as I said, 18 to 24, but 24 is only a handful of cases. But we haven't had any customers say well, I'll go elsewhere, because we're in the backlog, I'm going to go elsewhere cancel my order because I want my airplane faster. And frankly, we're ramping up production to accommodate that demand, that backlog and what we see is a nice solid demand going forward. So, we're quite comfortable where we are in our lead times. Good morning. Well with respect to labor, we've seen some wage increases in engineering forced at Gulfstream, but we have covered those with some increasing prices to offset that. But we don't see any labor issues with respect to the delivery of these airplanes. And as I say the supply chain has been pretty stable here . So, GDIT, particularly in the tech industry, any company that got large exposure to tech here, experts has certainly have their challenges and mobility, but I will say GDIT is holding up very nicely, attrition is at pre-pandemic levels. So, we're holding our own, but very mindful, this is a valuable workforce and coveted by many. So, one thing that Gulfstream -- one of the many things that Gulfstream has been quite good at is managing its operations and having very strong operating leverage. And we have brought the supply chain along with us. So, all of our estimates that we're giving you fully accounting for what we expect the supply chain to be able to manage as well as our own operations. So, we're quite comfortable that we do not have an operating challenge. No? Hi, Sheila. So, we have worked for many years with our state and local governments to provide them pretty robust training programs that are still up and running. We are hiring this year at an accelerated rate over what we had anticipated, largely because of the backlog. In terms of hiring in COVID, obviously constrained. These are hiring levels for '22 at levels we have seen before and executed before. So, the question is all about the efficiency of your training programs. And we're pretty comfortable that once we get these people in the door, we can get them trained and have them go as new shipbuilders. They've got learning curves, obviously, as they get more proficient and become veterans, but we factored all of that in our thinking. So, to give you a little bit of additional color on that, demand was quite good in the United States and also increased throughout the rest of the world we saw as we had begun to see earlier, a return to the Fortune 500 as well as private companies as well as smaller companies. So, it's pretty robust across the portfolio and the kinds of both individuals that we see, but also companies that we see. But I don't see any structural change here, if that's kind of what you're poking at in terms of . Go ahead, I'm sorry. Hi, Seth. So, I'll answer those in the inverse order, almost negligible CapEx. So, this is just simply a timing of -- timing issue of expanding an existing building somewhat and getting in place the tools and fixtures to effectuate the increased production. On the service side, we expect '22 to see some nice service growth at Gulfstream as well as Jet Aviation which have a nice year as well. And we expect service volume quite naturally to grow with the expanding fleet. And we have included those assumptions on a going forward basis. Yes, so think about it this way. What I wanted to explain is that the guidance that we are giving you for '23 and '24, was based on a 1 to 1 book-to-bill. Clearly, if it's better than that, we'll increase production accordingly. But for planning purposes, that's what we have assumed and I think that's prudent planning. David? Yes. Loud and clear. So, let's talk about Marine. We have for some time said that we expected revenue growth in the $400 million to $500 million range. We still expect that. Next year is a little bit later, a $300 million increase and that's largely just workload timing. When I go to Combat -- so I think what we are anticipating is some decrease in pressure on the army budget. Look, we're  in '23, in particular, so we're pretty early on in the budget for that fiscal year. We don't have full OMB or tax back. But I think that the pressures on the army budget have been very well articulated. And while we expect that ultimately the funding levels for our platform programs will be sufficient and relatively stable, we will see some rather dramatic drop offs in O&M funded accounts, like maintenance, for example. So, we are factoring all of that into what I see is that increased army pressure. We're factoring all of that into our estimate for between 1% and 3% lower growth this year, but we anticipate growth returning as a number of these international orders come in a couple of years as well as new army start. So, I think we have given you a balanced and realistic view of combat. So, for this particular CR, given our portfolio and the prior year funding levels, we don't see a material impact of all, almost nothing. You've already got David. I need to get . So, we've been talking to our navy customer and clearly, some investments would be required. But I think, too, at the moment, we need to get the supply chain stabilized on the two-a-year cadence before we actually think about really ramping up to three. It is doable. We just need some time for that supply chain to adjust from the ravages of COVID. Good morning. Those are largely new work in the $32 billion and the customer adjudicates that as they get to it. But I think we've recognized as well that not only is the customer decision cycle, but it's also their protests that affect the timing of any of these wins, and they're significant."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.07 per diluted share on revenue of $9.6 billion, operating earnings of $1.08 billion and net earnings of $860 million. We beat consensus by $0.09 per share on somewhat lower revenue than anticipated by the sell side. However, operating margin is up about 40 basis points more than anticipated. This led to the earnings beat.\n Revenue is up 1.5% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings were up less than 1%. Net earnings are up 3.1%, and earnings per share are up 5.9%. This is all reasonably good, but the real story for us is the sequential results. Here, we beat last quarter revenue by 3.8%, operating earnings by 12.6%, net earnings by 16.7%, and EPS by 17.6%.\n On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $733 million or 2.7%. Operating earnings are up $137 million or 4.8%, net earnings are up $140 million, and earnings per share are up $0.64, a strong 8.5%.\n We had a powerful quarter from a cash perspective. Cash flow from operating activities was $1.47 billion. That is 171% in net earnings. Free cash flow was $1.275 billion, 148% of net income. This follows a very strong cash quarter performance in the second quarter. In summary, we enjoyed a good quarter in almost all important respects.\n So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason give you additional color around cash, backlog, taxes and deployment of cash and then answer your questions. \n First, Aerospace. At the outset, let me remind you that in April of last year, we announced that we were cutting production as a result of certain supply chain issues. Shortly thereafter, it became clear that there was a reduction in demand related to COVID. That resulted in additional cuts to production. Those production cuts were preplanned and implemented slowly over the ensuing months and reached their low point in the second quarter of this year.\n We had anticipated renewed post-COVID demand in the second half of this year and planned increased production for the second half with 32 planned deliveries in the third quarter and 39% in the fourth quarter. In fact, demand accelerated in mid-February, a full 4 months earlier than we had anticipated. This created opportunities but also operations and supply chain challenges for us, particularly for 2022. On balance, it is a rich problem to have.\n With that, let me turn to the Aerospace results in the quarter. Aerospace had revenue of $2.07 billion and operating earnings of $262 million, with a 12.7% operating margin. We managed delivery of 31 aircraft as opposed to the 32 planned, 1 slipped into the fourth quarter on customer preference. Revenue is $91 million more than the year-ago quarter, up 4.6% on 1 fewer aircraft delivered.\n On the other hand, operating earnings are down $21 million on a 160 basis point degradation in margins. This was the result of an additional $28 million in G&A expenses driven by higher R&D expense and around a $20 million settlement of a supplier claim related to the allocation of warranties after the end of G550 production. This was offset, but only in part, by improved gross margins on delivered aircraft and better margins in the Gulfstream service centers.\n The real story here is the quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement. Sales, earnings and margins are ramping up as planned. I will not dwell on these numbers. They are available in the charts attached to the press release. From an order perspective, this quarter boarded on the spectacular. In dollar terms, Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 1.6:1. Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.7:1. The second quarter was the strongest order quarter in the number of units that we have seen in quite some time. This quarter was slightly better.\n As previously discussed, sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February and continued on through the remainder of the first quarter. The pipeline that developed in that quarter rolled over into the second quarter and increased demand continued through the third quarter. We continue to experience a high level of interest activity and a solid pipeline. As a result of the order activity, Gulfstream backlog this quarter is the highest in the last 6 years.\n From a new product perspective, the G500 and G600 continued to perform well. Margins are improving on a consistent basis, and quality is excellent. We have delivered 131 of these aircraft to customers through the end of the quarter with 20 scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter. These are the metrics of a successful program building further momentum.\n The G700 has approximately 1,800 test hours on the 5 test aircraft. The new Rolls-Royce engine is performing well, but much remains to be accomplished. We remain on track for entry into service in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the G800 to follow in 6 to 9 months.\n As I mentioned earlier, we had planned 32 deliveries in the third quarter and came up on short. The slip was attributable to customer preference. We had planned for 39 in the fourth and LAD-1 that slipped into the quarter. If everything goes as planned, we will deliver 40 aircraft in the fourth quarter.\n The story in Combat Systems quarter-over-quarter sequential and year-to-date is all about operating excellence and continued strong margin performance. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.745 billion, down 3.1% from the year ago quarter. However, earnings are up 2.2% over the year ago quarter on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, yet another example of strong operating leverage from Combat Systems.\n Further that theme on a year-to-date basis, Combat System revenue was up $201 million or 3.8%, while operating earnings are up a significant 7.4% on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins. Demand for our combat vehicles remained stable in the U.S., with a brigade of Abrams main battle tanks per year and half a brigade of Strykers per year. Domestic upside is possible from the MPF program where our vehicle is performing well.\n In the near term, we are stable internationally but opportunity rich in the intermediate period with order potential in Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Denmark and Switzerland. You may have read in the press about some noise and vibration issues in Ajax that have emerged during the programs test phase. We are working very closely with both the British Army and the Ministry of Defense and are confident that both technical issues can be resolved. In summary, this quarter was an impressive operating performance once again by the Combat Systems Group.\n Turning to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.64 billion is up $232 million, above 9.6% over the year ago quarter. The current quarter revenue growth was distributed fairly evenly across the 3 shipyards. It is also up sequentially and year-to-date. Year-to-date revenue was up 7.5%. This is very impressive continued growth. In fact, revenue in this group has been up for the last 16 quarters on a quarter over year ago quarter basis.\n Operating earnings are $229 million in the quarter, up $6 million or 2.7% on an operating margin of 8.7%. On a sequential basis, operating earnings are up $19 million, on a 40 basis point improvement in margins. Electric Boats performance remained strong, and while still early in the Columbia first ship construction contract, the program remains on cost and schedule.\n We had a particularly strong quarter in our ship repair business, continuing to support our Navy customer. Throughout the group, we have a solid backlog of new construction and repair work, and our programs are well supported in the FY '22 budget. In summary, revenue growth is clearly visible. The real opportunity given this steady revenue visibility is margin improvement over time.\n Moving to Technologies. This segment had revenue of $3.120 billion in the quarter, down $130 million from the year ago quarter or 4%. The revenue decrease was attributable to Mission Systems from timing on several programs in part driven by chip shortages. On the other hand, Information Technology grew revenue against the year ago quarter at a rate of 1.4%.\n Operating earnings of $327 million are up $13 million or 4.1% on a 10.5% operating margin. EBITDA margin is a truly impressive 14.4%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Most of our competitors carry state and local taxes below the line. This quarter revenues decrease will impact the year, and we now expect revenue to be around $12.6 billion or $400 million less than our second quarter update. Earnings will, however, remain the same on better margins.\n Total backlog remains relatively consistent over all comparator periods, so good order activity in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1:1 and good order prospects on the horizon. The book-to-bill at GDIT was a little better than 1:1 and somewhat less in Mission Systems. The pipeline remains active at both businesses.\n From an opportunity perspective, cybersecurity is a top priority throughout the government and the budget calls for tens of billions of dollars in unclassified spending in both the defense and civil spaces. This is a significant opportunity for which we are well positioned to support our customers' needs, particularly as more and more customers move toward a 0 trust model.\n So that concludes my remarks with respect to a very good quarter and first 9 months. As we look toward the end of the year, we expect performance to be in line with the update to guidance that we gave you on the last call, except as I referenced in my remarks about Mission Systems. However, EPS guidance remains unchanged.\n I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks. \nJason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $1.5 billion in the quarter, once again on the strength of Gulfstream orders and from continued strong cash performance from our Technology segment.\n Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.3 billion or a 148% net earnings conversion. Through the first 9 months, our conversion rate is 91%, approaching our full year outlook for free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range. For those of you who followed us for some time, this performance through the first 9 months of the year is better than we've seen in the past several years and gives us good line of sight to achieving the upper end of our target cash range for the year.\n Looking at capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $196 million in the quarter or 2% of sales. That puts us a little under the 2% of sales for the first 9 months, so trending somewhat below our forecast for the year. We're still projecting full year CapEx in the range of 2.5% of sales. So that obviously implies an uptick in spending in the fourth quarter. We also paid $332 million in dividends and spent $117 million on the repurchase of 600,000 shares in the quarter. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 8.5 million shares at an average price of just under $174 per share.\n We repaid $500 million of notes that matured in July. And although there were no new issuances, we ended the quarter with $2 billion of commercial paper outstanding. We expect to fully retire that balance before the end of the year. So we ended the third quarter with a cash balance of just over $3.1 billion and a net debt position of $10.5 billion, down more than $800 million from last quarter and down $1.4 billion from this time last year.\n With the scheduled CP repayment in the fourth quarter, we expect to end the year with a net debt balance below $10 billion for the first time since 2018. As a result, net interest expense in the quarter was $99 million, down from $118 million in the third quarter of 2020. That brings the net interest expense for the first 9 months of the year to $331 million, down from $357 million for the same period in 2020.\n The tax rate in the quarter was 15.3%, bringing our rate to 15.9% for the first 9 months, consistent with our full year outlook, which remains around 16%. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the third quarter, with a 0.9x book-to-bill for the company as a whole, bringing us to a 1:1 ratio for the first 9 months and a 1.2x ratio for the trailing 12 months. As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.6x book-to-bill in the quarter, while technologies recorded a book-to-bill of one-to-one. \n Foreign exchange rate fluctuation resulted in a $300 million reduction in backlog in the quarter, with the majority of that impact in Combat Systems. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $88.1 billion. That's up 8% over this time last year, and total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $129.6 billion.\n That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Howard to start the Q&A. \nHoward Rubel: Thank you, Jason. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Myles Walton of UBS. \nMyles Walton: Phebe, I wonder, could you talk a bit about the transition potential margin impact of the new generation of the 400 and the 800 coming online? It seems like the 800 is a pretty advantageous move for the 650 engine with the 700 engines. And you usually would expect some level of reset on margins, but I'm curious if that reset will be materially lighter than we'd normally expect with the new entry into service. \nPhebe Novakovic: So we get a fair number of questions on this, so I think it's worthwhile walking through each element here. And first, let's take a look at margins. I'll make some comments that I'd like, Jason, to maybe elucidate a couple of points, and then we'll get into a little bit of earnings. So when you think about margins and the new product development, at present, we have about 3 models in production, soon to be joined by the 700. The 800 replaces the 650, and the 400 comes later.\n Importantly, we have all the modern plant property and equipment to do everything we need to do. We need to add some more CapEx to undergird the increase in wing production. Remember, we're doing all of our wings. But here's the important part, and it goes to the design for producibility that we built into these airplanes and the implied productivity that's embedded in that design for producibility.\n And remember, too, we are seeing margin improvement in every single one of our airplanes in services. This now tells you -- and again, I think it shines the spotlight on the operating leverage of Gulfstream. But to amplify all of that and really give an additional uplift, remember, all these aircraft are related. They all have the Symmetry flight deck. The G700 and 800 are the same engine and wings and the same basic fuselage. The G400 and 500, 600 have the same engines or similar engines from the same family from 1 supplier and the same basic fuselage. So this commonality align -- allowed us to design for producibility, which is going to be an uplift to our margins.\n Now if we unpack that a little bit, we get an awful lot of questions about R&D. And I'd like Jason to talk a little bit more, and perhaps not for all but for some, a bit of a tutorial on R&D accounting. \nJason Aiken: Yes. So to Phebe's point, we get a lot of questions around will this new product investment have any impact on the overall R&D spend and what does that do to margins over time. And as a reminder, we have a long-term steady commitment and demonstrated performance of investing in Gulfstream's product development and new technologies over time. So I think if you look over a multiyear period, we've averaged company-sponsored R&D in the call it, roughly 1% of sales range, and we don't expect that to change.\n Largely, the 800, I wouldn't say it's behind us, but it's been part and parcel to that spend over time. R&D is spent as a period expense over time. As Phebe mentioned, the G400, while a clean sheet airplane is part of the 500 and 600 development, and so the commonality among those helps keep that spend down. And so both of those airplanes are right within that profile of R&D spend. I think to the extent you see any lumpiness in R&D as we did this quarter, and we'll expect to see a little bit next quarter, that has more to do with supplier offsets that we receive. You're probably familiar with those where suppliers contribute to the program development efforts. And those come in lumps and chunks, so that tends to create the quarterly perturbations and R&D spend.\n But overall, the period expense for these programs, including the 2 that were announced this month, are right inside that line of company-sponsored R&D. So we don't expect that or the -- frankly, the introduction once they come to have an overall impact in the margin improvement trajectory that we see for Gulfstream over time. \nPhebe Novakovic: So what does all that mean if you step back? So margins this year are at their low point in aerospace. Next year margins will improve, and '23 margins will improve. Earnings were better in '21 than they were last year. They're going to be better in '22 and '23.\n And by the way, when we give you guidance on the next call, we're going to give you some color and some insight into both of those years to help explain and amplify again what we're looking at, at Gulfstream. So I hope that helps answer your question, Myles. \nOperator: We'll now move on to our next question, which will be coming from David Strauss. \nDavid Strauss: Phebe, I wanted to ask you, you highlighted that the Gulfstream backlog is the highest it's been in about 6 years. I think if I just take kind of the aircraft revenue, you've got something like 2.5 years in backlog based on today. So how -- and at the same time, you also comment on supply chain challenges. So how do you balance all that as you think about where production rates go at Gulfstream? \nPhebe Novakovic: So the increased demand supports increased production. We'll get into all of that specificity on the next call. But as I noted, after we reduced production last year in response to COVID, supply chain challenges that were in large part driven by COVID and COVID demand, the supply chain needs to gear back up. So there's a little bit of a headwind. But that's why I wanted to give you the color around the margin and earnings performance. \nDavid Strauss: Okay. But all that being said, we should see higher production in '22 and '23? \nPhebe Novakovic: We're anticipating that to drive a higher revenue. So as I said in my remarks, this is a rich problem to have. I wanted to be as transparent with you as possible to tell you, hey, look, we've got this. There's a nice strong backlog. We've got very good demand, a continuing demand. But as we ramp up, and we will be ramping up, there are some challenges. We can manage those challenges and manage through them, but I thought it was important that you guys understand that. \nOperator: We're now going to move over to Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. \nRobert Stallard: Phebe, I was wondering if you could elaborate on these challenges. You obviously face some chip issues in Mission Systems, but it seems you're also conscious of some potential headwinds in the aerospace division that ramps up. And one of your peers also talked about broader supply chain challenges in its Defense business. I was wondering if you could comment on this topic generally and what you could be seeing in the future. \nPhebe Novakovic: So I tried to give you some measured look at the Aerospace issues. But on supply chain, the chip shortage impacted Mission Systems. I would note how -- and we do expect that to go into next year somewhat. I would note, however, even since the close of the quarter, they have begun to significantly mitigate some of those chip impacts. But across the portfolio of our defense businesses, we are not seeing significant or even material supply chain challenges. So we've been able to manage through that pretty well. So for us, and I can only speak for us, that hasn't been a significant issue other than its impact at technologies and driven by Mission Systems. \nRobert Stallard: Yes. And in aerospace, the challenge is there. Is that just a lead time issue with suppliers? Or is it specific parts that you're finding particularly tight? \nPhebe Novakovic: It's primarily a lead time. The fact that we pulled down last year adds a little bit of headwind to the increase in production that we see on a going-forward basis. But I don't see any particular problems at the moment impacting that. This is really just a timing issue and getting folks back up to speed. \nOperator: We're now going to move over to Cai von Rumohr of Cowen. \nCai Von Rumohr: Yes. So Phebe, could you give us some color on demand at Gulfstream, specifically high net worth versus corporate versus fractional? And most importantly, are you seeing any opportunity for improved pricing in this sector? \nPhebe Novakovic: Let me answer those in the inverse order. We have seen some upward pressure on pricing, and then let me unpack your demand. So look, our own view of our increased demand is a combination of factors. One, the very attractive product mix, a strong economy, the return of the Fortune 1000, increase high net worth individuals. And in fact, COVID did create in pockets some wealth creation and the pent-up demand that's built up during the pandemic. The demand is -- and I think importantly is spread evenly pretty much across our product line. And there's nothing unusual to report on customer mix or geographic distribution other than the North America was quite, quite strong. \nOperator: And we're now going to move to Ron Epstein of Bank of America. \nRonald Epstein: Just maybe changing gears a little bit. I think everybody is going to focus on bizjet, so I'm going to maybe not do that. A while back, there was some discussion... \nPhebe Novakovic: Oh my, how innovative. \nRonald Epstein: Imagine that, right? There were some discussion in the press around the Polish defense ministry purchasing some Abrams tanks and 1 Abrams. I think maybe 250 of them, if I remember right. Where does that stand? And if you can give some color on that and maybe some of the other international business going on in the Land Systems business. \nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So we're working very closely with our customer as well as the Department of Defense to support a potential order of 250 tanks out of Poland. If we -- and frankly, this is a powerful system for the polls to have given their geographic location and their historical experience, particularly with folks stream and West. So if we think through again the FMS process, and this is an FMS sale, we're looking at somewhere between maybe in the 2-year period. \n But just to give you a little bit of additional color we see increased demand signals coming out of Czech Republic, Romania, Denmark, Switzerland, Spain and, of course, the Middle East. The world hasn't gotten any safer. \nOperator: We'll now move over to our next question from Richard Safran of Seaport Research Partners. \nRichard Safran: Phebe, Jason, Howard, with such great cash flow performance, I wanted to get an update on how you're thinking about capital deployment, invest in the business, dividends, repurchases, commercial paper. Now, Jason, I heard your remarks about retiring commercial paper. But as we look ahead, are you thinking about maintaining your current strategy? Or are you considering any changes? I think in the past, you've stated you invest in the business depending on need and that dividend should be repeatable. But I was just curious if there's any update here on how you're thinking about it. \nPhebe Novakovic: So let me give you the strategic framework, and then Jason can fill in any specifics. But essentially, our capital deployment strategy remains unchanged. We invest opportunistically in small acquisitions or in investments to grow the business where we can get a good capital return, return on our capital. Dividends and opportunistic share repurchase. This has been our strategy from the day 1 and the advent of this management team. Jason? \nJason Aiken: Yes. I think the only thing I'd add to your point on the commercial paper repayment and future priorities around debt is that commercial paper will mature here in the fourth quarter. We've got more than sufficient cash on hand, so we'll just repay that in normal course as it comes due. \n The next debt maturity is in late next year. I think it's around $1 billion that will come due. So no real imminent issues there, so we can focus on the priorities Phebe mentioned. And then as those elements of the debt ladder do mature, we'll pay those down in due course up to  a point until we get to a comfortable place that we think long term continues to support our target mid-A credit rating for the company. \nOperator: We'll now be taking our next question from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. \nSeth Seifman: Phebe, when you think about the certification timeline for the 700 and the 800, I guess, is there anything you'd point out to as a long pole in the tent? And thinking specifically about the engine certification, which you mentioned today, and then also the changes in ODA that Steve Dickson outlined last week testifying before Congress. \nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So our estimate at the moment still remains late next year for the 700, with the 800 to follow 6 to 9 months later. For those of you who have followed engine certification for years and decades, some of you, you'll know that they are always challenging. This engine is performing extremely well in terms of its capability in either meeting or outperforming its design specification. We've got a lot of test growth on a going-forward basis to get through. \n So we don't see any particular issues at the moment, but we are mindful that these are always complex and challenging processes to work through. And we've adapted to changes in the -- in our regulators in the FAA's game book before. And at the moment, we don't see any reason to adjust our estimates. But if we do, we'll let you know. \nSeth Seifman: Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up for Jason. If you could update us on where you expect to be on working capital at the end of this year and then kind of maybe without specific guidance, just what the opportunity buckets are in working capital for '22. \nJason Aiken: Sure. I think as you can see from the exhibits this morning, working capital was a benefit, call it, in the couple of $300 million or $400 million in the quarter. That is largely from the performance at Gulfstream, the significant order activity that we've seen throughout the year and the quarter as well as the continued sale of the last of the test articles from the 500 and 600 program. So that really is the big benefit in the quarter.\n Working capital is still a bit of a headwind year-to-date, just as the business grows and we work through some of that. But I think as you look ahead, we would expect to see working capital to continue to be a benefit in the fourth quarter and beyond as we get back to that 100% conversion level this year. We're approaching that level this year and certainly expect to get above 100% conversion next year. So part of that is the continued demand cadence at Gulfstream. Once we get through the 700 program, we would look to sell off those test articles as well. \n And then, of course, you've got the ongoing benefits at Combat Systems. You've seen us achieve a regular order on the large international program there in Combat Systems. And that will continue to be a tailwind, really even more of a tailwind, I think, into '22 as well as into '23. So those are some of the major movers.\n The other side of it, of course, is where we should be peaking this year in terms of the capital expenditure investment profile in Marine Systems. So that will start to come down next year and return more to the normal historical level we see by 2023. So those are really the big movers there and should give you a sense of where we ought to see the working capital moving over the next 2, 3 years. \nOperator: Our next question will be from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. \nKristine Liwag: Phebe and Howard and Jason. Phebe, how do you anticipate the vaccine executive order will affect labor and production? And also, do you have a sense of the percentage of GD employees that are currently vaccinated? \nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So before I get into the mandate, I'd like to take the opportunity to reiterate again our acknowledgment of our workforce. I think it's important to remember that we were declared a critical national infrastructure business early in the onset of the pandemic. And as a result of that, our workers stayed on the factory floor in the shipyards and in places where they were needed, frankly, throughout the pandemic. They stood their watch and, from my perspective with courage and fortitude, to produce the goods and services that are necessary for our national security. I personally am fully cognizant of the sacrifices they made, and I'm proud of the courage they showed.\n Now let me turn to the mandate. As you well know, as a federal contractor, we are covered by the executive order on the mandate. The corporate office mandate has been fully executed. Two of our largest businesses are in the process of executing the mandate, and many others are set to implement accordingly. And because of our customer, operational and geographic diversity of many of our businesses, we are working with our customers as contract modifications are received that could trigger an implementation. So we keep a pretty running tally. We're at, we believe, in some form of either full or partial vaccination in the 75% range or so. And then yes, so we understand the mandate. \nKristine Liwag: And then maybe if I could add one on supply chain and aerospace. We're seeing that some of the suppliers also have to comply with the mandate. How are you mitigating potential supply chain issues in aerospace if you're not able to get parts? And how do you think about that with regards to your production rate plans for Gulfstream? \nPhebe Novakovic: Well, frankly, to the extent that there is an impact in the supply chain of this mandate, it will affect a lot of lines of business throughout the defense aerospace world. So I don't see a particular challenge at Gulfstream or in the moment at any of our other large lines of business. But we will certainly be mindful and deal with any workflow perturbations should they emerge.\n Look, we have a history of dealing with challenges methodically, systematically and thoroughly. So you'd expect us to approach that operating discipline and apply that operating discipline to any emerging issues that may or may not arise. \nOperator: We'll now move to our next question from Peter Arment of Baird. \nPeter Arment: Phebe, maybe just to ask on the Technologies segment, just given the strong operating performance there. Is there any -- just a clarification, is there any onetimers in the 10.5% that you had this quarter? \nPhebe Novakovic: No. \nPeter Arment: And just if not, do you view this segment being able to sustain its kind of 10% or a double-digit margin going forward or just any color around that? \nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. Double-digit margin going forward. Okay? \nPeter Arment: Yes. No, I just -- any -- are you seeing any changes there or your ability to kind of manage that in terms of I know it's a very price competitive environment. \nPhebe Novakovic: No. I mean not at the moment. We've been pretty consistent in our margin performance across this entity. So I don't see any systemic change that should impact that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Akers of Wells Fargo. \nMatthew Akers: I wonder if you could talk about for the G400, 800, just kind of early feedback. And how much, I guess, of the demand you're seeing there, sort of customers that are sort of incremental that wouldn't have bought some of your other platforms versus potentially kind of cannibalizing some of the other aircraft? \nPhebe Novakovic: We have no instances of cannibalization to date. The 800 is ultimately a replacement for the 650. About 650 demand remains pretty steady. And the customer base is pretty much our typical customer base. There may be incremental adds here and there, but I would argue that we see that in both the 700 and 800 and frankly, the rest of that portfolio to the extent that there are incremental here and there. And this tend to be high net worth individuals or some new Fortune 1000 or 500 companies. But I think there's nothing particularly notable here in terms of being exceptional outside the norm. Other than there's a lot of good interest here. We've taken a good number of orders. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski of Alembic Global. \nPeter Skibitski: Phebe, I was wondering if you could share your thoughts on the fiscal '22 defense budget. There seems to be a lot of tailwind to the President's request in Congress. And I'm wondering if you could share with us if you see some of the support, incremental support, occurring to GD programs and maybe you'd wager odds if that budget could be signed into law by the end of this calendar year or not. \nPhebe Novakovic: So I think you know as much as I do, given the fulsome and in-depth reporting on congressional budget processes about the likelihood of signing, so I'm not going to go speculate on hypothetical timing. But I think, importantly, all of our major and frankly all of our programs were well supported, and some are beneficiaries of  increased spending on the part of the Congress. So all in all, we had no particular surprises, by the way, up or down. So we were quite comfortable on how this budget is being played out. \nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. \nNoah Poponak: Phebe, the -- in the business jet market at large, the end market and investors keep debating the sustainability of this recent uptick in demand and some people feel like it's... \nPhebe Novakovic: I haven't heard a lot of that. \nNoah Poponak: Yes. Exactly. Well, you've made, I guess, the pragmatic decision to kind of not wait in there. And I guess, I just wonder if you've had enough time or you speak to so many customers, if you've heard enough from real deal new customers to perhaps have more of a view on the sustainability of what we're seeing. \nPhebe Novakovic: Well, I wouldn't be taken little about this. I think that -- and nor should anybody. I think the demand that we're seeing is, I tried to reiterate before, is across our existing customer base. The Fortune 1000 is back in force. There are, as I noted, new entrants into that market as some companies have increased their profitability over the last 2 years. And there are additional high net worth individuals who have entered into the market. \n So I think that the data -- and I can only speak for Gulfstream. The data would suggest that given our attractive product mix as strong, as I noted earlier, strong economy and the fact that our customers are back and broad-based demand, I'm not worried at the moment about sustainability. These are -- Gulfstream is in and business jet market is in a cyclical market, driven in part no small measure by the economy. But we have been the most resilient in terms of demand through most economic cycles. So again, I think we are [ very resilient ] and we've got a good pipeline going forward. \nNoah Poponak: That's helpful. Do you have a sense, even if directionally, how many of your customers in the last 18 months are truly brand new? \nPhebe Novakovic: We're not going to parse it, but it's pretty -- we've gotten a fair number of new folks, but also our regular and historic customers. They're back on some new customers from market share increases. So as far as I'm concerned, we had very, very good demand, and the pipeline remains robust. \n As that was our final question, I would like to hand back to Howard Rubel for any closing remarks. \nHoward Rubel: Thank you, Melissa. Thank you, all, for joining us on our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the third quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have any other questions, I can be reached (703) 876-3117. That will now end our call. \nOperator: This concludes the General Dynamics Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Thank you, all, for joining, and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $1.5 billion in the quarter, once again on the strength of Gulfstream orders and from continued strong cash performance from our Technology segment.\n Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.3 billion or a 148% net earnings conversion. Through the first 9 months, our conversion rate is 91%, approaching our full year outlook for free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range. For those of you who followed us for some time, this performance through the first 9 months of the year is better than we've seen in the past several years and gives us good line of sight to achieving the upper end of our target cash range for the year.\n Looking at capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $196 million in the quarter or 2% of sales. That puts us a little under the 2% of sales for the first 9 months, so trending somewhat below our forecast for the year. We're still projecting full year CapEx in the range of 2.5% of sales. So that obviously implies an uptick in spending in the fourth quarter. We also paid $332 million in dividends and spent $117 million on the repurchase of 600,000 shares in the quarter. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 8.5 million shares at an average price of just under $174 per share.\n We repaid $500 million of notes that matured in July. And although there were no new issuances, we ended the quarter with $2 billion of commercial paper outstanding. We expect to fully retire that balance before the end of the year. So we ended the third quarter with a cash balance of just over $3.1 billion and a net debt position of $10.5 billion, down more than $800 million from last quarter and down $1.4 billion from this time last year.\n With the scheduled CP repayment in the fourth quarter, we expect to end the year with a net debt balance below $10 billion for the first time since 2018. As a result, net interest expense in the quarter was $99 million, down from $118 million in the third quarter of 2020. That brings the net interest expense for the first 9 months of the year to $331 million, down from $357 million for the same period in 2020.\n The tax rate in the quarter was 15.3%, bringing our rate to 15.9% for the first 9 months, consistent with our full year outlook, which remains around 16%. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the third quarter, with a 0.9x book-to-bill for the company as a whole, bringing us to a 1:1 ratio for the first 9 months and a 1.2x ratio for the trailing 12 months. As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.6x book-to-bill in the quarter, while technologies recorded a book-to-bill of one-to-one. \n Foreign exchange rate fluctuation resulted in a $300 million reduction in backlog in the quarter, with the majority of that impact in Combat Systems. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $88.1 billion. That's up 8% over this time last year, and total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $129.6 billion.\n That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Howard to start the Q&A. Yes. So to Phebe's point, we get a lot of questions around will this new product investment have any impact on the overall R&D spend and what does that do to margins over time. And as a reminder, we have a long-term steady commitment and demonstrated performance of investing in Gulfstream's product development and new technologies over time. So I think if you look over a multiyear period, we've averaged company-sponsored R&D in the call it, roughly 1% of sales range, and we don't expect that to change.\n Largely, the 800, I wouldn't say it's behind us, but it's been part and parcel to that spend over time. R&D is spent as a period expense over time. As Phebe mentioned, the G400, while a clean sheet airplane is part of the 500 and 600 development, and so the commonality among those helps keep that spend down. And so both of those airplanes are right within that profile of R&D spend. I think to the extent you see any lumpiness in R&D as we did this quarter, and we'll expect to see a little bit next quarter, that has more to do with supplier offsets that we receive. You're probably familiar with those where suppliers contribute to the program development efforts. And those come in lumps and chunks, so that tends to create the quarterly perturbations and R&D spend.\n But overall, the period expense for these programs, including the 2 that were announced this month, are right inside that line of company-sponsored R&D. So we don't expect that or the -- frankly, the introduction once they come to have an overall impact in the margin improvement trajectory that we see for Gulfstream over time. Yes. I think the only thing I'd add to your point on the commercial paper repayment and future priorities around debt is that commercial paper will mature here in the fourth quarter. We've got more than sufficient cash on hand, so we'll just repay that in normal course as it comes due. \n The next debt maturity is in late next year. I think it's around $1 billion that will come due. So no real imminent issues there, so we can focus on the priorities Phebe mentioned. And then as those elements of the debt ladder do mature, we'll pay those down in due course up to  a point until we get to a comfortable place that we think long term continues to support our target mid-A credit rating for the company. Sure. I think as you can see from the exhibits this morning, working capital was a benefit, call it, in the couple of $300 million or $400 million in the quarter. That is largely from the performance at Gulfstream, the significant order activity that we've seen throughout the year and the quarter as well as the continued sale of the last of the test articles from the 500 and 600 program. So that really is the big benefit in the quarter.\n Working capital is still a bit of a headwind year-to-date, just as the business grows and we work through some of that. But I think as you look ahead, we would expect to see working capital to continue to be a benefit in the fourth quarter and beyond as we get back to that 100% conversion level this year. We're approaching that level this year and certainly expect to get above 100% conversion next year. So part of that is the continued demand cadence at Gulfstream. Once we get through the 700 program, we would look to sell off those test articles as well. \n And then, of course, you've got the ongoing benefits at Combat Systems. You've seen us achieve a regular order on the large international program there in Combat Systems. And that will continue to be a tailwind, really even more of a tailwind, I think, into '22 as well as into '23. So those are some of the major movers.\n The other side of it, of course, is where we should be peaking this year in terms of the capital expenditure investment profile in Marine Systems. So that will start to come down next year and return more to the normal historical level we see by 2023. So those are really the big movers there and should give you a sense of where we ought to see the working capital moving over the next 2, 3 years."

            "name": "Phebe Novakovic",
            "content": "Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.07 per diluted share on revenue of $9.6 billion, operating earnings of $1.08 billion and net earnings of $860 million. We beat consensus by $0.09 per share on somewhat lower revenue than anticipated by the sell side. However, operating margin is up about 40 basis points more than anticipated. This led to the earnings beat.\n Revenue is up 1.5% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings were up less than 1%. Net earnings are up 3.1%, and earnings per share are up 5.9%. This is all reasonably good, but the real story for us is the sequential results. Here, we beat last quarter revenue by 3.8%, operating earnings by 12.6%, net earnings by 16.7%, and EPS by 17.6%.\n On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $733 million or 2.7%. Operating earnings are up $137 million or 4.8%, net earnings are up $140 million, and earnings per share are up $0.64, a strong 8.5%.\n We had a powerful quarter from a cash perspective. Cash flow from operating activities was $1.47 billion. That is 171% in net earnings. Free cash flow was $1.275 billion, 148% of net income. This follows a very strong cash quarter performance in the second quarter. In summary, we enjoyed a good quarter in almost all important respects.\n So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason give you additional color around cash, backlog, taxes and deployment of cash and then answer your questions. \n First, Aerospace. At the outset, let me remind you that in April of last year, we announced that we were cutting production as a result of certain supply chain issues. Shortly thereafter, it became clear that there was a reduction in demand related to COVID. That resulted in additional cuts to production. Those production cuts were preplanned and implemented slowly over the ensuing months and reached their low point in the second quarter of this year.\n We had anticipated renewed post-COVID demand in the second half of this year and planned increased production for the second half with 32 planned deliveries in the third quarter and 39% in the fourth quarter. In fact, demand accelerated in mid-February, a full 4 months earlier than we had anticipated. This created opportunities but also operations and supply chain challenges for us, particularly for 2022. On balance, it is a rich problem to have.\n With that, let me turn to the Aerospace results in the quarter. Aerospace had revenue of $2.07 billion and operating earnings of $262 million, with a 12.7% operating margin. We managed delivery of 31 aircraft as opposed to the 32 planned, 1 slipped into the fourth quarter on customer preference. Revenue is $91 million more than the year-ago quarter, up 4.6% on 1 fewer aircraft delivered.\n On the other hand, operating earnings are down $21 million on a 160 basis point degradation in margins. This was the result of an additional $28 million in G&A expenses driven by higher R&D expense and around a $20 million settlement of a supplier claim related to the allocation of warranties after the end of G550 production. This was offset, but only in part, by improved gross margins on delivered aircraft and better margins in the Gulfstream service centers.\n The real story here is the quarter-over-quarter sequential improvement. Sales, earnings and margins are ramping up as planned. I will not dwell on these numbers. They are available in the charts attached to the press release. From an order perspective, this quarter boarded on the spectacular. In dollar terms, Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 1.6:1. Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.7:1. The second quarter was the strongest order quarter in the number of units that we have seen in quite some time. This quarter was slightly better.\n As previously discussed, sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February and continued on through the remainder of the first quarter. The pipeline that developed in that quarter rolled over into the second quarter and increased demand continued through the third quarter. We continue to experience a high level of interest activity and a solid pipeline. As a result of the order activity, Gulfstream backlog this quarter is the highest in the last 6 years.\n From a new product perspective, the G500 and G600 continued to perform well. Margins are improving on a consistent basis, and quality is excellent. We have delivered 131 of these aircraft to customers through the end of the quarter with 20 scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter. These are the metrics of a successful program building further momentum.\n The G700 has approximately 1,800 test hours on the 5 test aircraft. The new Rolls-Royce engine is performing well, but much remains to be accomplished. We remain on track for entry into service in the fourth quarter of 2022, with the G800 to follow in 6 to 9 months.\n As I mentioned earlier, we had planned 32 deliveries in the third quarter and came up on short. The slip was attributable to customer preference. We had planned for 39 in the fourth and LAD-1 that slipped into the quarter. If everything goes as planned, we will deliver 40 aircraft in the fourth quarter.\n The story in Combat Systems quarter-over-quarter sequential and year-to-date is all about operating excellence and continued strong margin performance. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.745 billion, down 3.1% from the year ago quarter. However, earnings are up 2.2% over the year ago quarter on the strength of an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin, yet another example of strong operating leverage from Combat Systems.\n Further that theme on a year-to-date basis, Combat System revenue was up $201 million or 3.8%, while operating earnings are up a significant 7.4% on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margins. Demand for our combat vehicles remained stable in the U.S., with a brigade of Abrams main battle tanks per year and half a brigade of Strykers per year. Domestic upside is possible from the MPF program where our vehicle is performing well.\n In the near term, we are stable internationally but opportunity rich in the intermediate period with order potential in Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Denmark and Switzerland. You may have read in the press about some noise and vibration issues in Ajax that have emerged during the programs test phase. We are working very closely with both the British Army and the Ministry of Defense and are confident that both technical issues can be resolved. In summary, this quarter was an impressive operating performance once again by the Combat Systems Group.\n Turning to Marine Systems. Revenue of $2.64 billion is up $232 million, above 9.6% over the year ago quarter. The current quarter revenue growth was distributed fairly evenly across the 3 shipyards. It is also up sequentially and year-to-date. Year-to-date revenue was up 7.5%. This is very impressive continued growth. In fact, revenue in this group has been up for the last 16 quarters on a quarter over year ago quarter basis.\n Operating earnings are $229 million in the quarter, up $6 million or 2.7% on an operating margin of 8.7%. On a sequential basis, operating earnings are up $19 million, on a 40 basis point improvement in margins. Electric Boats performance remained strong, and while still early in the Columbia first ship construction contract, the program remains on cost and schedule.\n We had a particularly strong quarter in our ship repair business, continuing to support our Navy customer. Throughout the group, we have a solid backlog of new construction and repair work, and our programs are well supported in the FY '22 budget. In summary, revenue growth is clearly visible. The real opportunity given this steady revenue visibility is margin improvement over time.\n Moving to Technologies. This segment had revenue of $3.120 billion in the quarter, down $130 million from the year ago quarter or 4%. The revenue decrease was attributable to Mission Systems from timing on several programs in part driven by chip shortages. On the other hand, Information Technology grew revenue against the year ago quarter at a rate of 1.4%.\n Operating earnings of $327 million are up $13 million or 4.1% on a 10.5% operating margin. EBITDA margin is a truly impressive 14.4%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Most of our competitors carry state and local taxes below the line. This quarter revenues decrease will impact the year, and we now expect revenue to be around $12.6 billion or $400 million less than our second quarter update. Earnings will, however, remain the same on better margins.\n Total backlog remains relatively consistent over all comparator periods, so good order activity in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1:1 and good order prospects on the horizon. The book-to-bill at GDIT was a little better than 1:1 and somewhat less in Mission Systems. The pipeline remains active at both businesses.\n From an opportunity perspective, cybersecurity is a top priority throughout the government and the budget calls for tens of billions of dollars in unclassified spending in both the defense and civil spaces. This is a significant opportunity for which we are well positioned to support our customers' needs, particularly as more and more customers move toward a 0 trust model.\n So that concludes my remarks with respect to a very good quarter and first 9 months. As we look toward the end of the year, we expect performance to be in line with the update to guidance that we gave you on the last call, except as I referenced in my remarks about Mission Systems. However, EPS guidance remains unchanged.\n I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks. So we get a fair number of questions on this, so I think it's worthwhile walking through each element here. And first, let's take a look at margins. I'll make some comments that I'd like, Jason, to maybe elucidate a couple of points, and then we'll get into a little bit of earnings. So when you think about margins and the new product development, at present, we have about 3 models in production, soon to be joined by the 700. The 800 replaces the 650, and the 400 comes later.\n Importantly, we have all the modern plant property and equipment to do everything we need to do. We need to add some more CapEx to undergird the increase in wing production. Remember, we're doing all of our wings. But here's the important part, and it goes to the design for producibility that we built into these airplanes and the implied productivity that's embedded in that design for producibility.\n And remember, too, we are seeing margin improvement in every single one of our airplanes in services. This now tells you -- and again, I think it shines the spotlight on the operating leverage of Gulfstream. But to amplify all of that and really give an additional uplift, remember, all these aircraft are related. They all have the Symmetry flight deck. The G700 and 800 are the same engine and wings and the same basic fuselage. The G400 and 500, 600 have the same engines or similar engines from the same family from 1 supplier and the same basic fuselage. So this commonality align -- allowed us to design for producibility, which is going to be an uplift to our margins.\n Now if we unpack that a little bit, we get an awful lot of questions about R&D. And I'd like Jason to talk a little bit more, and perhaps not for all but for some, a bit of a tutorial on R&D accounting. So what does all that mean if you step back? So margins this year are at their low point in aerospace. Next year margins will improve, and '23 margins will improve. Earnings were better in '21 than they were last year. They're going to be better in '22 and '23.\n And by the way, when we give you guidance on the next call, we're going to give you some color and some insight into both of those years to help explain and amplify again what we're looking at, at Gulfstream. So I hope that helps answer your question, Myles. So the increased demand supports increased production. We'll get into all of that specificity on the next call. But as I noted, after we reduced production last year in response to COVID, supply chain challenges that were in large part driven by COVID and COVID demand, the supply chain needs to gear back up. So there's a little bit of a headwind. But that's why I wanted to give you the color around the margin and earnings performance. We're anticipating that to drive a higher revenue. So as I said in my remarks, this is a rich problem to have. I wanted to be as transparent with you as possible to tell you, hey, look, we've got this. There's a nice strong backlog. We've got very good demand, a continuing demand. But as we ramp up, and we will be ramping up, there are some challenges. We can manage those challenges and manage through them, but I thought it was important that you guys understand that. So I tried to give you some measured look at the Aerospace issues. But on supply chain, the chip shortage impacted Mission Systems. I would note how -- and we do expect that to go into next year somewhat. I would note, however, even since the close of the quarter, they have begun to significantly mitigate some of those chip impacts. But across the portfolio of our defense businesses, we are not seeing significant or even material supply chain challenges. So we've been able to manage through that pretty well. So for us, and I can only speak for us, that hasn't been a significant issue other than its impact at technologies and driven by Mission Systems. It's primarily a lead time. The fact that we pulled down last year adds a little bit of headwind to the increase in production that we see on a going-forward basis. But I don't see any particular problems at the moment impacting that. This is really just a timing issue and getting folks back up to speed. Let me answer those in the inverse order. We have seen some upward pressure on pricing, and then let me unpack your demand. So look, our own view of our increased demand is a combination of factors. One, the very attractive product mix, a strong economy, the return of the Fortune 1000, increase high net worth individuals. And in fact, COVID did create in pockets some wealth creation and the pent-up demand that's built up during the pandemic. The demand is -- and I think importantly is spread evenly pretty much across our product line. And there's nothing unusual to report on customer mix or geographic distribution other than the North America was quite, quite strong. Oh my, how innovative. Yes. So we're working very closely with our customer as well as the Department of Defense to support a potential order of 250 tanks out of Poland. If we -- and frankly, this is a powerful system for the polls to have given their geographic location and their historical experience, particularly with folks stream and West. So if we think through again the FMS process, and this is an FMS sale, we're looking at somewhere between maybe in the 2-year period. \n But just to give you a little bit of additional color we see increased demand signals coming out of Czech Republic, Romania, Denmark, Switzerland, Spain and, of course, the Middle East. The world hasn't gotten any safer. So let me give you the strategic framework, and then Jason can fill in any specifics. But essentially, our capital deployment strategy remains unchanged. We invest opportunistically in small acquisitions or in investments to grow the business where we can get a good capital return, return on our capital. Dividends and opportunistic share repurchase. This has been our strategy from the day 1 and the advent of this management team. Jason? Yes. So our estimate at the moment still remains late next year for the 700, with the 800 to follow 6 to 9 months later. For those of you who have followed engine certification for years and decades, some of you, you'll know that they are always challenging. This engine is performing extremely well in terms of its capability in either meeting or outperforming its design specification. We've got a lot of test growth on a going-forward basis to get through. \n So we don't see any particular issues at the moment, but we are mindful that these are always complex and challenging processes to work through. And we've adapted to changes in the -- in our regulators in the FAA's game book before. And at the moment, we don't see any reason to adjust our estimates. But if we do, we'll let you know. Yes. So before I get into the mandate, I'd like to take the opportunity to reiterate again our acknowledgment of our workforce. I think it's important to remember that we were declared a critical national infrastructure business early in the onset of the pandemic. And as a result of that, our workers stayed on the factory floor in the shipyards and in places where they were needed, frankly, throughout the pandemic. They stood their watch and, from my perspective with courage and fortitude, to produce the goods and services that are necessary for our national security. I personally am fully cognizant of the sacrifices they made, and I'm proud of the courage they showed.\n Now let me turn to the mandate. As you well know, as a federal contractor, we are covered by the executive order on the mandate. The corporate office mandate has been fully executed. Two of our largest businesses are in the process of executing the mandate, and many others are set to implement accordingly. And because of our customer, operational and geographic diversity of many of our businesses, we are working with our customers as contract modifications are received that could trigger an implementation. So we keep a pretty running tally. We're at, we believe, in some form of either full or partial vaccination in the 75% range or so. And then yes, so we understand the mandate. Well, frankly, to the extent that there is an impact in the supply chain of this mandate, it will affect a lot of lines of business throughout the defense aerospace world. So I don't see a particular challenge at Gulfstream or in the moment at any of our other large lines of business. But we will certainly be mindful and deal with any workflow perturbations should they emerge.\n Look, we have a history of dealing with challenges methodically, systematically and thoroughly. So you'd expect us to approach that operating discipline and apply that operating discipline to any emerging issues that may or may not arise. No. Yes. Double-digit margin going forward. Okay? No. I mean not at the moment. We've been pretty consistent in our margin performance across this entity. So I don't see any systemic change that should impact that. We have no instances of cannibalization to date. The 800 is ultimately a replacement for the 650. About 650 demand remains pretty steady. And the customer base is pretty much our typical customer base. There may be incremental adds here and there, but I would argue that we see that in both the 700 and 800 and frankly, the rest of that portfolio to the extent that there are incremental here and there. And this tend to be high net worth individuals or some new Fortune 1000 or 500 companies. But I think there's nothing particularly notable here in terms of being exceptional outside the norm. Other than there's a lot of good interest here. We've taken a good number of orders. So I think you know as much as I do, given the fulsome and in-depth reporting on congressional budget processes about the likelihood of signing, so I'm not going to go speculate on hypothetical timing. But I think, importantly, all of our major and frankly all of our programs were well supported, and some are beneficiaries of  increased spending on the part of the Congress. So all in all, we had no particular surprises, by the way, up or down. So we were quite comfortable on how this budget is being played out. I haven't heard a lot of that. Well, I wouldn't be taken little about this. I think that -- and nor should anybody. I think the demand that we're seeing is, I tried to reiterate before, is across our existing customer base. The Fortune 1000 is back in force. There are, as I noted, new entrants into that market as some companies have increased their profitability over the last 2 years. And there are additional high net worth individuals who have entered into the market. \n So I think that the data -- and I can only speak for Gulfstream. The data would suggest that given our attractive product mix as strong, as I noted earlier, strong economy and the fact that our customers are back and broad-based demand, I'm not worried at the moment about sustainability. These are -- Gulfstream is in and business jet market is in a cyclical market, driven in part no small measure by the economy. But we have been the most resilient in terms of demand through most economic cycles. So again, I think we are [ very resilient ] and we've got a good pipeline going forward. We're not going to parse it, but it's pretty -- we've gotten a fair number of new folks, but also our regular and historic customers. They're back on some new customers from market share increases. So as far as I'm concerned, we had very, very good demand, and the pipeline remains robust. \n As that was our final question, I would like to hand back to Howard Rubel for any closing remarks."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2021 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. With that completed, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Early this morning, we have reported earnings of $2.61 per diluted share on revenue of $9.2 billion, operating earnings of $959 million, and net income of $737 million. Revenue was essentially flat against the second quarter last year but operating earnings are up $125 million and net earnings are up $112 million, earnings per share are up $0.43. To be a little more granular, revenue on the defense side of the business is up against last year's second quarter by $308 million or 4.2%. Aerospace is down $352 million, pretty much as planned. Operating earnings on the defense side are up $98 million or 14.3%, and operating earnings in aerospace are up $36 million on a 390 basis point improvement in operating margin. The operating margin for the entire company was 10.4%, 140 basis points better than the year ago quarter. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.07 per share on somewhat lower revenue than anticipated by the sell side. However, operating margin is 20 basis points lower than anticipated coupled with a somewhat lower share count, this led to the earnings feed. On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $596 million or 3.3% and operating earnings are up $129 million or 7.3%. Overall margins are up 40 basis points. The defense numbers are particularly good with revenue up $752 million or 5.2%, and operating earnings up $143 million or 10.3%. On the aerospace side of the business, revenue on a year-to-date basis is down $156 million or 4.3%, but earnings are up $16 million or 4% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins. The quarter was also very strong from a cash perspective; free cash flow of $943 million is 128% of net income. Cash flow from operating activities was 151% of net income and had a very solid quarter from an earnings perspective across the board. The year-to-date results give us solid start to the year and enabled us to raise our forecast for the full year which I will share with you at the end of these remarks.\nJason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we generated over $1.1 billion on the strength of the Gulfstream order book and additional collections on our large international Combat Vehicle contract. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow as Phebe noted was $943 million or 128% net earnings conversion. You may recall that for the past several years, our free cash flow has been heavily weighted to the back half of the year, so the strong quarter derisks that profile somewhat and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range. Looking at capital deployment; I mentioned capital expenditures which were $172 million in the quarter or 1.9% of sales, that's down from last year but our full year expectation remains in the range of 2.5% of sales. We also paid $336 million in dividends and spent approximately $600 million on the repurchase of 3.3 million shares; that brings year-to-date repurchases to 7.9 million shares at an average price of just under $173 per share. We have 279.5 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. We repaid $2.5 billion of notes that matured in May, in part with proceeds from $1.5 billion in notes we issued in May. We also issued $2 billion of commercial paper during the quarter to facilitate the repayment of those notes and for liquidity saving purposes, but we expect to fully retire that CP before the end of the year.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you, Jason. Now let me do my best to give you an updated forecast. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I will not repeat. In Aerospace, we expect an additional $200 million of revenue with an operating margin of around 12.4% which is 10 basis point below what we previously forecast; this will result in an additional $10 million of operating earnings. There could be some upside here if we can squeeze out a few more planes in the year. With respect to the defense businesses, Combat Systems should have another $100 million of revenue and add another 10 basis points of operating margin; so total revenue of $7.4 billion and operating margin of around 14.6%. Marine Systems has an additional $300 million and 10 basis points of improved margin, so annual revenue of $10.6 billion with an operating margin around 8.4%. Technology revenue will be down $200 million from our previous forecast but add 30 basis points of operating margin, so annual revenue of $13 billion with an operating margin of around 9.8%. So on a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue of about $39.2 billion and an overall operating margin around 10.6%, this rolls up to EPS around $11.50, $0.45 to $0.50 better than our forecast going into the year.\nHoward Rubel: Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.\nOperator: Absolutely, sir.  Today's first question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Hi, yes. Good morning, Phebe and Jason.\nPhebe Novakovic: Hi, Peter.\nPeter Arment: Nice results. Phebe, maybe just to start with Combat and my follow-up will be related to that. Just -- maybe, could you just talk about, I think there is really strong performance that you're seeing, but also, we're seeing a lot of activity in the international market that -- for some of your key platforms. Just how you think about Combat growing in what is a domestically flatter budget environment but based on how you're doing in terms of a lot of your works ? Thanks.\nPhebe Novakovic: So domestically both of our large platform programs, and Stryker and Abrams are continuing to grow, particularly Stryker, as the army assigns new missions and capabilities to that platform. There are also, as you all know, a number of developmental programs that factor into our longer-term thinking. Externally, outside the United States, demand is increasing, primarily driven by Europe. And again, that is focused and centered on our Combat vehicles, both -- both of our wheeled vehicles, as well as our track vehicles, most specifically, the Abrams main battle tank.\nPeter Arment: And just as a follow-up. Just as you talked about, I guess, some of that activity , have you -- do you expect that the discussions around recent comments around Poland, will that would be closing this year potentially?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, you know, Poland's been a very dangerous neighborhood. And I think there is no stronger deterrent than the Abrams main battle tank. I think press reports have suggested that they want 250 tanks for working very closely with the U.S. government to ensure we meet whatever ultimately United States and Poland determine that they want. I think our initial estimate to close is probably good solid year plus out; but again, more to be -- more to come, and then we'll keep you informed as that program unfolds.\nPeter Arment: Appreciate it. Thanks a lot for the color.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much, and good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Hi, Seth.\nSeth Seifman: Hi. I wanted to follow up on something you mentioned in the remarks, Phebe, about what needs to be done on the engine for the G700. And I wonder if you could tell us specifically what milestones we should be looking for? And what risks that the engine poses to the schedule for the program?\nPhebe Novakovic: So as I noted, we continue to make progress on both, the airplane and the engine development; but as I'm sure you know being a student of new engine development programs, they are always difficult to get through certification, and while there is no particular issue at the time, we still have a ways to go with respect to that certification process. But at the moment, we don't have any particular issues that would impact our overall estimation of timing.\nSeth Seifman: Okay, great. Thanks very much. And then, just as a follow-up. There's been a lot of discussion in the press about the AJAX program; how that's going and that it doesn't really seem to be having too much of a negative impact on the segment's financial results but -- the way that it's playing into financial performance of Combat?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, our U.K. customer is constructively and actively engaged in this program, and we're working very closely with them on two issues that were identified during customer test; one is noise and one is vibration. And given our long decade-long history of Combat vehicles design and production, you know, interestingly enough, this is a transformational vehicle for the U.K. army, and with many transformational programs it has emerged during the testing process. So, we will then are dealing with both of those issues quite closely with our U.K. government customer.\nSeth Seifman: Hey, great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Next is Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Hi, Phebe and Jason. Phebe, can you provide more color on the type of our profile at Gulfstream or the demands from corporate or individual of U.S. versus international?\nPhebe Novakovic: Sure. All in all we see a reasonable balance across the broad cross section of buyers. The U.S. had a particularly strong quarter, generating more of this quarter's orders, some of the new customers and a broadening of the market and importantly, our core Fortune 500 customers have re-engaged. So in all that the markets we are looking at the moment is robust.\nKristine Liwag: Thanks. And my follow-up is on pricing. Since there doesn't seem to be too many used jets in inventory, are you getting more pricing power for new orders?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, let's just say as a matter, of course, we never talk about pricing. So, I am not about to break my discipline, but let me let me give you a little context here. Gulfstream has always been extremely disciplined about its pricing and that long history of disciplined control around pricing will continue. Price is precious and once you on rely on your discipline around pricing, it's a long way back up the hill.\nKristine Liwag: Great. Thank you, Phebe.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please, go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nRobert Stallard: Phebe, just a follow-up on that topic and the strength of the demand environment in the order intake at aerospace. At what point would you feel comfortable raising business jet production?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, we're increasing our business jet Gulfstream production rates throughout the remainder of this year. We've got 71 deliveries to go and we will, as you well know, set production for next year, in the fall of this year and then report fully to you on those production levels in next year.\nRobert Stallard: Okay. And just a follow-up on the pricing issue. Are you seeing -- you might call maybe irrational -- on the new pricing front?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, that's your word, not mine. Hey look, we tend not to -- first of all we don't compete on price most importantly and I never comment on other people's behavior. That's a wise injudicious  stance to adhere to.\nRobert Stallard: Okay, fair enough. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please, go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi, good morning and thank you for the time, Phebe, Jason and Howard. Maybe, on mission. If we could just talk about what's going on there for a second. I appreciate the divestiture in the semiconductor chip issue, but it seems like it was flat year-over-year organically and then the book-to-bill is slightly below one. So, maybe Phebe, can you talk about what the drivers in that business are and what you're seeing?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, I think you need to look -- as you well noted, our divestiture of our SATCOM business. But I believe absent that and given the chip issue that we and others have had and that we are working assiduously to address, we have seen some growth and we anticipate some additional growth going forward. But it will be best measured.\nJason Aiken: And I think to add on to Phebe's point, assuming that business can overcome some of the supply chain issues that they've seen, which at this point they're getting good signals, that they'll be able to do in the second half. We ought to see some modest organic growth out of that business for the full year.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. And then maybe just one on Combat, that was also a really good quarter there and the first half is up, I think, 7%. It implies a deceleration into the second half. What's may be falling off there?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, I think it's a only slightly in percentage terms. We think we had originally guided to an increase burst what  impetus behind growth in the first half will repeat in the second half and that's logic and vehicle production deliveries in both the United States and outside the United States.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, thank you so much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes, Phebe. Could you commented on what services did in the quarter? I imagine it was up and what you expect for the rest of the year?\nPhebe Novakovic: You mean in aerospace services?\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes in Gulfstream.\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes, well, our services include both jet aviation services as well as Gulfstream. So, we saw some nice order, nice recovery in the United States, but here in Middle East  and Asia recovering a little more slowly. So, I think we had anticipated about $0.5 billion increase in revenue. I think that is a bridge too far in the moment and I think we're looking more along the lines of...\nJason Aiken: Call it $375-ish million for the year at this point.\nPhebe Novakovic: So, not tremendously off our original estimate, but as I said, it's the international recovery. That's been just a touch slower than we anticipated, but the U.S. has been very, very strong. Jason?\nJason Aiken: And George, on to that point, I think it's driven a nice rebound this year, I think to the tune of around 25% growth over last year and importantly, I think that some people are watching the levels we've seen through the first half of this year or within, call it 95-ish percent of where we were at this time in 2019. So, I think that's a good initial indication of the strength of the recovery in that business here in 2021.\nGeorge Shapiro: Okay. I'll stick with my one. Thank you.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thanks, George.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please, go ahead.\nDoug Harned: Good morning. Thank you.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nDoug Harned: I wanted to go back to Gulfstream because when you talk about the demand where it's obviously very good, you talked a little bit about where they're coming from. But can you give us a sense of the psychology of your customers? By that I mean, are you seeing these orders come in really as kind of pent up demand that's been slowed recently? Or are you seeing people actually think about the use of business jets differently coming out of ?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, we have no evidence that there has been any fundamental shift in thinking about the use of business aviation, I think that it would be way, way, too premature to get real clarity about that. You're kind of getting a question that we've received a number of times and that goes to kind of, is there a structural change as a result of this pandemic in business aviation? And if you think critically about change, what we know is that structural change is almost never apparent prospectively. It almost always is apparent retrospectively. And so, I believe that it is premature to assume any pronouncements about structural change. Now that said, we've seen our customers are the same kinds of customers that we've had historically back in -- I think there was some slowing obviously. There was some slowing of demand last year and a number of our customers, particularly in the Fortune 500 are on their aircraft replacement cycle. That remains unchanged. We did see some new entrants into the market as some industries have expanded in the COVID environment, creating opportunities for those companies. But yes, I think psychology is an interesting word, but I think I've gotten to the essence of your question.\nDoug Harned: And a little bit related to that, you described the unit book-to-bill is higher than the revenue book-to-bill. Have you seeing a mixed shift towards a smaller aircraft and what do you see driving that difference in unit versus revenue book-to-bill right now?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, we have not seen a movement particularly into the smaller jets. I think the 280 was maybe about less than that 20% of the order book and really, it's demand for both the in-service airplanes, the 500, 600, 650 and of course in 700. So, really a strong demand pull across all of our airplanes. I don't think there's anything in particular discern from that. These are our regular customers back buying to replace the airplanes in the missions that they need and they have and the airplanes that they buy, then with each one of those missions since the way we think about it.\nDoug Harned: Okay, very good. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from David Strauss with Barclays. Please, go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nDavid Strauss: Phebe, on Gulfstream production, just to kind of level set us, you talked about it coming down  in COVID. Are you taking Gulfstream -- I guess just looking at holistically on the large cabin side and adjusting for the G550. Are you taking large-cabin production back to where we were prior to all this or above that?\nPhebe Novakovic: Follow-up, we are increasing on a reasonable basis. Our production of all of our existing now airplanes and we are not back at the 2019 production levels, but to-go basis we're looking at second half orders of 71 and so that in it of itself suggests that we've got solid production I will tell you and that production plan contemplates increased production in each and every one of our in-service large-cabin fleet.\nDavid Strauss: Okay, all right. And Jason, quick follow-up. Just given the strength of Gulfstream order activity and advances you're seeing there, could you be looking at closer to kind of 100% or maybe even a little bit above that free cash flow conversion this year?\nJason Aiken: Yes, I think, David, as I alluded to in the remarks, I think the way to think about the strength of the first half and the strength of the activity at Gulfstream is it somewhat derisks the profile for the second half and getting to that 95% to 100% range. You'll recall over the past several years, we've had a pretty steep slope in the second half on our free cash flow generation with frankly at times most, if not all, of our free cash flow for the year coming in the second half is not even most in the fourth quarter. So, that's not anything I would put together by design and I'm really encouraged by the shift in that slope that we've seen this year. So, it does give us, I think even reinforced confidence to getting to that 95% to 100% range. I think if you think about that range as a percentage of net income and combine that with Phebe's guidance on increasing net income, you can imply increasing free cash flow to support that number. And frankly, if I'm going to lean a little forward, I think it could possibly put us towards the top into that range of the 95% to 100% range. I don't know, but I'd want to get out above 100% this year. I think we still look to next year and beyond to be nicely above 100%, but bottom line, I think this reinforces improvement in overall free cash flow and maybe pushes us up towards the higher end of that 95% to 100% range.\nDavid Strauss: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Please, go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, you talked about the 12.4% margins in aerospace and obviously in the first half, you're slightly under that, but the first quarter included a charge in the second quarter, I'm sure had production inefficiencies because of the manufacturing being close point. So I'm just curious, it would look like there is more upside in the second half, barring some pickup in in R&D or other expenses. Is that an area of conservatism that we should be ?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, when we think about the second half margins, they will be better than our first half margins -- our first half margins were at low point. But we will see some negative impact from two factors. One is the absence of the 550  deliveries as that airplane is now out of service and a higher R&D as we move toward G700 certification.\nMyles Walton: Okay, all right. And then, maybe just give us some color if you can, if you want to on the first availability of delivery slots, particularly on the 500, 600 at this point?\nPhebe Novakovic: We got out of the practice of doing that because it became a lot less meaningless with new airplane deliveries -- with new airplanes. So, we're not going to, I think, reinstitute that.\nMyles Walton: You can't go back to there?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes, go back to there, but I think if you think about the environment that we're looking at now and we think we've been very clear and consistent about this -- starting really, it was in mid-February, we saw an increase in demand and it was consistent and steady throughout that first quarter that led to the order quarter you saw this quarter and second quarter. And then, as we look at both the pipeline and the market, at the moment, it is robust. So, we're seeing a return as I said, of our Fortune 500 customers, as well as new entrants and North America is quite strong. So all in all, I think we're looking at about a pretty good market.\nMyles Walton: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Matt Akers, Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead.\nMatt Akers: Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. A couple on the IT business. I guess, anything in particularly you can point to that kind of drove the strength this quarter either by customer or product? And then I think you said you were seeing some delayed awards. Is that the comment, sort of the protest that you mentioned or is that kind of a broader statement about the market? Anything you can elaborate on there.\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes, sure. So, our growth in the quarter with shield across many of our 7,000 contracts, but notably proportionately a bit more from our new contract awards. So, contract awards for new work, I think which is significant, we have seen a delay in contract awards from two fundamental factors. One, there has been an increase and elongation in the customer decision cycle; and two, we've seen an increase propensity of many in the IT industry to protest repeatedly. Early and often seems to be the mantra. So, both of those have increased our expectations for when we can see that growth coming, but I think I mentioned that we've got about $34 billion already in customer hands awaiting some sort of decision and we've got about $20 billion in the pipeline. So, all of that drives growth. It's just given this elongated cycle and given this increased propensity to protest, it's going to make the recognition of that revenue a little bit lumpier.\nMatt Akers: Got it. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi, good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nRobert Spingarn: Phebe, just maybe one on shipbuilding. A little bit strategic, but one of your peers in shipbuilding stated that the future of the Navy is going to be Platform Plus, where shipbuilding platforms will be tailored around capabilities and technologies that are key differentiators. Would you agree with this? I'm not sure it applies to submarines as much surface ships, but would you agree with this and would GD need to make any additional investments either organically or inorganically to position yourself from this?\nPhebe Novakovic: Platform Plus. I'm not sure I can give you any real insightful color around that. I will tell you how we see our ships. Let's talk about the surface combatants first in the DDG . That is an extraordinarily versatile ship that has over the years had multiple instantiation of improvements and remains a very, very agile ship in terms of its ability to upgrade. So, we're already on the block. Our fight free upgrade which gave an additional capability, I suspect that that ship and others like it can be the type of platform that evolves over time to address different kinds of missions. I think that that's pretty much regular order. I don't know that that's a systemic change in the way the Navy has ever looked at it's combatant fleet. With respect to our auxiliary ships, I think that those tend to be , and I'm thinking the oilers, EPS, those tend to be purpose-built ships for a particular mission. And then submarines, submarines remain a pivotal competitive advantage for the United States and what we have historically focused on and will continue to focus on is integrating any new technologies or capabilities up that's submarine. I think it's very important when you're in a complex business like shipbuilding and particularly submarine design and construction, that you focus on the business of designing and building those ship and ensuring that you can successfully integrate any new capabilities that your customer wants, and we have a long history of that and I suspect us to continue that for some time to come.\nHoward Rubel: Raquel , we'll just take one more call, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. And our final question today will come from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please, go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. So GDIT, when do you expect those two protests to be kind of adjudicated? And secondly, you have an above-average exposure to fed civil, which where the funding is strong, Q3 normally is the strongest booking quarter for the sector's book-to-bill quarter. So, give us some color on what we should expect this quarter to the extent?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, Cai, you got a glass to judge . We have very little insight, like none into the timing of protest resolution. That really is up to the reviewing authority. With respective to the federal civilian, I think we've been with many of those customers for 30 years and we have a lot of customer intimacy across several many key federal civilian agencies. And I would imagine that as they receive more funding and the ubiquitousness of IT infrastructure to all of their missions, I would see that is some additional upside and potential for us. When that comes, again, we'll depend on whole series of issues around timing. But you can rest assure that in that pipeline on a going forward basis that we're looking at, we've got some good work in there.\nCai von Rumohr: Great. And so a follow-up on the AJAX; you mentioned you're .\nPhebe Novakovic: So far we've had -- I think we had two issues .\nCai von Rumohr: Okay, two issues. Good point. But I believe it's a fixed price contract and there has been call there that basically you pay for all the state-issue expenses. Do you see that jeopardizing profitability on the contract?\nPhebe Novakovic: We have been able to make any changes here before in a very cost-effective and time-efficient manner to meet the needs of our customers for the testing program. But I do not see at the moment any impact on our EACs, or frankly on our ability to produce this vehicle efficiently. The kinds of changes we're likely to see that we anticipate, typically are cut into the production line. So, I don't see a whole lot of motivations  from a cost or schedule impact from the changes that we can envision resulting from this -- from the resolution that we come to our customer with on these particular issues.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific, thanks so much.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and of course, the highlights presentation, which includes our revised guidance. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you, Raquel. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Thank you as well. We thank you, all, for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. You have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we generated over $1.1 billion on the strength of the Gulfstream order book and additional collections on our large international Combat Vehicle contract. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow as Phebe noted was $943 million or 128% net earnings conversion. You may recall that for the past several years, our free cash flow has been heavily weighted to the back half of the year, so the strong quarter derisks that profile somewhat and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range. Looking at capital deployment; I mentioned capital expenditures which were $172 million in the quarter or 1.9% of sales, that's down from last year but our full year expectation remains in the range of 2.5% of sales. We also paid $336 million in dividends and spent approximately $600 million on the repurchase of 3.3 million shares; that brings year-to-date repurchases to 7.9 million shares at an average price of just under $173 per share. We have 279.5 million shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. We repaid $2.5 billion of notes that matured in May, in part with proceeds from $1.5 billion in notes we issued in May. We also issued $2 billion of commercial paper during the quarter to facilitate the repayment of those notes and for liquidity saving purposes, but we expect to fully retire that CP before the end of the year. And I think to add on to Phebe's point, assuming that business can overcome some of the supply chain issues that they've seen, which at this point they're getting good signals, that they'll be able to do in the second half. We ought to see some modest organic growth out of that business for the full year. Call it $375-ish million for the year at this point. And George, on to that point, I think it's driven a nice rebound this year, I think to the tune of around 25% growth over last year and importantly, I think that some people are watching the levels we've seen through the first half of this year or within, call it 95-ish percent of where we were at this time in 2019. So, I think that's a good initial indication of the strength of the recovery in that business here in 2021. Yes, I think, David, as I alluded to in the remarks, I think the way to think about the strength of the first half and the strength of the activity at Gulfstream is it somewhat derisks the profile for the second half and getting to that 95% to 100% range. You'll recall over the past several years, we've had a pretty steep slope in the second half on our free cash flow generation with frankly at times most, if not all, of our free cash flow for the year coming in the second half is not even most in the fourth quarter.

            "name": "Phebe Novakovic",
            "content": "Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Early this morning, we have reported earnings of $2.61 per diluted share on revenue of $9.2 billion, operating earnings of $959 million, and net income of $737 million. Revenue was essentially flat against the second quarter last year but operating earnings are up $125 million and net earnings are up $112 million, earnings per share are up $0.43. To be a little more granular, revenue on the defense side of the business is up against last year's second quarter by $308 million or 4.2%. Aerospace is down $352 million, pretty much as planned. Operating earnings on the defense side are up $98 million or 14.3%, and operating earnings in aerospace are up $36 million on a 390 basis point improvement in operating margin. The operating margin for the entire company was 10.4%, 140 basis points better than the year ago quarter. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.07 per share on somewhat lower revenue than anticipated by the sell side. However, operating margin is 20 basis points lower than anticipated coupled with a somewhat lower share count, this led to the earnings feed. On a year-to-date basis, revenue is up $596 million or 3.3% and operating earnings are up $129 million or 7.3%. Overall margins are up 40 basis points. The defense numbers are particularly good with revenue up $752 million or 5.2%, and operating earnings up $143 million or 10.3%. On the aerospace side of the business, revenue on a year-to-date basis is down $156 million or 4.3%, but earnings are up $16 million or 4% on a 90 basis point improvement in operating margins. The quarter was also very strong from a cash perspective; free cash flow of $943 million is 128% of net income. Cash flow from operating activities was 151% of net income and had a very solid quarter from an earnings perspective across the board. The year-to-date results give us solid start to the year and enabled us to raise our forecast for the full year which I will share with you at the end of these remarks. Thank you, Jason. Now let me do my best to give you an updated forecast. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I will not repeat. In Aerospace, we expect an additional $200 million of revenue with an operating margin of around 12.4% which is 10 basis point below what we previously forecast; this will result in an additional $10 million of operating earnings. There could be some upside here if we can squeeze out a few more planes in the year. With respect to the defense businesses, Combat Systems should have another $100 million of revenue and add another 10 basis points of operating margin; so total revenue of $7.4 billion and operating margin of around 14.6%. Marine Systems has an additional $300 million and 10 basis points of improved margin, so annual revenue of $10.6 billion with an operating margin around 8.4%. Technology revenue will be down $200 million from our previous forecast but add 30 basis points of operating margin, so annual revenue of $13 billion with an operating margin of around 9.8%. So on a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue of about $39.2 billion and an overall operating margin around 10.6%, this rolls up to EPS around $11.50, $0.45 to $0.50 better than our forecast going into the year. Hi, Peter. So domestically both of our large platform programs, and Stryker and Abrams are continuing to grow, particularly Stryker, as the army assigns new missions and capabilities to that platform. There are also, as you all know, a number of developmental programs that factor into our longer-term thinking. Externally, outside the United States, demand is increasing, primarily driven by Europe. And again, that is focused and centered on our Combat vehicles, both -- both of our wheeled vehicles, as well as our track vehicles, most specifically, the Abrams main battle tank. So, you know, Poland's been a very dangerous neighborhood. And I think there is no stronger deterrent than the Abrams main battle tank. I think press reports have suggested that they want 250 tanks for working very closely with the U.S. government to ensure we meet whatever ultimately United States and Poland determine that they want. I think our initial estimate to close is probably good solid year plus out; but again, more to be -- more to come, and then we'll keep you informed as that program unfolds. Hi, Seth. So as I noted, we continue to make progress on both, the airplane and the engine development; but as I'm sure you know being a student of new engine development programs, they are always difficult to get through certification, and while there is no particular issue at the time, we still have a ways to go with respect to that certification process. But at the moment, we don't have any particular issues that would impact our overall estimation of timing. So, our U.K. customer is constructively and actively engaged in this program, and we're working very closely with them on two issues that were identified during customer test; one is noise and one is vibration. And given our long decade-long history of Combat vehicles design and production, you know, interestingly enough, this is a transformational vehicle for the U.K. army, and with many transformational programs it has emerged during the testing process. So, we will then are dealing with both of those issues quite closely with our U.K. government customer. Sure. All in all we see a reasonable balance across the broad cross section of buyers. The U.S. had a particularly strong quarter, generating more of this quarter's orders, some of the new customers and a broadening of the market and importantly, our core Fortune 500 customers have re-engaged. So in all that the markets we are looking at the moment is robust. Well, let's just say as a matter, of course, we never talk about pricing. So, I am not about to break my discipline, but let me let me give you a little context here. Gulfstream has always been extremely disciplined about its pricing and that long history of disciplined control around pricing will continue. Price is precious and once you on rely on your discipline around pricing, it's a long way back up the hill. Good morning. Well, we're increasing our business jet Gulfstream production rates throughout the remainder of this year. We've got 71 deliveries to go and we will, as you well know, set production for next year, in the fall of this year and then report fully to you on those production levels in next year. Well, that's your word, not mine. Hey look, we tend not to -- first of all we don't compete on price most importantly and I never comment on other people's behavior. That's a wise injudicious  stance to adhere to. Well, I think you need to look -- as you well noted, our divestiture of our SATCOM business. But I believe absent that and given the chip issue that we and others have had and that we are working assiduously to address, we have seen some growth and we anticipate some additional growth going forward. But it will be best measured. Well, I think it's a only slightly in percentage terms. We think we had originally guided to an increase burst what  impetus behind growth in the first half will repeat in the second half and that's logic and vehicle production deliveries in both the United States and outside the United States. You mean in aerospace services? Yes, well, our services include both jet aviation services as well as Gulfstream. So, we saw some nice order, nice recovery in the United States, but here in Middle East  and Asia recovering a little more slowly. So, I think we had anticipated about $0.5 billion increase in revenue. I think that is a bridge too far in the moment and I think we're looking more along the lines of... So, not tremendously off our original estimate, but as I said, it's the international recovery. That's been just a touch slower than we anticipated, but the U.S. has been very, very strong. Jason? Thanks, George. Good morning. So, we have no evidence that there has been any fundamental shift in thinking about the use of business aviation, I think that it would be way, way, too premature to get real clarity about that. You're kind of getting a question that we've received a number of times and that goes to kind of, is there a structural change as a result of this pandemic in business aviation? And if you think critically about change, what we know is that structural change is almost never apparent prospectively. It almost always is apparent retrospectively. And so, I believe that it is premature to assume any pronouncements about structural change. Now that said, we've seen our customers are the same kinds of customers that we've had historically back in -- I think there was some slowing obviously. There was some slowing of demand last year and a number of our customers, particularly in the Fortune 500 are on their aircraft replacement cycle. That remains unchanged. We did see some new entrants into the market as some industries have expanded in the COVID environment, creating opportunities for those companies. But yes, I think psychology is an interesting word, but I think I've gotten to the essence of your question. Well, we have not seen a movement particularly into the smaller jets. I think the 280 was maybe about less than that 20% of the order book and really, it's demand for both the in-service airplanes, the 500, 600, 650 and of course in 700. So, really a strong demand pull across all of our airplanes. I don't think there's anything in particular discern from that. These are our regular customers back buying to replace the airplanes in the missions that they need and they have and the airplanes that they buy, then with each one of those missions since the way we think about it. Good morning. Follow-up, we are increasing on a reasonable basis. Our production of all of our existing now airplanes and we are not back at the 2019 production levels, but to-go basis we're looking at second half orders of 71 and so that in it of itself suggests that we've got solid production I will tell you and that production plan contemplates increased production in each and every one of our in-service large-cabin fleet. So, when we think about the second half margins, they will be better than our first half margins -- our first half margins were at low point. But we will see some negative impact from two factors. One is the absence of the 550  deliveries as that airplane is now out of service and a higher R&D as we move toward G700 certification. We got out of the practice of doing that because it became a lot less meaningless with new airplane deliveries -- with new airplanes. So, we're not going to, I think, reinstitute that. Yes, go back to there, but I think if you think about the environment that we're looking at now and we think we've been very clear and consistent about this -- starting really, it was in mid-February, we saw an increase in demand and it was consistent and steady throughout that first quarter that led to the order quarter you saw this quarter and second quarter. And then, as we look at both the pipeline and the market, at the moment, it is robust. So, we're seeing a return as I said, of our Fortune 500 customers, as well as new entrants and North America is quite strong. So all in all, I think we're looking at about a pretty good market. Yes, sure. So, our growth in the quarter with shield across many of our 7,000 contracts, but notably proportionately a bit more from our new contract awards. So, contract awards for new work, I think which is significant, we have seen a delay in contract awards from two fundamental factors. One, there has been an increase and elongation in the customer decision cycle; and two, we've seen an increase propensity of many in the IT industry to protest repeatedly. Early and often seems to be the mantra. So, both of those have increased our expectations for when we can see that growth coming, but I think I mentioned that we've got about $34 billion already in customer hands awaiting some sort of decision and we've got about $20 billion in the pipeline. So, all of that drives growth. It's just given this elongated cycle and given this increased propensity to protest, it's going to make the recognition of that revenue a little bit lumpier. Good morning. Platform Plus. I'm not sure I can give you any real insightful color around that. I will tell you how we see our ships. Let's talk about the surface combatants first in the DDG . That is an extraordinarily versatile ship that has over the years had multiple instantiation of improvements and remains a very, very agile ship in terms of its ability to upgrade. So, we're already on the block. Our fight free upgrade which gave an additional capability, I suspect that that ship and others like it can be the type of platform that evolves over time to address different kinds of missions. I think that that's pretty much regular order. I don't know that that's a systemic change in the way the Navy has ever looked at it's combatant fleet. With respect to our auxiliary ships, I think that those tend to be , and I'm thinking the oilers, EPS, those tend to be purpose-built ships for a particular mission. And then submarines, submarines remain a pivotal competitive advantage for the United States and what we have historically focused on and will continue to focus on is integrating any new technologies or capabilities up that's submarine. I think it's very important when you're in a complex business like shipbuilding and particularly submarine design and construction, that you focus on the business of designing and building those ship and ensuring that you can successfully integrate any new capabilities that your customer wants, and we have a long history of that and I suspect us to continue that for some time to come. So, Cai, you got a glass to judge . We have very little insight, like none into the timing of protest resolution. That really is up to the reviewing authority. With respective to the federal civilian, I think we've been with many of those customers for 30 years and we have a lot of customer intimacy across several many key federal civilian agencies. And I would imagine that as they receive more funding and the ubiquitousness of IT infrastructure to all of their missions, I would see that is some additional upside and potential for us. When that comes, again, we'll depend on whole series of issues around timing. But you can rest assure that in that pipeline on a going forward basis that we're looking at, we've got some good work in there. So far we've had -- I think we had two issues . We have been able to make any changes here before in a very cost-effective and time-efficient manner to meet the needs of our customers for the testing program. But I do not see at the moment any impact on our EACs, or frankly on our ability to produce this vehicle efficiently. The kinds of changes we're likely to see that we anticipate, typically are cut into the production line. So, I don't see a whole lot of motivations  from a cost or schedule impact from the changes that we can envision resulting from this -- from the resolution that we come to our customer with on these particular issues."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning everyone, and welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics first quarter 2021 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.48 per diluted share on revenue of $9.4 billion, operating earnings of $938 million and net income of $708 million. Revenue is up $640 million or 7.3% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $4 million and net earnings are up $2 million. To be a little more granular, revenue on the Defense side of the business is up against last year's first quarter by $444 million and Aerospace is up $196 million. The operating earnings on the Defense side are up $45 million or 6.4%, while operating earnings in the Aerospace side are down $20 million, but still nicely above consensus. I'll have more to say about this A bit later. The operating margin for the entire company was 10%, 70 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was driven by a 250 basis point lower margin rated Aerospace, as was fully anticipated in our guidance to you, combined with $21 million more in corporate operating expense. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.18 per share. We have roughly $500 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and have 50 more operating earnings. So, it's a pure operations beat. I must confess that we were also beat our own expectations rather handsomely. This is in almost all respects a very solid quarter. It's hard to find something not to like about it. It's a very good start to the year. So, let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason at color around cash, backlog, taxes, and deployment of cash. And then we'll answer your questions. First, Aerospace. Aerospace enjoyed revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $220 million, with an 11.7% operating margin. Revenue is almost $200 million higher than anticipated by us and the sell side. Revenue is also $196 million higher than the year ago quarter. The difference is almost exclusively more G500 and G600 deliveries than the year ago quarter. The 11.7% operating margin is lower than the year ago quarter, but consistent with our guidance and sell side expectations. Finally, we took some mark-to-market charges with respect to our G500 test inventories. Without the charge from a pure operating perspective, performance in the quarter was superb. Aerospace also had a very strong quarter from an orders perspective with the book-to-bill of 1.3 to one. Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.34 to one. In unit terms, this is the strongest order quarter for the last two years, excluding the fourth quarter of 2019 when we launched the G700.\nJason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we essentially broke even for the quarter. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was negative $131 million. For those of you who followed us for some time, you know we've been a fairly significant user of cash in the first quarter for the past several years. This quarter was a marked improvement from that pattern due in large part to the strong order activity at Gulfstream and ongoing progress payments on our large international Combat Systems program, consistent with the contract amendment Phebe referenced earlier. So, the quarter was nicely ahead of our expectations and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range. Looking at capital deployment. I mentioned capital expenditures, which were $134 million in the quarter or 1.4% of sales. That's down between 25% and 30% from the first quarter a year ago, but we're still expecting full year CapEx to be roughly 2.5% of sales. We also paid $315 million in dividends and increase the quarterly dividend by a little more than 8% to $1.19 per share. And we spent nearly $750 million on the repurchase of 4.6 million shares at an average price of just over $161 per share. After all this, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion and a net debt position of $11.4 billion, down $1.3 billion from this time last year. Net interest expense in the quarter was $123 million, up from $107 million in the first quarter of 2020. The increase in 2021 is due to the incremental debt issued last year in conjunction with the refinancing of maturing notes. We have $3 billion of outstanding debt maturing later this year, and we plan to refinance a portion of those notes to achieve a more balanced deployment of capital. But this will still result in a declining debt balance this year and beyond. During the quarter, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act. As you may be aware, it contains two provisions that affect our business. First, it extended the provision of the CARES Act that allows reimbursement of contractor payments to workers who were prevented from working due to COVID-related facility closures. This will continue to benefit our technologies business, although it does not provide for fee on those costs. So that will have an ongoing diluted impact on the segments margins.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you, Jason. As a reminder, we asked participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question today comes from Jon Raviv from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nJonathan Raviv: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks. Thanks for the opportunity to hear. Question on actually on GDIT. The staffing , you guys had talked about 7% growth this year. You did 5% of the first quarter, so definitely a good start. So, any kind of milestones to look upon there. And then just overall commentary on the environment. We've heard of some delays and slowness in awards. Some other contractors have been highlighting, some disruptions that impact the organic growth. So, any view as to how that's impacting your 2021 and how that could flow out over 2022, some of these new businesses -- using awards come through.\nPhebe Novakovic: So, as I noted, we submitted a very large number of proposals in the quarter, and we are waiting over $30 billion in customer\u2019s decisions on contracts. And COVID, obviously, had some impact on those -- that decision-making process. But we suspect that as -- we expect that as the government gets back to full operating cadence that we will begin to work through some of that backlog on the order decisions.\nJonathan Raviv: And then as -- thank you, Phebe. As a brief follow-up, again, sticking to the technology and maybe also like key market. When you look at this huge -- almost backlog of things to be adjudicate, you mentioned that a lot of it is new business. Would you consider a lot of this new business to be takeaways from other contractors, or is this some that element of whites-pace almost with the government creating and doing more things that are contractor addressable?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, I think, it's a combination. I think, we're winning more than our fair share, number one. Number two, the government is combining a number of preexisting current workload in the larger contracts given that the scale and magnitude of the effort that's required again is a good thing for us to bid on those large contracts. And then, some of it is just pure program programming. So, I think that's pretty much how we see that market unfolding.\nJonathan Raviv: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Hi, Seth.\nSeth Seifman: I was wondering if you could -- I think you mentioned some inventory right downs on G500, I was wondering if you could quantify that. Just so we could have a cleaner look at the Aerospace margin.\nPhebe Novakovic: Yeah. So, we're not in the habit of giving detailed product by product margin. We did have a mark-to-market on some of our test airplanes, on the 500 test airplanes, which is pretty much to be expected with test airplanes. But we see that as largely behind us. So, I noted that just to tell -- to give you awesome color that absent that we would have seen even better operating performance.\nSeth Seifman: Right. I guess maybe without quantifying it, is there -- is it possible to talk a little bit about the -- I guess the trajectory of margins at Aerospace, when we should expect through the year and sort of as we go into Q2?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, we expect, as I noted, deliveries to be lower in Q2, margins to be compressed in Q2, but increasing nicely then quarter-over-quarter, as we go through Q3 and into Q4. But recall, we admitted before that we see 2021 as our lower margin year for all the reasons that we noted, not the least of which is we took about 10 airplanes, largely as -- on our production last year largely as a result of the -- ended the 550 production and some mid-cabin. So, when the demand begins to increase or increasingly picks up and we ought to see some return to what we had considered our normal production rate and hence delivery rate. So, that'll drive margin.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. Thanks.\nPhebe Novakovic: By the way, when you think about margin, particularly out the impact of the entry into service of the 700.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. Good quarter, Phebe.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you, Cai.\nCai von Rumohr: So, could you give us some more on demand at Gulfstream? You basically said it's broadly based. But first, what are we looking at in terms of corporate demand, which we've heard is still weak and ultra high net worth, which we've heard is very strong. And any color on specific models. Like I think you said you had 70 orders for the G700, are those -- is that number moving up at a decent pace?\nPhebe Novakovic:\nindoor 22:46: So, look, if you think about demand, as we see the lifting of the international travel restrictions and removal of quarantine restrictions and the increased confidence of obviously the U.S. economy, but also global economies, we expect to see demand continue to increase and should it, we see Gulfstream as being in very good stead.\nCai von Rumohr: So, you mentioned demand getting better. And we know that pre-owned prices are continuing to come down and we have the weird situation where all of this happening, while international routes are not opening up. Given the strength in demand, if you wanted, or if the demand were there to sort of deliver more planes, how long would it take you to kind of uptick your production rate so that we can see those deliveries moving up?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, on average, it takes about six months lead time. But we're -- looking at just a few more production airplanes, as I noted in my remarks, and we'll continue to adjust and be sufficiently agile as we see demand continue to increase. So I liked how we balanced ourselves right now. Prudent, yet forward looking and we are pretty efficient when it comes to that to ramping up. But it does take the lead time of about two quarters.\nCai von Rumohr: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning, David.\nDavid Strauss: Phebe, want to follow-up on some of your earlier comments around the margin in Gulfstream. So, over time we got used to this being a mid to high teens business. Is that still the right way to think about this business going forward, particularly when the 700 comes in? And do you expect the 700 to be margin accretive when it starts to deliver?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, the 700 will be margin accretive when we begin deliveries. We think about this on -- given our portfolio and our place in the firmament as a mid-teen margin business for the short-term. But as you can imagine, we'll continue to work margins. And as we've talked about many times before our margins at Gulfstream are a whole host -- driven by a whole host of issues, not the least of which is service mix, mix of airplanes. And when we were -- a couple of years ago, that was, as you recall, an acceleration of the 650 backlog, which kind of solitary effect of better aligning 650 demand with the backlog. So, there wasn't too much of wait for people. But also helping us transition through that period when we were replacing the 450, 500 -- the 450, 550 with 500 and 600. So that is largely behind us. And we -- as I said, expect to see some nice margin accretion as we go forward.\nDavid Strauss: Great. That's helpful. And do you think -- could you comment a little bit on the moving pieces of capital and what to expect there? Inventories come down a bit, advances, benefit of headwind. So, just -- how we should expect the different pieces within working capital to move from here? Thanks.\nJason Aiken: Sure. You'll recall the major moving pieces that we've talked about, sort of outside the normal run rates for the business, in general, have been the elevated inventory level at Gulfstream as we have invested in the new models between test airplanes and the buildup for production and entry into service. That obviously has been a headwind for several years now. We saw that start to turn at the end of last year, a little bit better than we thought was going to happen, a little earlier than we thought was going to happen. And so we -- that helped us outperform our cash flow expectations for 2020. You can think about that for Gulfstream continuing to normalize this year. We'll start to see the 500s and 600s hit that inflection point and no longer be a headwind. But at the same time, keep in mind, we're building up on the 700 as that program moves toward entry into service. So, that'll become a little more neutral this year and then eventually shifted into a tailwind in the 2022 period and beyond. The other piece is, obviously, the large international program at Combat Systems, which again was a headwind for several years, that turned with the modification to that contract that Phebe discussed earlier into a more neutral event last year. So that stabilized last year and becomes a very modest tailwind this year, and then becomes a more meaningful tailwind in 2022, 2023, and a little bit more in 2024. So, when you think about the way those two pieces are moving, that kind of gets us on a cash flow trajectory from -- if you go back to 2019, we were in the 60%-ish range moving toward an expectation of the 80% range. Last year, we outperformed that a little bit as Gulfstream did a little better. And now we're in the high -- mid to high 90% range. The one piece there that's still sort of keeping us out of the 100% range really is the elevated investment profile in CapEx at Marine Systems. So, once that normalizes, next year, it gets back into the 2% of sales range. You should expect to see us the whole business at large being in the 100% to 100%-plus range, really with those two working capital pieces at Gulfstream and Combat Systems becoming the tailwinds that allow us to get even nicely above a 100%. So, that's kind of the trajectory for all those major moving pieces. Hopefully that gives you a sense of where we're going and the basis for our expectation for the improvement that we see ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nRonald Epstein: Yeah. Good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning, Ron.\nRonald Epstein: How are you? Switching over to the ship business? How is the electric boat adjusting to both having the Virginia Class and the Columbia Class in -- everything that they got to do in terms of workforce, supply chain, so on and so forth, and how's that going?\nPhebe Novakovic: It's going very well, on both ramping up Virginia and equally importantly, more significantly Columbia. There's something important to remember when you think about Columbia. We started work on that program 14 years ago. And in that 14-year-period we have worked assiduously with the Navy to reduce all known potential risks that we could foresee in the ramp up of a very complex new program that -- and that included workforce hiring and training, supply chain readiness, facility readiness, construction prototyping, technology readiness, retiring potential known risks -- the potential risks in new high-end technologies and then the design maturity. That -- this boat entered into construction with a 83% design completion level and break contest to Virginia, which has been an exemplary program at 43%. So all of this prior planning and 14 years of detailed blocking and tackling at every conceivable level has mitigated an awful lot of risk and allowed us to -- for verbally hit the ground running on Columbia, and so far so good. I will know, it\u2019s a very complex program, so you can't declare victory on any ship building program right out of the bat, but we have taken unprecedented and historically unprecedented measures to retire all the known risks going forward. So that has really allowed us to execute coming right out of the gates very strongly. They've done a very good job.\nRonald Epstein: Got it. Got it. Got it. And it seems like the focus on the Pacific's been good for the ship business. How's it been for Gulfstream? I mean, when you think about U.S., China relations, has that had an impact on Gulfstream demand in the region?\nPhebe Novakovic: Not that we can see. So, our demand in Asia has been quite steady and good. We've got nice, large install base, a lot of customer intimacy there. So, today we have not seen it, that particular impact.\nRonald Epstein: Got it. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning, Myles.\nMyles Walton: Heard your thoughts on M&A for a little bit, so I was hoping maybe we could go there. Obviously, you're getting to a point on your leverage, which is getting pretty attractive, building up plenty of firepower. What are you looking at in terms of landscape GDs, always historically been an acquisitive company. Is the appetite growing there?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, we have been through a significant investment period across many of our large lines of business and our focus here is on execution and primary focus. We will -- we always look for potential niche bolt-ons here and there. But we don't see anything on the horizon here of any significant opportunities that would entice us.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And Jason, what's the target ratios that we're aiming for? I know you said you'll refinance some of it, but maybe a little color there.\nJason Aiken: Yeah. I think perhaps less of a target ratio then -- we're going to continue to prioritize our mid A rating. That's always going to be sort of where we seek to land long-term. And so, the key for us right now is we had -- as you're aware of sort of an outsize level of debt maturing this year versus if you look out over the next 10 to 20 years what our debt ladder maturity phasing looks like. And so, really what we're aiming to do is sort of bring that into more of a balanced picture of capital deployment that allows us to step down the debt over time in reasonable measures, as well as have considerable flexibility and firepower available for other deployment opportunities. \nMyles Walton: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, everyone. Thank you.\nPhebe Novakovic: Hi, Sheila.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hey. Phebe, maybe a big picture question for you, because I know Howard always has us covered on the numbers. You've been at GD as the -- over almost a decade now and at the company for 20 years, how do you think about where GD goes over the next decade, whether from a portfolio focus or customer focus as the budget flat lines or where operating leverage comes from that?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, from a strategic perspective, we decided several years ago to invest in a number of our significant lines of business, where we believe that we could realize the best return on invested capital and really drive value. We have been in that period at Gulfstream, GDIT, primarily the Gulfstream, GDIT and the Marine Group. So the key now from my perspective is all about execution. And execution has been the hallmark of everything that we do here, and it is the undergirding of all financial performance. And it requires a discipline across -- it requires discipline across a series of elements and that are faster than all operations. But really, as I see the next several years, it's all about execution and wise deployment of capital to drive nice value creation. Ultimately, long-term value creation is based on good product. It's a perm execution wise investments and smart capital limit. So that's what I see us doing.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global. Please go ahead with your question.\nPete Skibitski: Hey, good morning, Phebe and Jason and Howard.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nPete Skibitski: Phebe, I was wondering -- in Combat, I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of what international orders are out there for you, maybe both kind of sole source expectations as well as competitive opportunities.\nPhebe Novakovic: So, international consists of two items, primarily sales outside the United States from entities outside -- from our business units outside the United States, as well as FMS sales emanating from the United States. And unfortunately, for the state of humankind, the world has become an increasingly dangerous place. And so, we see the reflection of that concern in many of U.S. allies with increased demand for many of our products in Europe, Eastern Europe, a little bit in Asia, parts of the Middle East, and in the former Commonwealth nations and in the U.K. as well. So, we looked for nice, steady demand signals coming from outside the United States for our business units that are domiciled ex-U.S. And FMS, United States has had a long history of providing its allies with FMS opportunities. And we have a number of those in our comp opportunities and our Combat Systems again, selling through the U.S. government to key us allies positions in particularly dangerous. So, we see that nice cadence continuing in terms of our orders.\nPete Skibitski: Okay. And U.S. wise, you expect programs that you're competing for this MPS and all MSP. Do you think they survive any budget tightness?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, new programs are always the most vulnerable. But with MPS, we were -- the only person -- they're only contracted to develop -- I think there were 12 prototypes. We delivered those last year. We liked our offering. We think it's what the army wants. But we are very attuned to army demands and how they see their site. And that's where -- intimacy with the army helps significantly. That plus -- so with all of them at MSP, that program got stretched considerably. So, we are taking it seriously and participating, but there's a long way to go before that comes to fruition. But recall another element and a key element of army modernization is upgrading with key -- with important and innovative new technologies, their existing platforms. And for us that means Stryker and Abrams, and both are undergoing major upgrade programs. So, all-in-all, we see the demand for our programs continuing to go strong. And there is nothing like -- going back to the earlier comments about execution. There's nothing like performing on schedule and on budget to amplify and provide a bit of an antidote to any potential cuts that come in the future. So, Combat is the army's major integrator of Combat Wheeled Systems and will remain such. So that ensures that our place in the firmament remains pretty strong.\nPete Skibitski: Right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.\nPeter Arment: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Phebe, Jason. Phebe, a question on the budgets, I guess just kind of following up on your comments there. Just -- we got the skinny budget from the new administration, and obviously we're to get some -- a lot more details soon. But how are you thinking about just the alignment with the new administration priorities when you think it look at GDs portfolio? Thanks.\nPhebe Novakovic: So, clearly, as I think -- perhaps it was Ron mentioned the demand for products that meet the pacific theater have -- has increased that puts our ship building business, particularly submarines in a very good stead. And you can see all of -- both the rhetoric of funding supporting increased submarine production. And we are executing on the current programs of record and working with the Navy to -- additional submarines can be executed in a relatively short-term. With respect to our Combat Systems Group, unfortunately, but regrettably the case, the hottest theater at the moment is Russia. And so whether we like it or not, that is the reality with which we were faced and this administration has been very quick to respond appropriately to the Russians. And so you see -- we believe that Combat System is highly aligned with that reality that we're now faced with in Europe. So, all-in-all, we liked our positioning with the new administration's priority. Remember, and particularly administration and this president has been an advocate of strong national security throughout his long and distinguished career. U.S. National Security strategy is driven by the threat of the perception of threat that has not changed. So, we will see some changes in relative priority among systems, but in all instances, we see ourselves very well aligned.\nPeter Arment: And just as a quick follow-up. Something that doesn't get talked a lot about, but you have a lot of CyOps  capabilities. Maybe you could just give us a little color on how you see the opportunities there. Thanks.\nPhebe Novakovic: So, if you mean from both cyber, cyber is embedded in all of our business and if you get to -- but I think you referred to CyOps. One would be -- it would be the height of fallen to discuss any of that. But let's just put it this way. We have always been on the leading edge of innovations with respect to cyber and electronic technologies that apply to the real world site in the moment.\nPeter Arment: Appreciate all the color. Thanks, Phebe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Safran from Seaport Global. Please go ahead with your question.\nRichard Safran: Phebe, Jason, Howard, good morning. How are you?\nPhebe Novakovic: Fine.\nRichard Safran: First question I had is, I was interested in the announcement and I think it was back in February where at IT you added Amazon cloud services to the milCloud 2.0. What I wanted to know is, how much does the addition of Amazon enhance your offering? Was this something that just improve the cost on the program, or is this something that maybe opens up new opportunities for expanding cloud service to the government? Just anything you can tell us regarding the size of the opportunity, or what this does, would be appreciated.\nPhebe Novakovic: So, not surprisingly, the U.S. Department of Defense is moving as all major institutions are increasingly to the cloud. And so, our cloud offerings are -- an incrementally important part of our offerings that we believe will ultimately drive increased adoption across our existing contracts and adoption of the technology suite that we offer. And frankly, an expansion of the market. So, cloud presents a significant opportunity, and we are well-positioned to execute on it.\nRichard Safran: Okay. Thanks for that. And then second -- and just to kind of a broad strategic question for you and your comments about execution. Over the past year or so, you've made a number of changes to adjust how you're operating, clearly for obvious reasons. I was just wondering, what are the more permanent changes and how you operate -- and that are going to persist long after COVID? I was just wondering if you discuss how these changes? How you're thinking about that impacting and improving margins.\nPhebe Novakovic: So, let me infer a little bit from the question you're asking. We hear a lot of anecdotal evidence that there may be systemic changes emanating from COVID that have to do with work-at-home and what that might mean for a commercial real estate footprint. We still believe it is too soon to declare any change structural. We do expect to see some -- the extent to which remains to be seen, but some work-from-home either in hybrid capacities, or in some cases more completely.  But I don't see that move as something that is dispositive and determinative of real performance and execution. I think what you saw -- going back to execution through COVID -- and frankly, this company's performance across its business units during COVID was really a manifestation of the discipline that we have in all of our operating -- and our operating performance and our operating leverage. The more disciplined a company is the better they were able to adapt to the vagaries and some of the really significant challenges that COVID provided both to the workforce and frankly, the costumers and the environment. So, I think that, to me, it underscored, amplified our operating excellence. And I suspect that that will continue -- then understanding of that will continue to permeate as we go forward. And we will continue to build on that. Operating excellence is never static. It has to get better and better and better. That's what continuous improvement is all about. And frankly, we have a longstanding discipline of around that. So, I don't think there'll be a structural change in our operating performance, but it's simply undergirds the importance of that discipline that focuses on performance.\nRichard Safran: Excellent color. Thanks.\nHoward Rubel: And Jamie, we will have time for just one last question, please.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks very much. Good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Morning. \nRobert Stallard: Phebe, just a couple of quick ones on the Aerospace division. Clearly, a very strong first quarter here. But I was wondering if you had seen any demand pulled forwards into the first quarter from the second quarter. And then secondly, you talked this before. How is the lead time for aircraft looking at? Are we still looking at roughly 12 months between an order and a delivery? And also how has pricing fed in the first quarter? Thank you.\nPhebe Novakovic: So, think of that demand, less about pull forward, demand comes when it comes and you execute it as it arrives on your doorstep. So, what we saw with respect to demand is starting -- as I noted in mid February, we start -- and we saw a nice steady increase in demand across a broad specter of our customer base and the U.S. Our initial estimates show or indications are that that demand is carrying through into the second quarter. Pricing is holding up very well. As you all know, we are very disciplined about our pricing. It is precious once lost. You don\u2019t get it back. We\u2019ve had a hard slog. So, pricing has done very well. And as I noted earlier, it\u2019s about six months to ramp up additional production and I don\u2019t see that interim significantly changing anytime soon, given all of the elements that have to perform. So, I hope that answers your question.\nRobert Stallard: Yeah. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nHoward Rubel: Operator, this now ends our call. Thank you very much everybody for your time. And I will be available to answer your questions, and I can be reached in my office. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that we'll conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Thank you, Phebe and good morning. I'll start with our cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we essentially broke even for the quarter. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was negative $131 million. For those of you who followed us for some time, you know we've been a fairly significant user of cash in the first quarter for the past several years. This quarter was a marked improvement from that pattern due in large part to the strong order activity at Gulfstream and ongoing progress payments on our large international Combat Systems program, consistent with the contract amendment Phebe referenced earlier. So, the quarter was nicely ahead of our expectations and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95% to 100% range. Looking at capital deployment. I mentioned capital expenditures, which were $134 million in the quarter or 1.4% of sales. That's down between 25% and 30% from the first quarter a year ago, but we're still expecting full year CapEx to be roughly 2.5% of sales. We also paid $315 million in dividends and increase the quarterly dividend by a little more than 8% to $1.19 per share. And we spent nearly $750 million on the repurchase of 4.6 million shares at an average price of just over $161 per share. After all this, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $1.8 billion and a net debt position of $11.4 billion, down $1.3 billion from this time last year. Net interest expense in the quarter was $123 million, up from $107 million in the first quarter of 2020. The increase in 2021 is due to the incremental debt issued last year in conjunction with the refinancing of maturing notes. We have $3 billion of outstanding debt maturing later this year, and we plan to refinance a portion of those notes to achieve a more balanced deployment of capital. But this will still result in a declining debt balance this year and beyond. During the quarter, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act. As you may be aware, it contains two provisions that affect our business. First, it extended the provision of the CARES Act that allows reimbursement of contractor payments to workers who were prevented from working due to COVID-related facility closures. This will continue to benefit our technologies business, although it does not provide for fee on those costs. So that will have an ongoing diluted impact on the segments margins. Sure. You'll recall the major moving pieces that we've talked about, sort of outside the normal run rates for the business, in general, have been the elevated inventory level at Gulfstream as we have invested in the new models between test airplanes and the buildup for production and entry into service. That obviously has been a headwind for several years now. We saw that start to turn at the end of last year, a little bit better than we thought was going to happen, a little earlier than we thought was going to happen. And so we -- that helped us outperform our cash flow expectations for 2020. You can think about that for Gulfstream continuing to normalize this year. We'll start to see the 500s and 600s hit that inflection point and no longer be a headwind. But at the same time, keep in mind, we're building up on the 700 as that program moves toward entry into service. So, that'll become a little more neutral this year and then eventually shifted into a tailwind in the 2022 period and beyond. The other piece is, obviously, the large international program at Combat Systems, which again was a headwind for several years, that turned with the modification to that contract that Phebe discussed earlier into a more neutral event last year. So that stabilized last year and becomes a very modest tailwind this year, and then becomes a more meaningful tailwind in 2022, 2023, and a little bit more in 2024. So, when you think about the way those two pieces are moving, that kind of gets us on a cash flow trajectory from -- if you go back to 2019, we were in the 60%-ish range moving toward an expectation of the 80% range. Last year, we outperformed that a little bit as Gulfstream did a little better. And now we're in the high -- mid to high 90% range. The one piece there that's still sort of keeping us out of the 100% range really is the elevated investment profile in CapEx at Marine Systems. So, once that normalizes, next year, it gets back into the 2% of sales range. You should expect to see us the whole business at large being in the 100% to 100%-plus range, really with those two working capital pieces at Gulfstream and Combat Systems becoming the tailwinds that allow us to get even nicely above a 100%. So, that's kind of the trajectory for all those major moving pieces. Hopefully that gives you a sense of where we're going and the basis for our expectation for the improvement that we see ahead. Yeah. I think perhaps less of a target ratio then -- we're going to continue to prioritize our mid A rating. That's always going to be sort of where we seek to land long-term. And so, the key for us right now is we had -- as you're aware of sort of an outsize level of debt maturing this year versus if you look out over the next 10 to 20 years what our debt ladder maturity phasing looks like. And so, really what we're aiming to do is sort of bring that into more of a balanced picture of capital deployment that allows us to step down the debt over time in reasonable measures, as well as have considerable flexibility and firepower available for other deployment opportunities."

            "name": "Phebe Novakovic",
            "content": "Thank you, Howard. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.48 per diluted share on revenue of $9.4 billion, operating earnings of $938 million and net income of $708 million. Revenue is up $640 million or 7.3% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $4 million and net earnings are up $2 million. To be a little more granular, revenue on the Defense side of the business is up against last year's first quarter by $444 million and Aerospace is up $196 million. The operating earnings on the Defense side are up $45 million or 6.4%, while operating earnings in the Aerospace side are down $20 million, but still nicely above consensus. I'll have more to say about this A bit later. The operating margin for the entire company was 10%, 70 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was driven by a 250 basis point lower margin rated Aerospace, as was fully anticipated in our guidance to you, combined with $21 million more in corporate operating expense. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.18 per share. We have roughly $500 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and have 50 more operating earnings. So, it's a pure operations beat. I must confess that we were also beat our own expectations rather handsomely. This is in almost all respects a very solid quarter. It's hard to find something not to like about it. It's a very good start to the year. So, let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason at color around cash, backlog, taxes, and deployment of cash. And then we'll answer your questions. First, Aerospace. Aerospace enjoyed revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $220 million, with an 11.7% operating margin. Revenue is almost $200 million higher than anticipated by us and the sell side. Revenue is also $196 million higher than the year ago quarter. The difference is almost exclusively more G500 and G600 deliveries than the year ago quarter. The 11.7% operating margin is lower than the year ago quarter, but consistent with our guidance and sell side expectations. Finally, we took some mark-to-market charges with respect to our G500 test inventories. Without the charge from a pure operating perspective, performance in the quarter was superb. Aerospace also had a very strong quarter from an orders perspective with the book-to-bill of 1.3 to one. Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.34 to one. In unit terms, this is the strongest order quarter for the last two years, excluding the fourth quarter of 2019 when we launched the G700. So, as I noted, we submitted a very large number of proposals in the quarter, and we are waiting over $30 billion in customer's decisions on contracts. And COVID, obviously, had some impact on those -- that decision-making process. But we suspect that as -- we expect that as the government gets back to full operating cadence that we will begin to work through some of that backlog on the order decisions. So, I think, it's a combination. I think, we're winning more than our fair share, number one. Number two, the government is combining a number of preexisting current workload in the larger contracts given that the scale and magnitude of the effort that's required again is a good thing for us to bid on those large contracts. And then, some of it is just pure program programming. So, I think that's pretty much how we see that market unfolding. Hi, Seth. Yeah. So, we're not in the habit of giving detailed product by product margin. We did have a mark-to-market on some of our test airplanes, on the 500 test airplanes, which is pretty much to be expected with test airplanes. But we see that as largely behind us. So, I noted that just to tell -- to give you awesome color that absent that we would have seen even better operating performance. So, we expect, as I noted, deliveries to be lower in Q2, margins to be compressed in Q2, but increasing nicely then quarter-over-quarter, as we go through Q3 and into Q4. But recall, we admitted before that we see 2021 as our lower margin year for all the reasons that we noted, not the least of which is we took about 10 airplanes, largely as -- on our production last year largely as a result of the -- ended the 550 production and some mid-cabin. So, when the demand begins to increase or increasingly picks up and we ought to see some return to what we had considered our normal production rate and hence delivery rate. So, that'll drive margin. By the way, when you think about margin, particularly out the impact of the entry into service of the 700. Thank you, Cai. indoor 22:46: So, look, if you think about demand, as we see the lifting of the international travel restrictions and removal of quarantine restrictions and the increased confidence of obviously the U.S. economy, but also global economies, we expect to see demand continue to increase and should it, we see Gulfstream as being in very good stead. So, on average, it takes about six months lead time. But we're -- looking at just a few more production airplanes, as I noted in my remarks, and we'll continue to adjust and be sufficiently agile as we see demand continue to increase. So I liked how we balanced ourselves right now. Prudent, yet forward looking and we are pretty efficient when it comes to that to ramping up. But it does take the lead time of about two quarters. Good morning, David. So, the 700 will be margin accretive when we begin deliveries. We think about this on -- given our portfolio and our place in the firmament as a mid-teen margin business for the short-term. But as you can imagine, we'll continue to work margins. And as we've talked about many times before our margins at Gulfstream are a whole host -- driven by a whole host of issues, not the least of which is service mix, mix of airplanes. And when we were -- a couple of years ago, that was, as you recall, an acceleration of the 650 backlog, which kind of solitary effect of better aligning 650 demand with the backlog. So, there wasn't too much of wait for people. But also helping us transition through that period when we were replacing the 450, 500 -- the 450, 550 with 500 and 600. So that is largely behind us. And we -- as I said, expect to see some nice margin accretion as we go forward. Good morning, Ron. It's going very well, on both ramping up Virginia and equally importantly, more significantly Columbia. There's something important to remember when you think about Columbia. We started work on that program 14 years ago. And in that 14-year-period we have worked assiduously with the Navy to reduce all known potential risks that we could foresee in the ramp up of a very complex new program that -- and that included workforce hiring and training, supply chain readiness, facility readiness, construction prototyping, technology readiness, retiring potential known risks -- the potential risks in new high-end technologies and then the design maturity. That -- this boat entered into construction with a 83% design completion level and break contest to Virginia, which has been an exemplary program at 43%. So all of this prior planning and 14 years of detailed blocking and tackling at every conceivable level has mitigated an awful lot of risk and allowed us to -- for verbally hit the ground running on Columbia, and so far so good. I will know, it's a very complex program, so you can't declare victory on any ship building program right out of the bat, but we have taken unprecedented and historically unprecedented measures to retire all the known risks going forward. So that has really allowed us to execute coming right out of the gates very strongly. They've done a very good job. Not that we can see. So, our demand in Asia has been quite steady and good. We've got nice, large install base, a lot of customer intimacy there. So, today we have not seen it, that particular impact. Good morning, Myles. So, we have been through a significant investment period across many of our large lines of business and our focus here is on execution and primary focus. We will -- we always look for potential niche bolt-ons here and there. But we don't see anything on the horizon here of any significant opportunities that would entice us. Hi, Sheila. So, from a strategic perspective, we decided several years ago to invest in a number of our significant lines of business, where we believe that we could realize the best return on invested capital and really drive value. We have been in that period at Gulfstream, GDIT, primarily the Gulfstream, GDIT and the Marine Group. So the key now from my perspective is all about execution. And execution has been the hallmark of everything that we do here, and it is the undergirding of all financial performance. And it requires a discipline across -- it requires discipline across a series of elements and that are faster than all operations. But really, as I see the next several years, it's all about execution and wise deployment of capital to drive nice value creation. Ultimately, long-term value creation is based on good product. It's a perm execution wise investments and smart capital limit. So that's what I see us doing. Good morning. So, international consists of two items, primarily sales outside the United States from entities outside -- from our business units outside the United States, as well as FMS sales emanating from the United States. And unfortunately, for the state of humankind, the world has become an increasingly dangerous place. And so, we see the reflection of that concern in many of U.S. allies with increased demand for many of our products in Europe, Eastern Europe, a little bit in Asia, parts of the Middle East, and in the former Commonwealth nations and in the U.K. as well. So, we looked for nice, steady demand signals coming from outside the United States for our business units that are domiciled ex-U.S. And FMS, United States has had a long history of providing its allies with FMS opportunities. And we have a number of those in our comp opportunities and our Combat Systems again, selling through the U.S. government to key us allies positions in particularly dangerous. So, we see that nice cadence continuing in terms of our orders. So, new programs are always the most vulnerable. But with MPS, we were -- the only person -- they're only contracted to develop -- I think there were 12 prototypes. We delivered those last year. We liked our offering. We think it's what the army wants. But we are very attuned to army demands and how they see their site. And that's where -- intimacy with the army helps significantly. That plus -- so with all of them at MSP, that program got stretched considerably. So, we are taking it seriously and participating, but there's a long way to go before that comes to fruition. But recall another element and a key element of army modernization is upgrading with key -- with important and innovative new technologies, their existing platforms. And for us that means Stryker and Abrams, and both are undergoing major upgrade programs. So, all-in-all, we see the demand for our programs continuing to go strong. And there is nothing like -- going back to the earlier comments about execution. There's nothing like performing on schedule and on budget to amplify and provide a bit of an antidote to any potential cuts that come in the future. So, Combat is the army's major integrator of Combat Wheeled Systems and will remain such. So that ensures that our place in the firmament remains pretty strong. So, clearly, as I think -- perhaps it was Ron mentioned the demand for products that meet the pacific theater have -- has increased that puts our ship building business, particularly submarines in a very good stead. And you can see all of -- both the rhetoric of funding supporting increased submarine production. And we are executing on the current programs of record and working with the Navy to -- additional submarines can be executed in a relatively short-term. With respect to our Combat Systems Group, unfortunately, but regrettably the case, the hottest theater at the moment is Russia. And so whether we like it or not, that is the reality with which we were faced and this administration has been very quick to respond appropriately to the Russians. And so you see -- we believe that Combat System is highly aligned with that reality that we're now faced with in Europe. So, all-in-all, we liked our positioning with the new administration's priority. Remember, and particularly administration and this president has been an advocate of strong national security throughout his long and distinguished career. U.S. National Security strategy is driven by the threat of the perception of threat that has not changed. So, we will see some changes in relative priority among systems, but in all instances, we see ourselves very well aligned. So, if you mean from both cyber, cyber is embedded in all of our business and if you get to -- but I think you referred to CyOps. One would be -- it would be the height of fallen to discuss any of that. But let's just put it this way. We have always been on the leading edge of innovations with respect to cyber and electronic technologies that apply to the real world site in the moment. Fine. So, not surprisingly, the U.S. Department of Defense is moving as all major institutions are increasingly to the cloud. And so, our cloud offerings are -- an incrementally important part of our offerings that we believe will ultimately drive increased adoption across our existing contracts and adoption of the technology suite that we offer. And frankly, an expansion of the market. So, cloud presents a significant opportunity, and we are well-positioned to execute on it. So, let me infer a little bit from the question you're asking. We hear a lot of anecdotal evidence that there may be systemic changes emanating from COVID that have to do with work-at-home and what that might mean for a commercial real estate footprint. We still believe it is too soon to declare any change structural. We do expect to see some -- the extent to which remains to be seen, but some work-from-home either in hybrid capacities, or in some cases more completely.

I would now like to turn the call over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full year 2022 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. With my introduction complete, I\u2019d turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.58 per diluted share on revenue of $10,850 million, operating earnings of $1,230 million and net earnings of $992 million. Revenue is up $559 million or 5.4% against the fourth quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $41 million or 3.5%. Net earnings are up $40 million or 4.2% and earnings per share are up $0.19 to 5.6%. So, the quarter-over-quarter results compare very favorably and are in most respects consistent with our forecast and sell side consensus. The sequential results are even better. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by $876 million or 8.8%, operating earnings by $129 million or 11.7%. Net earnings by $90 million or 10% and EPS by $0.32, a 9.8% improvement. As promised that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest for the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, earnings per share, operating margins, net earnings and return on sales improved quarter over the previous quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvement. For the full year, we had revenue of $39.4 billion, up 2.4%, net earnings of $3.4 billion, up 4.1% and earnings per fully diluted share of $12.19, up $0.64, a 5.5% increase. So overall, the year was also reasonably consistent with our forecast and modestly better than the sell side. It was a very solid year in a difficult environment. Let me ask Jason to provide detail on our overall order activity, very strong backlog and cash performance in the quarter and the year.\nJason Aiken: Yes. Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Order activity and backlog were once again a very strong story with a 1.2:1 book-to-bill ratio for the company for the fourth quarter and a 1.1 times for the full year. Order activity in the Marine and Aerospace groups led the way. We finished the year with a total backlog at an all-time high of $91.1 billion and total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts of nearly $128 billion. I should note that foreign exchange rate fluctuations continued to be a headwind, reducing year-end backlog by nearly $600 million with the vast majority of the impact in Combat Systems. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter and the year. It was another solid quarter with operating cash flow of $669 million, which brings us to $4.6 billion of operating cash flow for the year. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the year was nearly $3.5 billion, a cash conversion rate of 102%, slightly ahead of our target for the year of 100% of net income. As discussed on previous calls, Gulfstream enjoyed particularly strong cash performance throughout the year on the strength of its order activity and the Technologies Group once again delivered outstanding cash performance. That said, when we talked with you in October, we discussed three potential constraints to cash in the fourth quarter; the pending outcome of congressional action on the tax treatment of R&D expenditures; the timing of resumption of cash collections on the Ajax program in the UK; and an anticipated uptick in capital expenditures as we progress through our ongoing facility investments. As it turns out, the Congress did not act to remedy the requirement to capitalize R&D costs, we did not receive any payments from the UK, though we now expect payments to resume this quarter, and our capital investments were in fact elevated, consistent with expectations. I'll discuss that in more detail a little later in the call. The net result was a lighter fourth quarter from a free cash flow perspective but slightly better than we had expected and rounds out a very strong year in terms of cash performance despite the headwinds I discussed. I should also point out that free cash flow per share has grown at a 22% compound annual growth rate from 2019 through 2022.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. Now let me review the quarter in the context of the business segment, paying modest attention to the quarter-over-quarter sequential and annual comparisons that are rather straightforward and set out in the press release. First, Aerospace. The story in aerospace is found in the sequential and year-over-year improvement as well as a continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, along with the overall strength of Gulfstream service business and the continuing improvement of Jet Aviation. In the quarter, Aerospace had revenue of $2.5 billion and earnings of $337 million. This represents a 4.4% increase in revenue and an 8% increase in earnings on a sequential basis. For the full year, revenue of $8.57 billion is up $432 million from the prior year, even though we delivered only one more aircraft than we did in 2021. The increase in both revenue and earnings was driven by higher service revenue at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. Earnings were also helped by somewhat higher margins on delivered aircraft. Fourth quarter revenue and earnings comparison on a quarter-over-quarter basis aren\u2019t as attractive because three aircraft we plan to deliver in the fourth quarter slipped into the first quarter this year. Gulfstream had 38 deliveries in the quarter when we had planned to deliver 41. As a result, Aerospace revenue and earnings are somewhat less than anticipated by the sell side for the quarter and for the year, but generally consistent with our forecast. I should also point out that Aerospace margins improved consistently quarter-over-quarter throughout the year. Aerospace demand remained strong. The book-to-bill was 1.2 times in the quarter and 1.4 times at Gulfstream alone. Orders in the quarter were $3 billion, up from $2.7 billion in the third quarter. The aerospace book-to-bill for the year was 1.5 times. To give you a little more color, Gulfstream received 430 new aircraft orders over the past two years, over 400 net orders after default and backlog adjustments as a result of the settlement of a case in arbitration. All said and done, aerospace backlog is up 20% in 2022 and a staggering 68% over the past few years. As we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains strong and sales activity is at a solid pace. At midyear 2022, we told you to expect revenue of about $8.6 billion and an operating margin of around 12.9%. We actually finished the year with a 13.2% operating margin. In short, we were spot on with respect to revenue and 30 basis points better on operating margin, which led to a $25 million more than forecast in operating earnings. With respect to G700 development, we estimate it will certify this upcoming summer but much depends on available FFA resources. So far, the effort has been very collaborative and is proceeding according to plan with no surprises. In summary, Aerospace exhibited very strong performance in the quarter and for the year. We look forward to a significant increase in deliveries in 2023 at Gulfstream and improved operating margin, but more about that as we get into guidance. We also expect continued growth and margin improvement at Jet. Next, Combat Systems. After a relatively slow start to the year, Combat Systems finished with a powerful fourth quarter. In fact, the fourth quarter of 2022 proved the highest revenue and earnings for Combat Systems in over 10 years. Revenue in the quarter was $2.18 billion, and it's up 15.5% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $332 million are up 18.1% on a 30 basis point increase in operating margin. OTS alone captured more than one-third of its revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter. The revenue growth was largely driven by Mobile Protected Firepower, Abrams for Poland and the large international order in Canada. OTS enjoyed higher revenue across all lines of business with particular strength in artillery rounds. Not surprising, the sequential comparisons are even better. Revenue is up $391 million or 21.9% and earnings are up $61 million or 22.5% on the strength of a 15.2% operating margin. From an orders perspective, Combat had a very good year in 2022 with a book-to-bill of 1.1 times, driven by MPS, very strong international demand for the Abrams main battle tank as well as growing demand on the munition side of the business. By the way, Combat's annual performance is fairly consistent with the forecast we provided you earlier in the year. Revenue and operating earnings are up somewhat and operating margin is a little lower. In short, this group had a wonderful quarter, continued its history of strong margin performance and had good order activity and a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. Marine Systems. The Marine Systems growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $2,970 billion is up 3.4% over the year ago quarter. Revenue was also up 7.2% sequentially and 4.9% for the full year. Operating earnings are up about 1% over the year ago, of less than 0.5% sequentially and up 2.6% for the full year. Once again, this is the highest full year of revenue and earnings ever for the Marine group. A little perspective may be of assistance here. Marine Systems has grown revenue from $8 billion in 2017 to $11 billion in 2022, this is a 5.3% compound annual growth rate with an average increase of $600 million per year. Earnings have grown from $685 million in 2017 to $900 million in 2022, a 5.5% compound annual growth rate. In addition, Marine had strong orders in the quarter, generating a 2.2 times book-to-bill, including the receipt of a $5.1 billion contract modification to Colombia. Our forecast to you in July of last year anticipated revenue of about $10.8 billion, operating margin of 8.3% and operating earnings of $896 million. We came in above that for revenue, a little lower on the predicted operating margin and right on the forecasted earnings. So, Jason is going to give you a little color on the Technologies Group, his new responsibility, provide a bit of perspective on balance sheet, other income and expense items, and I will close with our outlook for 2023.\nJason Aiken: The Technologies Group as a whole had a very strong finish to a solid year and a very challenging operating environment. Revenue in the quarter of $3.25 billion was up 9.3% over the prior year and up 6% sequentially. Operating earnings of $340 million were up about 2% over the fourth quarter of 2021 and sequentially, were up an impressive 19%. The main driver of the fourth quarter performance was Mission Systems' ability to overcome some of the logjam in its supply chain and deliver some of the product that was held up at the end of the third quarter. While these issues have not been completely resolved, the fourth quarter performance gives us good reason for optimism that they're starting to see their way through this. For the year, revenue of $12.5 billion was up just slightly from 2021. Breaking that down, GDIT once again grew in the low single digits, up 1.6% after 2.2% growth in 2021. Mission Systems was down 2% despite the strong end to the year. Earnings for the year of $1.23 billion were down 3.8% on a 40 basis point contraction in margin to 9.8% as a result of the mix shift between product and service revenue as GDIT reported its highest margin since the CSRA acquisition and its highest ever earnings, but Mission Systems was down for the reasons discussed. With respect to backlog, the Technologies Group had a solid year, notwithstanding an ongoing trend of customer solicitations pushing to the right and recurring award protests. GDIT received over $11 billion in awards during the year, almost 20% higher than 2021, representing more new work than any year since the CSRA acquisition. And Mission Systems finished the year with a 1.1 times book-to-bill and a capture rate in excess of 80%, putting them in a good position to emerge from the supply chain headwinds they've been facing. With that, I'll turn to some of the financial particulars before turning it back over to Phebe to give you our guidance for 2023. Starting with capital deployment in 2022. Capital expenditures, as I noted, were elevated in the fourth quarter at $494 million or 4.6% of sales. That brings us to $1.1 billion for the full year. At 2.8% of sales, full year capital expenditures are slightly higher than our original expectation due strictly to timing. We expect capital expenditures to start to step back down below 2.5% in 2023 and continuing to trend towards historic levels. We also paid $345 million in dividends in the fourth quarter bringing the full year to $1.4 billion, and we repurchased approximately 440,000 shares of stock in the quarter, bringing us to over 5 million shares for the year for $1.2 billion at just under $226 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $50 million in 2022 and we expect that to increase to approximately $200 million in 2023. This includes a modest voluntary contribution to one of our commercial plans, which was made this month and fully funds the plan that had a funding gap of more than $500 million within the past two years. Concurrently, we shifted the investment mix to hedge the plan's $2 billion of liabilities, thus eliminating any funding risk associated with market volatility or discount rate fluctuations. However, as a result of the change in investment mix, our pension income will be lower in 2023. Following this derisking activity, we expect our corporate operating expense for 2023 to be approximately $140 million and our other income to be approximately $80 million, a combined reduction of roughly $125 million in nonoperating noncash income from 2022. Speaking of pension income, the fourth quarter had higher than anticipated other income as we benefited from higher discount rates for measuring liabilities on our nonqualified pension plans, which are mark-to-market at the end of the year. We also repaid $1 billion of fixed rate notes in the fourth quarter. After all this, we ended the year with a cash balance of over $1.2 billion and a net debt position of $9.3 billion, down approximately $600 million from last year. We have $1.25 billion of debt maturing in 2023. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $85 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $364 million. That compares to $93 million and $424 million in the respective 2021 period. Pending our decisions with respect to the scheduled debt maturities, we expect interest expense in 2023 to remain essentially consistent with 2022. Turning to income taxes. We had an 18.1% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which brings our full year rate to 16%, consistent with our guidance. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect the full year effective tax rate to increase to around 17%, reflecting higher taxes on foreign earnings. The sum total of these below-the-line items versus the comparable levels in 2022 is a net negative impact on 2023 diluted earnings per share of $0.63. And finally, with respect to our outlook for free cash flow, following a strong 2022, we expect cash conversion in 2023 to be better than 100%, roughly in the 105% range, assuming the resumption of Ajax receipts in the first quarter, as I mentioned earlier. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Phebe.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. So, let me provide our operating forecast for 2023 with some color around our outlook for each of the business groups and then a company-wide roll-up. In 2023, we expect Aerospace revenue to be around $10.4 billion, up between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. Margin is expected to be up 140 basis points to 14.6%. Gulfstream deliveries will be around 145, up a little over 20%. This is all consistent with the multiyear forecast we gave you in January of 2021 and at the end of Q2. In Combat Systems, at this time last year, we had anticipated revenue to be down slightly in 2023, following a modest decline in 2022 with a return to low single digit growth later in our planning horizon. Since then, the threat environment has clearly changed. Continuing the better-than-expected performance in 2022, we expect the group to hold steady again in '23 with revenue of $7.3 billion and operating margin once again towards the high end of their reliable 14% to 15% range at 14.7%. The improved outlook is a result of strong order activity we saw in 2022, including the MPF Award and growing international demand, particularly the tank order in Poland, which came in sooner than had been anticipated. We're seeing demand signals resulting from the war in Ukraine, but we've only just begun to see that manifest in our backlog at this point. To the extent those demand signals start to convert into order activity, we could see some opportunity for additional revenue in the latter part of the year, particularly in our armaments and munition business. As I noted earlier, Marine Group has been on a remarkable growth journey, averaging $600 million a year. Our outlook of $400 million to $500 million per year over time remains unchanged. However, the supply chain constraints of the Virginia program will drive some annual variability this year. As a result, the group's revenue for 2023 will remain essentially flat at $10.9 billion as well their operating margin rate at 8.1%. We anticipate a return to growth in 2024 and 2025 at around $600 million a year. We expect revenue in the range of $12.5 billion to $12.6 billion in the Technologies Group. To give you a little color behind this outlook, GDIT will continue to grow at a low single digit pace consistent with the past two years. Mission Systems, however, will be challenged from a revenue perspective, particularly in the first half of the year as they work through the lingering supply chain issues they've been dealing with for the past 18 months. As a result, their revenue will be down slightly compared with 2022. The resulting shift in the group's revenue mix, with stronger service activity but lower hardware volume was yield in operating margin in the 9.5% range, sustaining their industry leading performance, albeit slightly lower than 2022. So, for 2023, company-wide, we expect to see approximately $41.2 billion to $41.3 billion of revenue, an increase of almost 5%. We anticipate operating margin of 10.9%, up 20 basis points from 2022. This all goes up to a forecast range of $12.60 to $12.65 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect a pattern similar to what we've seen in recent years with sequential increases in revenue and operating margins throughout the year. As always, this forecast is purely from operations. It assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady to avoid dilution from option exercises. Beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effective deployment of capital. Let me close with an observation. Our forecast comes from our operating plan. It is conservative as it must be in this environment of unpredictable financing of the government. However, the threat environment suggests increases in defense spending. In short, I see more opportunity than risk in our forecast. With that, I'll turn it over to Howard to start the Q&A.\nA - Howard Rubel: Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Myles Walton with Wolf Research.\nMyles Walton: I was hoping maybe you could touch on a couple of things. One, Jason, your new role and how you sort of think about balancing the act between the CFO and the operating segment roles and responsibilities which you intend to focus on there. And then maybe on the capital deployment front for '23 at 105%, obviously, you've got a lot of excess cash. Should we expect you to pick up repurchase activity in '23 versus '22 or relatively similar?\nJason Aiken: Myles, I think with respect to your first question, looking at the new responsibility and that opportunity. First and foremost, it's important to remember that these businesses are run by two excellent and accomplished presidents. And frankly, I have the highest level of confidence in them and their teams. When I look back over recent history in this role, Chris Marzilli, really helped steer this business through a period of remarkable change and transformation, not to mention COVID. And I don't think as I look ahead that this market is going to become any less dynamic. So I think the focus really is on continuing to make sure that the businesses continue to focus on their bottom line, earnings and cash as always but frankly, also finding our way to a sustainable top line growth trajectory, and that will really be the emphasis. In terms of balancing the two, I'm humbled and honored to have this dual responsibility, fortunately entering my tenth year in the role as CFO. So I feel confident about the ability to handle both at the same time.\nPhebe Novakovic: So with respect to our capital deployment, we'll continue to invest in our business where prudent. We'll continue to maintain our dividend and we'll repurchase shares accordingly. So I don't see any big change in the priorities at least for our execution.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: Phebe, could you touch on -- you mentioned three deliveries that slipped out. Was that customer preference, was that supply chain related? And then it doesn't appear that you're going to -- your prior guidance was 148 deliveries this year, now you're talking 145. So it doesn't seem any makeup there. And then last thing, the 170, I think you forecasted for '24 deliveries. Does that still hold?\nPhebe Novakovic: So let me go in order. We had, as I noted, three airplanes have slipped into this quarter. One was simply an issue that we just couldn't get it completed in time and two of them were customer preferences for international deliveries. With respect to the production next year, we are confident that we can make that and our trajectory going forward past this year remains the same. So directionally and we're right on track, and we're comfortable we get there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.\nSeth Seifman: I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about Marine and the supply chain challenges at Electric Boat. And specifically, what we should be looking for in terms of any particular metrics, whether it's hiring or deliveries or certain milestones to get a sense that things are firming there and kind of also what the risk is of further deterioration in schedules.\nPhebe Novakovic: So let's deconstruct that and I think we have to posit few truth. We went into COVID with scheduled variants on Virginia. Virginia is also about a third of the Electric Boat revenue. COVID had a profound impact on many aspects of our lives, but particularly lasting one on the workforce. We had labor discontinuities throughout the United States and we also experienced something that we had not anticipated abnormally large retirement of experienced workers. In a business that is heavily manpower dependent, these impacts had a disproportionate effect on additional schedule variants. We are working with the Navy who's been quite active and engaged in helping develop a plan and a really detailed action list on how to address these issues. And ship building and the supply chain are fixed by incremental improvements over time. So, what do we see at the moment? We see stabilization in the workforce. I think across the nation, we've got a little bit better labor dynamics than we did immediately coming out of COVID. We also have additional experience in what some of the challenges have been. So the way I look at it, this year will give us a bit of a chance to dig further see funds to the velocity of the material coming into Electric Boat. And that ought to be a good thing for all involved despite and notwithstanding the considerable issues around schedules. I would note that the Submarine Industrial base delivered two submarines last year, and we're going to deliver two more this year. So, I think maintaining that cadence of delivery is important. But in much of shipbuilding, milestones are difficult to identify really until you get the ship in the customers' hands. So, as I said, we're working very closely with the Navy to ensure that we could just get back some of that schedule variance on the remainder of the Block 4 ships and on the Block 5 ships.\nSeth Seifman: And maybe just to follow up specifically on that. Most of the discussion -- our discussion today and then the trade press has been about Virginia. How's the Columbia schedule holding up?\nPhebe Novakovic: So we're about 30% done on the first ship and we are ahead of the contract schedule.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird.\nPeter Arment: Phebe, maybe just to stay on Seth's line of question just on Marine. Maybe you could just -- there's been a lot written about just the industrial base, and you just mentioned it. How are you thinking about just maybe the CapEx profile and in particular, things start to get unveiled on [ACAS] (ph), what the plans might be there? Just should we expect any further step-up in CapEx [Technical Difficulty]?\nPhebe Novakovic: Not with respect to ACAS. And I think we have, as I've said on earlier calls and to many of you in person, we'll just take our lead from our Navy customer on how they want us to respond to all of this. So this is really an intergovernmental series of discussions and agreements and we will, of course, support whatever the Navy plan is going forward.\nPeter Arment: And just as a quick follow-up, just maybe just in general on the supply chain. You talked about the constraints in marine and some of the issues at Mission Systems. Has it gotten worse submission or do you think it's actually kind of stabilized? And this is just -- if is what it is, what's going on in the marketplace?\nJason Aiken: So I think with respect to Mission Systems, we have to really focus on what it is we're talking about here, which is really chips and microelectronics, right? So unlike some of the other parts of the business, which are heavily labor and availability of workforce driven. So this is really, obviously, for Mission Systems an issue that's impacting industries much broader than just us or us in the Aerospace and Defense side. And I think when these issues first surfaced, Mission Systems did a really nice job of developing workarounds, right? Finding alternate sourcing, certifying substitute parts and so on. So, all of those actions were predicated on the expectation that the supply chain would kind of come through this and get over the hump within, call it, a year plus or minus. But frankly, as we've continued to work our way through it, it's become clear that we're not always at the top of the priority list for some of these sources of supply. So when they saw the bottlenecks we were dealing with were going to persist somewhat longer than expected, the team really adapted to this new normal with a whole new set of tactics. That includes procuring key components with longer lead times anywhere from 12 to 18 or even 24 months, as well as working with key suppliers to improve the forecasting that we were giving them and the reliability of demand so that they could have confidence in where we were going and allocate additional capacity to us and our priorities. So, all of that is in place and underway. As you might imagine, some of those things take a little longer to yield results. So that's why we're expecting that to kind of come through in the second half of this year. But we do feel like they've got a good plan in place, they've taken great corrective actions, and we just need to see that all sort of roll out and to get to the other side of this, but it's likely to be toward the second half back into this year before that all takes hold.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.\nRon Epstein: You've talked about this a little bit in your prepared remarks about the impact that the Ukraine could potentially have on Land Systems. Maybe from a bigger strategic point of view, it seems like in the past, the logic had always been the Army was a bill payer for the Navy and the Air Force. Is that -- are we learning a different lesson now out of the Ukraine and what kind of implications potentially does that have for your Land Systems business?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, if you look at the services funding over, I'd say, in the modern air post World War II, the Army gets funded when they're tactical challenges and tactical problems, either a hot war, relatively cold war or preparedness, this is an issue where we've got both strategic challenges in which the Navy and the Air Force tend to get funded. And as I noted, the threat environment has materially changed. So that has driven increased interest in a number of Army and land forces capabilities. And as we've begun to see those show up in our in our backlog and in our order book, but we've got more room to grow and more room to go there as some of this demand converts into actual orders. So, when I think about what's going on in Europe, our European Combat Vehicle business has done quite well in securing a number of contracts, both historically but increasingly recently and on a -- what we expect on a going forward basis. They've been active in Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Luxembourg. By the way, I wrote all those down because that's a lot of countries. So I think the closer you are to the threat, the more urgent you feel your funding requirements. So all of which is to say, we have changed our expectations for Combat Systems growth. By the way, overarching all of this is a need to increase our ammunition and projectile output, and we've been working with the Army for the last three, four, five months on exactly that kind of plan. So as we've always posited, the threat environment really drives demand for defense products and we're seeing some of that now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky with Citi.\nJason Gursky: Jason, I want to take the opportunity to ask you a question about the Technologies Group. I know you've been in the seat for just a small amount of time, but I'm maybe curious to know as you settle into your seat, the kinds of investments that you think you might want to make either in technologies or new products and services or in processes BD in order to accelerate revenue. Just kind of get your first impressions on the needs there in the group and what might change with you now taking over leadership of that group.\nJason Aiken: So I think the way to think about this group between GDIT and Mission Systems, technologies taken together, is that we currently are and have been for quite some time, in a model and of the capability set that a lot of the peer companies out there are trying to get to. That is a well balanced and comprehensive set of offerings between the traditional federal IT services offerings as well as cyber, hardware and other elements of that portfolio. And so I don't think we have to necessarily play catch up as much in that game. I think there's always opportunities to refine and enhance the portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, this is not going to stop being a dynamic environment. We are, as always, have continued to invest internally in new technology capabilities, that will continue to be the case. As you know, I'll say what I know Phebe would say if she were talking right now. We're not going to speculate about M&A. There's always the possibility for bolt-on acquisitions. I would note, by the way, since you brought up the point that since we acquired CSRA in 2018 and essentially transformed the face of this group with the size and capability of our federal IT services business. There have been -- if I look at GDIT's competitor group, call it, the top five or six main peers, there have been some 40 to 45 acquisitions in that space that those companies have taken on and we have not done any. We've done a couple of small bolt-ons in Mission Systems during that time, but nothing in GDIT space. And so it's interesting to see how the others are behaving in the aftermath of that activity and a lot of the consolidation that's happened in the industry. But I think we put ourselves in very good stead and we see a lot of a lot of others following suit. So I don't think there's a massive sea change in what we have planned ahead, but we'll continue to focus on maintaining our leading position in the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.\nCai von Rumohr: So you margin was up a little bit sequentially at Gulfstream and yet my understanding was you had some software warranty charges in the second and third quarter associated with the G500 and G600. So were there any other -- what were the reason the margins weren't a bit better there in Aerospace?\nPhebe Novakovic: The margins are pretty darn good. We have performed what we had told you. And so we were pretty pleased with that. I would note that one of the headwinds is R&D. So the additional work that has been required from the airworthiness directive and the new FAA requirements as a result of the MAX have driven increased R&D. And we'll continue to see some of that and then that will begin to unwind. But I think those are very strong margins and better than we had anticipated in our guidance to you.\nCai von Rumohr: And Jason, the guide for Mission Systems margins is down over 200 bps from where you've been. Once things start to sort out, where do you see Mission Systems margins can go? Can they go back to where they were?\nJason Aiken: So I want to make sure I think you're saying technologies as a whole because we don't really give -- or business unit specific margin guidance within the group. But given what you're saying, I think if you look back to prior to the CSRA acquisition, when the IT services side of the business became, frankly, our largest business group and the lion's share, the sort of two thirds, if you will, or more of the technologies grew. We used to -- the combined margin of those businesses used to be in the, call it, the low double digit range, it's usually between 10% and 11% on a fairly consistent basis. Since we acquired CSRA, we've averaged over the past five years 9.8% margin for the group. So what we're seeing right now is really just a shift in the moment where we've had GDIT come through that significant integration effort for the first couple of years followed immediately on the footsteps of that with the impacts of COVID, they've really embarked on a nice steady trajectory now of low single digit growth for several years now, and we expect to see that continue. As Mission Systems in the moment is dealing with the supply chain issues that have been, I think, well addressed, their volume is down a bit. So what we're seeing in terms of the group's margin, aggregate margin, is really nothing more than a shift in the mix between the two. So that's with the increased service side of the business and the lower volumes on the product and hardware side of the business. So as Mission Systems comes through this and gets back on track to a growth level, which we do expect to see happen once they come through these issues, you ought to see the margin on an aggregate basis tick back up. And by the way, that's not -- shouldn't overlook the fact that GDIT on its own is continuing to improve and harvest its margins as it grows. I think I said before, they had their highest margin as a business since we acquired CSRA and their highest earnings contribution to the company ever. So everything, I think, is headed in the right direction, just got to come through the supply chain issues at Mission Systems and that will help influence the mix, and we ought to see a trend back up toward the 10% level over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.\nPete Skibitski: Just following on to Ron's question earlier on combat and that was standing the flat outlook for this year, but you talked about the international demand, and it seemed like Congress added quite a bit of money for Stryker and Abrams to the '23 budget. So can you give us any sense of kind of the CAGR that you think is a reasonable expectation after 2023 when things begin to -- or when the demand begins to actually convert for you?\nPhebe Novakovic: So I think what we're looking at now is low single digit growth. So if we see anything over time that accelerates that, we'll certainly let you know that that's our best planning in the moment in consultation with our customer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe overall on the defense portfolio as a whole, all three segments. When you think about it, you're guiding the business flat on the top line perspective and EBIT as well. The budget is up 10 and you have some pretty good programs in there. How do you think about that delta and when it catches up to the budget and EBIT growth resumes?\nPhebe Novakovic: So I think that's more in '24. One of the big issues there, as I said, is Virginia. But look, the way I look at the defense portfolio, we have an extremely strong backlog and now it's just a question of executing, executing across that portfolio. So I'm not too worried about growth on the defense side at all nor on the aerospace side. There is one thing that I think we're focused on, we should be focused on, and I neglected to mention this earlier. But with respect to execution, one of the things that we can do on Virginia and frankly at EB, in general, is to continue to improve our operating performance. That provides us more ability to cover some of the perturbations that are coming out of the supply chain. So I really think about all of this as execution. Growth comes when it comes. We've got the backlog to support it. And so I like the position we're in, frankly.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: And then if I could ask one more. I don't know if you provided it. Can you give us an update on the G700, G800 certification processes?\nPhebe Novakovic: So we still expect the G700 to convert -- get certified this summer. And the G800 will be about six months after that, so we don't see any change in that. And the relationship has been going very well with the FAA. So we are continuing to look forward to finishing all the certification processes. Now that -- I will tell you that is outside our complete control, a lot of this is FAA resources and their ability to focus, given all the other demands that they have on them, but so far so good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Herbert with RBC.\nPhebe Novakovic: I guess, we lost him.\nKen Herbert: Sorry about that. I was muted. I wanted to first ask, within Aerospace, really good growth in the services business. What's the outlook for services growth in '23 as part of the aerospace guide? And can you talk a little bit about investments that you're making in that business?\nPhebe Novakovic: We expect low single digit growth in our service side. And we continue to invest prudently when we see the need for more service capacity. But at the moment, we're pretty -- nothing really outstanding in that regard. You've got the capacity to accommodate what we see as reasonable steady growth.\nKen Herbert: And just a quick clarification on the 700 certification this summer. As obviously, you commented you're working with the FAA closely and a lot of this is -- or some of this is out of your control. How would you characterize your visibility or sort of the ongoing risks around I guess, FAA capacity to support that? I mean do you feel like you're well through that risk retirement or is there still substantial uncertainty and risk associated with that summer time frame?\nPhebe Novakovic: I think the FAA has done a good job managing its portfolio and a series of complex and multifaceted requirements. And so far, we are sticking to what we believe is a reasonable expectation for the certification.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.\nRobert Stallard: Just a couple of quick ones from me, Phebe. First of all, on Ukraine, it looks like they're going to get Abrams tanks. At what point does capacity in some form or other particularly staffing become an issue? And then secondly, just for Jason, what sort of book-to-bill have you assumed in aerospace for 2023 in your cash flow guidance?\nPhebe Novakovic: Staffing is not an issue here. There is plenty of capacity on the combat vehicle side, both tracked and wheeled. So to the extent that the US government intends to execute any contracts with respect to some of these bilateral agreements that they are developing, we can -- it's well within the capacity of the industrial base to accommodate.\nJason Aiken: And then, Rob, with respect to your second question, as it relates to aerospace book-to-bill, much like going into 2022, we've assumed a return to a 1:1 book-to-bill and that is one of the predicates for our cash flow forecast. So to the extent they outperform, obviously, that could provide some upside.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse.\nScott Deuschle: Phebe, you touched on it a bit in your prepared remarks. I was curious if you could comment a bit more in depth on the sales pipeline at Gulfstream and the latest trends you're seeing there, both from individual buyers and the corporate buyers. And then for Jason, I was just wondering if you could identify what the unbilled receivable balance was on Ajax at the end of the year and how much of that you expect to burn down this year?\nPhebe Novakovic: With respect to our pipeline, I noted that it remains strong. I would also say that corporate America has been very active, both public and private companies, high net worth individuals. Europe remains slow. Mid East just picked up. Southeast Asia, let's say, not China, has been increasingly active. So we've got a good demand across all of our offerings in all of our aircraft.\nJason Aiken: And then on your second question, as it relates to the Ajax unbilled, that's at the end of the year, roughly $1.7 billion is where we stand right now. I don't want to get into the specifics of how much we expect to collect this year, that's part of ongoing discussions with that customer. But needless to say, as I mentioned in my remarks, we do have good reason to expect those cash receipts to resume before the end of this quarter. And so we'll start to see that unbilled balance come down.\nHoward Rubel: Operator, this is Mr. Rubel. We'll take one more question, please and then we'll wrap the call up.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.\nRobert Spingarn: Phebe, going back to an earlier question on entry into service for 700 and 800. When would might we expect the R&D to decline, I don't know how much the 400 would use, and what would the incremental margins at Gulfstream look like once that happens? I imagine that's 24 or is it 25?\nPhebe Novakovic: So I think we expect R&D to begin to go down at the end of next year. And look, we have Gulfstream is an extremely high performing operationally strong company. And so I think we have demonstrated incremental improvement in margins as our operating efficiency and discipline in our supply chain, engineering. And really on the shop floor, all of that has improved. So I think there's upward over time, margin opportunity, but we're not going to get into parsing specifics until we have good clarity. But we're very comfortable that we will improve steadily and repeatedly.\nRobert Spingarn: And just a clarification on the FAA, you talked about it earlier. Are they still in the discovery process as they evolve their system after what's happened at peers over the past couple of years, or is there a set process that is in stone at this point?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes, I think that that's a broader question than I'm able to answer. What I can tell you is that our relationship and working relationship with the FAA has matured significantly. And we think we all have a very clear understanding of what the new requirements are and how to execute them.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay, thank you very much.\nHoward Rubel: And thank you all for joining us today on this call. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics Web site for the fourth quarter earnings release, highlights presentation and outlook. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached later today on my office at (703) 876-3117. Operator?\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time, which concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Order activity and backlog were once again a very strong story with a 1.2:1 book-to-bill ratio for the company for the fourth quarter and a 1.1 times for the full year. Order activity in the Marine and Aerospace groups led the way. We finished the year with a total backlog at an all-time high of $91.1 billion and total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts of nearly $128 billion. I should note that foreign exchange rate fluctuations continued to be a headwind, reducing year-end backlog by nearly $600 million with the vast majority of the impact in Combat Systems. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter and the year. It was another solid quarter with operating cash flow of $669 million, which brings us to $4.6 billion of operating cash flow for the year. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the year was nearly $3.5 billion, a cash conversion rate of 102%, slightly ahead of our target for the year of 100% of net income. As discussed on previous calls, Gulfstream enjoyed particularly strong cash performance throughout the year on the strength of its order activity and the Technologies Group once again delivered outstanding cash performance. That said, when we talked with you in October, we discussed three potential constraints to cash in the fourth quarter; the pending outcome of congressional action on the tax treatment of R&D expenditures; the timing of resumption of cash collections on the Ajax program in the UK; and an anticipated uptick in capital expenditures as we progress through our ongoing facility investments. As it turns out, the Congress did not act to remedy the requirement to capitalize R&D costs, we did not receive any payments from the UK, though we now expect payments to resume this quarter, and our capital investments were in fact elevated, consistent with expectations. I'll discuss that in more detail a little later in the call. The net result was a lighter fourth quarter from a free cash flow perspective but slightly better than we had expected and rounds out a very strong year in terms of cash performance despite the headwinds I discussed. I should also point out that free cash flow per share has grown at a 22% compound annual growth rate from 2019 through 2022. The Technologies Group as a whole had a very strong finish to a solid year and a very challenging operating environment. Revenue in the quarter of $3.25 billion was up 9.3% over the prior year and up 6% sequentially. Operating earnings of $340 million were up about 2% over the fourth quarter of 2021 and sequentially, were up an impressive 19%. The main driver of the fourth quarter performance was Mission Systems' ability to overcome some of the logjam in its supply chain and deliver some of the product that was held up at the end of the third quarter. While these issues have not been completely resolved, the fourth quarter performance gives us good reason for optimism that they're starting to see their way through this. For the year, revenue of $12.5 billion was up just slightly from 2021. Breaking that down, GDIT once again grew in the low single digits, up 1.6% after 2.2% growth in 2021. Mission Systems was down 2% despite the strong end to the year. Earnings for the year of $1.23 billion were down 3.8% on a 40 basis point contraction in margin to 9.8% as a result of the mix shift between product and service revenue as GDIT reported its highest margin since the CSRA acquisition and its highest ever earnings, but Mission Systems was down for the reasons discussed. With respect to backlog, the Technologies Group had a solid year, notwithstanding an ongoing trend of customer solicitations pushing to the right and recurring award protests. GDIT received over $11 billion in awards during the year, almost 20% higher than 2021, representing more new work than any year since the CSRA acquisition. And Mission Systems finished the year with a 1.1 times book-to-bill and a capture rate in excess of 80%, putting them in a good position to emerge from the supply chain headwinds they've been facing. With that, I'll turn to some of the financial particulars before turning it back over to Phebe to give you our guidance for 2023. Starting with capital deployment in 2022. Capital expenditures, as I noted, were elevated in the fourth quarter at $494 million or 4.6% of sales. That brings us to $1.1 billion for the full year. At 2.8% of sales, full year capital expenditures are slightly higher than our original expectation due strictly to timing. We expect capital expenditures to start to step back down below 2.5% in 2023 and continuing to trend towards historic levels. We also paid $345 million in dividends in the fourth quarter bringing the full year to $1.4 billion, and we repurchased approximately 440,000 shares of stock in the quarter, bringing us to over 5 million shares for the year for $1.2 billion at just under $226 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $50 million in 2022 and we expect that to increase to approximately $200 million in 2023. This includes a modest voluntary contribution to one of our commercial plans, which was made this month and fully funds the plan that had a funding gap of more than $500 million within the past two years. Concurrently, we shifted the investment mix to hedge the plan's $2 billion of liabilities, thus eliminating any funding risk associated with market volatility or discount rate fluctuations. However, as a result of the change in investment mix, our pension income will be lower in 2023. Following this derisking activity, we expect our corporate operating expense for 2023 to be approximately $140 million and our other income to be approximately $80 million, a combined reduction of roughly $125 million in nonoperating noncash income from 2022. Speaking of pension income, the fourth quarter had higher than anticipated other income as we benefited from higher discount rates for measuring liabilities on our nonqualified pension plans, which are mark-to-market at the end of the year. We also repaid $1 billion of fixed rate notes in the fourth quarter. After all this, we ended the year with a cash balance of over $1.2 billion and a net debt position of $9.3 billion, down approximately $600 million from last year. We have $1.25 billion of debt maturing in 2023. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $85 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $364 million. That compares to $93 million and $424 million in the respective 2021 period. Pending our decisions with respect to the scheduled debt maturities, we expect interest expense in 2023 to remain essentially consistent with 2022. Turning to income taxes. We had an 18.1% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which brings our full year rate to 16%, consistent with our guidance. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect the full year effective tax rate to increase to around 17%, reflecting higher taxes on foreign earnings. The sum total of these below-the-line items versus the comparable levels in 2022 is a net negative impact on 2023 diluted earnings per share of $0.63. And finally, with respect to our outlook for free cash flow, following a strong 2022, we expect cash conversion in 2023 to be better than 100%, roughly in the 105% range, assuming the resumption of Ajax receipts in the first quarter, as I mentioned earlier. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Phebe. Myles, I think with respect to your first question, looking at the new responsibility and that opportunity. First and foremost, it's important to remember that these businesses are run by two excellent and accomplished presidents. And frankly, I have the highest level of confidence in them and their teams. When I look back over recent history in this role, Chris Marzilli, really helped steer this business through a period of remarkable change and transformation, not to mention COVID. And I don't think as I look ahead that this market is going to become any less dynamic. So I think the focus really is on continuing to make sure that the businesses continue to focus on their bottom line, earnings and cash as always but frankly, also finding our way to a sustainable top line growth trajectory, and that will really be the emphasis. In terms of balancing the two, I'm humbled and honored to have this dual responsibility, fortunately entering my tenth year in the role as CFO. So I feel confident about the ability to handle both at the same time. So I think with respect to Mission Systems, we have to really focus on what it is we're talking about here, which is really chips and microelectronics, right? So unlike some of the other parts of the business, which are heavily labor and availability of workforce driven. So this is really, obviously, for Mission Systems an issue that's impacting industries much broader than just us or us in the Aerospace and Defense side. And I think when these issues first surfaced, Mission Systems did a really nice job of developing workarounds, right? Finding alternate sourcing, certifying substitute parts and so on. So, all of those actions were predicated on the expectation that the supply chain would kind of come through this and get over the hump within, call it, a year plus or minus. But frankly, as we've continued to work our way through it, it's become clear that we're not always at the top of the priority list for some of these sources of supply. So when they saw the bottlenecks we were dealing with were going to persist somewhat longer than expected, the team really adapted to this new normal with a whole new set of tactics. That includes procuring key components with longer lead times anywhere from 12 to 18 or even 24 months, as well as working with key suppliers to improve the forecasting that we were giving them and the reliability of demand so that they could have confidence in where we were going and allocate additional capacity to us and our priorities. So, all of that is in place and underway. As you might imagine, some of those things take a little longer to yield results. So that's why we're expecting that to kind of come through in the second half of this year. But we do feel like they've got a good plan in place, they've taken great corrective actions, and we just need to see that all sort of roll out and to get to the other side of this, but it's likely to be toward the second half back into this year before that all takes hold. So I think the way to think about this group between GDIT and Mission Systems, technologies taken together, is that we currently are and have been for quite some time, in a model and of the capability set that a lot of the peer companies out there are trying to get to. That is a well balanced and comprehensive set of offerings between the traditional federal IT services offerings as well as cyber, hardware and other elements of that portfolio. And so I don't think we have to necessarily play catch up as much in that game. I think there's always opportunities to refine and enhance the portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, this is not going to stop being a dynamic environment. We are, as always, have continued to invest internally in new technology capabilities, that will continue to be the case. As you know, I'll say what I know Phebe would say if she were talking right now. We're not going to speculate about M&A. There's always the possibility for bolt-on acquisitions. I would note, by the way, since you brought up the point that since we acquired CSRA in 2018 and essentially transformed the face of this group with the size and capability of our federal IT services business. There have been -- if I look at GDIT's competitor group, call it, the top five or six main peers, there have been some 40 to 45 acquisitions in that space that those companies have taken on and we have not done any. We've done a couple of small bolt-ons in Mission Systems during that time, but nothing in GDIT space. And so it's interesting to see how the others are behaving in the aftermath of that activity and a lot of the consolidation that's happened in the industry. But I think we put ourselves in very good stead and we see a lot of a lot of others following suit. So I don't think there's a massive sea change in what we have planned ahead, but we'll continue to focus on maintaining our leading position in the market. So I want to make sure I think you're saying technologies as a whole because we don't really give -- or business unit specific margin guidance within the group. But given what you're saying, I think if you look back to prior to the CSRA acquisition, when the IT services side of the business became, frankly, our largest business group and the lion's share, the sort of two thirds, if you will, or more of the technologies grew. We used to -- the combined margin of those businesses used to be in the, call it, the low double digit range, it's usually between 10% and 11% on a fairly consistent basis. Since we acquired CSRA, we've averaged over the past five years 9.8% margin for the group. So what we're seeing right now is really just a shift in the moment where we've had GDIT come through that significant integration effort for the first couple of years followed immediately on the footsteps of that with the impacts of COVID, they've really embarked on a nice steady trajectory now of low single digit growth for several years now, and we expect to see that continue. As Mission Systems in the moment is dealing with the supply chain issues that have been, I think, well addressed, their volume is down a bit. So what we're seeing in terms of the group's margin, aggregate margin, is really nothing more than a shift in the mix between the two. So that's with the increased service side of the business and the lower volumes on the product and hardware side of the business. So as Mission Systems comes through this and gets back on track to a growth level, which we do expect to see happen once they come through these issues, you ought to see the margin on an aggregate basis tick back up. And by the way, that's not -- shouldn't overlook the fact that GDIT on its own is continuing to improve and harvest its margins as it grows. I think I said before, they had their highest margin as a business since we acquired CSRA and their highest earnings contribution to the company ever. So everything, I think, is headed in the right direction, just got to come through the supply chain issues at Mission Systems and that will help influence the mix, and we ought to see a trend back up toward the 10% level over time. And then, Rob, with respect to your second question, as it relates to aerospace book-to-bill, much like going into 2022, we've assumed a return to a 1:1 book-to-bill and that is one of the predicates for our cash flow forecast. So to the extent they outperform, obviously, that could provide some upside. And then on your second question, as it relates to the Ajax unbilled, that's at the end of the year, roughly $1.7 billion is where we stand right now. I don't want to get into the specifics of how much we expect to collect this year, that's part of ongoing discussions with that customer. But needless to say, as I mentioned in my remarks, we do have good reason to expect those cash receipts to resume before the end of this quarter. And so we'll start to see that unbilled balance come down."

            "name": "Phebe Novakovic",
            "content": "Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.58 per diluted share on revenue of $10,850 million, operating earnings of $1,230 million and net earnings of $992 million. Revenue is up $559 million or 5.4% against the fourth quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $41 million or 3.5%. Net earnings are up $40 million or 4.2% and earnings per share are up $0.19 to 5.6%. So, the quarter-over-quarter results compare very favorably and are in most respects consistent with our forecast and sell side consensus. The sequential results are even better. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by $876 million or 8.8%, operating earnings by $129 million or 11.7%. Net earnings by $90 million or 10% and EPS by $0.32, a 9.8% improvement. As promised that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest for the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, earnings per share, operating margins, net earnings and return on sales improved quarter over the previous quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvement. For the full year, we had revenue of $39.4 billion, up 2.4%, net earnings of $3.4 billion, up 4.1% and earnings per fully diluted share of $12.19, up $0.64, a 5.5% increase. So overall, the year was also reasonably consistent with our forecast and modestly better than the sell side. It was a very solid year in a difficult environment. Let me ask Jason to provide detail on our overall order activity, very strong backlog and cash performance in the quarter and the year. Thanks, Jason. Now let me review the quarter in the context of the business segment, paying modest attention to the quarter-over-quarter sequential and annual comparisons that are rather straightforward and set out in the press release. First, Aerospace. The story in aerospace is found in the sequential and year-over-year improvement as well as a continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, along with the overall strength of Gulfstream service business and the continuing improvement of Jet Aviation. In the quarter, Aerospace had revenue of $2.5 billion and earnings of $337 million. This represents a 4.4% increase in revenue and an 8% increase in earnings on a sequential basis. For the full year, revenue of $8.57 billion is up $432 million from the prior year, even though we delivered only one more aircraft than we did in 2021. The increase in both revenue and earnings was driven by higher service revenue at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation. Earnings were also helped by somewhat higher margins on delivered aircraft. Fourth quarter revenue and earnings comparison on a quarter-over-quarter basis aren't as attractive because three aircraft we plan to deliver in the fourth quarter slipped into the first quarter this year. Gulfstream had 38 deliveries in the quarter when we had planned to deliver 41. As a result, Aerospace revenue and earnings are somewhat less than anticipated by the sell side for the quarter and for the year, but generally consistent with our forecast. I should also point out that Aerospace margins improved consistently quarter-over-quarter throughout the year. Aerospace demand remained strong. The book-to-bill was 1.2 times in the quarter and 1.4 times at Gulfstream alone. Orders in the quarter were $3 billion, up from $2.7 billion in the third quarter. The aerospace book-to-bill for the year was 1.5 times. To give you a little more color, Gulfstream received 430 new aircraft orders over the past two years, over 400 net orders after default and backlog adjustments as a result of the settlement of a case in arbitration. All said and done, aerospace backlog is up 20% in 2022 and a staggering 68% over the past few years. As we go into the new year, the sales pipeline remains strong and sales activity is at a solid pace. At midyear 2022, we told you to expect revenue of about $8.6 billion and an operating margin of around 12.9%. We actually finished the year with a 13.2% operating margin. In short, we were spot on with respect to revenue and 30 basis points better on operating margin, which led to a $25 million more than forecast in operating earnings. With respect to G700 development, we estimate it will certify this upcoming summer but much depends on available FFA resources. So far, the effort has been very collaborative and is proceeding according to plan with no surprises. In summary, Aerospace exhibited very strong performance in the quarter and for the year. We look forward to a significant increase in deliveries in 2023 at Gulfstream and improved operating margin, but more about that as we get into guidance. We also expect continued growth and margin improvement at Jet. Next, Combat Systems. After a relatively slow start to the year, Combat Systems finished with a powerful fourth quarter. In fact, the fourth quarter of 2022 proved the highest revenue and earnings for Combat Systems in over 10 years. Revenue in the quarter was $2.18 billion, and it's up 15.5% from the year ago quarter. Operating earnings of $332 million are up 18.1% on a 30 basis point increase in operating margin. OTS alone captured more than one-third of its revenue and earnings in the fourth quarter. The revenue growth was largely driven by Mobile Protected Firepower, Abrams for Poland and the large international order in Canada. OTS enjoyed higher revenue across all lines of business with particular strength in artillery rounds. Not surprising, the sequential comparisons are even better. Revenue is up $391 million or 21.9% and earnings are up $61 million or 22.5% on the strength of a 15.2% operating margin. From an orders perspective, Combat had a very good year in 2022 with a book-to-bill of 1.1 times, driven by MPS, very strong international demand for the Abrams main battle tank as well as growing demand on the munition side of the business. By the way, Combat's annual performance is fairly consistent with the forecast we provided you earlier in the year. Revenue and operating earnings are up somewhat and operating margin is a little lower. In short, this group had a wonderful quarter, continued its history of strong margin performance and had good order activity and a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. Marine Systems. The Marine Systems growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $2,970 billion is up 3.4% over the year ago quarter. Revenue was also up 7.2% sequentially and 4.9% for the full year. Operating earnings are up about 1% over the year ago, of less than 0.5% sequentially and up 2.6% for the full year. Once again, this is the highest full year of revenue and earnings ever for the Marine group. A little perspective may be of assistance here. Marine Systems has grown revenue from $8 billion in 2017 to $11 billion in 2022, this is a 5.3% compound annual growth rate with an average increase of $600 million per year. Earnings have grown from $685 million in 2017 to $900 million in 2022, a 5.5% compound annual growth rate. In addition, Marine had strong orders in the quarter, generating a 2.2 times book-to-bill, including the receipt of a $5.1 billion contract modification to Colombia. Our forecast to you in July of last year anticipated revenue of about $10.8 billion, operating margin of 8.3% and operating earnings of $896 million. We came in above that for revenue, a little lower on the predicted operating margin and right on the forecasted earnings. So, Jason is going to give you a little color on the Technologies Group, his new responsibility, provide a bit of perspective on balance sheet, other income and expense items, and I will close with our outlook for 2023. Thanks, Jason. So, let me provide our operating forecast for 2023 with some color around our outlook for each of the business groups and then a company-wide roll-up. In 2023, we expect Aerospace revenue to be around $10.4 billion, up between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. Margin is expected to be up 140 basis points to 14.6%. Gulfstream deliveries will be around 145, up a little over 20%. This is all consistent with the multiyear forecast we gave you in January of 2021 and at the end of Q2. In Combat Systems, at this time last year, we had anticipated revenue to be down slightly in 2023, following a modest decline in 2022 with a return to low single digit growth later in our planning horizon. Since then, the threat environment has clearly changed. Continuing the better-than-expected performance in 2022, we expect the group to hold steady again in '23 with revenue of $7.3 billion and operating margin once again towards the high end of their reliable 14% to 15% range at 14.7%. The improved outlook is a result of strong order activity we saw in 2022, including the MPF Award and growing international demand, particularly the tank order in Poland, which came in sooner than had been anticipated. We're seeing demand signals resulting from the war in Ukraine, but we've only just begun to see that manifest in our backlog at this point. To the extent those demand signals start to convert into order activity, we could see some opportunity for additional revenue in the latter part of the year, particularly in our armaments and munition business. As I noted earlier, Marine Group has been on a remarkable growth journey, averaging $600 million a year. Our outlook of $400 million to $500 million per year over time remains unchanged. However, the supply chain constraints of the Virginia program will drive some annual variability this year. As a result, the group's revenue for 2023 will remain essentially flat at $10.9 billion as well their operating margin rate at 8.1%. We anticipate a return to growth in 2024 and 2025 at around $600 million a year. We expect revenue in the range of $12.5 billion to $12.6 billion in the Technologies Group. To give you a little color behind this outlook, GDIT will continue to grow at a low single digit pace consistent with the past two years. Mission Systems, however, will be challenged from a revenue perspective, particularly in the first half of the year as they work through the lingering supply chain issues they've been dealing with for the past 18 months. As a result, their revenue will be down slightly compared with 2022. The resulting shift in the group's revenue mix, with stronger service activity but lower hardware volume was yield in operating margin in the 9.5% range, sustaining their industry leading performance, albeit slightly lower than 2022. So, for 2023, company-wide, we expect to see approximately $41.2 billion to $41.3 billion of revenue, an increase of almost 5%. We anticipate operating margin of 10.9%, up 20 basis points from 2022. This all goes up to a forecast range of $12.60 to $12.65 per fully diluted share. On a quarterly basis, we expect a pattern similar to what we've seen in recent years with sequential increases in revenue and operating margins throughout the year. As always, this forecast is purely from operations. It assumes we buy only enough shares to hold the share count steady to avoid dilution from option exercises. Beating our EPS guidance must come from outperforming the operating plan and the effective deployment of capital. Let me close with an observation. Our forecast comes from our operating plan. It is conservative as it must be in this environment of unpredictable financing of the government. However, the threat environment suggests increases in defense spending. In short, I see more opportunity than risk in our forecast. With that, I'll turn it over to Howard to start the Q&A. So with respect to our capital deployment, we'll continue to invest in our business where prudent. We'll continue to maintain our dividend and we'll repurchase shares accordingly. So I don't see any big change in the priorities at least for our execution. So let me go in order. We had, as I noted, three airplanes have slipped into this quarter. One was simply an issue that we just couldn't get it completed in time and two of them were customer preferences for international deliveries. With respect to the production next year, we are confident that we can make that and our trajectory going forward past this year remains the same. So directionally and we're right on track, and we're comfortable we get there. So let's deconstruct that and I think we have to posit few truth. We went into COVID with scheduled variants on Virginia. Virginia is also about a third of the Electric Boat revenue. COVID had a profound impact on many aspects of our lives, but particularly lasting one on the workforce. We had labor discontinuities throughout the United States and we also experienced something that we had not anticipated abnormally large retirement of experienced workers. In a business that is heavily manpower dependent, these impacts had a disproportionate effect on additional schedule variants. We are working with the Navy who's been quite active and engaged in helping develop a plan and a really detailed action list on how to address these issues. And ship building and the supply chain are fixed by incremental improvements over time. So, what do we see at the moment? We see stabilization in the workforce. I think across the nation, we've got a little bit better labor dynamics than we did immediately coming out of COVID. We also have additional experience in what some of the challenges have been. So the way I look at it, this year will give us a bit of a chance to dig further see funds to the velocity of the material coming into Electric Boat. And that ought to be a good thing for all involved despite and notwithstanding the considerable issues around schedules. I would note that the Submarine Industrial base delivered two submarines last year, and we're going to deliver two more this year. So, I think maintaining that cadence of delivery is important. But in much of shipbuilding, milestones are difficult to identify really until you get the ship in the customers' hands. So, as I said, we're working very closely with the Navy to ensure that we could just get back some of that schedule variance on the remainder of the Block 4 ships and on the Block 5 ships. So we're about 30% done on the first ship and we are ahead of the contract schedule. Not with respect to ACAS. And I think we have, as I've said on earlier calls and to many of you in person, we'll just take our lead from our Navy customer on how they want us to respond to all of this. So this is really an intergovernmental series of discussions and agreements and we will, of course, support whatever the Navy plan is going forward. So, if you look at the services funding over, I'd say, in the modern air post World War II, the Army gets funded when they're tactical challenges and tactical problems, either a hot war, relatively cold war or preparedness, this is an issue where we've got both strategic challenges in which the Navy and the Air Force tend to get funded. And as I noted, the threat environment has materially changed. So that has driven increased interest in a number of Army and land forces capabilities. And as we've begun to see those show up in our in our backlog and in our order book, but we've got more room to grow and more room to go there as some of this demand converts into actual orders. So, when I think about what's going on in Europe, our European Combat Vehicle business has done quite well in securing a number of contracts, both historically but increasingly recently and on a -- what we expect on a going forward basis. They've been active in Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Luxembourg. By the way, I wrote all those down because that's a lot of countries. So I think the closer you are to the threat, the more urgent you feel your funding requirements. So all of which is to say, we have changed our expectations for Combat Systems growth. By the way, overarching all of this is a need to increase our ammunition and projectile output, and we've been working with the Army for the last three, four, five months on exactly that kind of plan. So as we've always posited, the threat environment really drives demand for defense products and we're seeing some of that now. The margins are pretty darn good. We have performed what we had told you. And so we were pretty pleased with that. I would note that one of the headwinds is R&D. So the additional work that has been required from the airworthiness directive and the new FAA requirements as a result of the MAX have driven increased R&D. And we'll continue to see some of that and then that will begin to unwind. But I think those are very strong margins and better than we had anticipated in our guidance to you. So I think what we're looking at now is low single digit growth. So if we see anything over time that accelerates that, we'll certainly let you know that that's our best planning in the moment in consultation with our customer. So I think that's more in '24. One of the big issues there, as I said, is Virginia. But look, the way I look at the defense portfolio, we have an extremely strong backlog and now it's just a question of executing, executing across that portfolio. So I'm not too worried about growth on the defense side at all nor on the aerospace side. There is one thing that I think we're focused on, we should be focused on, and I neglected to mention this earlier. But with respect to execution, one of the things that we can do on Virginia and frankly at EB, in general, is to continue to improve our operating performance. That provides us more ability to cover some of the perturbations that are coming out of the supply chain. So I really think about all of this as execution. Growth comes when it comes. We've got the backlog to support it. And so I like the position we're in, frankly. So we still expect the G700 to convert -- get certified this summer. And the G800 will be about six months after that, so we don't see any change in that. And the relationship has been going very well with the FAA. So we are continuing to look forward to finishing all the certification processes. Now that -- I will tell you that is outside our complete control, a lot of this is FAA resources and their ability to focus, given all the other demands that they have on them, but so far so good. I guess, we lost him. We expect low single digit growth in our service side. And we continue to invest prudently when we see the need for more service capacity. But at the moment, we're pretty -- nothing really outstanding in that regard. You've got the capacity to accommodate what we see as reasonable steady growth. I think the FAA has done a good job managing its portfolio and a series of complex and multifaceted requirements. And so far, we are sticking to what we believe is a reasonable expectation for the certification. Staffing is not an issue here. There is plenty of capacity on the combat vehicle side, both tracked and wheeled. So to the extent that the US government intends to execute any contracts with respect to some of these bilateral agreements that they are developing, we can -- it's well within the capacity of the industrial base to accommodate. With respect to our pipeline, I noted that it remains strong. I would also say that corporate America has been very active, both public and private companies, high net worth individuals. Europe remains slow. Mid East just picked up. Southeast Asia, let's say, not China, has been increasingly active. So we've got a good demand across all of our offerings in all of our aircraft. So I think we expect R&D to begin to go down at the end of next year. And look, we have Gulfstream is an extremely high performing operationally strong company. And so I think we have demonstrated incremental improvement in margins as our operating efficiency and discipline in our supply chain, engineering. And really on the shop floor, all of that has improved. So I think there's upward over time, margin opportunity, but we're not going to get into parsing specifics until we have good clarity. But we're very comfortable that we will improve steadily and repeatedly. Yes, I think that that's a broader question than I'm able to answer. What I can tell you is that our relationship and working relationship with the FAA has matured significantly. And we think we all have a very clear understanding of what the new requirements are and how to execute them."

Please note, that this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference call over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Howard, please go ahead.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you operator and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter 2022 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. With that completed, I turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.26 per diluted share and revenue of $10 billion. Operating earnings of $1.1 billion and net earnings of $902 million. Revenue is up, $407 million or 4.3% against the third quarter last year.  Operating earnings are up $18 million or 1.7%. Net earnings are up 4.9% and earnings per share are up 6.2%. So the quarter-over-quarter results compare favorably.  The sequential results are even better. Here we beat last quarter's revenue by 8.6%, operating earnings by 12.3%, net earnings by 17.8% and EPS by 18.5%. We beat consensus by $0.11 per share on somewhat higher revenue than anticipated by the sell side. Operating margin is about as anticipated. Most of the beat came from various other items including a lower tax rate than anticipated by the sell side.  On a year-to-date basis, net earnings are up $93 million or 4% and earnings per share are up $0.45 a strong 5.5%. We also had another very strong quarter from a cash perspective, net cash flow provided by operating activities is $1,280 billion. Free cash flow was $1.03 billion, a 114% of net income.  This follows a very strong cash performance in the first half. Order performance was good in the quarter across all segments and particularly strong at Gulfstream. You will hear more detail on cash and backlog from Jason a little later.  In summary, we enjoyed a strong quarter particularly so unlighted supply chain foreign exchange and inflation headwinds. So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments. First Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $2,350 billion and operating earnings of $312 million with a 13.3% operating margin.  Revenue is $281 million more than a year ago quarter up 13.6%. Operating earnings up $50 million more, up 19.1% on higher revenue and a 60 basis point improvement in margins. The sequential improvement is even better, revenue is up $480 million or 25.7% and operating earnings are up $74 million or 31.1%.  To be fair, the prior quarters revenue and earnings were somewhat lower as a result of the inability to deliver for Aircraft, due the airworthiness directive, which was fully resolved in the third quarter. From an audit perspective, this was yet another good quarter reflecting continuing strong demand. The Aerospace book-to-bill was 1.15:1, Gulfstream Aircraft alone had a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 and 1.9:1 year-to-date.  The first point and perspective since the end of the third quarter of 2021, Aerospace total backlog has grown $4,362 billion, to reach a very robust $19.1 billion. Despite apparent macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to experience a strong level of interest, good activity and a replenishing pipeline, Certainly, demand in the quarter was not as super-heated as prior quarters, but still the book-to-bill was very good against a significant increase in deliveries. Only time will tell about the macroeconomic impact, but we continue to see strong interest in Gulfstream aircraft and services. From a product perspective, the G500 and G600 of now seen FAA removed the wind-related airworthiness directive right on the schedule we had previously forecast. Almost the entire fleet had received the installation of the upgraded software by the end of the quarter. We have delivered 188 of these aircraft to customers through the end of the quarter. The G500, G600 together led the quarter in orders follow closely by G650. This is a very successful program with real market momentum. With respect to G700 development, the control law software validation is scheduled to begin FAA-type inspection authorization during the first week of November. We estimate we will certify this upcoming summer but much depends on available FAA resources. Gulfstream had 35 deliveries in the quarter. If everything goes as planned, we'll deliver 40 to 41 aircraft in the fourth quarter. I haven't said much about Jet Aviation, but suffice it to say, it performed well in the quarter with improving margins in its MRO activities. In short, Aerospace exhibited very strong performance in the quarter and should have an even stronger fourth quarter. Next, Combat. Combat Systems had very similar results on a quarter over year ago quarter basis, but with strong improvement sequentially. The Combat Systems revenue of $1.790 billion is up 2.5% from the year ago quarter. earnings are down 1.8% on a 60 basis point reduction in operating margin. Nevertheless, the operating margin in the quarter is an impressive 15.2%.  On a sequential basis, Combat Systems revenue is up $122 million or 7.3%, while operating earnings are up a very significant 10.6% on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin. Demand across the segment provided a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 with a large order for Abrams main battle tanks for Poland, orders for $370 million for munitions and ordinance, and in order for 39 labs from the Canadian government.  We also received our first order related to the Ukraine at our munitions business. All of this increases the Combat Systems total backlog to $13.8 billion. In summary, this was an impressive new business quarter with strong operating performance once again by the Combat Systems group. Next, Marine. Revenue of $2.8 billion is up $132 million, 5% over the year ago quarter. This quarter's revenue growth was distributed fairly evenly between electric boat and NASCO. Revenue is also up $118 million or 4.5% sequentially. Year-to-date revenue is up $415 million or 5.4%. Revenue in this group has been up for the last 20 quarters on a quarter-over-quarter basis. This is very impressive continued consistent growth. Operating earnings are $238 million in the quarter, up $9 million or 3.9% on operating margins of 8.6%. On a sequential basis, operating earnings are $27 million or an impressive 12.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in margin. At Electric Boat, the Columbia first ship remains on cost and on contract schedule. The ship is more than 25% complete. NASCO had a particularly good quarter with improved TAO revenue and better margins across the board. From an orders perspective, Electric Boat received a large maintenance and modernization order for the USS Hartford. NASCO received orders for an additional ESB and 2 TAO oilers. As a result, book-to-bill was 1.1:1, leading to a $400 million increase in backlog. Throughout the group, we have a solid backlog of new construction and repair work. Our programs are also well supported in the FY '23 budget. In summary, revenue growth is clearly visible. And as I've said before, the real opportunity given the steady revenue visibility is margin improvement over time. Moving to Technologies. This segment has revenue of $3.71 billion in the quarter, down $49 million from the year ago quarter or 1.6%. The revenue decrease was fairly evenly split in dollar terms between Mission Systems and IT. Mission Systems suffered from nagging supply chain disruptions and the failure of some government customers to obligate funds for authorized and appropriated products. In the case of IT services, it was largely timing and program mix. Operating earnings of $285 million are down $42 million or 12.8% on a 120 basis point reduction in operating margin, exclusively attributed to Mission Systems and largely related to the issues impacting revenue. Total backlog remains relatively consistent over all comparative periods with a book-to-bill of 1:1 in good order prospects on the horizon. The pipeline remains very active at both businesses.  GDIT enjoyed another solid operating quarter with healthy earnings and particularly strong cash in part due to good results in the federal civilian division. While we continue to see procurement delays, GDIT's year-to-date wins exceeded full year 2021 awards in dollar terms. These wins highlight the nice momentum in the business as GDIT begins to realize the benefits from targeted investments in the technical differentiation of its offerings. And this, despite the more than $3.5 billion tied up in prolonged protest and nearly $17 billion pending adjudication at the end of the third quarter. On the people front, GDIT remains focused on attracting and retaining the very best technology talent. The culture of this business has created. One of empowerment, accountability and inclusivity is a clear differentiator and a fiercely competitive talent market. Mission Systems experienced a series of challenges in the third quarter, additional supply chain disruptions, inflation, labor availability and select intel programs and customer contracting delays. Many mission system customers have a serious shortage of contracting officers that have hampered their ability to execute on programs of record. In addition, quite understandably, customer focus has been redirected in some areas to meet the more urgent demands of the Ukraine. The business has offset some of the bottom line impact by productivity improvements and cost-cutting initiatives. They will make every effort to catch up in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, we anticipate these fact of life realities to continue for a while. I have more to say on that subject in a moment. That concludes my remarks with respect to a solid quarter for the entire company. So as we look toward the end of the year, we expect performance to be largely in line with the update to guidance that we gave you on the last call. As I just referenced, we expect technologies to fall short of our previous estimates, but we expect aerospace to run somewhat ahead of our previous forecast. All up, they should offset each other. In all other respects, our guidance remains the same. We stand by our previous EPS guidance. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks.\nJason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Starting with our cash performance. It was another strong quarter with operating cash flow of nearly $1.3 billion. This was achieved once again on the strength of the Gulfstream orders and particularly strong cash performance from our Technology segment. This brings us to $3.9 billion of operating cash flow through the first 9 months of the year, which also includes the ongoing collections on our large international combat vehicle contract according to the contract restructure that occurred back in 2020. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was just over $1 billion for the quarter and $3.3 billion year-to-date, yielding a conversion rate of 137% through the first 9 months. The continued strong performance positioned us very well to achieve our target for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income. With respect to the status of the tax treatment of research and development expenses, I think everyone can sense that despite the broad-based bipartisan support for immediate expensing of these investments, the window of opportunity for action in 2022 is quickly closing. As we've said all throughout the year, if the Congress acts to defer or reverse the capitalization requirement, we would expect free cash flow for the year at or above 110% of net income. Looking at capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $255 million in the quarter or 2.6% of sales. That's up from last year, consistent with our expectation to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. For the first 9 months, we're at 2.2% of sales, but 2.5% remains our full year target, so obviously an implied uptick in capital investments in the fourth quarter. We also paid $345 million in dividends during the quarter, bringing the total deployed in dividends and share repurchases through the first 9 months to just over $2.1 billion. The net result at the end of the third quarter was a cash balance of $2.5 billion and a net debt position just under $9 billion, down over $1.5 billion from this time last year. Net interest expense in the quarter was $86 million, down from $99 million in the third quarter of 2021. That brings the interest expense for the first 9 months of the year to $279 million, down from $331 million for the same period in 2021. At this point, we continue to expect our interest expense for the year to be approximately $380 million, including the assumed repayment of $1 billion of notes that mature in the fourth quarter.  The tax rate in the quarter was 14.3%, bringing the rate for the first 9 months to 15.1%. This is consistent with our guidance last quarter to expect a lower rate in the third quarter and a higher rate in the fourth. So no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year, which, of course, implies a higher tax rate in the discrete fourth quarter.  One more comment on the tax front. The inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in August included a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks. We don't expect either of these provisions to have a material impact on our financial results. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the third quarter with a 1.1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As mentioned earlier, Aerospace continued to have a strong order activity with a 1.2 times book-to-bill in the quarter and 1.6 times over the trailing 12 months. On the defense side, the combined book-to-bill was 1.1 times, with each of the segments achieving a book-to-bill of at least 1 times. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $88.8 billion, while total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $125.8 billion. The increase in backlog was particularly notable given a headwind from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $275 million in the quarter and $650 million year-to-date, with the vast majority of the impact in Combat Systems. Incidentally, the FX fluctuations also negatively impacted Combats revenue by $55 million in the quarter and $123 million in the first 9 months of the year due to the surging dollar versus the euro and the British pound. But for the FX headwind, the Combat Systems Group's revenue would have been up by 5.6% in the quarter and down only 3.9% for the first 9 months. That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it over to Howard to start the Q&A.\nHoward Rubel: Thanks, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first telephone question today comes from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Seth, please go ahead, you may begin. \nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. Good morning. Sorry, Jason, to waste a question on pension here, but you guys are a little bit different than your peer group in terms of the way that you account for things. When we think about where interest rates and asset returns are year-to-date and we think about the income below the line next year, where that might migrate to you. And when we think about the cash impact if any, in terms of the contributions that you would expect. Can you give us an update on that?\nJason Aiken: Yes. As you said, Seth, we are somewhat different from most of the peer group in this regard. And as a result, right now, we're not expecting anything material from an income perspective on the pension front. Obviously, that's something we'll roll up as part of our full operating plan process here in the fourth quarter and give you more specific detailed guidance in January. But I think the bottom line is both from an earnings as well as from a cash perspective, we don't expect that at this point to be a material item.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. Just to clarify, the $40 million or so of income below the line each quarter, that kind of continues?\nJason Aiken: Some version in that range. I don't have an exact number at this point. You can expect it to decline as you would modestly. But again, that's not 100% pension income there. It's a big piece of that is pension income on the commercial side of the business. So it should down take a little bit, but not in a material way.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. Okay. And then maybe as a quick follow-up, we saw some news during the quarter about the Australian sub and the potential to do some work on that outside of Australia. And we all kind of know about the capacity constraints on sub building right now. Maybe could you talk a little bit about your thinking on that topic?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So we are driven entirely by the demand of our customer and the prioritization of our customers. So we're working with them, our U.S. Navy, to determine what the focus should be going forward. And as we work through these -- some of these capacity issues then how do we accommodate not only U.S. demand but potentially other demand.\nSeth Seifman: Okay, great. Thanks very much. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from David Straus of Barclays. David, go ahead. \nDavid Strauss: Thanks, good morning. Phebe, were there any unusual costs at the Aerospace segment in the quarter related to the 500, 600 software fix?\nJason Aiken: Yes, David, we did have, I think you're aware, some customer accommodation related to the software issue, both in the second quarter and the third quarter wasn't material to the results, but that has been absorbed in the numbers that you see and is inherent in the improved margins that the group posted in the quarter.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. And it's completely behind nothing lingering in Q4, Jason?\nPhebe Novakovic: Right.\nJason Aiken: That's correct. It's behind us at this point.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. Great. And a follow-up on free cash flow conversion. Given where you are year-to-date, I mean over 100% for the full year looks pretty conservative unless there's something unusual, I guess, from a working capital perspective that you're expecting in or baking in in Q4. Can you just elaborate on that?\nJason Aiken: Yes. As you point out, the cash flow has been particularly strong through the first 9 months. So as I said in the opening remarks, we're very comfortable with the 100-plus percent for the year. To be completely candid, there's probably some opportunity for some upside there. If I look at the things that we're monitoring, number one, to the first 9 months, we've had a significant benefit from working capital reduction. Some of that's timing. So some of that could turn in the fourth quarter. We'll watch that. The other big piece is, as I noted, we're still expecting or forecasting CapEx for the year to be in the 2.5% of sales range. So that implies a pretty meaningful uptick in CapEx in the fourth quarter. I'll acknowledge that often chased our CapEx forecast and rarely hit it. So there could be some upside opportunity there if we don't get everything in, in the year. But if we do that, that's a headwind to the fourth quarter. And frankly, the third item is something that everybody continues to monitor and that is we need to resolve our situation on the Ajax program. So those are some of the things we're monitoring for the fourth quarter. We come through all that. And certainly, to your point, we have some opportunity for some upside.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks very much. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Ron, you may begin.\nRon Epstein: Good morning. Just maybe the supply chain question. It seems like you guys are navigating it really well. Most airplane companies today are having aren't going to deliver more than they thought they were going to deliver the opposite problem. So I guess my question for you is how is the supply chain going for Gulfstream? And then b, when you look at the defense business you have, you heard kind of across the sector, similar issues on chips and so on and so forth. How is it going there?\nPhebe Novakovic: So we've had a fair number of supply chain challenges on the aerospace side, which we have accommodated heretofore. But supply chain remains a potential challenge going forward. And as we go through our planning process in the fourth quarter, we get a lot more clarity airplane by airplane of what the supply chain is able to do. But we have so far managed. There are, however, as you quite rightly note, a fair number of headwinds out there. On the defense side, we have accommodated most of the supply chain perturbations, except obviously in the Marine group. But most profoundly in the quarter and most impactfully is at Mission Systems. And while they had with a lot of the more pedestrian supply chain challenges, specialty chips continue to dog them and the additional delays that they experienced in the quarter were very, very hard for them, in fact, impossible for them to overcome. Mission Systems is a very high-performance organization, and they produced several high-value complex products that have experienced delays before, but again, even beyond some of the chip problems, some of the specialty products going into that production those production lines were also impacted. So the Mission System is credit. They have taken a lot of cost-cutting and restructuring initiatives to offset the margin impact and earnings impact of the revenue decline, but we're going to have to work through some of that. And so more to come as we look into the fourth quarter and then into next year.\nRon Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then maybe as a follow-on, on the labor side, what are you seeing across the businesses, right? We clearly hear from the Navy that they want to have more shipbuilders out there. But I mean what are you seeing across all the businesses you have in the portfolio in terms of skilled labor?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So there are some across the businesses, there are some specialty engineering and specialty fields that have had some headwinds on labor, but those are beginning to resolve in terms of manufacturing, we had some perturbation in -- we've had a lot of perturbation in the labor market, but felt that particularly at constant point, but that's beginning to resolve itself.  When you think about shipbuilding, shipbuilding is a very complex, high touch labor business. And when you have a nationwide perturbation in the labor market is going to be impacted. I mean while we kept open, not all of the supply chain did, but we also lost a number of experienced shipbuilders as well as experienced people manufacturing folks in the supply chain. So all of that at a higher level than we normally experience. And I don't think that we are alone in that. People took the opportunity in the middle of the pandemic to retire. So we've got to work through some of that.  But ultimately, we do not see and I think this is an important point here. We do not see labor as constraint for our revenue growth at the moment. Certainly not in the longer term.\nRon Epstein: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Rod Stallard of Vertical Research. Rod, please proceed.\nRobert Stallard: Good morning. Steve, your comments suggest that we're finally seeing some of this strong defense demand turning into orders. But what sort of time line are you expecting for these orders to actually convert into deliveries.\nPhebe Novakovic: You talking about combat?\nRobert Stallard: Well, across the defense divisions, but firstly, combat. Yes.\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. Let's talk about Combat because I think -- and then we can talk if you want a little bit about technologies. And before I get to combat, marine is pretty clear. The orders continue to be healthy. The revenue projection, while you have some quarterly lumpiness, it signifies nothing for the long-term growth.  With respect to combat, we saw a number of things in the quarter, primarily Stryker and Abrams as well as MPF is beginning to ramp up as in Poland. And we saw some munitions orders also related to the Ukraine. So I suspect that -- and if we parse through, we focus in on the Ukraine, what we anticipate that our U.S. Army customers telling us they want more ammunition and munitions. So we're working with them to ramp up production. In Europe, we've seen demand for bridges because frankly, a lot of water in Europe. And we've got a very nice business in Germany to provide river crossings at various widths and weight levels. And then we\u2019re seeing -- beginning to see increases in vehicle orders and vehicle RFPs coming out, particularly, but not exclusively in the former Eastern block. So technologies is really, I think, a tale of two cities. GDIT has had good bookings. They grew last year. We anticipate them to grow this year. This is all about Mission Systems, as I think, tried to give you a fair amount of detailed color on what's impacting them. The demand for their high-value products is out there. It's just our -- the inability to deliver because of the supply chain is constraining some of the orders, but they're there. They're just waiting to be executed once we get through all of this, and we will, we will get through it.\nRobert Stallard: So just to follow up on combat, and these orders you've had from Europe, for example, is there roughly a 12-month to 2-year lead time between the contract getting signed and actually GD delivering?\nPhebe Novakovic: Completely depends on the product. Less so on the bridge side and it depends and again, less so potentially on the vehicle side, it just depends on the vehicle, and exactly what modifications or changes folks want. We're not looking at clean sheet vehicles. We're looking at changes to existing vehicles that we have updated consistently and throughout the years. So it will depend. I suspect a year, in some cases, 18 months. Certainly, I don't expect a whole lot more than that.\nRobert Stallard: Yes, it was great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Wolfe Research. Myles, please go ahead. \nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. I know that there's the $1 billion maturity coming in November, but curious maybe, Phebe, how you're thinking about capital deployment in a broader sense, obviously, cash flow coming in ahead of expectations. I think. Go ahead. \nPhebe Novakovic: Yes, yes. No, no, no. And that's a very good question. Our capital deployment priorities remain the same. But let me give -- ask Jason to give you a little bit more color on the details.\nJason Aiken: Yes. I think the way to think about it, Myles, we've talked about the $1 billion coming due in November. We do plan to pay that down. When you think on the debt side, we'll have additional maturities coming up in 2023, and that's where we said we'll start to look, think back to the CSRA acquisition and the additional debt we took on, we would bring it down to a point where it's some undefined point in the future, we'd start to think about whether we've hit the right level or not. And I think when we get into next year, we'll start to have that conversation in a more substantive way in terms of decision making. When you look at the other elements, share repurchase, as you know, is always tactical and opportunistic. It was a very volatile market in the third quarter. So we were a little more hands off just kind of trying to see what -- where things shake out, but that doesn't change our long-term approach to share repurchase in a tactical and opportunistic way. And I think importantly, the dividend is always going to be there. You've always heard us talk about that, and we'll continue to expect to be on that trajectory that we've been on for the past quarter century, frankly. So as Phebe said, no changes in the deployment strategy. It will just be a matter of what's in the moment in a given quarter. And I think importantly, our cash flow performance and our liquidity resources afford to see optionality to address all of those priorities without having to forgo one for the sake of the other.\nMyles Walton: And just a quick follow up, Phebe said, it\u2019s the M&A market attractiveness. Is that improved become worse the same?\nPhebe Novakovic: We're just not going to comment on M&A. So I think we can leave it at that. You want one more shot, one more question?\nMyles Walton: No. I'll stay through. I don't want to get Howard Angry.\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes, that's a scary thing, Isn't it?\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. George, go ahead. \nGeorge Shapiro: Yes. Jason, I wonder if I could pin you down a little bit as to how big a number of the software fixes were in the margin for Gulfstream in the quarter. Are we talking a few million dollars or something more?\nJason Aiken: George, I don't actually have a discrete number on the software fix. I mean, I have a sense of the overall R&D budget and that sort of fits into that context. So I think as David asked earlier in terms of impacts to aerospace in the quarter, you saw the nice margin improvement, frankly, even a little bit ahead of where we were expecting, which is why as Phebe alluded, we think we'll -- the group perform better for the full year. But even within those strong results in the quarter, we did have an impact, an adverse impact in terms of the accommodations we made with customers on the 500, 600 airworthiness directive. Again, that's fully behind us. And we are in a, at this point, sustained elevated R&D mode. Part of that was the resources that were diverted from the 700 over to the 500, 600 AD fix, and that will sustain through next year, as we've talked about as we continue towards certification of the 700 and then ultimately the 800. So I'll give you a little more color around that, but I apologize, I don't have a discrete number around the airworthiness directed fix.\nGeorge Shapiro: Okay. And then a quick one, Phebe, a usual question. There's a $59 million difference between the gross and the net bookings in Aerospace. Was that a cancellation? Was it FX related? Or if you can quantify that?\nPhebe Novakovic: All of the above. I mean really absolutely immaterial.\nGeorge Shapiro: Okay. And let me sneak in one last one. \nPhebe Novakovic: You're risking Howard's ire. Go, George.\nGeorge Shapiro: I always got Howard's ire. That's okay. when you commented about your deliveries in '23 and '24, it presupposed the book-to-bill of 1. Obviously, we've run a lot better than that. So are you thinking of changing those delivery forecasts or just stay conservative with the delivery forecast that you have out there?\nPhebe Novakovic: Not at the moment. We assumed 1:1, and at the moment, I don't see any reason to change that. But as we go through our planning process, to the extent that we need to modify it, we certainly will and we'll be very explicit about that in the fourth quarter.\nGeorge Shapiro: Okay. Thanks very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kristine Liwag of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nPhebe Novakovic: Kristine. Hello?\nKristine Liwag: Sorry about that. You guys hear me.\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes.\nKristine Liwag: Okay. Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And Phebe, on international defense sales, we're seeing changes in relationship between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. With your foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia through Canada, how do we think about this evolving relationship potentially affecting your business?\nPhebe Novakovic: We see no indication of that in a moment. You want to ask one more. \nKristine Liwag: Yes, following up on what George was asking about on aerospace. I mean book-to-bill was at 1times at aerospace. We've seen this above 2 times in the past few quarters. But at the same time, the backlog is at record levels. Can you provide some color on the demand resilience you're seeing? Is this a demand from corporate customers, individuals? And then also, is there some sort of level of backlog where you're comfortable at so not to extend the duration of when people have to wait for their aircraft. Any color you could provide there would be really helpful.\nPhebe Novakovic: Sure. So we -- let's take your question in the inverter. We always watch the delivery times for our aircraft to our customers. And so far, that's all been manageable. Well, just to remind you, starting in mid-February of last year, we frankly entered the hottest in notranic demand market that I've ever seen. And the order level in the quarter was by any measure, spectacular.  So we've seen strong U.S. demand, Fortune 500 Mideast, Southeast Asia. And our demand interestingly, and I think not surprisingly, our pipeline going into the fourth quarter looks very much like the pipeline going into the third quarter. So at the moment, we've got some pretty good visibility of what orders look like.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen. Cai, please go ahead. \nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much, and good results, Phebe. So how is the software accommodation split between the second and third quarter. And as we look going forward, with that out of the way, and presumably R&D flat to down and volume up, what should we look for about the margins in the fourth quarter and going forward?\nPhebe Novakovic: So we'll see some margin upside, which we alluded to or about stated rather, in our guidance for the year. But the software fixes work almost entirely done by the end of the second quarter and the financial issue, it's about 50-50. So we're -- we like where we are. And frankly, you haven't asked this, but let me just give you a little bit of transparency around that. The transparency of the engineering resources that -- and the cooperation between the FAA and the Gulfstream was very strong and very apparent throughout that process. So we expect that kind of relationship to continue.\nJason Aiken: If I could add just 1 thing. Cai, there was a predicate in your question that R&D would be coming down, we don't yet expect R&D to be coming down. If you look through next year with the 700 and the 800 will remain at a sustained and potentially even elevated level next year. So I just want to make sure that point is also clear.\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. Good point.\nCai von Rumohr: Excellent. And as a follow-up, if we turn to GDIT, you mentioned $3.5 billion in protest, $17 billion in bids awaiting. How does that compare with the second quarter? And given that they lifted the occupancy restrictions at DoD in the middle of September, have we seen a pickup in any of that flowing through to bookings?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes, we have. But tell me again what the first part of your question was?\nCai von Rumohr: Well, you had $17 billion in business awaiting at $3.5 billion in progress.\nPhebe Novakovic: Some of the protests have resolved to our favor. And these are -- when we say protest, these are items that we've won that have been protested. And we've got one in there that's got to be approaching the federal level of number of protests. So hopefully, we'll get through that in the fourth quarter. And I think there's -- it's down somewhat, as I said, because they've resolved. But we still see a fair amount of proposals in the decision-making cycle, which has, as we've said elongated. But even given that, GDIT continues to grow.\nCai von Rumohr: Thank you, very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Herbert of RBC. Ken, proceed. \nKenneth Herbert: Yes, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to first ask on the schedule for the 7 and the 800. Is it fair to assume that resources that were diverted from the 700 are now 100% back on that program? And in the last few months, considering issues, okay, great, considering issues on the 5 and 6 have been resolved. Are you seeing anything else from the FAA that could potentially put entry to service schedules at risk?\nPhebe Novakovic: So as I said, we've cooperated very well with the FAA. We expect that to continue. I would note that we learned a lot in that process of how to work through the new software requirements from the FAA. I think that, coupled with the fact that the G700 is the most mature aircraft to enter the FAA certification process as a result of its software system and considerable and successful testing that preceded FAA review. We see -- we're sticking with our at the moment with our summer 2023 estimate. But look, when we give you sort of our best guess on when the certification is. That's a result of a lot of things that we control and that we can talk about with certainty. But ultimately, this is an FAA issue, and it's the availability of their resources, and they are the regulator and they're going to control it. So we've always tried to be transparent about that, but recognize that the U.S. government controls ultimately the pace.\nKenneth Herbert: Okay. Very helpful. And if I could, just 1 quick follow-up. On the defense side, how would you look at the risk of your business if for whatever reason, we have a continuing resolution that extends into calendar '23?\nPhebe Novakovic: At the moment, we don't see a particular risk. And if we get 3 to 4 quarters in the entire year of a CR, which I find in this threat environment, very difficult to imagine. And we'd have to come back at you. But nothing we hear would suggest that it's the desire of Congress to do that.\nKenneth Herbert: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Doug, please go ahead. \nDoug Harned: Good morning. Thank you. When you look at the demand you're seeing at Gulfstream right now, can you give us kind of a picture of how this looks? And what I mean is we're seeing a lot of things such as first-time customers going straight to large cabin jets, perhaps shifts in international versus U.S. Can you give us a picture of what that outlook is today for you? And has that changed some over the past couple of years?\nPhebe Novakovic: So I think you and I, a couple of years ago, had a discussion about structural versus cyclical change. And I still think it's premature to see any to declare that there's been a structural change. We've certainly seen some increase in first-time buyers, but that was in part because a lot of wealth was created during the pandemic. The higher the pandemic. So I don't have exact data about what's in the pipeline, but I can imagine that it will be much different than this quarter, which is heavy U.S. Fortune 500, again, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.\nDoug Harned: And then just switching over, earlier when you talked about munitions, this is something that also looks like -- it looks like there's a lot of potential growth here. How do you think about this? I mean, I think of it as a high-margin business for you within Combat and potential to have orders well beyond that 3.70 that you got this quarter?\nPhebe Novakovic: So -- and I think I may have alluded to this in my remarks that, our customer has expressed an interest in increasing that demand. So we're working with them on increasing production. But I think your predicated about a high-margin business is not quite based. In fact, we are -- OTS where we do all of this work is a high-performance organization with respect to operating leverage. But that comes from a very wide and vast portfolio. So we do okay, but I wouldn't say that they were additive.\nDoug Harned: So you don't think of it as a higher-margin business. I just thought traditionally, it was a higher-margin business than perhaps some of the other parts of combat vehicles, and that's not the case?\nPhebe Novakovic: OTS, on occasion, will be a higher-margin business, but that's largely about mix, and it's not driven by 1 particular line of business. They've got an awful lot of contracts and the high-velocity contract turnover. So I think that's how you should think about them.\nHoward Rubel: Thanks, Doug. Lisa, we'll take one more question, please. This will be our final.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Scott Deuschle of Credit Suisse. Go ahead. \nScott Deuschle: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jason, I think ROIC is something that you've historically been very focused on. And honestly, it's held up really well here despite the capital that you put in the business. So just curious, as you get past the bulk of the CapEx phase of marine working capital comes out of the business and you have margins reflected aerospace? Where do you think ROIC can go over the next few years?\nJason Aiken: It's a great question. Obviously, as we've been in this period of extended investment, you'd expect to see ROIC become a little bit muted as a result. And we saw a little bit of a downtick in that during that investment period. But as we emerge having had essentially the investment period behind us. To your point, we absolutely expect to see ROIC back on decline. We'll see that this year, and we expect to see it next year and beyond. So our targets over the long term ought to be back in the range as we were in prior to the investment period we entered into a few years ago, and that's what you should expect as well.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. Great. And then Jason, does the recently announced facility expansion of Savannah, does that have any impact to the prior guidance you gave on '23 CapEx? Or was that embedded in the 2% figure you previously talked about? Thank you.\nJason Aiken: Yes, that's all embedded and now look we've given previously. So no change to those projections.\nScott Deuschle: Great. Thank you so much. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session. I'll hand back to the management team for any closing remarks.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you all for joining us today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for both our earnings release and, of course, our highlights presentation. If you have any other questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. Starting with our cash performance. It was another strong quarter with operating cash flow of nearly $1.3 billion. This was achieved once again on the strength of the Gulfstream orders and particularly strong cash performance from our Technology segment. This brings us to $3.9 billion of operating cash flow through the first 9 months of the year, which also includes the ongoing collections on our large international combat vehicle contract according to the contract restructure that occurred back in 2020. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was just over $1 billion for the quarter and $3.3 billion year-to-date, yielding a conversion rate of 137% through the first 9 months. The continued strong performance positioned us very well to achieve our target for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income. With respect to the status of the tax treatment of research and development expenses, I think everyone can sense that despite the broad-based bipartisan support for immediate expensing of these investments, the window of opportunity for action in 2022 is quickly closing. As we've said all throughout the year, if the Congress acts to defer or reverse the capitalization requirement, we would expect free cash flow for the year at or above 110% of net income. Looking at capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $255 million in the quarter or 2.6% of sales. That's up from last year, consistent with our expectation to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. For the first 9 months, we're at 2.2% of sales, but 2.5% remains our full year target, so obviously an implied uptick in capital investments in the fourth quarter. We also paid $345 million in dividends during the quarter, bringing the total deployed in dividends and share repurchases through the first 9 months to just over $2.1 billion. The net result at the end of the third quarter was a cash balance of $2.5 billion and a net debt position just under $9 billion, down over $1.5 billion from this time last year. Net interest expense in the quarter was $86 million, down from $99 million in the third quarter of 2021. That brings the interest expense for the first 9 months of the year to $279 million, down from $331 million for the same period in 2021. At this point, we continue to expect our interest expense for the year to be approximately $380 million, including the assumed repayment of $1 billion of notes that mature in the fourth quarter.  The tax rate in the quarter was 14.3%, bringing the rate for the first 9 months to 15.1%. This is consistent with our guidance last quarter to expect a lower rate in the third quarter and a higher rate in the fourth. So no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year, which, of course, implies a higher tax rate in the discrete fourth quarter.  One more comment on the tax front. The inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in August included a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks. We don't expect either of these provisions to have a material impact on our financial results. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the third quarter with a 1.1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As mentioned earlier, Aerospace continued to have a strong order activity with a 1.2 times book-to-bill in the quarter and 1.6 times over the trailing 12 months. On the defense side, the combined book-to-bill was 1.1 times, with each of the segments achieving a book-to-bill of at least 1 times. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $88.8 billion, while total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $125.8 billion. The increase in backlog was particularly notable given a headwind from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of approximately $275 million in the quarter and $650 million year-to-date, with the vast majority of the impact in Combat Systems. Incidentally, the FX fluctuations also negatively impacted Combats revenue by $55 million in the quarter and $123 million in the first 9 months of the year due to the surging dollar versus the euro and the British pound. But for the FX headwind, the Combat Systems Group's revenue would have been up by 5.6% in the quarter and down only 3.9% for the first 9 months. That concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it over to Howard to start the Q&A. Yes. As you said, Seth, we are somewhat different from most of the peer group in this regard. And as a result, right now, we're not expecting anything material from an income perspective on the pension front. Obviously, that's something we'll roll up as part of our full operating plan process here in the fourth quarter and give you more specific detailed guidance in January. But I think the bottom line is both from an earnings as well as from a cash perspective, we don't expect that at this point to be a material item. Some version in that range. I don't have an exact number at this point. You can expect it to decline as you would modestly. But again, that's not 100% pension income there. It's a big piece of that is pension income on the commercial side of the business. So it should down take a little bit, but not in a material way. Yes, David, we did have, I think you're aware, some customer accommodation related to the software issue, both in the second quarter and the third quarter wasn't material to the results, but that has been absorbed in the numbers that you see and is inherent in the improved margins that the group posted in the quarter. That's correct. It's behind us at this point. Yes. As you point out, the cash flow has been particularly strong through the first 9 months. So as I said in the opening remarks, we're very comfortable with the 100-plus percent for the year. To be completely candid, there's probably some opportunity for some upside there. If I look at the things that we're monitoring, number one, to the first 9 months, we've had a significant benefit from working capital reduction. Some of that's timing. So some of that could turn in the fourth quarter. We'll watch that. The other big piece is, as I noted, we're still expecting or forecasting CapEx for the year to be in the 2.5% of sales range. So that implies a pretty meaningful uptick in CapEx in the fourth quarter. I'll acknowledge that often chased our CapEx forecast and rarely hit it. So there could be some upside opportunity there if we don't get everything in, in the year. But if we do that, that's a headwind to the fourth quarter. And frankly, the third item is something that everybody continues to monitor and that is we need to resolve our situation on the Ajax program. So those are some of the things we're monitoring for the fourth quarter. We come through all that. And certainly, to your point, we have some opportunity for some upside. Yes. I think the way to think about it, Myles, we've talked about the $1 billion coming due in November. We do plan to pay that down. When you think on the debt side, we'll have additional maturities coming up in 2023, and that's where we said we'll start to look, think back to the CSRA acquisition and the additional debt we took on, we would bring it down to a point where it's some undefined point in the future, we'd start to think about whether we've hit the right level or not. And I think when we get into next year, we'll start to have that conversation in a more substantive way in terms of decision making. When you look at the other elements, share repurchase, as you know, is always tactical and opportunistic. It was a very volatile market in the third quarter. So we were a little more hands off just kind of trying to see what -- where things shake out, but that doesn't change our long-term approach to share repurchase in a tactical and opportunistic way. And I think importantly, the dividend is always going to be there. You've always heard us talk about that, and we'll continue to expect to be on that trajectory that we've been on for the past quarter century, frankly. So as Phebe said, no changes in the deployment strategy. It will just be a matter of what's in the moment in a given quarter. And I think importantly, our cash flow performance and our liquidity resources afford to see optionality to address all of those priorities without having to forgo one for the sake of the other. George, I don't actually have a discrete number on the software fix. I mean, I have a sense of the overall R&D budget and that sort of fits into that context. So I think as David asked earlier in terms of impacts to aerospace in the quarter, you saw the nice margin improvement, frankly, even a little bit ahead of where we were expecting, which is why as Phebe alluded, we think we'll -- the group perform better for the full year. But even within those strong results in the quarter, we did have an impact, an adverse impact in terms of the accommodations we made with customers on the 500, 600 airworthiness directive. Again, that's fully behind us. And we are in a, at this point, sustained elevated R&D mode.

So I'll give you a little more color around that, but I apologize, I don't have a discrete number around the airworthiness directed fix. If I could add just 1 thing. Cai, there was a predicate in your question that R&D would be coming down, we don't yet expect R&D to be coming down. If you look through next year with the 700 and the 800 will remain at a sustained and potentially even elevated level next year. So I just want to make sure that point is also clear. It's a great question. Obviously, as we've been in this period of extended investment, you'd expect to see ROIC become a little bit muted as a result. And we saw a little bit of a downtick in that during that investment period. But as we emerge having had essentially the investment period behind us.

            "name": "Phebe Novakovic",
            "content": "Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.26 per diluted share and revenue of $10 billion. Operating earnings of $1.1 billion and net earnings of $902 million. Revenue is up, $407 million or 4.3% against the third quarter last year.  Operating earnings are up $18 million or 1.7%. Net earnings are up 4.9% and earnings per share are up 6.2%. So the quarter-over-quarter results compare favorably.  The sequential results are even better. Here we beat last quarter's revenue by 8.6%, operating earnings by 12.3%, net earnings by 17.8% and EPS by 18.5%. We beat consensus by $0.11 per share on somewhat higher revenue than anticipated by the sell side. Operating margin is about as anticipated. Most of the beat came from various other items including a lower tax rate than anticipated by the sell side.  On a year-to-date basis, net earnings are up $93 million or 4% and earnings per share are up $0.45 a strong 5.5%. We also had another very strong quarter from a cash perspective, net cash flow provided by operating activities is $1,280 billion. Free cash flow was $1.03 billion, a 114% of net income.  This follows a very strong cash performance in the first half. Order performance was good in the quarter across all segments and particularly strong at Gulfstream. You will hear more detail on cash and backlog from Jason a little later.  In summary, we enjoyed a strong quarter particularly so unlighted supply chain foreign exchange and inflation headwinds. So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments. First Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $2,350 billion and operating earnings of $312 million with a 13.3% operating margin.  Revenue is $281 million more than a year ago quarter up 13.6%. Operating earnings up $50 million more, up 19.1% on higher revenue and a 60 basis point improvement in margins. The sequential improvement is even better, revenue is up $480 million or 25.7% and operating earnings are up $74 million or 31.1%.  To be fair, the prior quarters revenue and earnings were somewhat lower as a result of the inability to deliver for Aircraft, due the airworthiness directive, which was fully resolved in the third quarter. From an audit perspective, this was yet another good quarter reflecting continuing strong demand. The Aerospace book-to-bill was 1.15:1, Gulfstream Aircraft alone had a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 and 1.9:1 year-to-date.  The first point and perspective since the end of the third quarter of 2021, Aerospace total backlog has grown $4,362 billion, to reach a very robust $19.1 billion. Despite apparent macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to experience a strong level of interest, good activity and a replenishing pipeline, Certainly, demand in the quarter was not as super-heated as prior quarters, but still the book-to-bill was very good against a significant increase in deliveries. Only time will tell about the macroeconomic impact, but we continue to see strong interest in Gulfstream aircraft and services. From a product perspective, the G500 and G600 of now seen FAA removed the wind-related airworthiness directive right on the schedule we had previously forecast. Almost the entire fleet had received the installation of the upgraded software by the end of the quarter. We have delivered 188 of these aircraft to customers through the end of the quarter. The G500, G600 together led the quarter in orders follow closely by G650. This is a very successful program with real market momentum. With respect to G700 development, the control law software validation is scheduled to begin FAA-type inspection authorization during the first week of November. We estimate we will certify this upcoming summer but much depends on available FAA resources. Gulfstream had 35 deliveries in the quarter. If everything goes as planned, we'll deliver 40 to 41 aircraft in the fourth quarter. I haven't said much about Jet Aviation, but suffice it to say, it performed well in the quarter with improving margins in its MRO activities. In short, Aerospace exhibited very strong performance in the quarter and should have an even stronger fourth quarter. Next, Combat. Combat Systems had very similar results on a quarter over year ago quarter basis, but with strong improvement sequentially. The Combat Systems revenue of $1.790 billion is up 2.5% from the year ago quarter. earnings are down 1.8% on a 60 basis point reduction in operating margin. Nevertheless, the operating margin in the quarter is an impressive 15.2%.  On a sequential basis, Combat Systems revenue is up $122 million or 7.3%, while operating earnings are up a very significant 10.6% on a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin. Demand across the segment provided a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 with a large order for Abrams main battle tanks for Poland, orders for $370 million for munitions and ordinance, and in order for 39 labs from the Canadian government.  We also received our first order related to the Ukraine at our munitions business. All of this increases the Combat Systems total backlog to $13.8 billion. In summary, this was an impressive new business quarter with strong operating performance once again by the Combat Systems group. Next, Marine. Revenue of $2.8 billion is up $132 million, 5% over the year ago quarter. This quarter's revenue growth was distributed fairly evenly between electric boat and NASCO. Revenue is also up $118 million or 4.5% sequentially. Year-to-date revenue is up $415 million or 5.4%. Revenue in this group has been up for the last 20 quarters on a quarter-over-quarter basis. This is very impressive continued consistent growth. Operating earnings are $238 million in the quarter, up $9 million or 3.9% on operating margins of 8.6%. On a sequential basis, operating earnings are $27 million or an impressive 12.8% on a 60 basis point improvement in margin. At Electric Boat, the Columbia first ship remains on cost and on contract schedule. The ship is more than 25% complete. NASCO had a particularly good quarter with improved TAO revenue and better margins across the board. From an orders perspective, Electric Boat received a large maintenance and modernization order for the USS Hartford. NASCO received orders for an additional ESB and 2 TAO oilers. As a result, book-to-bill was 1.1:1, leading to a $400 million increase in backlog. Throughout the group, we have a solid backlog of new construction and repair work. Our programs are also well supported in the FY '23 budget. In summary, revenue growth is clearly visible. And as I've said before, the real opportunity given the steady revenue visibility is margin improvement over time. Moving to Technologies. This segment has revenue of $3.71 billion in the quarter, down $49 million from the year ago quarter or 1.6%. The revenue decrease was fairly evenly split in dollar terms between Mission Systems and IT. Mission Systems suffered from nagging supply chain disruptions and the failure of some government customers to obligate funds for authorized and appropriated products. In the case of IT services, it was largely timing and program mix. Operating earnings of $285 million are down $42 million or 12.8% on a 120 basis point reduction in operating margin, exclusively attributed to Mission Systems and largely related to the issues impacting revenue. Total backlog remains relatively consistent over all comparative periods with a book-to-bill of 1:1 in good order prospects on the horizon. The pipeline remains very active at both businesses.  GDIT enjoyed another solid operating quarter with healthy earnings and particularly strong cash in part due to good results in the federal civilian division. While we continue to see procurement delays, GDIT's year-to-date wins exceeded full year 2021 awards in dollar terms. These wins highlight the nice momentum in the business as GDIT begins to realize the benefits from targeted investments in the technical differentiation of its offerings. And this, despite the more than $3.5 billion tied up in prolonged protest and nearly $17 billion pending adjudication at the end of the third quarter. On the people front, GDIT remains focused on attracting and retaining the very best technology talent. The culture of this business has created. One of empowerment, accountability and inclusivity is a clear differentiator and a fiercely competitive talent market. Mission Systems experienced a series of challenges in the third quarter, additional supply chain disruptions, inflation, labor availability and select intel programs and customer contracting delays. Many mission system customers have a serious shortage of contracting officers that have hampered their ability to execute on programs of record. In addition, quite understandably, customer focus has been redirected in some areas to meet the more urgent demands of the Ukraine. The business has offset some of the bottom line impact by productivity improvements and cost-cutting initiatives. They will make every effort to catch up in the fourth quarter. Nonetheless, we anticipate these fact of life realities to continue for a while. I have more to say on that subject in a moment. That concludes my remarks with respect to a solid quarter for the entire company. So as we look toward the end of the year, we expect performance to be largely in line with the update to guidance that we gave you on the last call. As I just referenced, we expect technologies to fall short of our previous estimates, but we expect aerospace to run somewhat ahead of our previous forecast. All up, they should offset each other. In all other respects, our guidance remains the same. We stand by our previous EPS guidance. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks. Yes. So we are driven entirely by the demand of our customer and the prioritization of our customers. So we're working with them, our U.S. Navy, to determine what the focus should be going forward. And as we work through these -- some of these capacity issues then how do we accommodate not only U.S. demand but potentially other demand. Right. So we've had a fair number of supply chain challenges on the aerospace side, which we have accommodated heretofore. But supply chain remains a potential challenge going forward. And as we go through our planning process in the fourth quarter, we get a lot more clarity airplane by airplane of what the supply chain is able to do. But we have so far managed. There are, however, as you quite rightly note, a fair number of headwinds out there. On the defense side, we have accommodated most of the supply chain perturbations, except obviously in the Marine group. But most profoundly in the quarter and most impactfully is at Mission Systems. And while they had with a lot of the more pedestrian supply chain challenges, specialty chips continue to dog them and the additional delays that they experienced in the quarter were very, very hard for them, in fact, impossible for them to overcome. Mission Systems is a very high-performance organization, and they produced several high-value complex products that have experienced delays before, but again, even beyond some of the chip problems, some of the specialty products going into that production those production lines were also impacted. So the Mission System is credit. They have taken a lot of cost-cutting and restructuring initiatives to offset the margin impact and earnings impact of the revenue decline, but we're going to have to work through some of that. And so more to come as we look into the fourth quarter and then into next year. Yes. So there are some across the businesses, there are some specialty engineering and specialty fields that have had some headwinds on labor, but those are beginning to resolve in terms of manufacturing, we had some perturbation in -- we've had a lot of perturbation in the labor market, but felt that particularly at constant point, but that's beginning to resolve itself.  When you think about shipbuilding, shipbuilding is a very complex, high touch labor business. And when you have a nationwide perturbation in the labor market is going to be impacted. I mean while we kept open, not all of the supply chain did, but we also lost a number of experienced shipbuilders as well as experienced people manufacturing folks in the supply chain. So all of that at a higher level than we normally experience. And I don't think that we are alone in that. People took the opportunity in the middle of the pandemic to retire. So we've got to work through some of that.  But ultimately, we do not see and I think this is an important point here. We do not see labor as constraint for our revenue growth at the moment. Certainly not in the longer term. You talking about combat? Yes. Let's talk about Combat because I think -- and then we can talk if you want a little bit about technologies. And before I get to combat, marine is pretty clear. The orders continue to be healthy. The revenue projection, while you have some quarterly lumpiness, it signifies nothing for the long-term growth.  With respect to combat, we saw a number of things in the quarter, primarily Stryker and Abrams as well as MPF is beginning to ramp up as in Poland. And we saw some munitions orders also related to the Ukraine. So I suspect that -- and if we parse through, we focus in on the Ukraine, what we anticipate that our U.S. Army customers telling us they want more ammunition and munitions. So we're working with them to ramp up production. In Europe, we've seen demand for bridges because frankly, a lot of water in Europe. And we've got a very nice business in Germany to provide river crossings at various widths and weight levels. And then we're seeing -- beginning to see increases in vehicle orders and vehicle RFPs coming out, particularly, but not exclusively in the former Eastern block. So technologies is really, I think, a tale of two cities. GDIT has had good bookings. They grew last year. We anticipate them to grow this year. This is all about Mission Systems, as I think, tried to give you a fair amount of detailed color on what's impacting them. The demand for their high-value products is out there. It's just our -- the inability to deliver because of the supply chain is constraining some of the orders, but they're there. They're just waiting to be executed once we get through all of this, and we will, we will get through it. Completely depends on the product. Less so on the bridge side and it depends and again, less so potentially on the vehicle side, it just depends on the vehicle, and exactly what modifications or changes folks want. We're not looking at clean sheet vehicles. We're looking at changes to existing vehicles that we have updated consistently and throughout the years. So it will depend. I suspect a year, in some cases, 18 months. Certainly, I don't expect a whole lot more than that. Yes, yes. No, no, no. And that's a very good question. Our capital deployment priorities remain the same. But let me give -- ask Jason to give you a little bit more color on the details. We're just not going to comment on M&A. So I think we can leave it at that. You want one more shot, one more question? Yes, that's a scary thing, Isn't it? All of the above. I mean really absolutely immaterial. You're risking Howard's ire. Go, George. Not at the moment. We assumed 1:1, and at the moment, I don't see any reason to change that. But as we go through our planning process, to the extent that we need to modify it, we certainly will and we'll be very explicit about that in the fourth quarter. Kristine. Hello? Yes. We see no indication of that in a moment. You want to ask one more. Sure. So we -- let's take your question in the inverter. We always watch the delivery times for our aircraft to our customers. And so far, that's all been manageable. Well, just to remind you, starting in mid-February of last year, we frankly entered the hottest in notranic demand market that I've ever seen. And the order level in the quarter was by any measure, spectacular.  So we've seen strong U.S. demand, Fortune 500 Mideast, Southeast Asia. And our demand interestingly, and I think not surprisingly, our pipeline going into the fourth quarter looks very much like the pipeline going into the third quarter. So at the moment, we've got some pretty good visibility of what orders look like. So we'll see some margin upside, which we alluded to or about stated rather, in our guidance for the year. But the software fixes work almost entirely done by the end of the second quarter and the financial issue, it's about 50-50. So we're -- we like where we are. And frankly, you haven't asked this, but let me just give you a little bit of transparency around that. The transparency of the engineering resources that -- and the cooperation between the FAA and the Gulfstream was very strong and very apparent throughout that process. So we expect that kind of relationship to continue. Yes. Good point. Yes, we have. But tell me again what the first part of your question was? Some of the protests have resolved to our favor. And these are -- when we say protest, these are items that we've won that have been protested. And we've got one in there that's got to be approaching the federal level of number of protests. So hopefully, we'll get through that in the fourth quarter. And I think there's -- it's down somewhat, as I said, because they've resolved. But we still see a fair amount of proposals in the decision-making cycle, which has, as we've said elongated. But even given that, GDIT continues to grow. So as I said, we've cooperated very well with the FAA. We expect that to continue. I would note that we learned a lot in that process of how to work through the new software requirements from the FAA. I think that, coupled with the fact that the G700 is the most mature aircraft to enter the FAA certification process as a result of its software system and considerable and successful testing that preceded FAA review. We see -- we're sticking with our at the moment with our summer 2023 estimate. But look, when we give you sort of our best guess on when the certification is. That's a result of a lot of things that we control and that we can talk about with certainty. But ultimately, this is an FAA issue, and it's the availability of their resources, and they are the regulator and they're going to control it. So we've always tried to be transparent about that, but recognize that the U.S. government controls ultimately the pace. At the moment, we don't see a particular risk. And if we get 3 to 4 quarters in the entire year of a CR, which I find in this threat environment, very difficult to imagine. And we'd have to come back at you. But nothing we hear would suggest that it's the desire of Congress to do that. So I think you and I, a couple of years ago, had a discussion about structural versus cyclical change. And I still think it's premature to see any to declare that there's been a structural change. We've certainly seen some increase in first-time buyers, but that was in part because a lot of wealth was created during the pandemic. The higher the pandemic. So I don't have exact data about what's in the pipeline, but I can imagine that it will be much different than this quarter, which is heavy U.S. Fortune 500, again, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. So -- and I think I may have alluded to this in my remarks that, our customer has expressed an interest in increasing that demand. So we're working with them on increasing production. But I think your predicated about a high-margin business is not quite based. In fact, we are -- OTS where we do all of this work is a high-performance organization with respect to operating leverage. But that comes from a very wide and vast portfolio. So we do okay, but I wouldn't say that they were additive. OTS, on occasion, will be a higher-margin business, but that's largely about mix, and it's not driven by 1 particular line of business. They've got an awful lot of contracts and the high-velocity contract turnover. So I think that's how you should think about them."

[Operator Instructions] I now have the pleasure of handing the call over to our host, Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. So, Howard, please go ahead. \nHoward Rubel: Thank you operator and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2022 conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. With that completed, I would like to turn the call over to our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jason Aiken. \nJason Aiken: Thank you, Howard. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. Before we get started, I want to let you all know that our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic isn't able to join us this morning. She recently came down with COVID, but not to worry she's on the mend and doing well, but she's asked me to cover today's call. With me is Bill Moss, our Vice President and Corporate Controller who will cover some of the financial particulars that I would normally address. So, with that let's get into the results. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $2.75 per diluted share on revenue of $9.2 billion, operating earnings of $978 million, earnings before taxes of $923 million, and net income of $766 million. Revenue was essentially flat against the second quarter last year, but operating earnings were up $19 million. Earnings before taxes were up $42 million and net earnings were up $29 million. Earnings per share were up $0.14, a 5.4% increase. To be a little more granular, we enjoyed revenue increases at Aerospace and Marine Systems offset by declines at Combat Systems and Technologies. We also had margin improvement in three of the four segments which led to higher operating earnings and earnings before taxes against the year ago quarter. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.03 per share on somewhat lower revenue, but somewhat higher operating margin than anticipated by the sell side. This led to the modest earnings beat. On a year-to-date basis, revenue, for all practical purposes, was even with last year's first half. Similarly, operating earnings were essentially flat, but earnings before taxes were up $46 million, net earnings were up $51 million, and EPS was up $0.25, almost 5%. In the quarter, free cash flow of $435 million was 57% of net income. Cash flow from operating activities was 86% of net income. This was pretty good in light of the powerful first quarter cash. To that point, year-to-date free cash flow of $2.3 billion was 151% of net earnings. In summary, we had a solid quarter from an earnings perspective and the year-to-date results give us a solid start to the year. So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Bill add color around cash, backlog, taxes and deployment of cash and then I'll provide updated guidance. I'll try to keep my remarks brief to leave ample opportunity for questions. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $1.9 billion, operating earnings of $238 million and a 12.7% operating margin. Revenue was $245 million more than the year ago quarter or 15.1%, largely as a result of higher service center sales at Gulfstream and higher service volume particularly FBOs at Jet Aviation. Operating earnings are up $43 million or 22.1% on a 70 basis point improvement in margins. So increased sales volume coupled with improved margins leads to very good operating leverage. We captured improved revenue on only 22 deliveries. We didn't deliver four G500 and 600s that were scheduled to deliver in the quarter. They've been deferred at customer request to the third quarter awaiting removal of the FAA wind directive. However, nine G500 and 600s in fact were delivered to customers in the quarter. So we delivered nine of the 13 that were planned in the quarter. From an order perspective, we did very well once again. In dollar terms, Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 2:1. Gulfstream aircraft alone had a book-to-bill of 2.7:1 even stronger if expressed in unit terms. As previously discussed, sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February 2021 and continued on to the second quarter of this year. The pipeline and sales activity remain strong as we enter this quarter. The Farnborough Air Show was a good one for us. From a new product perspective, the G500 and G600 continue to perform well. Margins are improving on a consistent basis and quality is superb. We're making good progress in the flight test of the software update for landing and high winds and expect removal of the FAA directive in mid-September. You may recall that last quarter we advised you of a risk of a three to six month delay for certification of the G700 to second quarter 2023, as a result of the time-consuming work on model-based software validation. As a result of the flight sciences engineering resources we needed to redeploy onto the work related to the G500 and 600 FAA limitation on landings and high wind conditions, the risk to the G700 schedule has become a reality. As we've previously advised, this will not adversely impact our financial plan for 2022 and 2023. We feel confident that the G800 will follow the G700 by about six months. Looking forward, we've planned 123 deliveries for the year and we fully expect to do just that. Turning to Defense. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.7 billion, down 12.3% over the year ago quarter. Revenue was impacted by Ajax at both Land Systems and ELS bomb bodies at OTS and some program mix. Operating earnings of $245 million were off against last year's quarter by 7.9% with a 70 basis point improvement in margins. Operating margin was a strong 14.7%. On a sequential basis, revenue was very similar to the first quarter, but operating earnings were up 7.9% or $18 million on a 110 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, Combat Systems revenue was down 10.2% and operating earnings were down only 7.5% on a 40-basis point improvement in margins.  In June, Land Systems was awarded the Mobile Protected Firepower contract the first all-new combat vehicle for the army in decades. The initial award for LRIP-1 was $410 million for 25 vehicles. The program of record for LRIP is $1.1 billion for 95 vehicles through 2026. The entire program requirement is 500 vehicles for more than $5 billion. The program fills a critical gap in the Army's infantry brigade combat force and we expect to move out swiftly on the program.  The quarter was very good for Combat Systems from an orders perspective with a 1.4:1 book-to-bill leading to an increase in total backlog and estimated potential contract value. Demand for our products particularly our combat vehicles, remains strong with Europe leading the way. International order opportunities for Abrams are particularly strong. This was an impressive operating performance once again by the Combat Systems group in a constrained revenue environment.  At Marine Systems, revenue of $2.65 billion was up $115 million over the year ago quarter. It was flat sequentially, but up year-to-date. In the quarter growth was led by Columbia, TAO and repair work volume. For the first half revenue was up $283 million or 5.6%. This is very impressive continued growth. Operating earnings were $211 million in the quarter essentially flat with the year ago quarter as a result of a 30-basis point reduction in margin.  The margin compression was the result of the impact on Electric Boat of additional scheduled delays in the Virginia program from the supply chain as it struggles with recovering from COVID. EB is working closely with the Navy and suppliers including embedding operating and engineering personnel on-site to restore the necessary Virginia program cadence. Nonetheless, Electric Boats performance remained strong and while still early in the Columbia first ship construction contract, the program remains on cost and schedule. Total backlog of almost $42 billion remains robust and is by far the largest of our operating groups. And lastly, Technologies. The segment had revenue of $3 billion in the quarter down $158 million from the year ago quarter or 5%. Two-thirds of the decline was attributed to Mission Systems, largely related to their continuing struggle with a shortage of chips which continues to plague their ability to deliver certain products. On the other hand, operating earnings of $304 million were down only $4 million or 1.3% on a 40-basis point improvement in operating margin to 10.1%. EBITDA margin was an impressive 14.1% including state and local taxes which are a 50-basis point drag on that result. Operating performance at GDIT was particularly strong 140-basis points better than the year ago quarter. These are industry-leading margin figures. Technologies had a good order activity in the quarter with book-to-bill of 1:1 and good order prospects on the horizon.  Mission Systems had nice orders for many of their product offerings, especially those impacted by the chip shortage. The IT pipeline remains healthy in most of our federal IT lines of business as the government continues to modernize and upgrade its mission support systems. GDIT has the opportunity to submit $35 billion in opportunities this year including $17 billion in the third quarter, most of which represents new work.  That concludes my remarks with respect to a solid quarter and first half. I'll now turn the call over to Bill for further remarks and then I'll provide our updated guidance. \nBill Moss: Thank you, Jason, and good morning. Starting with cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we generated over $650 million, which following our strong first quarter performance brings us to over $2.6 billion for the first six months of the year. This was achieved once again on the strength of the Gulfstream order book and additional collections on our large international combat vehicle contract, which continues to receive payments as scheduled according to the contract restructure that occurred in 2020. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $435 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion year-to-date, yielding a conversion rate of 151% year-to-date. The strong performance so far reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income. And of course, as a reminder that outlook assumes current law with respect to the tax treatment of research and development expenditures. If the Congress acts to defer or reverse the current capitalization requirement we would expect free cash flow for the year at or above 110% of net income. Looking at capital deployment capital expenditures were $224 million in the quarter or 2.4% of sales. That's up from last year consistent with our expectation to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. For the first six months we're closer to 2% of sales, but 2.5% remains our full year target. We also paid $349 million in dividends and spent approximately $800 million on the repurchase of 3.6 million shares. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 4.9 million shares for just shy of $1.1 billion. The net result at the end of the second quarter was a cash balance of $2.2 billion, and a net debt position of $9.3 billion, down more than $2 billion from this time last year. As a result, net interest expense in the quarter was $95 million, down from $109 million in the second quarter of 2021. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $193 million down from $232 million for the same period in 2021. At this point, we continue to expect our interest expense for the year to be approximately $380 million, including the assumed repayment of $1 billion of notes that mature in the fourth quarter. The tax rate in the quarter was 17% bringing the rate for the first half to 15.6%, so no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year. But of course that implies a rate in the mid-16% range for the second half of the year, to arrive at that outcome. To shape that for you, we expect the rate to be somewhat lower in the third quarter and higher in the fourth. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the second quarter with a 1.1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As Jason mentioned, order activity in Aerospace led the way with a two times book-to-bill, which is the fifth consecutive quarter the book-to-bill for the group has been 1.6 times or higher. As a result Aerospace backlog is up over $5 billion in the past year, an increase of almost 40%. During the quarter, we finalized negotiations on the restructure of the last of our arrangements with a fractional aircraft operator, which resulted in a roughly $300 million reduction in the Aerospace backlog and a $900 million reduction in aircraft options. This action essentially clears our backlog of any exposure to fractional customers and has no impact on our production and revenue forecast for 2022 and beyond. On the Defense side, Combat Systems and Technologies also had solid quarters with a 1.4 times and a one times book-to-bill respectively. The increase in the Combat Systems backlog was particularly notable given a headwind from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of over $200 million in the quarter and $300 million year-to-date. Incidentally, the FX fluctuations also negatively impacted Combat's revenue by $65 million in the first half of the year as the euro fell to near parity with the dollar. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.6 billion while total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $126 billion. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Jason to give you an update on our guidance for 2022 and wrap-up remarks.\nJason Aiken: Thanks, Bill. Let me do my best to give you an updated forecast. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I won't repeat. There is, however, a chart with respect to this that will be posted on our website, which should be helpful. In Aerospace, we expect an additional $200 million of revenue with an operating margin of around 12.9% which is 10 basis points higher than we previously forecast. This will result in additional operating earnings. There could be some upside here if we can deliver out a few more planes in the year. With respect to the Defense businesses, Combat Systems should be on the low end of our revenue range with an improvement of up to 50 basis points of operating margin. So total revenue of around $7.1 billion and operating margin around 15%. There's no change to Marine Systems revenue, but 30 basis points lower margin. So annual revenue of $10.8 billion with an operating margin around 8.3%, for the reasons I have previously described to you. Technologies revenue will be in the middle of the forecast revenue range at the same operating margin driven by GDIT with 3.5% year-over-year growth. So for the group, we expect annual revenue of around $12.9 billion with an operating margin around 10%. So, on a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue at the higher end of our initial guidance and an overall operating margin around 10.8%, which is unchanged. This rolls up to EPS at the high end of our previous guidance range. In short, we expect only modest deviation from our initial guidance. That concludes my remarks, and we'll be pleased to take your questions.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you, Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead when you ready, Robert.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nJason Aiken: Good morning, Rob.\nRobert Stallard: Jason, I'll kick it off with one for you. The big question we've been getting from folks is what the impact could be on business jet and the Aerospace division from a slowdown in the global economy. I was wondering if you could give us some perspectives on how this could play out and how aerospace is differently positioned from where it was say in 2007 2008?\nJason Aiken: Yes. So, I think the most important point here, Rob, is the robust nature of the demand we've seen up to this point, the order activity that's resulted in the extended backlog that that provides us. Not to mention frankly -- and Bill spoke to this a little bit in terms of some of the cleanup in the quarter, but the durability of the backlog that continues to just increase the quality of that order book as we move forward. So, obviously, we can't predict when and what any type of slowdown will look like. There's a lot of talk out in the market about interest rates, inflation, the stock market recession potential and so on. But to be completely frank with you, we have not yet seen any impact of that in terms of our order pipeline and the resulting order activity that we've seen. There continues to be a very strong customer demand. We're continuing to see that as we embark here into the third quarter. And so I think bottom line between the size of the backlog, the ongoing order activity the durability of that backlog, which at this point is in excess of 2.5 times our annual sales for the group. Notwithstanding, the possibility of economic slowdown or similar conditions, we remain very confident and steadfast in our outlook for the next couple of years that we provided in terms of 2023, 2024 and beyond.\nRobert Stallard: Okay. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned the AJAX program in the Combat Systems division. Could you give us an update of what the situation is there and how it's to pan out from here? Thank you.\nJason Aiken: Sure. So the program is proceeding. The vehicle tests are continuing and they continue to confirm frankly the vehicle performance that we've seen to date. With respect to some of the things that the customer has been focused on when it comes to vibration in the vehicle, some concerns that emerged in some of the early customer trials have been addressed at this point. And we are working right now on -- with the customer on securing appropriate communications gear. So I think the key here at this point is that this is going to really be all about how soon approvals can move through the system as we undergo this series of deliberate tests that take time as would be the case on any new platform development program. Frankly this is not inconsistent with experience that we would expect on any new platform development. But like I said we continue to work with the customer and they continue to assure us of their commitment to the program as well as of their need for this transformational capability. So it's an ongoing path forward, continuing to make progress and we expect to see ourselves to the other side of this testing and trials period soon enough and onward and upward with the program.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have a question on the line from Seth Seifman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead when you're ready.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much, and good morning.\nJason Aiken: Good morning Seth.\nSeth Seifman: Good morning. Just to start off, I'm sure you've gotten this question a bunch of times but with regard to moving forward on G500 and 600 and the landing restriction, it sounds like you're still on track to have that lifted this quarter. And just any color you can give on what gives you the confidence there given that the Gulfstream, I think has done all its work but you're dependent on the FAA to do their work?\nJason Aiken: No you kind of summed it up nicely there Seth. The fact is we have the software fix for this issue completed. It's been developed. It has been tested. It has been flown. And so we have great confidence in the efficacy of that software fix. And we are currently working with the FAA Gulfstream and the FAA working concurrently toward the initiative to get this airworthiness directive resolved. The program plan for that is to complete by or before mid-September. To your point, we are in part dependent on the resources of the FAA to make that happen. But they have been very good about this. They are committing the resources that we think are necessary and the teams are working together. And right now, everything seems to be right on track for a resolution of this, by the end of the third quarter.\nSeth Seifman: Great. Thanks. And then just as a follow-up still in Aerospace. This might be kind of a crude measure, but just looking at the revenue per aircraft in the quarter, it looks pretty strong. But obviously, we don't necessarily have all the information about mix and price and stuff like that. Can you tell us what the service growth was to help us hone in on that? And then, you mentioned a fractional settlement. Did that have any impact on the revenue in the quarter or any other backlog mechanics? Did those affect revenue?\nJason Aiken: Yes. So, on the service side, we did see very strong growth in the quarter. That's continuing a trend that we've seen, since we've been emerging from the pandemic, both including sort of flight hour ramp-up as activity and flight activity picks up around the world, as well as FBO activity at our Jet Aviation business, particularly on the US side. So I think we had somewhere in excess of 35% growth year-over-year in the quarter, in service activity. And it's frankly that service activity that is driving the upside to the revenue and the outlook for the Aerospace group for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we're still expecting our 123 aircraft deliveries for the year. So, a couple of hundred million dollars of additional revenue for the year is coming from that service side of the business. And I know you referenced, the cleanup we mentioned the backlog, but I sort of missed the latter part of your question. Do you mind repeating what you were getting at there? I'm sorry, Seth. He has already dropped off the line. Perhaps, you were getting at, whether any of the cleanup in the backlog has affected any of the revenue or other aspects of the Aerospace outlook. And the fact is, no, we're in good shape there. The cleanup as I mentioned or I think as Bill mentioned in the remarks was related to an ongoing negotiation we had with our really last sizable fractional customer in that backlog, and we've come to a settlement with that customer, removed some of the airplanes and expired some of the options there. And none of that activity has any impact on the outlook for the business. So all forecasts remain intact.\nSeth Seifman: Great. Thank you.\nJason Aiken: Operator, hope we have our next question on.\nOperator: We now have our next question from David Strauss of Barclays. Your line is open, David.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nJason Aiken: Good morning, David.\nDavid Strauss: Jason, when we were down at Gulfstream back in June, I think you talked -- Gulfstream talked about being about 70% of the way through the software validation test on the 700. Can you just give us an update exactly where that stands today?\nJason Aiken: Yes. I don't have an exact number on the update of 70%. Obviously, the progress on that software validation has been slowed somewhat by the fact that we've had to divert common resources in terms of those flight sciences engineers over to the fix on the 500 and 600. So that, as I mentioned before is really what's sort of affirming our risk on the slip of the 700 entry into service. So there's been some modest progress there, but call it in that 70-plus percent range remains where we are at this point. As soon as we get through that airworthiness directive resolution, we'll get those resources back on that program and moving forward to that updated EIS date. \nDavid Strauss : Okay. And as a follow-up, can you update us on supply chain? Any constraints you're kind of seeing on the Gulfstream side of things? I think when we were down there it was discussed about some shortages on the engine side. How do you feel about the overall supply chain at Gulfstream and your ability to hit that 123 delivery number for the full year? \nJason Aiken: Yes. So as you referenced supply chain is definitely -- not to sugar coat it, it's an ongoing issue for the industry. It's no surprise or no secret that I think the commercial aerospace industry has had a fragile supply chain even before COVID hit. So it's probably no surprise that that's only been exacerbated. And I'd say, it's a daily battle. But that said I think there's no team that I'd rather have tackled this issue than the Gulfstream team down there. They have people embedded throughout the supply chain actively managing these issues with our partners to help them meet our commitments to our customers. And so I think while there can be issues from supplier-to-supplier and it's an active management activity that's going on. It's important to consider the impact of any part or subsystem or so on to the overall tack time of the airplane production process and ultimately the delivery schedule. So just because, let's say, a particular part may be missing its due on dock date doesn't necessarily mean that that's going to impact overall completion of the airplane or delivery of the customer between workaround that our team has and other efforts to keep the overall aircraft flow moving we don't see any impact to the delivery outlook that we have for the year. Obviously, these types of activities aren't optimal. We want to get this corrected frankly for the benefit of the entire ecosystem. But we continue to have great confidence in the team at Gulfstream to get through the challenge and they'll meet their aircraft delivery forecast for the year. \nDavid Strauss : Thanks very much.\nJason Aiken: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you for that. We now have the next question from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead when you\u2019re ready, Ron.\nRon Epstein: Yes. Hey, thank you. Good morning everyone.\nJason Aiken: Good morning, Ron.\nRon Epstein: Question for you on again kind of maybe going back to the supply chain, but focusing a little bit more on Defense. So it seems like at Gulfstream, you guys are managing the constraints well. We've heard from some of the engine producers that castings and forgings and things are tight and you're managing through that. But it seems like you've got a lot more flexibility in your commercial business than you do in your defense business. And one of the themes that seems to have emerged from this quarter is that because of the way defense contracting is done we continue to hear shortages of A, B and C. Is there anything you guys can do about chip shortages buying inventory ahead, or are you just so constrained by the kind of the materials management acquisition rules that you can't do that? Because it seems like defense is just sort of fundamentally this sort of just-in-time business, but we're in sort of a just-in-case world if you get the gist of the question. \nJason Aiken: Yes. No, it's a great question Ron and I'll kind of break that down into two aspects of our business sort of the short-term side and the long-term side. And the piece that we're seeing a bigger issue in on the short-term side and you referred to the chip shortage it's really that the Mission Systems piece that we've talked about for some time now. And again that's because these are quick turn orders. They're product-driven. They're dependent on these chips and you got to get them out the door. And obviously these are highly engineered high-end design engineering type products. So to your point the specifications are quite specific. That said, number one, I think the team is doing a tremendous job trying to develop work around. They are out there ordering parts in advance where they can. It's tough to get your spot in line because this is an issue affecting not just the industry, but the broader economy, but they're doing their best they can on that front. They are also working to change designs, modify designs, accept alternate parts where they can and be as nimble as they can on that front, but that obviously takes some time. I think importantly for that side of the business, this is just a timing issue we've seen here. If you take for example the second quarter and the product it wasn't able to ship at the end of the quarter, we've seen the vast majority of that actually get shipped in the first month of the third quarter. So that is flowing through. It doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet. I think this is going to be something that's going to bug us for the balance of the year and maybe spill over a little into next year. But the fact is we've seen some of the strongest order activity from the customer in this area. So I think this is just a timing thing. We'll come through it and the order demand is there so that this will continue on into the balance of this year and beyond. So that's sort of on the short-term side of the business. The other big supply chain side that we're seeing frankly is a little bit different. It's on frankly the longest \u2013 longest leg side of the business and that's in the shipbuilding side. And really there it's less about parts or material availability. It's about the availability of labor the price and availability of skilled labor. And so we're seeing that really hit the supply chain for us. And for us it's focused primarily on the Virginia Class program. When you think of NASCO out on the West Coast and frankly the Columbia program at Electric Boat those are all hitting this in stride. But on the Virginia program, the supply chain has stumbled a little bit more. And when you think about it we have been working hard even prior to COVID to ramp-up our resources on those programs to support two per year Virginia as well as the addition of Columbia. And we were making pretty good headwind on that. And then COVID hits and you take two steps back instead -- or at least a pause instead of needing to take two steps forward. So when you think about shipbuilding and the nature of that business -- a shock like that to the system can hit it quickly, but it just takes time for it to recover. And so that's what we're seeing on the Virginia program as the supply chain is struggling to catch back up and, sort of, hit that cadence that they need to be on. But again like Gulfstream like Mission Systems Electric Boat has got all the resources that we can bring to bear and all the sense of urgency to apply to that supply chain. And once we can get that schedule right I think we'll be back on track. But in the meantime that schedule extension brings cost and that cost brings an impact to margins and that's what's affecting our outlook for that business. So that's -- I'm trying to give you a complete answer as I can on the supply chain as it hits the defense side. So that's sort of both into the spectrum from my perspective. \nRon Epstein: Yes. Got it. And then maybe just one quick follow-up on combat. With all the awards that have been coming in and the activity in Europe when would you expect that to flow through the business? Is that a 2023 kind of thing? When would we expect to see that kind of -- at least on the top line? \nJason Aiken: Yes, good question. I want to take a step back and maybe give a little clarity on what we've seen through the first half of this year and then what that means for where we're going. Obviously in the first half of the year we're down notionally a little bit more than you would expect given our full year outlook. I think we're about 10% down year-to-date. If you do some quick checking you'll see that what that's really a function of it that last year, our revenue per quarter was essentially consistent throughout the year, first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, which is really in contrast to the tried and true annual cycle that we see in Combat Systems and we're frankly once again seeing this year which is a sequential ladder, if you will, lowest in the first quarter, rising to the fourth quarter. So, that created a little unusual headwind in terms of the year-over-year comparisons. But we're still -- based on the way the second half plays out, still expecting to be at the low end of our revenue forecast. So, what does that imply? That implies about a 3.5% growth in the second half versus the second half of last year and I think that's imminently achievable by that group. But looking beyond that to your point, there's a tremendous amount of activity in this market. Obviously, as I mentioned before, the MPF award is a big one for us. That's a whole new additive space in the infantry brigade combat structure there. And there's tremendous demand signals internationally as you mentioned. Obviously, we're working toward the tank opportunity in Poland. There's other international tank opportunities as I mentioned before. And then you alluded to sort of demand generally internationally and everybody has kind of the suspicion that everything going on in Eastern Europe is going to lead to significant growth for the -- on the defense side. And certainly we are seeing those demand signals. I think the key thing that we all have to keep in mind here is to keep and check our expectations with respect to timing. The demand signals are there. We are having regular dialogue and ongoing conversation with those customers about that interest. But it just takes time for interest to turn into budgets to turn it into appropriations to turn into contracts to turn into revenue. So, I think it's all consistent with our long-term outlook that by 2024 and beyond we ought to see a nice uptick trajectory in Combat Systems. We're still talking low to mid-single-digit growth, but we ought to see an inflection point to growth out in that period and all of that is supportive of this. But in the meantime I'd just reiterate our emphasis that the focus and the story for Combat Systems is a margin one. And you've seen how well once again this group can perform on the margin side and be a really good cyclical no matter what's happening on the topline.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Melius Research. Your line is open Robert.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey, good morning.\nJason Aiken: Good morning.\nRobert Spingarn: Jason I just want to go back to labor and talk across all the businesses where you stand where -- obviously, you said shipbuilding is a tough one. So, maybe that's the most challenging area. But when you look across the business, what is the labor and talent acquisition situation?\nJason Aiken: Yes, you touched on it Rob. The shipbuilding side has been the toughest one. We've seen that in Maine. We've seen that all over sort of the New England shipyards as we've tried to ramp up. And frankly those are the two shipyards at EB and Bath that we have the most opportunity to ramp up. And so you got -- it's not like a lot of other industries where you're hearing things about remote work the ability to pull people from all over the country and all over the world. You've got to get shipbuilders in those states and in those regions to do that work and so that's what presents the challenge. The good news is we -- as I mentioned well before COVID, we had been ramping up and anticipating ramp-up. And so we've had a lot of resources put in place as well as great partnerships at the state and local levels to get the kind of trade schools and apprenticeships and so on to make that happen. So, I think the resources are in place. We've just got to keep our flow moving through those processes, keep our training capabilities up and running, and we can catch back up with this. It's just going to take time. And again that's just sort of the nature of shipbuilding and it's a challenge that those teams are up to. When you look on the other end of the spectrum, I think it's all about GDIT. And obviously, they are in a hypercompetitive market for hyper-skilled talent, and that only gets more competitive all the time. I think the leading positions they have in their markets, the strong culture they have and continue to build with that workforce and the opportunities that they provide their workforce within the company, continue to I think put them in a good position to compete and keep and grow that talent, it's -- I'm not going to sugarcoat it though, it's a war for talent every day. And we just -- it's our job to keep up with that and punch above our weight, and continue to retain and draw in the kind of talent they need to do that work and as that business grows. So those are kind of the two ends, of the spectrum. I think the other area, that we monitor it closely, is at Gulfstream. Obviously, with the growth they have you need people to do that. I think, not to underestimate the challenge that they have, but I think they've done a really good job of keeping up with it and I don't see that as being as high a nail, an item for Gulfstream in the moment. There's nothing that we can take our eye off the ball, and they've got to keep at it, but I think they're up to that challenge as well. \nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, going specifically to Electric Boat and the focus on getting Columbia ramped up and the labor situation, you just talked about there. Have we seen any work packages moved between Electric Boat and Newport News, in order to manage volumes and address labor shortages either for you or for them? \nJason Aiken: So, Rob, I hate to give you this answer, but that's the kind of thing I don't think, I should probably get into too great a detail. We obviously, work very closely with them as our teaming partner on Virginia, as well as our subcontractor on Columbia. It's a three-part conversation between us, Newport and the Navy, to make sure that we're doing everything we can to support that customer and the growth that they need. And I think, that's the most important message is we're going to do everything we can, to support that customer and we're working together as a team to do that. And both sides, I think have a mutuality around that that's very important and very supportive. So... \nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.\nJason Aiken: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have the next question on the phone line from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead when you\u2019re ready.\nDoug Harned: Hi. Good morning. Thank you.\nJason Aiken: Good morning, Doug\nDoug Harned: Good morning. I wanted to see, if you could give us a little bit of a picture on the mix of Gulfstream orders. And in particular the G650, has extended longer than I think you all, first expected strong demand. Can you give us a sense of, what the mix is and then also, how you're looking at G650 production over time? \nJason Aiken: Yes, you're absolutely, right. The G650 order activity continues to be robust, frankly, beyond even what we I think perhaps conservatively expected. I think we've said, a couple of times now in the past and it continues to be the case that the announcement of the G700 and the G800 have absolutely for our market and our customers clarified, where we are with this family of aircraft. And it clarifies, what the 650 is in terms of an opportunity for those customers. So that airplane, I think, continues to have legs to it. To make no mistake about it, the 800 is the replacement for the 650. And as the 800 comes into service, we will work the 650 out. There may be some modest overlap as we feather in from one to the other. But I think, what this outsized demand on the 650 does is it gives us a lot of optionality. It gives us opportunity, if this demand environment continues. With respect to our outlook for 2023 and 2024, we'll have to see how that plays out. It's also giving us the optionality, to deal with some of these issues, we've talked about with the certification process. As the 700 slips, we're not backtracking on our commitments to the delivery units, the revenue and the earnings forecast that we've given for 2022, 2023 and 2024. And frankly the 650 demand is helping with that, as well as the demand environment in general. And to that point, you kind of asked about the whole portfolio. And I think there's some question and speculation out there among the community about the airworthiness directive and what that might mean for the 500 and 600. And I'd tell you again, we delivered the vast majority of the airplanes that we intended to this quarter. We expect that to be resolved by the end of the third quarter. And when you look at the order activity in the second quarter, I think, the 500 and 600 represented about half the order activity that we had. So there's no signs of slowing down there. Our customers understand what this little bump in the road is and so, those platforms continue to be very well supported. So across the board -- and I didn't even mention the G280, that continues to have great order demand. I think the mid-cabin space has really picked up in the aftermath of COVID. So really across the board, in the portfolio, we see broad-based demand for our airplanes.\nDoug Harned: Well -- and then just as a follow-up, switching over to Technologies, I mean, I know there's been -- you've had challenges with award protests and so, there have been some difficulties. But this is something where we've been looking for growth for a long time. And if you look out over the next few years, I mean, how are you thinking about Technologies in terms of a growth trajectory? Because we just haven't really seen it yet.\nJason Aiken: So, obviously, this is a conversation we've been in for some time now. And I think if you look back, we had low single-digit growth last year. We're expecting modestly better growth this year. And as I reiterated earlier our updated outlook for the year is spot on in the middle of our revenue forecast range we gave back in January. Obviously, we're off to a little bit of a slower start to the year, but I'd say a little bit of a slower start and that's largely attributable to Mission Systems. I won't reiterate those issues, but we do believe that that is a timing issue for us. GDIT is flat for the first half, but we absolutely have a clear line of sight to growth for them in the second half. And so, look, I mean, what gives us confidence in this outlook? I think, the way we look at it is not any one particular win or loss or one program or another. It's really about all of the key, what I think about as, leading indicator data or statistics that are around a business that is made up of thousands of contracts across the portfolio. You're talking about order activity, win and capture rates on new as well as recompete business, book-to-bill, backlog, potential contract value, so on and so forth. And all of those metrics for us continue to support an outlook for this business of low to mid-single-digit growth. And when you look at GDIT, for example, they had awards in the first half that were valued at about $7 billion. And that's significantly higher than the first half of last year and the vast majority of that represents new work. So, obviously, this can be frustrating, I think, for you all. And sometimes it is for us, given the particularly lumpy aspect of this business when it comes to the protest and delayed award adjudication process. So it can come in fits and starts. But we remain bullish on this and we think bottom line, we're talking about a low to mid-single-digit growth outlook. And frankly, as I think about it, you may have noticed a couple of weeks after the quarter, we had the announcement of the Air Force European support contracts some $900-plus million opportunity. If that had happened a couple of weeks earlier, it would be kind of a completely different conversation around the book-to-bill for the Technologies group in the quarter. So that's just a one-off example, but it speaks to the point that, while timing can be frustrating and lumpy and the pipeline can be a challenge to get through, it doesn't change our long-term outlook for this business.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Peter Arment of Baird. Please go ahead, when you are ready, Peter.\nPeter Arment: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Jason.\nJason Aiken: Good morning.\nPeter Arment: Maybe we can get just your updated thoughts on -- we've seen the markups from defense budget working their way through the Senate and House. How is that impacting some of your defense business? And obviously I mean there's been a focus on combat and technology so kind of returning to growth. And just kind of any color you can provide there that would be helpful.\nJason Aiken: Yeah. I think the two things that I'd point out. It's obviously still very early in that process. But bottom-line as you'd expect shipbuilding remains extremely well supported. You can see the numbers there. And so that I think just continues to be supportive of our -- an underpinning of our outlook for the ongoing $400 million to $500 million a year growth in the Marine Systems business, so all positive there. I think the greater area of maybe anxiety or speculation is around Combat Systems and the Army budgets. We'll see where that goes. This is obviously something that ebbs and flows and has a lot higher beta in terms of an Army budget on an annual basis than on the Navy strategic side. But the fact is we can't ignore the fact that there is a significant amount of support among the Congress for increasing defense budgets. So Abrams, Stryker those continue to be very critical assets in the Army infrastructure and we think there's continued support for those. And so while there's a lot of chatter around it those are going to decline and what's going to happen. Let's just see how it plays out. I think we'll have to stay tuned and see.\nPeter Arment: Okay. And just as a quick follow-up. Your thoughts on just any impact if we have a continuing resolution, obviously this is not -- you guys have managed through a lot of continuing resolutions. So, just thoughts on any impact there?\nJason Aiken: Yeah. I don't see any real high anxiety in the moment. It's obviously something to your point that we've learned to work with and work around. It's certainly not desirable by any stretch of the imagination, but it's almost become part of our annual reality. I think until these things get into a six-seven-month-plus type of situation that's when it really starts to affect our shorter-cycle business on the technology side, perhaps in the ammunition side. But beyond that we really don't see a significant impact at this point. Again, it's unfortunate. We don't like it but we've learned to try to operate around it.\nOperator: Thank you. We would now like to have the next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead, when you are ready.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning guys. Thank you for the time Jason and Howard.\nJason Aiken: Yeah, morning Sheila.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. I wanted to maybe ask a shorter-term question to follow-up on Doug's on Technologies. It was down 3% in the first half and up 10% growth in the second half implied with the guidance. GDIT seems to be doing well like fairly flat. Can you maybe bridge us on mission? And how you think about supply chain getting back growing in the second half timing of funding because a lot of the GDIT peers have complained about that, maybe if you could just bridge us shorter term.\nJason Aiken: Yeah. You've touched on the key issues, but I think the biggest piece of it is what I mentioned before is that we're already seeing here in the third quarter our ability to catch back up on some of that delayed product shipment from the second quarter. We really got that balled up there toward the end of the second quarter and that hampered the revenue for the first half. But we -- look, I don't want to sugarcoat the challenge is Mission Systems is not out of the woods. So they're going to fight and scrap their way, but they're seeing their way toward workarounds on that supply chain side. And I have a good deal of confidence that they can get there. On the GDIT side, it is a frustrating environment in terms of the slow pace of the outlays. Frankly, we've seen that a bit on both the Mission Systems and GDIT side. But I think the hill that they have to climb in the second half is not as high. And I think we've got reasonable line of sight in terms of the work that's in the books and they just got to go execute on that should get them there in the second half. They've just got a little bit of go to get in the second half. So I feel even greater confidence on the GDIT side.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Thank you. And then I just wanted to ask a cleanup on aerospace. When we think about the 123 delivery side, how much of that includes G700s? And then given the raise was on service how much of the services business is in the backlog? \nJason Aiken: So I don't necessarily get into detailed order \u2013 backlog and ordering cancellations on an aircraft-by-aircraft basis. I apologize I'm going to have to punt on that one. But on the service side, we typically don't have much in the way of service activity in the backlog. We have a very modest amount in the aerospace unfunded backlog category that is related to longer-term maintenance arrangements that we have with some larger customers. But the service activity across the board at Jet Aviation and Gulfstream is really a book-and-bill basis on a quarterly and annual basis so sort of a one-to-one typically there.\nHoward Rubel: Operator, we will just take one more question. \nOperator: Thank you. We have the last question from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen. You may proceed with your question.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. So orders at Gulfstream for aircraft you mentioned about half in the quarter was for the 500, 600. You mentioned that the 650 is doing well. How is the 800? Because that's been introduced relatively lately. You now have a new competitor in the market that looks like they match you in range with four versus three sections. So how is the 800 doing? \nJason Aiken: Yes. The demand for that aircraft is quite solid Cai. It's doing well every quarter. Booking orders I think between the fact that the 650 is still taking orders and the fact that the EIS for the 800 is still a good ways out, we're not expecting a massive surge in orders. As we start to move closer to that transition, you might expect it to pick up and shift more from the 650 to the 800. But right now I'd tell you it's just good solid order activity that is very much supportive of our EIS timing and our expectations for that airplane.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. And could you \u2013 could give us a little bit more color in terms of the order potential for combat? You mentioned Europe is strong. You mentioned Abrams. How about the rest of your vehicles? How about the munitions business? \nJason Aiken: So the rest of the vehicles you have to think about our European Land Systems business. They have an extremely large installed base of wheeled and tracked combat vehicles that on the one hand have a replacement cycle with them that offers some opportunity in the out years, as well as it provides incentive for those who are trying to bring up their level of defense spending to do so in a way that aligns with their allies. And if their allies are operating and fighting one particular platform or another, that's an incentive for those who are starting to spend up more to achieve commonality with those allies. So we think that puts us in good stead for these opportunities that are coming out of threats in Europe. Across the board, though to be a little more specific, a lot of this stuff is either in the backlog or on the horizon when you think about the Spanish 8x8 vehicle. You've got again the potential \u2013 or the \u2013 I shouldn't say the potential, the impending order for tanks out of Poland. We're talking with Romania, Switzerland all of those are sort of bread and butter countries are all looking at increased spending on a variety of platforms. So that plus just sort of this, again, generic increased level of indicated interest across Europe, particularly Eastern Europe, I think it provides tremendous potential opportunity. It's just too early to try and count any of that and anticipate exactly when or what that looks like. Timing in Europe often can be a challenge. So it would probably be a bit of a fool's errand for me to try and get too specific around that. But we do see a good robust environment as supportive of combat.\nCai von Rumohr: Thanks, again.\nJason Aiken: You\u2019re welcome.\nHoward Rubel: And Brica, operator, I think we are done with the question-and-answer period. And I thank everybody for joining the call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and the highlights presentation, which will contain our earnings outlook. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Brica, you can now indicate the call is over please.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's call. Thank you all again for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and good morning. Starting with cash performance in the quarter. From an operating cash flow perspective, we generated over $650 million, which following our strong first quarter performance brings us to over $2.6 billion for the first six months of the year. This was achieved once again on the strength of the Gulfstream order book and additional collections on our large international combat vehicle contract, which continues to receive payments as scheduled according to the contract restructure that occurred in 2020. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $435 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion year-to-date, yielding a conversion rate of 151% year-to-date. The strong performance so far reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income. And of course, as a reminder that outlook assumes current law with respect to the tax treatment of research and development expenditures. If the Congress acts to defer or reverse the current capitalization requirement we would expect free cash flow for the year at or above 110% of net income. Looking at capital deployment capital expenditures were $224 million in the quarter or 2.4% of sales. That's up from last year consistent with our expectation to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. For the first six months we're closer to 2% of sales, but 2.5% remains our full year target. We also paid $349 million in dividends and spent approximately $800 million on the repurchase of 3.6 million shares. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 4.9 million shares for just shy of $1.1 billion. The net result at the end of the second quarter was a cash balance of $2.2 billion, and a net debt position of $9.3 billion, down more than $2 billion from this time last year. As a result, net interest expense in the quarter was $95 million, down from $109 million in the second quarter of 2021. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $193 million down from $232 million for the same period in 2021. At this point, we continue to expect our interest expense for the year to be approximately $380 million, including the assumed repayment of $1 billion of notes that mature in the fourth quarter. The tax rate in the quarter was 17% bringing the rate for the first half to 15.6%, so no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year. But of course that implies a rate in the mid-16% range for the second half of the year, to arrive at that outcome. To shape that for you, we expect the rate to be somewhat lower in the third quarter and higher in the fourth. Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the second quarter with a 1.1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As Jason mentioned, order activity in Aerospace led the way with a two times book-to-bill, which is the fifth consecutive quarter the book-to-bill for the group has been 1.6 times or higher. As a result Aerospace backlog is up over $5 billion in the past year, an increase of almost 40%. During the quarter, we finalized negotiations on the restructure of the last of our arrangements with a fractional aircraft operator, which resulted in a roughly $300 million reduction in the Aerospace backlog and a $900 million reduction in aircraft options. This action essentially clears our backlog of any exposure to fractional customers and has no impact on our production and revenue forecast for 2022 and beyond. On the Defense side, Combat Systems and Technologies also had solid quarters with a 1.4 times and a one times book-to-bill respectively. The increase in the Combat Systems backlog was particularly notable given a headwind from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of over $200 million in the quarter and $300 million year-to-date. Incidentally, the FX fluctuations also negatively impacted Combat's revenue by $65 million in the first half of the year as the euro fell to near parity with the dollar. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.6 billion while total potential contract value including options and IDIQ contracts was $126 billion. That concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Jason to give you an update on our guidance for 2022 and wrap-up remarks."

            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Thank you, Howard. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. Before we get started, I want to let you all know that our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic isn't able to join us this morning. She recently came down with COVID, but not to worry she's on the mend and doing well, but she's asked me to cover today's call. With me is Bill Moss, our Vice President and Corporate Controller who will cover some of the financial particulars that I would normally address. So, with that let's get into the results. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $2.75 per diluted share on revenue of $9.2 billion, operating earnings of $978 million, earnings before taxes of $923 million, and net income of $766 million. Revenue was essentially flat against the second quarter last year, but operating earnings were up $19 million. Earnings before taxes were up $42 million and net earnings were up $29 million. Earnings per share were up $0.14, a 5.4% increase. To be a little more granular, we enjoyed revenue increases at Aerospace and Marine Systems offset by declines at Combat Systems and Technologies. We also had margin improvement in three of the four segments which led to higher operating earnings and earnings before taxes against the year ago quarter. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.03 per share on somewhat lower revenue, but somewhat higher operating margin than anticipated by the sell side. This led to the modest earnings beat. On a year-to-date basis, revenue, for all practical purposes, was even with last year's first half. Similarly, operating earnings were essentially flat, but earnings before taxes were up $46 million, net earnings were up $51 million, and EPS was up $0.25, almost 5%. In the quarter, free cash flow of $435 million was 57% of net income. Cash flow from operating activities was 86% of net income. This was pretty good in light of the powerful first quarter cash. To that point, year-to-date free cash flow of $2.3 billion was 151% of net earnings. In summary, we had a solid quarter from an earnings perspective and the year-to-date results give us a solid start to the year. So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Bill add color around cash, backlog, taxes and deployment of cash and then I'll provide updated guidance. I'll try to keep my remarks brief to leave ample opportunity for questions. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $1.9 billion, operating earnings of $238 million and a 12.7% operating margin. Revenue was $245 million more than the year ago quarter or 15.1%, largely as a result of higher service center sales at Gulfstream and higher service volume particularly FBOs at Jet Aviation. Operating earnings are up $43 million or 22.1% on a 70 basis point improvement in margins. So increased sales volume coupled with improved margins leads to very good operating leverage. We captured improved revenue on only 22 deliveries. We didn't deliver four G500 and 600s that were scheduled to deliver in the quarter. They've been deferred at customer request to the third quarter awaiting removal of the FAA wind directive. However, nine G500 and 600s in fact were delivered to customers in the quarter. So we delivered nine of the 13 that were planned in the quarter. From an order perspective, we did very well once again. In dollar terms, Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 2:1. Gulfstream aircraft alone had a book-to-bill of 2.7:1 even stronger if expressed in unit terms. As previously discussed, sales activity truly accelerated in the middle of February 2021 and continued on to the second quarter of this year. The pipeline and sales activity remain strong as we enter this quarter. The Farnborough Air Show was a good one for us. From a new product perspective, the G500 and G600 continue to perform well. Margins are improving on a consistent basis and quality is superb. We're making good progress in the flight test of the software update for landing and high winds and expect removal of the FAA directive in mid-September. You may recall that last quarter we advised you of a risk of a three to six month delay for certification of the G700 to second quarter 2023, as a result of the time-consuming work on model-based software validation. As a result of the flight sciences engineering resources we needed to redeploy onto the work related to the G500 and 600 FAA limitation on landings and high wind conditions, the risk to the G700 schedule has become a reality. As we've previously advised, this will not adversely impact our financial plan for 2022 and 2023. We feel confident that the G800 will follow the G700 by about six months. Looking forward, we've planned 123 deliveries for the year and we fully expect to do just that. Turning to Defense. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.7 billion, down 12.3% over the year ago quarter. Revenue was impacted by Ajax at both Land Systems and ELS bomb bodies at OTS and some program mix. Operating earnings of $245 million were off against last year's quarter by 7.9% with a 70 basis point improvement in margins. Operating margin was a strong 14.7%. On a sequential basis, revenue was very similar to the first quarter, but operating earnings were up 7.9% or $18 million on a 110 basis point improvement in operating margin. For the first half, Combat Systems revenue was down 10.2% and operating earnings were down only 7.5% on a 40-basis point improvement in margins.  In June, Land Systems was awarded the Mobile Protected Firepower contract the first all-new combat vehicle for the army in decades. The initial award for LRIP-1 was $410 million for 25 vehicles. The program of record for LRIP is $1.1 billion for 95 vehicles through 2026. The entire program requirement is 500 vehicles for more than $5 billion. The program fills a critical gap in the Army's infantry brigade combat force and we expect to move out swiftly on the program.  The quarter was very good for Combat Systems from an orders perspective with a 1.4:1 book-to-bill leading to an increase in total backlog and estimated potential contract value. Demand for our products particularly our combat vehicles, remains strong with Europe leading the way. International order opportunities for Abrams are particularly strong. This was an impressive operating performance once again by the Combat Systems group in a constrained revenue environment.  At Marine Systems, revenue of $2.65 billion was up $115 million over the year ago quarter. It was flat sequentially, but up year-to-date. In the quarter growth was led by Columbia, TAO and repair work volume. For the first half revenue was up $283 million or 5.6%. This is very impressive continued growth. Operating earnings were $211 million in the quarter essentially flat with the year ago quarter as a result of a 30-basis point reduction in margin.  The margin compression was the result of the impact on Electric Boat of additional scheduled delays in the Virginia program from the supply chain as it struggles with recovering from COVID. EB is working closely with the Navy and suppliers including embedding operating and engineering personnel on-site to restore the necessary Virginia program cadence. Nonetheless, Electric Boats performance remained strong and while still early in the Columbia first ship construction contract, the program remains on cost and schedule. Total backlog of almost $42 billion remains robust and is by far the largest of our operating groups. And lastly, Technologies. The segment had revenue of $3 billion in the quarter down $158 million from the year ago quarter or 5%. Two-thirds of the decline was attributed to Mission Systems, largely related to their continuing struggle with a shortage of chips which continues to plague their ability to deliver certain products. On the other hand, operating earnings of $304 million were down only $4 million or 1.3% on a 40-basis point improvement in operating margin to 10.1%. EBITDA margin was an impressive 14.1% including state and local taxes which are a 50-basis point drag on that result. Operating performance at GDIT was particularly strong 140-basis points better than the year ago quarter. These are industry-leading margin figures. Technologies had a good order activity in the quarter with book-to-bill of 1:1 and good order prospects on the horizon.  Mission Systems had nice orders for many of their product offerings, especially those impacted by the chip shortage. The IT pipeline remains healthy in most of our federal IT lines of business as the government continues to modernize and upgrade its mission support systems. GDIT has the opportunity to submit $35 billion in opportunities this year including $17 billion in the third quarter, most of which represents new work.  That concludes my remarks with respect to a solid quarter and first half. I'll now turn the call over to Bill for further remarks and then I'll provide our updated guidance. Thanks, Bill. Let me do my best to give you an updated forecast. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I won't repeat. There is, however, a chart with respect to this that will be posted on our website, which should be helpful. In Aerospace, we expect an additional $200 million of revenue with an operating margin of around 12.9% which is 10 basis points higher than we previously forecast. This will result in additional operating earnings. There could be some upside here if we can deliver out a few more planes in the year. With respect to the Defense businesses, Combat Systems should be on the low end of our revenue range with an improvement of up to 50 basis points of operating margin. So total revenue of around $7.1 billion and operating margin around 15%. There's no change to Marine Systems revenue, but 30 basis points lower margin. So annual revenue of $10.8 billion with an operating margin around 8.3%, for the reasons I have previously described to you. Technologies revenue will be in the middle of the forecast revenue range at the same operating margin driven by GDIT with 3.5% year-over-year growth. So for the group, we expect annual revenue of around $12.9 billion with an operating margin around 10%. So, on a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue at the higher end of our initial guidance and an overall operating margin around 10.8%, which is unchanged. This rolls up to EPS at the high end of our previous guidance range. In short, we expect only modest deviation from our initial guidance. That concludes my remarks, and we'll be pleased to take your questions. Good morning, Rob. Yes. So, I think the most important point here, Rob, is the robust nature of the demand we've seen up to this point, the order activity that's resulted in the extended backlog that that provides us. Not to mention frankly -- and Bill spoke to this a little bit in terms of some of the cleanup in the quarter, but the durability of the backlog that continues to just increase the quality of that order book as we move forward. So, obviously, we can't predict when and what any type of slowdown will look like. There's a lot of talk out in the market about interest rates, inflation, the stock market recession potential and so on. But to be completely frank with you, we have not yet seen any impact of that in terms of our order pipeline and the resulting order activity that we've seen. There continues to be a very strong customer demand. We're continuing to see that as we embark here into the third quarter. And so I think bottom line between the size of the backlog, the ongoing order activity the durability of that backlog, which at this point is in excess of 2.5 times our annual sales for the group. Notwithstanding, the possibility of economic slowdown or similar conditions, we remain very confident and steadfast in our outlook for the next couple of years that we provided in terms of 2023, 2024 and beyond. Sure. So the program is proceeding. The vehicle tests are continuing and they continue to confirm frankly the vehicle performance that we've seen to date. With respect to some of the things that the customer has been focused on when it comes to vibration in the vehicle, some concerns that emerged in some of the early customer trials have been addressed at this point. And we are working right now on -- with the customer on securing appropriate communications gear. So I think the key here at this point is that this is going to really be all about how soon approvals can move through the system as we undergo this series of deliberate tests that take time as would be the case on any new platform development program. Frankly this is not inconsistent with experience that we would expect on any new platform development. But like I said we continue to work with the customer and they continue to assure us of their commitment to the program as well as of their need for this transformational capability. So it's an ongoing path forward, continuing to make progress and we expect to see ourselves to the other side of this testing and trials period soon enough and onward and upward with the program. Good morning Seth. No you kind of summed it up nicely there Seth. The fact is we have the software fix for this issue completed. It's been developed. It has been tested. It has been flown. And so we have great confidence in the efficacy of that software fix. And we are currently working with the FAA Gulfstream and the FAA working concurrently toward the initiative to get this airworthiness directive resolved. The program plan for that is to complete by or before mid-September. To your point, we are in part dependent on the resources of the FAA to make that happen. But they have been very good about this. They are committing the resources that we think are necessary and the teams are working together. And right now, everything seems to be right on track for a resolution of this, by the end of the third quarter. Yes. So, on the service side, we did see very strong growth in the quarter. That's continuing a trend that we've seen, since we've been emerging from the pandemic, both including sort of flight hour ramp-up as activity and flight activity picks up around the world, as well as FBO activity at our Jet Aviation business, particularly on the US side. So I think we had somewhere in excess of 35% growth year-over-year in the quarter, in service activity. And it's frankly that service activity that is driving the upside to the revenue and the outlook for the Aerospace group for the year. As I mentioned earlier, we're still expecting our 123 aircraft deliveries for the year. So, a couple of hundred million dollars of additional revenue for the year is coming from that service side of the business. And I know you referenced, the cleanup we mentioned the backlog, but I sort of missed the latter part of your question. Do you mind repeating what you were getting at there? I'm sorry, Seth. He has already dropped off the line. Perhaps, you were getting at, whether any of the cleanup in the backlog has affected any of the revenue or other aspects of the Aerospace outlook. And the fact is, no, we're in good shape there. The cleanup as I mentioned or I think as Bill mentioned in the remarks was related to an ongoing negotiation we had with our really last sizable fractional customer in that backlog, and we've come to a settlement with that customer, removed some of the airplanes and expired some of the options there. And none of that activity has any impact on the outlook for the business. So all forecasts remain intact. Operator, hope we have our next question on. Good morning, David. Yes. I don't have an exact number on the update of 70%. Obviously, the progress on that software validation has been slowed somewhat by the fact that we've had to divert common resources in terms of those flight sciences engineers over to the fix on the 500 and 600. So that, as I mentioned before is really what's sort of affirming our risk on the slip of the 700 entry into service. So there's been some modest progress there, but call it in that 70-plus percent range remains where we are at this point. As soon as we get through that airworthiness directive resolution, we'll get those resources back on that program and moving forward to that updated EIS date. Yes. So as you referenced supply chain is definitely -- not to sugar coat it, it's an ongoing issue for the industry. It's no surprise or no secret that I think the commercial aerospace industry has had a fragile supply chain even before COVID hit. So it's probably no surprise that that's only been exacerbated. And I'd say, it's a daily battle. But that said I think there's no team that I'd rather have tackled this issue than the Gulfstream team down there. They have people embedded throughout the supply chain actively managing these issues with our partners to help them meet our commitments to our customers. And so I think while there can be issues from supplier-to-supplier and it's an active management activity that's going on. It's important to consider the impact of any part or subsystem or so on to the overall tack time of the airplane production process and ultimately the delivery schedule. So just because, let's say, a particular part may be missing its due on dock date doesn't necessarily mean that that's going to impact overall completion of the airplane or delivery of the customer between workaround that our team has and other efforts to keep the overall aircraft flow moving we don't see any impact to the delivery outlook that we have for the year. Obviously, these types of activities aren't optimal. We want to get this corrected frankly for the benefit of the entire ecosystem. But we continue to have great confidence in the team at Gulfstream to get through the challenge and they'll meet their aircraft delivery forecast for the year. Sure. Good morning, Ron. Yes. No, it's a great question Ron and I'll kind of break that down into two aspects of our business sort of the short-term side and the long-term side. And the piece that we're seeing a bigger issue in on the short-term side and you referred to the chip shortage it's really that the Mission Systems piece that we've talked about for some time now. And again that's because these are quick turn orders. They're product-driven. They're dependent on these chips and you got to get them out the door. And obviously these are highly engineered high-end design engineering type products. So to your point the specifications are quite specific. That said, number one, I think the team is doing a tremendous job trying to develop work around. They are out there ordering parts in advance where they can. It's tough to get your spot in line because this is an issue affecting not just the industry, but the broader economy, but they're doing their best they can on that front. They are also working to change designs, modify designs, accept alternate parts where they can and be as nimble as they can on that front, but that obviously takes some time. I think importantly for that side of the business, this is just a timing issue we've seen here. If you take for example the second quarter and the product it wasn't able to ship at the end of the quarter, we've seen the vast majority of that actually get shipped in the first month of the third quarter. So that is flowing through. It doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet. I think this is going to be something that's going to bug us for the balance of the year and maybe spill over a little into next year. But the fact is we've seen some of the strongest order activity from the customer in this area. So I think this is just a timing thing. We'll come through it and the order demand is there so that this will continue on into the balance of this year and beyond. So that's sort of on the short-term side of the business. The other big supply chain side that we're seeing frankly is a little bit different. It's on frankly the longest \u2013 longest leg side of the business and that's in the shipbuilding side. And really there it's less about parts or material availability. It's about the availability of labor the price and availability of skilled labor. And so we're seeing that really hit the supply chain for us. And for us it's focused primarily on the Virginia Class program. When you think of NASCO out on the West Coast and frankly the Columbia program at Electric Boat those are all hitting this in stride. But on the Virginia program, the supply chain has stumbled a little bit more. And when you think about it we have been working hard even prior to COVID to ramp-up our resources on those programs to support two per year Virginia as well as the addition of Columbia. And we were making pretty good headwind on that. And then COVID hits and you take two steps back instead -- or at least a pause instead of needing to take two steps forward. So when you think about shipbuilding and the nature of that business -- a shock like that to the system can hit it quickly, but it just takes time for it to recover. And so that's what we're seeing on the Virginia program as the supply chain is struggling to catch back up and, sort of, hit that cadence that they need to be on. But again like Gulfstream like Mission Systems Electric Boat has got all the resources that we can bring to bear and all the sense of urgency to apply to that supply chain. And once we can get that schedule right I think we'll be back on track. But in the meantime that schedule extension brings cost and that cost brings an impact to margins and that's what's affecting our outlook for that business. So that's -- I'm trying to give you a complete answer as I can on the supply chain as it hits the defense side. So that's sort of both into the spectrum from my perspective. Yes, good question. I want to take a step back and maybe give a little clarity on what we've seen through the first half of this year and then what that means for where we're going. Obviously in the first half of the year we're down notionally a little bit more than you would expect given our full year outlook. I think we're about 10% down year-to-date. If you do some quick checking you'll see that what that's really a function of it that last year, our revenue per quarter was essentially consistent throughout the year, first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, which is really in contrast to the tried and true annual cycle that we see in Combat Systems and we're frankly once again seeing this year which is a sequential ladder, if you will, lowest in the first quarter, rising to the fourth quarter. So, that created a little unusual headwind in terms of the year-over-year comparisons. But we're still -- based on the way the second half plays out, still expecting to be at the low end of our revenue forecast. So, what does that imply? That implies about a 3.5% growth in the second half versus the second half of last year and I think that's imminently achievable by that group. But looking beyond that to your point, there's a tremendous amount of activity in this market. Obviously, as I mentioned before, the MPF award is a big one for us. That's a whole new additive space in the infantry brigade combat structure there. And there's tremendous demand signals internationally as you mentioned. Obviously, we're working toward the tank opportunity in Poland. There's other international tank opportunities as I mentioned before. And then you alluded to sort of demand generally internationally and everybody has kind of the suspicion that everything going on in Eastern Europe is going to lead to significant growth for the -- on the defense side. And certainly we are seeing those demand signals. I think the key thing that we all have to keep in mind here is to keep and check our expectations with respect to timing. The demand signals are there. We are having regular dialogue and ongoing conversation with those customers about that interest. But it just takes time for interest to turn into budgets to turn it into appropriations to turn into contracts to turn into revenue. So, I think it's all consistent with our long-term outlook that by 2024 and beyond we ought to see a nice uptick trajectory in Combat Systems. We're still talking low to mid-single-digit growth, but we ought to see an inflection point to growth out in that period and all of that is supportive of this. But in the meantime I'd just reiterate our emphasis that the focus and the story for Combat Systems is a margin one. And you've seen how well once again this group can perform on the margin side and be a really good cyclical no matter what's happening on the topline. Good morning. Yes, you touched on it Rob. The shipbuilding side has been the toughest one. We've seen that in Maine. We've seen that all over sort of the New England shipyards as we've tried to ramp up. And frankly those are the two shipyards at EB and Bath that we have the most opportunity to ramp up. And so you got -- it's not like a lot of other industries where you're hearing things about remote work the ability to pull people from all over the country and all over the world. You've got to get shipbuilders in those states and in those regions to do that work and so that's what presents the challenge. The good news is we -- as I mentioned well before COVID, we had been ramping up and anticipating ramp-up. And so we've had a lot of resources put in place as well as great partnerships at the state and local levels to get the kind of trade schools and apprenticeships and so on to make that happen. So, I think the resources are in place. We've just got to keep our flow moving through those processes, keep our training capabilities up and running, and we can catch back up with this. It's just going to take time. And again that's just sort of the nature of shipbuilding and it's a challenge that those teams are up to. When you look on the other end of the spectrum, I think it's all about GDIT. And obviously, they are in a hypercompetitive market for hyper-skilled talent, and that only gets more competitive all the time. I think the leading positions they have in their markets, the strong culture they have and continue to build with that workforce and the opportunities that they provide their workforce within the company, continue to I think put them in a good position to compete and keep and grow that talent, it's -- I'm not going to sugarcoat it though, it's a war for talent every day. And we just -- it's our job to keep up with that and punch above our weight, and continue to retain and draw in the kind of talent they need to do that work and as that business grows. So those are kind of the two ends, of the spectrum. I think the other area, that we monitor it closely, is at Gulfstream. Obviously, with the growth they have you need people to do that. I think, not to underestimate the challenge that they have, but I think they've done a really good job of keeping up with it and I don't see that as being as high a nail, an item for Gulfstream in the moment. There's nothing that we can take our eye off the ball, and they've got to keep at it, but I think they're up to that challenge as well. So, Rob, I hate to give you this answer, but that's the kind of thing I don't think, I should probably get into too great a detail. We obviously, work very closely with them as our teaming partner on Virginia, as well as our subcontractor on Columbia. It's a three-part conversation between us, Newport and the Navy, to make sure that we're doing everything we can to support that customer and the growth that they need. And I think, that's the most important message is we're going to do everything we can, to support that customer and we're working together as a team to do that. And both sides, I think have a mutuality around that that's very important and very supportive. So... Sure. Good morning, Doug Yes, you're absolutely, right. The G650 order activity continues to be robust, frankly, beyond even what we I think perhaps conservatively expected. I think we've said, a couple of times now in the past and it continues to be the case that the announcement of the G700 and the G800 have absolutely for our market and our customers clarified, where we are with this family of aircraft. And it clarifies, what the 650 is in terms of an opportunity for those customers. So that airplane, I think, continues to have legs to it. To make no mistake about it, the 800 is the replacement for the 650. And as the 800 comes into service, we will work the 650 out. There may be some modest overlap as we feather in from one to the other. But I think, what this outsized demand on the 650 does is it gives us a lot of optionality. It gives us opportunity, if this demand environment continues. With respect to our outlook for 2023 and 2024, we'll have to see how that plays out. It's also giving us the optionality, to deal with some of these issues, we've talked about with the certification process. As the 700 slips, we're not backtracking on our commitments to the delivery units, the revenue and the earnings forecast that we've given for 2022, 2023 and 2024. And frankly the 650 demand is helping with that, as well as the demand environment in general. And to that point, you kind of asked about the whole portfolio. And I think there's some question and speculation out there among the community about the airworthiness directive and what that might mean for the 500 and 600. And I'd tell you again, we delivered the vast majority of the airplanes that we intended to this quarter. We expect that to be resolved by the end of the third quarter. And when you look at the order activity in the second quarter, I think, the 500 and 600 represented about half the order activity that we had. So there's no signs of slowing down there. Our customers understand what this little bump in the road is and so, those platforms continue to be very well supported. So across the board -- and I didn't even mention the G280, that continues to have great order demand. I think the mid-cabin space has really picked up in the aftermath of COVID. So really across the board, in the portfolio, we see broad-based demand for our airplanes. So, obviously, this is a conversation we've been in for some time now. And I think if you look back, we had low single-digit growth last year. We're expecting modestly better growth this year. And as I reiterated earlier our updated outlook for the year is spot on in the middle of our revenue forecast range we gave back in January. Obviously, we're off to a little bit of a slower start to the year, but I'd say a little bit of a slower start and that's largely attributable to Mission Systems. I won't reiterate those issues, but we do believe that that is a timing issue for us. GDIT is flat for the first half, but we absolutely have a clear line of sight to growth for them in the second half. And so, look, I mean, what gives us confidence in this outlook? I think, the way we look at it is not any one particular win or loss or one program or another. It's really about all of the key, what I think about as, leading indicator data or statistics that are around a business that is made up of thousands of contracts across the portfolio. You're talking about order activity, win and capture rates on new as well as recompete business, book-to-bill, backlog, potential contract value, so on and so forth. And all of those metrics for us continue to support an outlook for this business of low to mid-single-digit growth. And when you look at GDIT, for example, they had awards in the first half that were valued at about $7 billion. And that's significantly higher than the first half of last year and the vast majority of that represents new work. So, obviously, this can be frustrating, I think, for you all. And sometimes it is for us, given the particularly lumpy aspect of this business when it comes to the protest and delayed award adjudication process. So it can come in fits and starts. But we remain bullish on this and we think bottom line, we're talking about a low to mid-single-digit growth outlook. And frankly, as I think about it, you may have noticed a couple of weeks after the quarter, we had the announcement of the Air Force European support contracts some $900-plus million opportunity. If that had happened a couple of weeks earlier, it would be kind of a completely different conversation around the book-to-bill for the Technologies group in the quarter. So that's just a one-off example, but it speaks to the point that, while timing can be frustrating and lumpy and the pipeline can be a challenge to get through, it doesn't change our long-term outlook for this business. Good morning. Yeah. I think the two things that I'd point out. It's obviously still very early in that process. But bottom-line as you'd expect shipbuilding remains extremely well supported. You can see the numbers there. And so that I think just continues to be supportive of our -- an underpinning of our outlook for the ongoing $400 million to $500 million a year growth in the Marine Systems business, so all positive there. I think the greater area of maybe anxiety or speculation is around Combat Systems and the Army budgets. We'll see where that goes. This is obviously something that ebbs and flows and has a lot higher beta in terms of an Army budget on an annual basis than on the Navy strategic side. But the fact is we can't ignore the fact that there is a significant amount of support among the Congress for increasing defense budgets. So Abrams, Stryker those continue to be very critical assets in the Army infrastructure and we think there's continued support for those. And so while there's a lot of chatter around it those are going to decline and what's going to happen. Let's just see how it plays out. I think we'll have to stay tuned and see. Yeah. I don't see any real high anxiety in the moment. It's obviously something to your point that we've learned to work with and work around. It's certainly not desirable by any stretch of the imagination, but it's almost become part of our annual reality. I think until these things get into a six-seven-month-plus type of situation that's when it really starts to affect our shorter-cycle business on the technology side, perhaps in the ammunition side. But beyond that we really don't see a significant impact at this point. Again, it's unfortunate. We don't like it but we've learned to try to operate around it. Yeah, morning Sheila. Yeah. You've touched on the key issues, but I think the biggest piece of it is what I mentioned before is that we're already seeing here in the third quarter our ability to catch back up on some of that delayed product shipment from the second quarter. We really got that balled up there toward the end of the second quarter and that hampered the revenue for the first half. But we -- look, I don't want to sugarcoat the challenge is Mission Systems is not out of the woods. So they're going to fight and scrap their way, but they're seeing their way toward workarounds on that supply chain side. And I have a good deal of confidence that they can get there. On the GDIT side, it is a frustrating environment in terms of the slow pace of the outlays. Frankly, we've seen that a bit on both the Mission Systems and GDIT side. But I think the hill that they have to climb in the second half is not as high. And I think we've got reasonable line of sight in terms of the work that's in the books and they just got to go execute on that should get them there in the second half. They've just got a little bit of go to get in the second half. So I feel even greater confidence on the GDIT side. So I don't necessarily get into detailed order \u2013 backlog and ordering cancellations on an aircraft-by-aircraft basis. I apologize I'm going to have to punt on that one. But on the service side, we typically don't have much in the way of service activity in the backlog. We have a very modest amount in the aerospace unfunded backlog category that is related to longer-term maintenance arrangements that we have with some larger customers. But the service activity across the board at Jet Aviation and Gulfstream is really a book-and-bill basis on a quarterly and annual basis so sort of a one-to-one typically there. Yes. The demand for that aircraft is quite solid Cai. It's doing well every quarter. Booking orders I think between the fact that the 650 is still taking orders and the fact that the EIS for the 800 is still a good ways out, we're not expecting a massive surge in orders. As we start to move closer to that transition, you might expect it to pick up and shift more from the 650 to the 800. But right now I'd tell you it's just good solid order activity that is very much supportive of our EIS timing and our expectations for that airplane. So the rest of the vehicles you have to think about our European Land Systems business. They have an extremely large installed base of wheeled and tracked combat vehicles that on the one hand have a replacement cycle with them that offers some opportunity in the out years, as well as it provides incentive for those who are trying to bring up their level of defense spending to do so in a way that aligns with their allies. And if their allies are operating and fighting one particular platform or another, that's an incentive for those who are starting to spend up more to achieve commonality with those allies. So we think that puts us in good stead for these opportunities that are coming out of threats in Europe. Across the board, though to be a little more specific, a lot of this stuff is either in the backlog or on the horizon when you think about the Spanish 8x8 vehicle. You've got again the potential \u2013 or the \u2013 I shouldn't say the potential, the impending order for tanks out of Poland. We're talking with Romania, Switzerland all of those are sort of bread and butter countries are all looking at increased spending on a variety of platforms. So that plus just sort of this, again, generic increased level of indicated interest across Europe, particularly Eastern Europe, I think it provides tremendous potential opportunity. It's just too early to try and count any of that and anticipate exactly when or what that looks like. Timing in Europe often can be a challenge. So it would probably be a bit of a fool's errand for me to try and get too specific around that. But we do see a good robust environment as supportive of combat. You're welcome."

I will now hand over to your host, Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations for General Dynamics. Over to you, Howard. \nHoward Rubel: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. With that completed, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic. \nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.61 per diluted share on revenue of $9.4 billion, operating earnings of $908 million and net earnings of $730 million. Revenue is flat against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are down $30 million, but net earnings are up $22 million in line which distorts the truly strong performance of the operating units. The improvement in net earnings was aided by less interest expense and a lower provision for income taxes against the year ago quarter. Earnings per diluted share are up $0.13 or 5.2% year-over-year. \n The operating margin for the entire company was 9.7%, 30 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was as anticipated in our earlier guidance to you, but also shaped by the aforementioned expense at the corporate other line. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.10 per share. We have roughly $400 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and almost $20 million more in operating earnings. We also beat our own expectations, particularly so in aerospace, about which I will have more to say shortly. \n As we indicated in our press release, cash from operating activities is just shy of $2 billion and about 270% of net income. After capital expenditures, free cash flow was $1.8 billion, 250% of net income. This is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in the fourth quarter of last year and not at all typical for us in a first quarter. Obviously, we are off to a good start here. \n This is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in the fourth quarter of last year and not at all typical for us in a first quarter. Obviously, we are off to a good start here. This is, in important respects, a very strong quarter, a good foundation for the year.  \n So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason add color around the spectacular cash performance, backlog, taxes, deployment of cash and the makeup of the corporate other line then we'll answer your questions.  \n First, Aerospace. Aerospace enjoyed another strong quarter. It had revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $243 million with a 12.8% operating margin. Revenue was $16 million ahead of last year's first quarter despite the delivery of 3 fewer aircraft. Revenue was almost $180 million higher than anticipated by the sell side. The difference is almost entirely growth at Gulfstream Services and Jet Aviation.  \n Operating earnings of $243 million or $23 million ahead of last year's first quarter, a 10.5% increase and well ahead of sell-side expectations. The 12.8% operating margin is 110 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. Here, the gross margin on delivered aircraft was slightly better, particularly the 500, but fully offset by increased R&D spending. The improvement comes from higher service revenue, coupled with significantly better margin on net revenue.  \n On the Gulfstream side of the service business, it was the result of an extremely attractive business mix. For Jet Aviation, it was strong performance at the FBOs in the United States. Aerospace also had another very strong quarter from an order perspective with a book-to-bill of 1.7:1. Gulfstream aircraft orders alone had a book-to-bill of 2.1:1. The order activity at Gulfstream was strong across the board, but driven by orders for the 650.  \n Strong sales activity and customer interest continues so far this quarter as well. The U.S. market remains robust with some slight improvement in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. China remains slow. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has stopped activity in Eastern Europe and slowed activity in Western Europe. All of this, however, is trumped by the strength of the U.S. market.  \n I should add that flight activity is increasing in Western Europe, including flights to the U.S. This is a good leading indicator of an improving market in Western Europe.  \n On the new product front, the G500 and G600 continued to perform well. Margins are improving on a steady basis and quality is superb. As of the end of the quarter, Gulfstream has over 160 of these aircraft in service, will support in the U.S. and Abrams interest from U.S. allies is increasing. Land Systems had a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. Orders in Europe were higher, primarily from negotiations that have been ongoing. The pipeline in Europe, however, has increased as nations are contemplating higher defense spending to respond to the threat.  \n Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me begin with a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter in '19. 2021 first quarter was up 10.6%. In first quarter of 2022, with the revenue of $2.7 billion, is up 6.8% over '21. The growth was led by Columbia class construction and repair volume.  \n We also enjoyed nice increases in TAO and DDG-51 construction volume. I'm pleased that the growth is spread over all shipyards.  \n Operating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, up $11 million or 5.5% on operating margins of 8%. We will strive to improve our operating margin as we progress through the year. The total backlog of almost $43 billion remains robust and is the largest of our operating groups. \n Finally, Technologies. This segment has revenue of almost $3.2 billion in the quarter, down $36 million from the year ago quarter, about a 1% decrease. However, GDIT enjoyed a $55 million increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter and a stunning $286 million sequentially. This was GDIT's highest revenue quarter in over 2 years.  \n Operating earnings at $298 million are down $8 million, roughly 2.6% on a 9.4% operating margin. Once again, GDIT was up $12 million quarter-over-quarter and $16 million sequentially. Technologies EBITDA margin was a strong 13.1%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result.  \n Total backlog grew $293 million sequentially and total estimated contract value grew $2.6 billion on the same basis. The book-to-bill for Technologies was 1.1:1, led by Mission Systems at 1.2:1, a good indication that their growth will soon resume. GDIT had good order activity with a 1:1 book-to-bill. Over 75% of this quarter's awards represented new business.  \n The G700 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. We have 5 flight test aircraft that have completed over 2,800 flight hours. We also have conducted over 25,000 hours of laboratory simulated flying. All structural testing is complete and all structural requirements have been met. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature.  \n The new Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 designed specifically to match the G700 aerodynamic to optimize speed, range, emission and fuel burn will be certified in the next few months. The engine is performing well and exceeding key performance parameters. Our final step toward entry into service is to complete certification flying with the FAA. This is typically the most predictable part of our test program.  \n All of this has been achieved during a pandemic and a certification process made increasingly rigorous due to industry events unrelated to Gulfstream. In that connection, this flight test process has a first-time requirement that was not part of our original flight test plan or any prior development effort. It is a model-based developmental software validation, a line-by-line examination of the plane software. The level of effort is considerable, completing 100% of the software validation is the impediment to finishing performance testing by the FAA and G800 first flight. I can assure you that the validation work to date has proceeded well and presented no surprises. It is just resource and time intensive. This leads me to some comments on the timing of certification.  \n We continue to target certification of the G700 for the fourth quarter of this year, but the ultimate timing is dependent on the FAA. It seems prudent for us at this time to recognize the risk of a 3- to 6-month slip in the process and to plan for it accordingly. If such a slip were to occur, we have offset any impact to our 2022 financial plan with an increase of deliveries of current production aircraft. This would also not adversely impact 2023. It also remains our view that the G800 certification will follow the G700 by 6 to 9 months.  \n Gulfstream remains committed to a safe and comprehensive certification test program. Production of customer G700 is underway, and we are preparing for entry into service. We will deliver a mature, high-quality aircraft.  \n Looking forward to next quarter, we expect to deliver 26 aircraft with rapid increases in the third and fourth quarters as we have previously indicated. So far, supply chain issues have been in the news in this category. However, we expect an increasing number of issues in this regard later in the year and believe we are on a path to work through them successfully. In short, off to a very good start at Aerospace.  \n Next, Combat. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.68 billion, down 8% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $227 million are down 7%. The numbers are reasonably consistent with our outlook and sell-side expectations. Margins at 13.6% are a 20 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter, so strong operating performance.  \n Stryker and Abrams have considerable support in the U.S. and Abrams interest from U.S. allies is increasing. Land Systems had a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. Orders in Europe were higher, primarily from negotiations that have been ongoing. The pipeline in Europe, however, has increased as nations are contemplating higher defense spending to respond to the threat.  \n Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me begin with a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter '19. 2021 first quarter was up 10.6%. And first quarter of 2022, with the revenue of $2.7 billion, is up 6.8% over '21. The growth was led by Columbia-class construction and repair volume. We also enjoyed nice increases in TAO and DDG-51 construction volume. I'm pleased that the growth is spread over all shipyards.  \n Operating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, up $11 million or 5.5% on operating margins of 8%. We will strive to improve our operating margin as we progress through the year. The total backlog of almost $43 billion remains robust and is the largest of our operating groups.  \n Finally, Technologies. This segment has revenue of almost $3.2 billion in the quarter, down $36 million from the year ago quarter, about a 1% decrease. However, GDIT enjoyed a $55 million increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter and the stunning $286 million sequentially. This was GDIT's highest revenue quarter in over 2 years. Operating earnings at $298 million are down $8 million, roughly 2.6% on a 9.4% operating margin. Once again, GDIT was up $12 million quarter-over-quarter and $16 million sequentially.  \n Technologies EBITDA margin was a strong 13.1%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Total backlog grew $293 million sequentially and total estimated contract value grew $2.6 billion on the same basis. The book-to-bill for technology is 1.1:1 led by Mission Systems at 1.2:1, a good indication that their growth will soon resume. GDIT had good order activity with a 1:1 book-to-bill. Over 75% of the quarter's awards represented new business.  \n So good order activity in the quarter and good order prospects on the horizon. GDIT alone submitted over $5 billion in the quarter, bringing the number of submitted proposals in the decision or protest queue to $29 billion. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of the year. We will, however, provide you a comprehensive update at the end of next quarter as is our custom.  \n This concludes my remarks with respect to a very good quarter. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks and then we'll take your questions. \nJason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is the unusually high corporate operating expense of $71 million in the quarter, which is up from $32 million in the year ago quarter. \n Given our full year expectation of around $110 million in corporate expense this year, you might have expected a first quarter number similar to last year. However, this year was impacted by a change to some of the terms of our equity compensation plan, which resulted in the acceleration of the expense associated with those awards. This was a onetime noncash item, and you should expect a lower corporate expense in the remaining quarters to result in our full year outlook of $110 million.  \n If you consider the performance of our operating segments in the quarter, excluding this corporate expense anomaly, the segment margins improved from 10.3% a year ago to 10.4% this quarter.  \n Turning to our cash performance. We had the strongest first quarter we've seen in some time. Following several years of negative free cash flow in the first quarter, this quarter was a marked improvement due in large part to the strong order activity at Gulfstream and ongoing progress payments on our large international vehicle program at Combat Systems.  \n For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of nearly $2 billion for a conversion rate of 270% of net income. Including capital expenditures of $141 million, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion or a conversion rate of 250%. So the quarter was well ahead of our expectations, some of which was favorable timing in our operating working capital, but the performance certainly reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income.  \n Looking at capital deployment, I mentioned capital expenditures were $141 million in the quarter or 1.5% of sales, which is consistent with last year. We're still planning for CapEx to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. We also paid $330 million in dividends and increased the quarterly dividend nearly 6% to $1.26 per share. And we spent over $290 million on the repurchase of $1.3 million of our shares at an average price of almost $225 per share.  \n After all this, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.9 billion and a net debt position of $8.6 billion, down $2.8 billion from this time last year and about $1.3 billion below the year-end position.  \n Net interest expense in the quarter was $98 million, down from $123 million in the first quarter of 2021. The decrease in 2022 is due to the $1.5 billion reduction in debt last year. We have another $1 billion of outstanding debt maturing later this year, and we'll have more to say about our plans related to those notes as we get closer to their maturity in November.  \n The tax rate in the quarter at 14% benefited from the timing of equity compensation activity and associated deductions, consistent with our expectations. So no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year. But, of course, that implies a higher rate for the balance of the year to arrive at that outcome.  \n Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the first quarter with a 1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.7x book-to-bill, which is also the book-to-bill for the group over the last 12 months. As a result, aerospace backlog has increased by almost 50% in the past year.  \n Technologies and Combat Systems also had solid quarters with a 1.1x and a 1x book-to-bill, respectively. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.2 billion, while total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $129 billion.  \n Finally, a quick note on our expectations for EPS progression for the balance of the year. We expect the second quarter to be roughly $0.10 above the first quarter with more significant steps up in the second half of the year.  \n Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. \nHoward Rubel: Thanks, Jason. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. \nMariana Perez Mora: This is Mariana Perez Mora on for Ron today. \nPhebe Novakovic: Before you get into your question, some of you may have noted an interesting juxtaposition of the subjects in my remarks. And I'll just note this the capacity for technology to air is endless. So nonetheless, I hope you got the message. All right, go ahead. \nMariana Perez Mora: That's fine. We got the message, right, but we got it. So on aero, you mentioned strong volumes and margins at services, could you please give us some more color on what were the main drivers? And please help us understand how sustainable are those volumes on margins? \nPhebe Novakovic: So we had higher R&D, but we had a very strong margin performance in services and a particularly good mix in service R&D at Gulfstream. We had also some improvement in gross margins. So that mix drove margins. \nMariana Perez Mora: And how sustainable are the volumes of services? Did anything change in the services business? \nPhebe Novakovic: We think that, that particular mix is going to be hard to replicate. But for the moment, we're sticking to our margin guidance that we gave you. Just to remind everybody, it is our custom to update you at the end of the second quarter with a full and detailed analysis of our prospects for the rest of the year by group and then a wrap up for the whole company. But we'll stick with what we've got now. We're off to a good start, however. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. \nMyles Walton: Phebe, on your comment around the software validation approach and the certification, is that something that's been recently added after the original certification plan was agreed to? Or is it just that you're getting to the point where you're having to accomplish this new element of your... \nPhebe Novakovic: No. This was an added process that we had not contemplated when we originally laid out our certification plan. And it's a result of events that are independent of us. \nMyles Walton: I see. Okay. And then on the free cash flow, Jason, is it the case it looks like unbilled was pretty favorable, and we know about the U.K. combat vehicle, but did the -- sorry, about the Canadian combat vehicle. But did the U.K. combat vehicle also start to pay out? \nJason Aiken: No. As you point out, we continue to receive steady payments on the international program that we reset a couple of years ago. So that continues apace. We're still working through issues with the customer on the U.K. side. So we hope to see that resolved later this year. . \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. \nDavid Strauss: Phebe, could you touch on a little bit more on marine margins, I think at 8%, that's the lowest we've seen in a while. I think you've talked in the past about that business eventually getting 9% plus kind of margins. So can you talk about what exactly happened in the first quarter and the progression from here to get to that above 9% level? \nPhebe Novakovic: So as we've noted before, margins will be compressed as we work down our learning curves on Colombia. And as you may recall, we are booking initial Columbia at a conservative margin. That, coupled with the well-publicized supply chain scheduling issues in Virginia, have driven some margin compression. But we expect those to stabilize over time as well. \nJason Aiken: And just to add to that, David, and put another point on what Phebe mentioned there, the Columbia program, while we saw growth, as she mentioned in all 3 of the shipyards, the Columbia program did bring more than half of the volume increase in the quarter. So just from a mix perspective, those are early margin rates on that program are impacting the aggregate margin for the group, too. \nDavid Strauss: Okay. And Phebe, I mean the outlook for this business longer term, you still think it can -- as Colombia gets further into production, do you still think it can be a 9% to 10% margin business? \nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. As we get further into production, the schedule stabilize on Virginia and both Bath and NASSCO will also contribute. So we are targeting that, and we believe that, that is fully achievable. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. \nSeth Seifman: Phebe, you mentioned the outlook for Gulfstream, both for this year and reinforced the guidance for next year. So I understand that that's where we're headed in terms of deliveries. But I guess can you walk through the mechanics a little bit more? If Gulfstream needs to see a significant step-up in deliveries at the second half at the same time that we'll be seeing incremental supply chain issues and then there might be a need to backfill some G700 deliveries in 2023 with those supply chain issues potentially still out there kind of some of the things that give you confidence in that delivery outlook given those sort of qualitative headwinds that you talked about? \nPhebe Novakovic: So with respect to the supply chain, we are working through all of those. And we don't see those as impacting our '23 or '24 estimates that we gave you. Our estimates on Gulfstream are predicated on the current demand environment, which has been strong, as I noted, continues into this quarter along with our backlog. So we're pretty comfortable that we've got both the supply chain, the manufacturing capability to meet all of those 2 out-year requirements. \n And as I noted in my remarks, if -- should there be a slip, then we will increase in production aircraft this year. But look, with respect to that slip -- potential slip, we wanted to be as transparent as possible to give you some insight when we saw it and then tell you that how we were going to address that so that there's no economic impact from that in either year '23 or '24. \nSeth Seifman: And then as a follow-up, Jason, I guess, maybe you mentioned you talked about addressing the debt on the next call maybe, but we could ask for a little bit of a preview. Just in terms of how you're thinking about it generally, there's probably some debt due each year for the next several years. We just saw one of your peers look to kind of term things out for a while. How do you think about where you want to take the capital structure from here and the role of debt repayment now that interest rates are going up? \nJason Aiken: Yes. I think our overarching approach to this remains unchanged. We continue to target the mid-A credit rating and want to get our metrics in line with that for the long term. In keeping with that, I think you can expect us to retire this debt that we see coming due later this year. What happens after that, I think, remains a little bit in play. We'll have to see because we talked about the elevated debt we had post CSRA acquisition and the fact that we intended to bring that down, but we never intended to get back to the level we had been with essentially 0 net debt prior to that acquisition. \n So now we're getting into the range looking ahead into the next couple of years where we're probably going to be evaluating, is this the place to land. We don't have an answer to that yet, but that's going to become more of the conversation. So we'll see where that plays out. I expect at this point that we'll go ahead and retire the debt that matures at the end of this year, but then we'll be more active in that conversation. But again, I think, ultimately, targeting that mid-A credit rating and everything that is attended to that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. \nRobert Stallard: Phebe, you mentioned the very strong order performance in Aerospace this quarter. But I was wondering what sort of impact this has had on the lead time for Jet, specifically the G650 you mentioned? Whether this is starting to have any sort of impact on customer demand? Are people like saying it's going to take too long to get my jet? \nPhebe Novakovic: No, we've managed that lead times very successfully. So present and even given the robust demand, we do not see that as an issue. \nRobert Stallard: And just a follow-up, how is the pricing environment evolved over the last 3 months? . \nPhebe Novakovic: Well, as you know, we are reticent and loathe to talk about pricing, but you can imagine that the pricing has kept pace with other economic factors. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. \nRobert Spingarn: Phebe, I was hoping to dig in to Combat a little bit and just ask what types of products you expect European nations to demand most? And to what extent do you expect those to be products from Combat Systems and particularly from ELS? \nPhebe Novakovic: So should the recent threat environment drive increased spending in rearming and recapitalizing land forces, we will see an increase in demand. And I suspect it to be aligned along our ordinance business as well as our vehicle business, both in the United States and at ELS. But I'm careful not to get ahead of our customers here. \nRobert Spingarn: Do you see much opportunity in technologies, perhaps for mission or even GDIT maybe on the cyber side over there? \nPhebe Novakovic: There could be some because clearly in today's war fighting environment, interoperability on networks and communication is critical and reliable interoperability. So I suspect there could be some increased demand, but we have not seen any of that so far. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. \nDouglas Harned: Can you comment on inflation? When you look forward, obviously, we're in perhaps a difficult inflationary environment. In terms of how you see it affecting, both on the Gulfstream side and on the government customer side, in terms of what you can pass through? What could pressure margins? \nPhebe Novakovic: So let me address that holistically across the company because we've dealt with inflationary pressures and increases in commodity costs in varying ways through a portfolio of actions. One is our contract architecture. A second is to the extent possible price increases. We've cut costs in other areas to offset some of the increases and then where possible we've had commodity substitutions and part substitutions. So that combination of arrows in our quiver has mitigated any impact. And at the moment, we do not project a margin compression as a result of increased prices. \nDouglas Harned: So your -- so you see -- are these things that you would have not done before? Are you doing things that offset -- basically reduce your costs in other ways? Or is it more on the ability to pass through some of the price increases? \nPhebe Novakovic: I can't give you a very -- I can't unpack that and give you a very clear distinction between which of these capabilities or which of these tools has resulted in the largest impact on our ability to offset inflationary increases, but -- because it's a combination of things. In some contracts, you've got contract architecture that protects you. In other cases, you take additional cost cuts that you had not anticipated taking before. But one of the things you expect from a company with strong operating leverage is when a cost increases somewhere else, you have to find offsetting cost reductions. And so we have historically done that, and we're continuing to do that. And then in some instances, you can have product substitutions. That's not particularly frequently, but it can happen in some critical products. So I think it's that panoply of weapons that we've used to offset these increases. \nOperator: Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. \nSheila  Kahyaoglu: So I wanted to ask about R&D profile of the business for Gulfstream in 2022, '23 and '24, since you've given guidance for Gulfstream profitability. When we think about the G700, the G800 and the 400, what's the magnitude of the investment you have to put in to work with the FAA? Or is it more of a heavy time burden? Like how do we think about that, Phebe, in terms of dollar amount? Or is it just more time and a push out of notification and deliveries? . \nPhebe Novakovic: Well, as we've noted, it's more a question of time resources, certainly on the new requirements. But you saw an increase in R&D this quarter. And it was because that we have this new set of software validation requirements that we need to walk through, and we've accommodated that in our plan. Jason, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? \nJason Aiken: Yes, just making sure we understand the nature of your question. I mean if it's about this potential risk that Phebe talked about and the additional effort we have to undertake in the certification process, it is both a time risk, but, of course, cost travels with time. And so there's the burden of the additional effort that goes on, the man hours that have to occur to accomplish those tasks. \n So it puts some pressure on the R&D budget. And as Phebe said, you saw some of that even in the first quarter. But I don't think any of this is enough to change the profile of what we've talked about either from an R&D spend in the aggregate in the '22, '23, '24 time frame or as we think about it in terms of the margin rate impact that it has on the business. \n So again, just to recap where we see this, we're in an elevated state this year. It will remain elevated in '23. And then once we get the 700 and the 800 certified, it remains somewhat elevated, but will notch down a step down in '24 as the effort shifts more towards the 400, and then we'll see it sort of return back to more of a normal run rate level beyond 2024. \nSheila  Kahyaoglu: And then maybe one more on technology. How are you thinking about the Technologies portfolio? I think it has a lot of good businesses in there, but organic growth hasn't been as robust as say Marine. So how do you think about the good businesses in that portfolio overall? Do you like it as a whole as a combined technology of an ammunition business? Or any thoughts to that? \nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. We spent a fair amount of time early on after the acquisition of CSRA, trimming that portfolio both in our IT business as well as in our Mission Systems business. So we like the mix of lines of business that we have right now. We believe they're complementary, and we believe that they're good growth engines, but I don't know that we heard your questions that clearly, but if one of them was -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but if one of them was comparing this to Marine growth, very few items in the defense budget are going to grow as reliably and as robustly as the submarine and shipbuilding accounts. So I wouldn't hold that as the metric, I think continued steady growth on the top line. But more importantly, the bottom line in Technologies has really been our focus. Does that make sense? \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Maugeri from Wolfe Research. \nMichael Maugeri: I think historically, sort of your commentary has been for $400 million to $500 million of annual revenue growth at Marine sort of implies some moderation from here. Growth has been strong over the last few years, maybe some risk retirements coming through on Columbia class. So with that said, I mean, is there any sort of good reason to think that growth should moderate over the next few years at Marine? \nPhebe Novakovic: No. We continue to project $400 million to $500 million a year on average. You'll see some perturbations in quarterly growth, largely driven by material sales, but nothing that changes the trajectory. \nMichael Maugeri: And then sticking with Marine, can you speak to the pipeline at Bath, maybe some upside there as it might relate to hypersonic work on DDG-1000, additional work for DDG-51? Or are we sort of pretty much tapped out there from a capacity standpoint? \nPhebe Novakovic: Well, yes, those are mixing kind of 2 different predicates. One, there's been a lot of talk about integrating various weapon systems on to shipboard platforms, but we haven't yet seen any of that materialize. And so it is not a question about capacity. We have adequate capacity that we expanded and updated and upgraded in the last few years through our capital deployment improvements at Bath and frankly, the other shipyards. So it's simply a question of the demand coming out of the U.S. Navy, and we haven't had any surprises there. They're continuing with respect to Bath and maybe have continued to support DDG-51 production. So we expect that to be a steady pace going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Baird. \nPeter Arment: Phebe, maybe just circle back on your comment regarding the pipeline increasing potentially with Combat. I'm just curious about your overall comments on how we should expect it's eventually show up in backlog. Should we consider this more of a '23 and '24 event when we're thinking about that? And then just as a follow-up related to kind of the budget outlook, just now that we've gotten the '23 requests and we saw what was enacted for '22. Maybe you could just give some high level thoughts on GD is faring given the request? \nPhebe Novakovic: If you're talking specifically about Combat, I think that it's hard to give projections about timing when, in fact, the budgets for the most part, have not materialized in significant increases. But were they to in the land forces and land forces modernization, we have every expectation that the vehicle -- combat vehicles demand will increase and ordinance and armaments will increase. So I think it's premature to bake in any assumptions about growth until you really see some of that. \n And I would say that one of the interesting things that we have not quite seen at the same level is the Abrams interest from multiple U.S. allies. So we'll have to see how that plays out over time. There are some potential out there. But as I said, I don't want to get too far ahead of our customers here, got to see how all this -- takes time to get from the threat to full funding to allocation of awards. I think you'll hear that from a lot of folks, not just us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. \nCai Von Rumohr: So Phebe, at Bath you recently had a mid-contract wage hike where the lower 5 of the 10 pay grades had a pay hike of over 20%. Now I assume mix is an issue, but could you comment on what that impact is on labor availability and cost and is there any read across to electric boat that this should be a concern there, too? \nPhebe Novakovic: So the wage increase at Bath is an attempt to help stabilize the manufacturing workforce and build ships faster. So this, in turn, will ultimately help competitiveness and margins. So we think we can fully address any cost impact. And I think the touch labor market has been less impacted by some of the well-publicized labor shortages and they tend to be more regional to the extent that they've existed. So we do -- we take each one of our lines of business on a case-by-case basis and then react accordingly. But Bath was a special set of circumstances given Maine and the realities in Maine regarding workforce. \nCai Von Rumohr: And then switching gears a little bit, what impact do the Russian sanctions have on your business at Gulfstream? . \nPhebe Novakovic: So to the extent that we expected an impact we anticipated it to show up at Jet Aviation in some of their European locations. But they were -- Jet was able to offset that with additional volume. With respect to Russia, as I noted, I think, before, they are less than 5% of our Gulfstream backlog and we had no deliveries this quarter, obviously. We've had no cancellations. And we have, in this demand environment, been able to manage the relatively few number of Russian airplanes in our backlog. So we do not see an impact at the moment. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. \nMatthew Akers: I wonder if you could talk on Technologies, a couple of things. I guess, one, I think you commented on some supply chain impacts on Mission Systems, just how those are trending. And then also just the timing of some of these new awards and when they get start to ramp up. \nPhebe Novakovic: So we discussed, I think, with you, I think starting maybe in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter, the -- some of the chip shortages that we were experiencing at Mission Systems that was constraining the ability to deliver a series of different kinds of products. So we have largely worked through those issues at Mission Systems, but we are now contending with the pent-up demand that resulted -- was generated by last year's slower deliveries as a result of chip shortages. \n And as we work through that, that ought to be upside for Mission Systems on the revenue side as we go forward. And then the timing of new orders typically at GDIT, they tend to be a -- tend to have a quarter lag or quarter and half lag from time of award to new starts. So we'll see some of the more recent larger awards begin to show up next quarter and then increasing over time. \nMatthew Akers: And if I could on Gulfstream, I mean one of the questions I've gotten is how sort of sustainable this business could be if we do go into a recession? I guess can you just talk about if that come up at all with your customers, are people concerned about the economic outlook, and sort of how resilient do you think this business could be if we do have a downturn? \nPhebe Novakovic: Well, we haven't heard a whole lot of that in the pipeline, but let's pass this prologue here. And I think what we have demonstrated repeatedly at Gulfstream is that Gulfstream is a very good cyclical. And in the past, what we've seen is relatively short economic perturbations and a pretty quick recovery at Gulfstream. \n So I think our job is to manage and play the cards that are dealt to us, and we've done so very effectively. So you can probably estimate the future of the U.S. economy better than we can. That seems to be a great support and get a Nobel prize if you get it right. But we're quite comfortable at the moment on where we stand, and I'm very comfortable with Gulfstream's ability to continue to be a good cyclical. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. \nKristine Liwag: Phebe, looking at the fiscal year '23 budget request, we're seeing a generational investment in the nuclear triad benefiting the Columbia-class. And we're also seeing advanced capabilities like safety systems seeing outsized growth. So as you look at your portfolio, with the IT business stable, leverage has come significantly down, what's your appetite to add a new vertical to the business to capture more of this outsized growth in advanced capabilities that you may not have today? \nPhebe Novakovic: No, I think we do not discuss potential acquisitions or divestitures, but we like where we are positioned to take advantage of the recapitalization of the triad. You want to ask another question? \nKristine Liwag: Yes. And maybe following on capital deployment then. Understanding that you're not going to talk about large M&A, what about additional priorities for cash? How should we think about dividend payments versus share repurchases, particularly as you're in the leverage where you want to be and the business is generating significant amount of free cash flow? \nJason Aiken: I think fundamentally, there's no change to the way we've articulated our capital deployment priorities. We talked a little earlier about the dividend increase earlier this year. That was the 25th annual -- consecutive annual increase. We've made pretty clear the significant investments we've been making in the business over the past several years. And now really, if you will, if there's any pivot at all, it's shifting back the attention more toward rewarding those patient shareholders with return of capital and share repurchases. \n And you've seen us do that last year. We embarked on that a little bit in the first quarter, and I think you should expect to see us continue that in a tactical and opportunistic way. M&A is always opportunistic. And as Phebe said, not something that we disclose out in front of anything. So that's kind of how you should expect us to behave. \nHoward Rubel: And operator, we'll take one more question, please. \nOperator: Our final question for today comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. \nGeorge Shapiro: Phebe, you had $104 million cancellation in the quarter. And I guess from what you said in response to the question before, it wasn't due to Russia. So if you could tell us where that might have been? \nPhebe Novakovic: We had one cancellation. And I have no clue where it was, but it wasn't Russia. And that... \nGeorge Shapiro: Yes. That's fine. And then Jason, where the payments from the Canadian contract in the first quarter similar to last year's first quarter, which was around $1 billion? And also, do you expect more to occur this year as well? . \nJason Aiken: Yes. Payment levels this year are very similar to last year, both in the first quarter and for the balance of the year. So the pattern should be pretty similar. And again, that customer has been very consistent in their payments since we negotiated the recast of that program. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A for today. I will hand back to Howard Rubel for any closing remarks. \nHoward Rubel: Thank you, Alex. And thank everybody else for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for our first quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have any questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3117. Thank you very much for your attention today. \nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. The first thing I'd like to address is the unusually high corporate operating expense of $71 million in the quarter, which is up from $32 million in the year ago quarter. \n Given our full year expectation of around $110 million in corporate expense this year, you might have expected a first quarter number similar to last year. However, this year was impacted by a change to some of the terms of our equity compensation plan, which resulted in the acceleration of the expense associated with those awards. This was a onetime noncash item, and you should expect a lower corporate expense in the remaining quarters to result in our full year outlook of $110 million.  \n If you consider the performance of our operating segments in the quarter, excluding this corporate expense anomaly, the segment margins improved from 10.3% a year ago to 10.4% this quarter.  \n Turning to our cash performance. We had the strongest first quarter we've seen in some time. Following several years of negative free cash flow in the first quarter, this quarter was a marked improvement due in large part to the strong order activity at Gulfstream and ongoing progress payments on our large international vehicle program at Combat Systems.  \n For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of nearly $2 billion for a conversion rate of 270% of net income. Including capital expenditures of $141 million, our free cash flow was $1.8 billion or a conversion rate of 250%. So the quarter was well ahead of our expectations, some of which was favorable timing in our operating working capital, but the performance certainly reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion at or above 100% of net income.  \n Looking at capital deployment, I mentioned capital expenditures were $141 million in the quarter or 1.5% of sales, which is consistent with last year. We're still planning for CapEx to be around 2.5% of sales for the year. We also paid $330 million in dividends and increased the quarterly dividend nearly 6% to $1.26 per share. And we spent over $290 million on the repurchase of $1.3 million of our shares at an average price of almost $225 per share.  \n After all this, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $2.9 billion and a net debt position of $8.6 billion, down $2.8 billion from this time last year and about $1.3 billion below the year-end position.  \n Net interest expense in the quarter was $98 million, down from $123 million in the first quarter of 2021. The decrease in 2022 is due to the $1.5 billion reduction in debt last year. We have another $1 billion of outstanding debt maturing later this year, and we'll have more to say about our plans related to those notes as we get closer to their maturity in November.  \n The tax rate in the quarter at 14% benefited from the timing of equity compensation activity and associated deductions, consistent with our expectations. So no change to our outlook of 16% for the full year. But, of course, that implies a higher rate for the balance of the year to arrive at that outcome.  \n Order activity and backlog were once again a strong story in the first quarter with a 1:1 book-to-bill for the company as a whole. As Phebe mentioned, the order activity in the Aerospace group led the way with a 1.7x book-to-bill, which is also the book-to-bill for the group over the last 12 months. As a result, aerospace backlog has increased by almost 50% in the past year.  \n Technologies and Combat Systems also had solid quarters with a 1.1x and a 1x book-to-bill, respectively. We finished the quarter with a total backlog of $87.2 billion, while total potential contract value, including options and IDIQ contracts was $129 billion.  \n Finally, a quick note on our expectations for EPS progression for the balance of the year. We expect the second quarter to be roughly $0.10 above the first quarter with more significant steps up in the second half of the year.  \n Howard, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A. No. As you point out, we continue to receive steady payments on the international program that we reset a couple of years ago. So that continues apace. We're still working through issues with the customer on the U.K. side. So we hope to see that resolved later this year. . And just to add to that, David, and put another point on what Phebe mentioned there, the Columbia program, while we saw growth, as she mentioned in all 3 of the shipyards, the Columbia program did bring more than half of the volume increase in the quarter. So just from a mix perspective, those are early margin rates on that program are impacting the aggregate margin for the group, too. Yes. I think our overarching approach to this remains unchanged. We continue to target the mid-A credit rating and want to get our metrics in line with that for the long term. In keeping with that, I think you can expect us to retire this debt that we see coming due later this year. What happens after that, I think, remains a little bit in play. We'll have to see because we talked about the elevated debt we had post CSRA acquisition and the fact that we intended to bring that down, but we never intended to get back to the level we had been with essentially 0 net debt prior to that acquisition. \n So now we're getting into the range looking ahead into the next couple of years where we're probably going to be evaluating, is this the place to land. We don't have an answer to that yet, but that's going to become more of the conversation. So we'll see where that plays out. I expect at this point that we'll go ahead and retire the debt that matures at the end of this year, but then we'll be more active in that conversation. But again, I think, ultimately, targeting that mid-A credit rating and everything that is attended to that. Yes, just making sure we understand the nature of your question. I mean if it's about this potential risk that Phebe talked about and the additional effort we have to undertake in the certification process, it is both a time risk, but, of course, cost travels with time. And so there's the burden of the additional effort that goes on, the man hours that have to occur to accomplish those tasks. \n So it puts some pressure on the R&D budget. And as Phebe said, you saw some of that even in the first quarter. But I don't think any of this is enough to change the profile of what we've talked about either from an R&D spend in the aggregate in the '22, '23, '24 time frame or as we think about it in terms of the margin rate impact that it has on the business. \n So again, just to recap where we see this, we're in an elevated state this year. It will remain elevated in '23. And then once we get the 700 and the 800 certified, it remains somewhat elevated, but will notch down a step down in '24 as the effort shifts more towards the 400, and then we'll see it sort of return back to more of a normal run rate level beyond 2024. \nSheila  Kahyaoglu: And then maybe one more on technology. How are you thinking about the Technologies portfolio? I think it has a lot of good businesses in there, but organic growth hasn't been as robust as say Marine. So how do you think about the good businesses in that portfolio overall? Do you like it as a whole as a combined technology of an ammunition business? Or any thoughts to that? I think fundamentally, there's no change to the way we've articulated our capital deployment priorities. We talked a little earlier about the dividend increase earlier this year. That was the 25th annual -- consecutive annual increase. We've made pretty clear the significant investments we've been making in the business over the past several years.

Payment levels this year are very similar to last year, both in the first quarter and for the balance of the year. So the pattern should be pretty similar. And again, that customer has been very consistent in their payments since we negotiated the recast of that program."

As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.61 per diluted share on revenue of $9.4 billion, operating earnings of $908 million and net earnings of $730 million. Revenue is flat against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are down $30 million, but net earnings are up $22 million in line which distorts the truly strong performance of the operating units. The improvement in net earnings was aided by less interest expense and a lower provision for income taxes against the year ago quarter. Earnings per diluted share are up $0.13 or 5.2% year-over-year. \n The operating margin for the entire company was 9.7%, 30 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was as anticipated in our earlier guidance to you, but also shaped by the aforementioned expense at the corporate other line. From a slightly different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.10 per share. We have roughly $400 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and almost $20 million more in operating earnings. We also beat our own expectations, particularly so in aerospace, about which I will have more to say shortly. \n As we indicated in our press release, cash from operating activities is just shy of $2 billion and about 270% of net income. After capital expenditures, free cash flow was $1.8 billion, 250% of net income. This is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in the fourth quarter of last year and not at all typical for us in a first quarter. Obviously, we are off to a good start here. \n This is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in the fourth quarter of last year and not at all typical for us in a first quarter. Obviously, we are off to a good start here. This is, in important respects, a very strong quarter, a good foundation for the year.  \n So let me move right into some color around the performance of the business segments, have Jason add color around the spectacular cash performance, backlog, taxes, deployment of cash and the makeup of the corporate other line then we'll answer your questions.  \n First, Aerospace. Aerospace enjoyed another strong quarter. It had revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $243 million with a 12.8% operating margin. Revenue was $16 million ahead of last year's first quarter despite the delivery of 3 fewer aircraft. Revenue was almost $180 million higher than anticipated by the sell side. The difference is almost entirely growth at Gulfstream Services and Jet Aviation.  \n Operating earnings of $243 million or $23 million ahead of last year's first quarter, a 10.5% increase and well ahead of sell-side expectations. The 12.8% operating margin is 110 basis points higher than the year ago quarter. Here, the gross margin on delivered aircraft was slightly better, particularly the 500, but fully offset by increased R&D spending. The improvement comes from higher service revenue, coupled with significantly better margin on net revenue.  \n On the Gulfstream side of the service business, it was the result of an extremely attractive business mix. For Jet Aviation, it was strong performance at the FBOs in the United States. Aerospace also had another very strong quarter from an order perspective with a book-to-bill of 1.7:1. Gulfstream aircraft orders alone had a book-to-bill of 2.1:1. The order activity at Gulfstream was strong across the board, but driven by orders for the 650.  \n Strong sales activity and customer interest continues so far this quarter as well. The U.S. market remains robust with some slight improvement in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. China remains slow. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has stopped activity in Eastern Europe and slowed activity in Western Europe. All of this, however, is trumped by the strength of the U.S. market.  \n I should add that flight activity is increasing in Western Europe, including flights to the U.S. This is a good leading indicator of an improving market in Western Europe.  \n On the new product front, the G500 and G600 continued to perform well. Margins are improving on a steady basis and quality is superb. As of the end of the quarter, Gulfstream has over 160 of these aircraft in service, will support in the U.S. and Abrams interest from U.S. allies is increasing. Land Systems had a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. Orders in Europe were higher, primarily from negotiations that have been ongoing. The pipeline in Europe, however, has increased as nations are contemplating higher defense spending to respond to the threat.  \n Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me begin with a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter in '19. 2021 first quarter was up 10.6%. In first quarter of 2022, with the revenue of $2.7 billion, is up 6.8% over '21. The growth was led by Columbia class construction and repair volume.  \n We also enjoyed nice increases in TAO and DDG-51 construction volume. I'm pleased that the growth is spread over all shipyards.  \n Operating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, up $11 million or 5.5% on operating margins of 8%. We will strive to improve our operating margin as we progress through the year. The total backlog of almost $43 billion remains robust and is the largest of our operating groups. \n Finally, Technologies. This segment has revenue of almost $3.2 billion in the quarter, down $36 million from the year ago quarter, about a 1% decrease. However, GDIT enjoyed a $55 million increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter and a stunning $286 million sequentially. This was GDIT's highest revenue quarter in over 2 years.  \n Operating earnings at $298 million are down $8 million, roughly 2.6% on a 9.4% operating margin. Once again, GDIT was up $12 million quarter-over-quarter and $16 million sequentially. Technologies EBITDA margin was a strong 13.1%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result.  \n Total backlog grew $293 million sequentially and total estimated contract value grew $2.6 billion on the same basis. The book-to-bill for Technologies was 1.1:1, led by Mission Systems at 1.2:1, a good indication that their growth will soon resume. GDIT had good order activity with a 1:1 book-to-bill. Over 75% of this quarter's awards represented new business.  \n The G700 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. We have 5 flight test aircraft that have completed over 2,800 flight hours. We also have conducted over 25,000 hours of laboratory simulated flying. All structural testing is complete and all structural requirements have been met. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature.  \n The new Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 designed specifically to match the G700 aerodynamic to optimize speed, range, emission and fuel burn will be certified in the next few months. The engine is performing well and exceeding key performance parameters. Our final step toward entry into service is to complete certification flying with the FAA. This is typically the most predictable part of our test program.  \n All of this has been achieved during a pandemic and a certification process made increasingly rigorous due to industry events unrelated to Gulfstream. In that connection, this flight test process has a first-time requirement that was not part of our original flight test plan or any prior development effort. It is a model-based developmental software validation, a line-by-line examination of the plane software. The level of effort is considerable, completing 100% of the software validation is the impediment to finishing performance testing by the FAA and G800 first flight. I can assure you that the validation work to date has proceeded well and presented no surprises. It is just resource and time intensive. This leads me to some comments on the timing of certification.  \n We continue to target certification of the G700 for the fourth quarter of this year, but the ultimate timing is dependent on the FAA. It seems prudent for us at this time to recognize the risk of a 3- to 6-month slip in the process and to plan for it accordingly. If such a slip were to occur, we have offset any impact to our 2022 financial plan with an increase of deliveries of current production aircraft. This would also not adversely impact 2023. It also remains our view that the G800 certification will follow the G700 by 6 to 9 months.  \n Gulfstream remains committed to a safe and comprehensive certification test program. Production of customer G700 is underway, and we are preparing for entry into service. We will deliver a mature, high-quality aircraft.  \n Looking forward to next quarter, we expect to deliver 26 aircraft with rapid increases in the third and fourth quarters as we have previously indicated. So far, supply chain issues have been in the news in this category. However, we expect an increasing number of issues in this regard later in the year and believe we are on a path to work through them successfully. In short, off to a very good start at Aerospace.  \n Next, Combat. Combat Systems had revenue of $1.68 billion, down 8% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $227 million are down 7%. The numbers are reasonably consistent with our outlook and sell-side expectations. Margins at 13.6% are a 20 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter, so strong operating performance.  \n Stryker and Abrams have considerable support in the U.S. and Abrams interest from U.S. allies is increasing. Land Systems had a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. Orders in Europe were higher, primarily from negotiations that have been ongoing. The pipeline in Europe, however, has increased as nations are contemplating higher defense spending to respond to the threat.  \n Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me begin with a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter '19. 2021 first quarter was up 10.6%. And first quarter of 2022, with the revenue of $2.7 billion, is up 6.8% over '21. The growth was led by Columbia-class construction and repair volume. We also enjoyed nice increases in TAO and DDG-51 construction volume. I'm pleased that the growth is spread over all shipyards.  \n Operating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, up $11 million or 5.5% on operating margins of 8%. We will strive to improve our operating margin as we progress through the year. The total backlog of almost $43 billion remains robust and is the largest of our operating groups.  \n Finally, Technologies. This segment has revenue of almost $3.2 billion in the quarter, down $36 million from the year ago quarter, about a 1% decrease. However, GDIT enjoyed a $55 million increase in revenue quarter-over-quarter and the stunning $286 million sequentially. This was GDIT's highest revenue quarter in over 2 years. Operating earnings at $298 million are down $8 million, roughly 2.6% on a 9.4% operating margin. Once again, GDIT was up $12 million quarter-over-quarter and $16 million sequentially.  \n Technologies EBITDA margin was a strong 13.1%, including state and local taxes, which are a 50 basis point drag on that result. Total backlog grew $293 million sequentially and total estimated contract value grew $2.6 billion on the same basis. The book-to-bill for technology is 1.1:1 led by Mission Systems at 1.2:1, a good indication that their growth will soon resume. GDIT had good order activity with a 1:1 book-to-bill. Over 75% of the quarter's awards represented new business.  \n So good order activity in the quarter and good order prospects on the horizon. GDIT alone submitted over $5 billion in the quarter, bringing the number of submitted proposals in the decision or protest queue to $29 billion. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of the year. We will, however, provide you a comprehensive update at the end of next quarter as is our custom.  \n This concludes my remarks with respect to a very good quarter. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken, for further remarks and then we'll take your questions. Before you get into your question, some of you may have noted an interesting juxtaposition of the subjects in my remarks. And I'll just note this the capacity for technology to air is endless. So nonetheless, I hope you got the message. All right, go ahead. So we had higher R&D, but we had a very strong margin performance in services and a particularly good mix in service R&D at Gulfstream. We had also some improvement in gross margins. So that mix drove margins. We think that, that particular mix is going to be hard to replicate. But for the moment, we're sticking to our margin guidance that we gave you. Just to remind everybody, it is our custom to update you at the end of the second quarter with a full and detailed analysis of our prospects for the rest of the year by group and then a wrap up for the whole company. But we'll stick with what we've got now. We're off to a good start, however. No. This was an added process that we had not contemplated when we originally laid out our certification plan. And it's a result of events that are independent of us. So as we've noted before, margins will be compressed as we work down our learning curves on Colombia. And as you may recall, we are booking initial Columbia at a conservative margin. That, coupled with the well-publicized supply chain scheduling issues in Virginia, have driven some margin compression. But we expect those to stabilize over time as well. Yes. As we get further into production, the schedule stabilize on Virginia and both Bath and NASSCO will also contribute. So we are targeting that, and we believe that, that is fully achievable. So with respect to the supply chain, we are working through all of those. And we don't see those as impacting our '23 or '24 estimates that we gave you. Our estimates on Gulfstream are predicated on the current demand environment, which has been strong, as I noted, continues into this quarter along with our backlog. So we're pretty comfortable that we've got both the supply chain, the manufacturing capability to meet all of those 2 out-year requirements. \n And as I noted in my remarks, if -- should there be a slip, then we will increase in production aircraft this year. But look, with respect to that slip -- potential slip, we wanted to be as transparent as possible to give you some insight when we saw it and then tell you that how we were going to address that so that there's no economic impact from that in either year '23 or '24. No, we've managed that lead times very successfully. So present and even given the robust demand, we do not see that as an issue. Well, as you know, we are reticent and loathe to talk about pricing, but you can imagine that the pricing has kept pace with other economic factors. So should the recent threat environment drive increased spending in rearming and recapitalizing land forces, we will see an increase in demand. And I suspect it to be aligned along our ordinance business as well as our vehicle business, both in the United States and at ELS. But I'm careful not to get ahead of our customers here. There could be some because clearly in today's war fighting environment, interoperability on networks and communication is critical and reliable interoperability. So I suspect there could be some increased demand, but we have not seen any of that so far. So let me address that holistically across the company because we've dealt with inflationary pressures and increases in commodity costs in varying ways through a portfolio of actions. One is our contract architecture. A second is to the extent possible price increases. We've cut costs in other areas to offset some of the increases and then where possible we've had commodity substitutions and part substitutions. So that combination of arrows in our quiver has mitigated any impact. And at the moment, we do not project a margin compression as a result of increased prices. I can't give you a very -- I can't unpack that and give you a very clear distinction between which of these capabilities or which of these tools has resulted in the largest impact on our ability to offset inflationary increases, but -- because it's a combination of things. In some contracts, you've got contract architecture that protects you. In other cases, you take additional cost cuts that you had not anticipated taking before. But one of the things you expect from a company with strong operating leverage is when a cost increases somewhere else, you have to find offsetting cost reductions. And so we have historically done that, and we're continuing to do that. And then in some instances, you can have product substitutions. That's not particularly frequently, but it can happen in some critical products. So I think it's that panoply of weapons that we've used to offset these increases. Well, as we've noted, it's more a question of time resources, certainly on the new requirements. But you saw an increase in R&D this quarter. And it was because that we have this new set of software validation requirements that we need to walk through, and we've accommodated that in our plan. Jason, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? Yes. We spent a fair amount of time early on after the acquisition of CSRA, trimming that portfolio both in our IT business as well as in our Mission Systems business. So we like the mix of lines of business that we have right now. We believe they're complementary, and we believe that they're good growth engines, but I don't know that we heard your questions that clearly, but if one of them was -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but if one of them was comparing this to Marine growth, very few items in the defense budget are going to grow as reliably and as robustly as the submarine and shipbuilding accounts. So I wouldn't hold that as the metric, I think continued steady growth on the top line. But more importantly, the bottom line in Technologies has really been our focus. Does that make sense? No. We continue to project $400 million to $500 million a year on average. You'll see some perturbations in quarterly growth, largely driven by material sales, but nothing that changes the trajectory. Well, yes, those are mixing kind of 2 different predicates. One, there's been a lot of talk about integrating various weapon systems on to shipboard platforms, but we haven't yet seen any of that materialize. And so it is not a question about capacity. We have adequate capacity that we expanded and updated and upgraded in the last few years through our capital deployment improvements at Bath and frankly, the other shipyards. So it's simply a question of the demand coming out of the U.S. Navy, and we haven't had any surprises there. They're continuing with respect to Bath and maybe have continued to support DDG-51 production. So we expect that to be a steady pace going forward. If you're talking specifically about Combat, I think that it's hard to give projections about timing when, in fact, the budgets for the most part, have not materialized in significant increases. But were they to in the land forces and land forces modernization, we have every expectation that the vehicle -- combat vehicles demand will increase and ordinance and armaments will increase. So I think it's premature to bake in any assumptions about growth until you really see some of that. \n And I would say that one of the interesting things that we have not quite seen at the same level is the Abrams interest from multiple U.S. allies. So we'll have to see how that plays out over time. There are some potential out there. But as I said, I don't want to get too far ahead of our customers here, got to see how all this -- takes time to get from the threat to full funding to allocation of awards. I think you'll hear that from a lot of folks, not just us. So the wage increase at Bath is an attempt to help stabilize the manufacturing workforce and build ships faster. So this, in turn, will ultimately help competitiveness and margins. So we think we can fully address any cost impact. And I think the touch labor market has been less impacted by some of the well-publicized labor shortages and they tend to be more regional to the extent that they've existed. So we do -- we take each one of our lines of business on a case-by-case basis and then react accordingly. But Bath was a special set of circumstances given Maine and the realities in Maine regarding workforce. So to the extent that we expected an impact we anticipated it to show up at Jet Aviation in some of their European locations. But they were -- Jet was able to offset that with additional volume. With respect to Russia, as I noted, I think, before, they are less than 5% of our Gulfstream backlog and we had no deliveries this quarter, obviously. We've had no cancellations. And we have, in this demand environment, been able to manage the relatively few number of Russian airplanes in our backlog. So we do not see an impact at the moment. So we discussed, I think, with you, I think starting maybe in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter, the -- some of the chip shortages that we were experiencing at Mission Systems that was constraining the ability to deliver a series of different kinds of products. So we have largely worked through those issues at Mission Systems, but we are now contending with the pent-up demand that resulted -- was generated by last year's slower deliveries as a result of chip shortages. \n And as we work through that, that ought to be upside for Mission Systems on the revenue side as we go forward. And then the timing of new orders typically at GDIT, they tend to be a -- tend to have a quarter lag or quarter and half lag from time of award to new starts. So we'll see some of the more recent larger awards begin to show up next quarter and then increasing over time. Well, we haven't heard a whole lot of that in the pipeline, but let's pass this prologue here. And I think what we have demonstrated repeatedly at Gulfstream is that Gulfstream is a very good cyclical. And in the past, what we've seen is relatively short economic perturbations and a pretty quick recovery at Gulfstream. \n So I think our job is to manage and play the cards that are dealt to us, and we've done so very effectively. So you can probably estimate the future of the U.S. economy better than we can. That seems to be a great support and get a Nobel prize if you get it right. But we're quite comfortable at the moment on where we stand, and I'm very comfortable with Gulfstream's ability to continue to be a good cyclical. No, I think we do not discuss potential acquisitions or divestitures, but we like where we are positioned to take advantage of the recapitalization of the triad. You want to ask another question? We had one cancellation. And I have no clue where it was, but it wasn't Russia. And that..."

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Nicole Shelton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNicole Shelton: Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company\u2019s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company\u2019s 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer. With the introductions complete, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phebe.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.64 per diluted share on revenue of $11,668,000,000, operating earnings of $1,288,000,000, and net earnings of $1,000,000,000. Revenue is up $817 million, a strong 7.5% against the fourth quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $61 million, and earnings per share are up $0.06, or 1.7%. The year-ago quarter had $52 million more of other net income, which helps explain the more modest earnings per share growth. In short, the quarter-over-quarter results compare quite favourably, particularly revenue and operating earnings. The sequential results are even better. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by $1,097,000, a very strong 10.4%, operating earnings by $231 million, or 21.9%, net earnings by $169 million or 20.2%, and EPS by $0.60, a 19.7% improvement. As we promised that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest of the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, revenue, earnings per share, operating earnings, and net earnings improved quarter over the previous quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvement. For the full year, we had revenue of $42.3 billion, up 7.3%, and operating earnings of $4.25 billion, up 0.8%, and earnings per fully diluted share of $12.02, down $0.17, a 1.4% decrease, mostly as a result of below-the-line items like other income, which was higher, and the tax provision, which was lower in 2022. The fourth quarter in the year are $0.04 and $0.09 respectively, below consensus. It is important to note that consensus lowered during the two weeks before this earnings release, as the sell side became aware of Gulfstream's deliveries from public sources. This miss was exclusively because the G700 did not certify before year end. As a result, Gulfstream was unable to deliver 15 G700s as we and the sell side had anticipated. I will have more to say about this in my segment remarks. While we miss consensus and our own expectations for reasons beyond our control, it should not distract from an otherwise good quarter and year. Let me ask Jason to provide some detail on our strong cash performance for the quarter and the year, overall order activity, and backlog, and any other items you might like to address.\nJason Aiken: Thank you, Phoebe, and good morning. Order activity and backlog were a strong story for us in 2023. We finished the year with total backlog of $93.6 billion, up $2.5 billion over last year. Total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, was nearly $132 billion. In terms of orders, the aerospace segment led the way with a 1.2 to 1 book-to-bill ratio in both the fourth quarter and full year, and they ended the year with total backlog of $20.5 billion. The defense segments had a book-to-bill of 0.7 times in the fourth quarter and one-to-one for the full year. Overall, the company had a book-to-bill of 1.1 times for the year, and all four segments were one-to-one or better. Turning to our cash performance, it was another strong quarter with operating cash flow of $1.2 billion, which brings us to $4.7 billion of operating cash flow for the year. As discussed on previous calls, this level of cash flow was achieved on the strength of Gulfstream orders, additional payments on Combat Systems international programs, and continued strong cash performance in technologies. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the year was $3.8 billion, a cash conversion rate of 115%. This was nicely ahead of our anticipated cash flow for the year, notwithstanding the delayed certification and entry into service of the G700. Looking at capital deployment, capital expenditures, as I noted on the last call, were higher in the fourth quarter at $304 million, which brings us to $904 million for the full year. The lion's share of these investments are of course, in our shipyards to support the Navy's submarine and shipbuilding plan. At 2.1% of sales, full year capital expenditures were a little lower than our original expectation due to timing, so some of that naturally pushes into next year. As a result, we expect CapEx to be between 2% and 2.5% of sales next year and closer to 2% thereafter. We also paid $360 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.4 billion. There were no shares repurchased in the quarter, so we finished the year with two million shares repurchased for $434 million at $215 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $106 million in 2023, which included a modest voluntary contribution to one of our commercial plans, and we expect to contribute approximately $75 million in 2024. After all this, we ended the year with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $7.3 billion, down approximately $1.9 billion, more than 20% from last year. We have $500 million of debt maturing in 2024. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $78 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $343 million. That compares to $85 million and $364 million in the respective 2022 periods. We expect interest expense in 2024 to continue to decrease to around $320 million. Turning to income taxes, we had an 18.1% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which brings our full year rate to 16.8%, slightly below, but generally in line with our guidance. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect the full year effective tax rate to increase to around 17.5%, reflecting higher taxes on foreign earnings. That concludes this portion of my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe for segment comments.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. First, aerospace; the story in aerospace is found in sequential and year-over-year improvement, continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, the overall strength of Gulfstream service business, and the continuing growth of jet aviation. In the quarter, aerospace had revenue of $2.74 billion and earnings of $449 million. This represents a 12% increase in revenue and a 33% increase in earnings on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The sequential numbers are even stronger, with a 35% increase in revenue coupled with a staggering 68% increase in operating earnings. The important point here is the dramatic increase in the delivery of in-service airplanes in the quarter, 39 versus 27 in the third quarter of 2023. A strong mix favoring large aircraft, strong pricing in the backlog, better overhead absorption, and improved supply chain response, leading to less out-of-station work, all contributed to a 16.4% margin in the quarter. For the full year, revenue of $8.62 billion is up only $54 million from the prior year, and operating earnings of $1.18 billion, improved by $52 million on a 50-basis point improvement in operating margin. Nevertheless, aerospace revenue and earnings are less than we anticipated for the quarter in the year because, as I mentioned earlier, we did not receive the certification of G700 in the fourth quarter and did not deliver 15 aircraft we had ready to go. That deprived us of slightly over a billion dollars of revenue and close to $250 million in earnings. These, of course, are orders of magnitude figures. We were also unable during the course of the year to increase production of in-service aircraft as planned because of well-known supply chain issues that began to resolve in the fourth quarter. So, where are we in our journey toward G700 certification? We are almost complete with the final technical inspection authorization. FAA function and reliability flight testing is almost done, and almost all of the paperwork associated with the process has been submitted. In the meantime, we are asking customers to schedule their pre-delivery inspections contemplating delivery this quarter. All that having been said, let me turn to the demand environment. The book-to-bill was 1.2 times in the quarter and 1.2 times for the year. Backlog increased $395 million sequentially and $938 million for the year. So, aerospace demand remained strong for both aircraft and services at Gulfstream and jet aviation. I should add that strong order intake was interrupted for a two- to three-week period twice during the year, once for a macroeconomic event and the second for a geopolitical event. I refer to the regional bank failures earlier in the year and the conflict initiated by the Hamas attack on Israel and the resultant conflict in Gaza. In each case, order intake resumed after a brief pause. As we go into the New Year, the sales pipeline remained strong and sales activity is at a solid pace. Aerospace backlog is up 72% since the first quarter of 2021 when we first detected a measurable uptake in order activity. In summary, aerospace results are in line with our original forecast, excluding the G700 certification delay. We look forward to a significant increase in deliveries in 2024 and improved operating margin, but I'll say more about this as we get to guidance. We also expect continued growth and margin improvement at Jet Aviation to perform well in the year. Next, combat systems. Revenue in the quarter of $2.36 billion is up 8.5% from the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $351 million are up 5.7% on a 40-basis point decrease in operating margin, but still a very good 14.8%. The majority of the growth in the quarter was at ordnance and tactical systems and European land systems. It was largely driven by higher artillery and propellant volume, including programs to expand production volume, higher volume of piranhas, bridges and eagles in Europe, and new international tank programs. Not surprisingly, the sequential comparisons are even better. Revenue is up $140 million or 6.3% and earnings are up $51 million or 17% on the strength of 130 basis point improvement in margins. From an order perspective, combat had a very good year with a 1.1 times book-to-bill, driven by very strong international demand for the Abrams main battle tank, growing demand on the munitions side of the business, and particular strength in Europe. By the way, combat's performance for the year significantly outperformed our expectations. 2023 revenue was up 13% against a flat forecast provided earlier in the year. Operating earnings are up $72 million or 6.7%, with operating margin at 13.9% for the year. In short, this group had a wonderful quarter and a year with strong revenue growth, strong margin performance, good order activity, and a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. Turning to marine, the powerful marine system's growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $3,408,000,000 is up 14.8% over the year ago quarter. Revenue is also up 13.5% sequentially, and 12.9% for the year. This was driven by Columbia class construction and engineering volume, TAO volume, and service contracts at bat. Operating earnings are down 8.4% over the year ago quarter on a 160 basis point reduction in operating margin attributable to EAC rate decreases at electric boats. These rate decreases similarly impact the sequential and annual comparison with respect to operating earnings. The EAC decreases were primarily driven by two factors, later than promised material to EB [ph], which drove additional out of station work at EB, and quality problems from several vendors. On the positive side, we are continuing to work with the Navy and the Congress to help further stabilize the supply chain with additional funding for work. We are also working with certain suppliers to set up process improvements where we can. EB also needs to continue to improve its productivity to help offset some of the financial impacts from the supply chain. Marine Systems had a one-time book-to-bill for the year, a good result for a group of shipyards that began the year with a total backlog of nearly $46 billion. Jason will now give you some color on the Technologies group for which he has responsibility, and then I'll return for our outlook for 2024.\nJason Aiken: The Technologies group had a solid quarter and a very strong year. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion was down 3.1% compared with the prior year, while operating earnings of $305 million were down 10.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year, however, the group's revenue of $12.9 billion was up 3.4%, with both businesses experiencing nice growth. The results exceeded our expectations on strong demand for the group's products and services. GDIT fared particularly well with increased volume across each of its customer-facing segments; defense, intel, and federal civilian. Operating earnings of $1.2 billion were down by 2% versus the prior year on a 50-basis point contraction in operating margin to 9.3%, and that's solely a function of the revenue mix as IT services grew faster than the defense electronics portfolio. Turning back to the quarterly performance, to break it down between the two businesses, GDIT's revenue was up in all four quarters compared with 2022, and they've now grown their top line in each of the past three years. The same is true for mission systems' quarterly revenue performance, with the exception of the fourth quarter. If you recall, last year's fourth quarter saw us break through a logjam in the supply chain and deliver an unusually high number of products, lifting both revenue and margins. Barring that anomaly in 2022, the group's comparisons on a quarterly and full-year basis are quite favorable. With respect to order activity and backlog, the technologies group had a very good year, notwithstanding the continuing trend of customer solicitations pushing to the right and recurring award protests. The individual businesses and the group as a whole achieved a one-to-one book-to-bill on solid revenue growth. GDIT received awards totalling $13.5 billion, far exceeding their previous annual record set the year before. They've got another $15 billion in awards pending adjudication and just shy of $2 billion in awards under protest. Mission systems had a great year as well, with a total value of submitted bids almost triple the level they saw in 2022. Of course, many of the group's awards come in the form of IDIQ contracts with potential value that doesn't initially hit the backlog. So much of these positive results will continue to manifest in the reported numbers over time. To that point, we ended the quarter with a total estimated contract value for the group of nearly $41 billion, and the group's combined qualified pipeline exceeds $130 billion; so all in all, a great year for the technologies group.\nPhebe Novakovic: So let me provide our operating forecast for 2024 with some color around our outlook for each business group and then the company-wide roll-up. In 2024, we expect aerospace revenue of about $12 billion, up around 40% over 2023. Operating margin is expected to be up 130 basis points to 15%. Gulfstream deliveries will be around 160, materially over the 111 delivered in 2023. This is about 10 fewer deliveries than we anticipated in the multiyear forecast we gave you in January of '22. The mix will include about 50 G700 deliveries and fewer G280s as a result of the Gaza conflict's impact on our Israel-based supplier. As I just noted, we anticipate a 15% operating margin for the year, weaker in the first half, particularly in the second quarter, and then well over 15% in the third and fourth quarters. While the ramp-up is slightly less than previously anticipated, it is not without supply chain challenges. In combat systems at this time last year, we had anticipated revenue to be flat in '23. With a changed threat environment, we had a 13% increase in revenue. For '24, we expect revenue to be up about 3% to $8.5 billion, coupled with a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin to 14.4%. The outlook is the result of the strong order activity we saw in '23 and the demand signals we see in Europe. To the extent that these demand signals start to convert into order activity, we could see some opportunity for additional revenue later in the year, particularly in our armaments and munitions business. As I noted earlier, the Marine group has been on a remarkable growth journey. In 2023, revenue came in much stronger than expected, almost $1.6 billion against a flattish forecast. Our outlook for this year anticipates revenue of about $12.8 billion, with operating margin improvement to 7.6%, which should result in a meaningful improvement in earnings in 2024. In technologies, 2023 revenue was stronger than anticipated in both businesses. 2024 revenue is expected to be up about 1% to $13 billion. Within the group, GDIT will be up low single digits, emissions systems will be down slightly due to a transition from legacy systems and a slow ramp up on new programs. Operating margins are expected to improve 20 basis points to about 9.5%. We see long term low single digit growth for the group and continued industry leading margins. So for 2024 company wide, we expect to see revenue of approximately $46.3 billion to $46.4 billion, an increase of around 9.5%. We anticipate operating margin of 11% up 100 basis points from 2023. All this rolls up to an EPS forecast of around $14.40. A reasonable range would be $14.35 billion to $14.45 billion. On a quarterly basis, the first two quarters look a lot alike with very strong third and fourth quarters. In summary, as we go into this year, we feel very good about the demand environment across all of our businesses. It has been some time since I have seen stronger demand signals and better promise of organic growth. We also have some very good opportunities across the business to improve operating margins. All we must do is execute. It almost goes without saying that we will be laser focused on operations. Nicole, back to you.\nNicole Shelton: Thanks, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow up, so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Myles Walton at Wolfe Research.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Phebe, I was hoping you could touch on the 700, not a surprise. How many do you have ready for pre-delivery inspection from your customers and also, relative to confidence of when the deliveries could take place, I mean, this is pretty much out of your control. The FAA has published a few rules last week that are pending and have to go through their process. I'm just curious, your confidence level for first quarter delivery versus, say, where you were in the fourth quarter expecting deliveries by year end? Thanks.\nPhebe Novakovic: So we have 15 airplanes ready to go and the hope is that we deliver them this quarter. The notifications that Gulfstream made earlier, I guess, this week, are in the regular order and really have no material impact on the certification process. I tried to give you as much clarity as I could around the certification and where we are.\nMyles Walton: Is there an 800 delivery assumed in the guidance for '24?\nPhebe Novakovic: So we're not going to go into what we've assumed for any given airplane in our guidance. So let me give you guys some perspective about this. For the last about eight years, we've tried to give you some clarity about a process over which we have no control and it's kind of like sticking your fingers in a light socket to predict a process that we just don't control. So I think we're going to be silent as we go forward about any specificity around certification timing because then we hear words like slip and miss and these planes are going to get certified, but get certified on the FAA schedule.\nMyles Walton: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move next to Ron Epstein at Bank of America.\nRon Epstein: Hey, good morning, Phebe and Jason. Maybe just circling back on your remarks, Phebe, around EB, but maybe more broadly, just kind of the ship industrial base, the DOD has been making some big investments. Now, where do you see Virginia-class build rates ultimately getting, Columbia, too, because it just seems like the supply chain and maybe just also from just a capacity perspective, we're just under-capacitized. So, any thoughts on that?\nPhebe Novakovic: So let's step back a minute and talk a little bit about the shipbuilding industrial base in general and the submarine industrial base in particular. These are very heavily manpower-driven businesses and industry and an entire supply chain and manpower availability was impacted significantly as a result of COVID in two respects. First, we had a really stunning increase in the timing and the number of retirements of seasoned workers throughout the industrial base. That, coupled with the post-COVID labor shortages, caused considerable perturbation in the supply chain. Those will begin to remedy. We've already seen some stabilization in the labor market. Those won't remedy, but there's clearly learning that has to happen throughout the supply chain. I'd say with respect to capacity, at Electric Boat, we are nicely sufficient capacity at the moment to deal with the demand that we have -- we see at the moment, but should that demand signal increase in the near term, we'll work closely with our Navy customer. I think key to the stabilization of the supply chain is improved delivery and improved quality and that happens as new workers come down their learning curves. We've benefited from Electric Boat because they have a very robust training system in which our new workers come out at a higher level of proficiency, but still they need to come down their learning curves and they're doing so nicely. I think to add a little bit of perspective to that, Electric Boat, we increased our velocity and throughput on Virginia by about 10% this year in '24% and about 30% on Columbia. So Electric Boat is continuing to do well. They just need to continue to improve their productivity, so we can continue to offset some of these financial impacts that we're seeing from the supply chain. But I would finally mention the Navy has been a very good partner in recognizing these challenges and working hard to get orders and certainty of demand into the supply chain and that helps the entire supply chain plan.\nRon Epstein: Got it. And maybe just one quick follow-on. Are we capacitized enough to meet the demand that AUKUS would require, having an extra Virginia class every three years?\nPhebe Novakovic: So I think we're going to look at all of that with the Navy, but let me tell you, the best thing we can do for AUKUS in the moment is get back to two-a-year production. That's one step at a time.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jason Gursky at Citigroup.\nJason Gursky: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the G400 and how that plane seems to be performing from a market acceptance perspective and kind of the pipeline that you're seeing for that aircraft. I'm just kind of curious how that segment of your market is shaping up there as we come into the New Year.\nPhebe Novakovic: So the plane is performing very nicely in excess of the design parameters. We see considerable interest in that end of the market and so we are quite positive about that airplane when it enters into service.\nJason Gursky: Okay, great. And then your comments on combat and the potential for some orders converting into revenue coming out of Europe in the second half of the year, that doesn't sound like it's implied in your guidance, but I'm just kind of curious that how far into the year can we go to get those orders and actually convert them into revenue?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, it depends on what the orders are for. On faster transaction material like service and munitions, they can move a little more quickly. Longer lead orders on combat vehicles take a little bit longer. So we factored to the best of our ability the known demand signals and the velocity of contracting into our plan. So the extent that there is upside, it'll be I think largely on the armament munition programs that execute at a faster rate and to the extent that we can speed up even further the installation of additional jigs and fixtures for productivity as well as our increased scope on delivery of munitions, that should help as well. But we think we had -- look in all cases, we give you a very balanced I'd say, 50-50 plan with opportunities and risks and we're quite comfortable with the estimates that we've given you at the time.\nOperator: We'll go next to Davis Strauss at Barclays.\nDavis Strauss: Phoebe, any thoughts on how the budget process for '24 might actually play out here given that we're quickly approaching, the potential for a sequester?\nPhebe Novakovic: So we have factored in all known funding into our plan and should we see an extensive and continuing resolution, we'll have to see what impact that has on our faster transaction businesses because every CR plays out a bit differently and to the extent that we have a sequester then we have factored some of that, but apparently, clearly you can't do all of it into your plan. So we'll adjust accordingly, but we are hopeful that the Congress is able to pass a critical defense bill, particularly in these times given the threat environment.\nDavis Strauss: Okay. Jason, I wanted to ask about free cash flow and capital deployment. Maybe help with some of the big movie pieces, obviously inventory was a big drag, but advances helped a lot. Your cash taxes have been really high. How do those all factor in, in '24 and I assume your guidance includes nothing as usual for capital deployment. How should we think about that given you have very little in maturities this year? Thanks.\nJason Aiken: Yeah, so when you think about free cash flow, we are anticipating to continue in the 100% conversion range in '24 and beyond. Obviously, we outperformed that a bit in 2023, but that doesn't affect what we expect in '24. So, the good news is a lot of the larger scale moving parts around cash flow are starting to settle down a little bit. We've experienced some big headwinds and then some corresponding tailwinds over the past several years, but right now if you look ahead, I think you can expect for the aerospace group a fairly steady conversion at or slightly above 100% conversion. When you think about it, we got a pretty big tailwind when they were building the significant backlog over the past few years and all the deposits were coming in. So that more than offset any effective inventory build. So as you transition into a period where you're starting to deliver off that inventory, but then you assume a steady one-to-one book-to-bill, you should be in a pretty regular burn rate at 100% conversion plus or minus for that business. Combat systems, on the other hand, should continue to see tailwinds as they work through some of the receivables and work in process on the international programs that we've made some great progress on in recent years. So that'll continue for a couple of years. The technologies group is a steady provider, well above 100% conversion and the marine systems group, as we noted, is still finishing up some of the large capital projects. We're coming through that now and we'll see what the future holds as Phebe alluded to in terms of Navy investment. But when you kind of net all those together, we're right about 100% for the coming year. If you look at capital deployment, as you noted, there's not a lot in terms of commitment. We've got $500 million in notes that mature out in November of this year. So we've got plenty of time to kind of see how things play out and decide what we want to do with that maturity. No rush on that decision and we'll look at all options as we always have. I think we've got great opportunity for stepped up share repurchases as more, I should say, as uncertainty sort of moves out of the environment. We looked at the last half of last year, the last quarter of last year, and the significant threat of a government shutdown sort of hung over the environment and that factors into our thinking as we think about how we preserve cash and deploy capital. So if we can get past that in March, then I think it provides a lot of optionality for us as we look ahead on the capital deployment front.\nPhebe Novakovic: If you think about it, the demand signals we see and our expected growth make share repurchases increasingly compelling. Hey, one thing that Jason talked about, just mentioned tangentially, and I want to focus a little bit on and just give you guys some perspective, when we talk about a one-to-one book-to-bill in our businesses, that's really for planning purposes. It's not a forecast. So just keep that in mind.\nOperator: We'll move next to Sheila Kahyaoglu at Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Phebe, Jason. Thank you for the time. Phebe, great color on Gulfstream. You gave some numbers around the loss of revenues and profit that slipped into '24 from the G700, which would imply, north of 20% margins for the G700, and given you have quite a few built up already, any color you could give on profit profile of the G700 relative to maybe the G650 and the G500 and 600?\nPhebe Novakovic: Hey, can you repeat the last part of your question? It was kind of coming in.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Sure, sorry. It was more just the profit profile of the G700 relative to G650 and the G500 and G600 as it entered service, just because you gave the revenue.\nPhebe Novakovic: Yeah, the G700 comes in at accretive margins, but as you all know, and many of you are quite expert in this, we've talked about over the years, including on this call, the margin performance at Gulfstream is driven by a host of issues and as I noted in my remarks, mix, pricing, out of station work, all impacted. So I think, again, as I mentioned earlier, the way to think about our plan is a really balanced plan. Not quite the question you asked, but I'd stick with that and I'd think about it that way. But these new airplanes are coming in at very nice margins.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, and then if I could ask one more on the defense side of the business, just given a lot of what your peers are talking about as well, and you have pretty robust demand in Marine and combat, but earnings growth tends to be below revenue growth. So just given inflation and mix, how do you think about GD's ability to continue to grow defense profits? It seems like combat is seeing some of that.\nPhebe Novakovic: Combat is seeing some of it, but I tried to give you some perspective earlier on the impacts of what happened to the industrial base in the Marine group, and it also impacted Gulfstream as a result of COVID. So for us, it's really a question of operating excellence, operating excellence, operating excellence. We're going to focus on that very heavily. So we drive increased profitable growth. That's the value proposition that we're looking at right now.\nOperator: We'll move next to Seth Seifman at JP Morgan.\nSeth Seifman: Okay, thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to start off asking about combat and just the 3% growth guide. I guess even if we adjust for some seasonality, I might have thought that the activity levels that we're seeing here in the earlier, what we saw in the second half of '23 would lead to some really quite robust growth in the first half, perhaps even double digit, and then being at 3% would imply something like flat or down in the second half. Am I not thinking about that cadence properly, or is there some reason for the growth to really step off or come down in the second half?\nPhebe Novakovic: No, I wouldn't look at anything macro with respect to that. In a quickly growing environment, contracts tend to come in a little bit more lumpier, and so this is simply a question of timing. I think we see mid to upper single digits over and toward the higher upper single digits over our planned period, but we've given you the plan that given the faster execution of contracting that we saw last year, we may have a bit of a slowdown in the first couple quarters and then acceleration as the year goes on, but the demand is there.\nSeth Seifman: Sure, sure. Okay, excellent. And then on aerospace, I guess it's probably about two years ago that you gave us a multi-year look at the aerospace business and the expectations there as the demand started to gather. Since that bunch of stuff has happened, I think demand has probably been a little stronger than expected. We've also seen some supply chain issues, some certification pushouts. As we think about a multi-year outlook for aerospace in terms of deliveries and profitability, is that something you can update at this time?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes, so we're going to deliver 160 airplanes that's in our plan this year. I will say that '25 will be more deliveries and '26 even more deliveries, but at this point given the issues that you mentioned, we're not going to be any more granular than that. We owe you additional fidelity as time goes on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah Poponak at Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak: Hey, good morning, everyone. Phebe, maybe just following on that, but a little bit bigger picture, I was curious to hear you talk about how you're managing supply versus demand in this pretty unique business jet market because if you go to $12 billion in revenue, that's run rating $3 billion a quarter and based on the change in backlog, I know that's imperfect, but directionally, the order rate had made it to $3 billion a quarter, but it's now slowed a little bit and we're trying to figure out where this market settles out. And so you want to get customers airplanes and you want to grow, but I know you also want to maintain backlog and that you're more focused on pricing and margins than units and so if you're going to $12 billion and then as you just said to Seth, you're going to go higher, I guess you'd be burning backlog. So how do you think about managing that multi-year supply versus demand in that market?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, look, I don't see us particularly burning through backlog given the robust backlog we have and given the robust pipeline that we have. We're off to a good start this year. So I don't see anything that particularly drives an unhealthy burn through the backlog. We have believed for some time and it is turning out to be the case that new clean sheet airplanes drive incremental demand and we're certainly seeing that and we don't see much of an abatement in that.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. So it sounds like you potentially expect the quarterly order rate to pick back up moving forward as your new airplanes are more entrenched in the market?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, look, our order rate has been quite healthy and quite wholesome and we would expect additional orders supported by the pipeline to come in this year. So we're not going to give you any real granularity around orders per quarter, but we see nice demand, continuing interest, and a very solid pipeline. To me, those are the sort of foundational elements that we rely on for looking on a going forward basis, looking at what production can ultimately be.\nOperator: We'll move next to Cai von Rumohr at TD Cowen.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes, thank you very much, Phebe. Good, good numbers. So Gulfstream, two issues. First, you mentioned the Hamas attack and the impact on the G280. Maybe tell me the status of that and what that means in terms of your ability to get deliveries. And secondly, I think the bigger question is, by my quick math, it looks like your guidance for '24 implies an 18% incremental margin at Gulfstream, which seems low given the good margins you should be getting on the G700.\nPhebe Novakovic: Okay. Right. So look, let's agree that we shouldn't in any given moment infer something from an implied margin. I think as you know probably better than most that the margin performance in any given quarter is driven by a myriad of factors that we have gone over multiple, multiple times and I think in this environment where we are encouraged by the supply chain, but we've got more ways to go, we think that we have given you a very, very balanced plan and I really stick to that plan. That's how I think about it. With respect to the G280, we have properly adjusted our plan to deal with the realities of what they are facing there. They are continuing to perform with retirees and management and as I say, we factored all of that into our expectations for the year.\nCai von Rumohr: So is that, I still don't quite understand, the 18% margin, is that sort of a P&L drag, the fact that there's -- they can't get enough or the timing?\nPhebe Novakovic: I wouldn't say it's a P&L drag. It's just a reality of the multiplicity of factors that are impacting us. '24 is a pivotal year. We saw a significant improvement in the supply chain during the course of the year that frankly allowed us to increase production in the latter half of the year. If you recall, we were delivering between 24 aircraft and 25 aircraft and we delivered 39 aircraft in the fourth quarter. That makes us pretty optimistic that we can continue to increase production, but we are cautious about the ability of the supply chain to keep up. All indicators are that they're doing quite well, but this is one step at a time and there's more risk. As I say, we're optimistic, but we've got a ways to go.\nOperator: We'll move next to George Shapiro at Shapiro Research.\nGeorge Shapiro: Just following up a bit on Cai's question, the incremental margin was like 38% here in this fourth quarter, which is pretty extraordinary. So, what changes to really knock that down to the point that Cai's comment?\nPhebe Novakovic: Hey, you guys are reverse engineering incremental margin and it's almost impossible to deal with in the complexity of this business. I would infer nothing from it. Look, let's talk about the underlying capabilities. Gulfstream has a lot of operating leverage. They've always been a good since we acquired them at GD years ago. They have been strong operating performers, with very good margin performance and gross margins coming out of their operations. That won't change, but the mix of business, the level of any given quarters, timing around supply chain and its impact on out-of-station work and mix of service, jet aviation, all of those things are contributing. So, there is nothing systemic other than those issues that you know, and they are temporary and we will work through the supply chain issues, but there's nothing systemic that should concern you about where we stand on Gulfstream and its ability to increase margins, earnings and revenue over time here.\nGeorge Shapiro: And one for you, Jason. The unbilled receivables were down like $450 million in the quarter. Is that just Ajax catching up?\nJason Aiken: It's a little bit Ajax and it's a little bit of the ongoing payments on our other large international program of combat systems. Those are the two big pieces. Yes, George.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Robert Spingarn at Melius Research.\nRobert Spingarn: Phoebe, Phebe the marine guide implies about $340 million in sales growth and in the past, you've talked about Columbia driving $400 million to $500 million of growth per year. So, could an economic price adjustment for Virginia-class be a meaningful source of sales and operating income for Marine in 2024?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, EPA adjustments can always be a good source of income. Look, I think the way that we've always talked about Marine growth being somewhat lumpy, $300 million to $500 million in any given year, but in the next two years, we expect between $600 million and $1 billion in per annum growth. So the growth is there. It just comes in on a lumpier basis than one might want, but it is there. So with respect to Virginia and any EPA adjustments, we're continuing to work with the Navy. We had contemplated the impact of Columbia prioritization, as had the Navy, on Virginia and that's just a work in progress as we work through all the particulars with the Navy, but we think we've given you a pretty good indicator of this year's revenue and we'll adjust it accordingly if anything changes on the upside.\nRobert Spingarn: So just to be clear, there's nothing in there for an adjustment yet?\nPhebe Novakovic: No. I think it's premature to put numbers in before you've got an agreement with your customers.\nRobert Spingarn: Fair enough. Thank you.\nPhebe Novakovic: And Audra, I think we have time for just one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take that question from Peter Arment at Baird.\nPeter Arment: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Hey, Phebe, maybe just to add and just speak on Marine, you've given us a lot of details on what some of the pressures were, but we've seen throughout the industry, the Defense Production Act has been used to kind of improve some capacity at rocket motors and munitions. Is there an opportunity? I know the Navy's a really good partner and customer. Is there an opportunity for to get some relief and free up some additional resources for you at the yards?\nPhebe Novakovic: So we have been pretty well resourced by the Navy and for many, many years in anticipation of particularly the Columbia and Block 5. So I think from our perspective where we really need some assistance and continued assistance from the Navy is stabilization of on-time delivery and quality coming out of the out of the supply chain. So I think that as we go through this year, I'm sure there'll be additional opportunities for us to work with the Navy and find some ability to relieve those pain points that remain in the supply chain.\nPeter Arment: Appreciate the color. Thanks, Phebe.\nPhebe Novakovic: Hey, and listen, before we leave, I just wanted, this is for many of you may know, this is Jason's last earnings call, and I wanted to thank him for his excellent years of service as a CFO. He will be missed, but his work will continue at Technologies. So I'm sure all of you will join me in congratulating Jason on a superb CFO job well done over the years.\nNicole Shelton: Okay. Well, thank you all for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the fourth quarter earnings release and highlights presentation.

            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Thank you, Phoebe, and good morning. Order activity and backlog were a strong story for us in 2023. We finished the year with total backlog of $93.6 billion, up $2.5 billion over last year. Total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, was nearly $132 billion. In terms of orders, the aerospace segment led the way with a 1.2 to 1 book-to-bill ratio in both the fourth quarter and full year, and they ended the year with total backlog of $20.5 billion. The defense segments had a book-to-bill of 0.7 times in the fourth quarter and one-to-one for the full year. Overall, the company had a book-to-bill of 1.1 times for the year, and all four segments were one-to-one or better. Turning to our cash performance, it was another strong quarter with operating cash flow of $1.2 billion, which brings us to $4.7 billion of operating cash flow for the year. As discussed on previous calls, this level of cash flow was achieved on the strength of Gulfstream orders, additional payments on Combat Systems international programs, and continued strong cash performance in technologies. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the year was $3.8 billion, a cash conversion rate of 115%. This was nicely ahead of our anticipated cash flow for the year, notwithstanding the delayed certification and entry into service of the G700. Looking at capital deployment, capital expenditures, as I noted on the last call, were higher in the fourth quarter at $304 million, which brings us to $904 million for the full year. The lion's share of these investments are of course, in our shipyards to support the Navy's submarine and shipbuilding plan. At 2.1% of sales, full year capital expenditures were a little lower than our original expectation due to timing, so some of that naturally pushes into next year. As a result, we expect CapEx to be between 2% and 2.5% of sales next year and closer to 2% thereafter. We also paid $360 million in dividends in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $1.4 billion. There were no shares repurchased in the quarter, so we finished the year with two million shares repurchased for $434 million at $215 per share. With respect to our pension plans, we contributed $106 million in 2023, which included a modest voluntary contribution to one of our commercial plans, and we expect to contribute approximately $75 million in 2024. After all this, we ended the year with a cash balance of $1.9 billion and a net debt position of $7.3 billion, down approximately $1.9 billion, more than 20% from last year. We have $500 million of debt maturing in 2024. Our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $78 million, bringing interest expense for the full year to $343 million. That compares to $85 million and $364 million in the respective 2022 periods. We expect interest expense in 2024 to continue to decrease to around $320 million. Turning to income taxes, we had an 18.1% effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which brings our full year rate to 16.8%, slightly below, but generally in line with our guidance. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect the full year effective tax rate to increase to around 17.5%, reflecting higher taxes on foreign earnings. That concludes this portion of my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to Phebe for segment comments. The Technologies group had a solid quarter and a very strong year. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion was down 3.1% compared with the prior year, while operating earnings of $305 million were down 10.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. For the year, however, the group's revenue of $12.9 billion was up 3.4%, with both businesses experiencing nice growth. The results exceeded our expectations on strong demand for the group's products and services. GDIT fared particularly well with increased volume across each of its customer-facing segments; defense, intel, and federal civilian. Operating earnings of $1.2 billion were down by 2% versus the prior year on a 50-basis point contraction in operating margin to 9.3%, and that's solely a function of the revenue mix as IT services grew faster than the defense electronics portfolio. Turning back to the quarterly performance, to break it down between the two businesses, GDIT's revenue was up in all four quarters compared with 2022, and they've now grown their top line in each of the past three years. The same is true for mission systems' quarterly revenue performance, with the exception of the fourth quarter. If you recall, last year's fourth quarter saw us break through a logjam in the supply chain and deliver an unusually high number of products, lifting both revenue and margins. Barring that anomaly in 2022, the group's comparisons on a quarterly and full-year basis are quite favorable. With respect to order activity and backlog, the technologies group had a very good year, notwithstanding the continuing trend of customer solicitations pushing to the right and recurring award protests. The individual businesses and the group as a whole achieved a one-to-one book-to-bill on solid revenue growth. GDIT received awards totalling $13.5 billion, far exceeding their previous annual record set the year before. They've got another $15 billion in awards pending adjudication and just shy of $2 billion in awards under protest. Mission systems had a great year as well, with a total value of submitted bids almost triple the level they saw in 2022. Of course, many of the group's awards come in the form of IDIQ contracts with potential value that doesn't initially hit the backlog. So much of these positive results will continue to manifest in the reported numbers over time. To that point, we ended the quarter with a total estimated contract value for the group of nearly $41 billion, and the group's combined qualified pipeline exceeds $130 billion; so all in all, a great year for the technologies group. Yeah, so when you think about free cash flow, we are anticipating to continue in the 100% conversion range in '24 and beyond. Obviously, we outperformed that a bit in 2023, but that doesn't affect what we expect in '24. So, the good news is a lot of the larger scale moving parts around cash flow are starting to settle down a little bit. We've experienced some big headwinds and then some corresponding tailwinds over the past several years, but right now if you look ahead, I think you can expect for the aerospace group a fairly steady conversion at or slightly above 100% conversion. When you think about it, we got a pretty big tailwind when they were building the significant backlog over the past few years and all the deposits were coming in. So that more than offset any effective inventory build. So as you transition into a period where you're starting to deliver off that inventory, but then you assume a steady one-to-one book-to-bill, you should be in a pretty regular burn rate at 100% conversion plus or minus for that business. Combat systems, on the other hand, should continue to see tailwinds as they work through some of the receivables and work in process on the international programs that we've made some great progress on in recent years. So that'll continue for a couple of years. The technologies group is a steady provider, well above 100% conversion and the marine systems group, as we noted, is still finishing up some of the large capital projects. We're coming through that now and we'll see what the future holds as Phebe alluded to in terms of Navy investment. But when you kind of net all those together, we're right about 100% for the coming year. If you look at capital deployment, as you noted, there's not a lot in terms of commitment. We've got $500 million in notes that mature out in November of this year. So we've got plenty of time to kind of see how things play out and decide what we want to do with that maturity. No rush on that decision and we'll look at all options as we always have. I think we've got great opportunity for stepped up share repurchases as more, I should say, as uncertainty sort of moves out of the environment. We looked at the last half of last year, the last quarter of last year, and the significant threat of a government shutdown sort of hung over the environment and that factors into our thinking as we think about how we preserve cash and deploy capital. So if we can get past that in March, then I think it provides a lot of optionality for us as we look ahead on the capital deployment front. It's a little bit Ajax and it's a little bit of the ongoing payments on our other large international program of combat systems. Those are the two big pieces. Yes, George."

            "name": "Phebe Novakovic",
            "content": "Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.64 per diluted share on revenue of $11,668,000,000, operating earnings of $1,288,000,000, and net earnings of $1,000,000,000. Revenue is up $817 million, a strong 7.5% against the fourth quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $61 million, and earnings per share are up $0.06, or 1.7%. The year-ago quarter had $52 million more of other net income, which helps explain the more modest earnings per share growth. In short, the quarter-over-quarter results compare quite favourably, particularly revenue and operating earnings. The sequential results are even better. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by $1,097,000, a very strong 10.4%, operating earnings by $231 million, or 21.9%, net earnings by $169 million or 20.2%, and EPS by $0.60, a 19.7% improvement. As we promised that it would be, the final quarter is our strongest of the year in both revenue and earnings. In fact, revenue, earnings per share, operating earnings, and net earnings improved quarter over the previous quarter throughout the year. It was a nice steady progression of sequential improvement. For the full year, we had revenue of $42.3 billion, up 7.3%, and operating earnings of $4.25 billion, up 0.8%, and earnings per fully diluted share of $12.02, down $0.17, a 1.4% decrease, mostly as a result of below-the-line items like other income, which was higher, and the tax provision, which was lower in 2022. The fourth quarter in the year are $0.04 and $0.09 respectively, below consensus. It is important to note that consensus lowered during the two weeks before this earnings release, as the sell side became aware of Gulfstream's deliveries from public sources. This miss was exclusively because the G700 did not certify before year end. As a result, Gulfstream was unable to deliver 15 G700s as we and the sell side had anticipated. I will have more to say about this in my segment remarks. While we miss consensus and our own expectations for reasons beyond our control, it should not distract from an otherwise good quarter and year. Let me ask Jason to provide some detail on our strong cash performance for the quarter and the year, overall order activity, and backlog, and any other items you might like to address. Thanks, Jason. First, aerospace; the story in aerospace is found in sequential and year-over-year improvement, continuing strong demand for Gulfstream aircraft, the overall strength of Gulfstream service business, and the continuing growth of jet aviation. In the quarter, aerospace had revenue of $2.74 billion and earnings of $449 million. This represents a 12% increase in revenue and a 33% increase in earnings on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The sequential numbers are even stronger, with a 35% increase in revenue coupled with a staggering 68% increase in operating earnings. The important point here is the dramatic increase in the delivery of in-service airplanes in the quarter, 39 versus 27 in the third quarter of 2023. A strong mix favoring large aircraft, strong pricing in the backlog, better overhead absorption, and improved supply chain response, leading to less out-of-station work, all contributed to a 16.4% margin in the quarter. For the full year, revenue of $8.62 billion is up only $54 million from the prior year, and operating earnings of $1.18 billion, improved by $52 million on a 50-basis point improvement in operating margin. Nevertheless, aerospace revenue and earnings are less than we anticipated for the quarter in the year because, as I mentioned earlier, we did not receive the certification of G700 in the fourth quarter and did not deliver 15 aircraft we had ready to go. That deprived us of slightly over a billion dollars of revenue and close to $250 million in earnings. These, of course, are orders of magnitude figures. We were also unable during the course of the year to increase production of in-service aircraft as planned because of well-known supply chain issues that began to resolve in the fourth quarter. So, where are we in our journey toward G700 certification? We are almost complete with the final technical inspection authorization. FAA function and reliability flight testing is almost done, and almost all of the paperwork associated with the process has been submitted. In the meantime, we are asking customers to schedule their pre-delivery inspections contemplating delivery this quarter. All that having been said, let me turn to the demand environment. The book-to-bill was 1.2 times in the quarter and 1.2 times for the year. Backlog increased $395 million sequentially and $938 million for the year. So, aerospace demand remained strong for both aircraft and services at Gulfstream and jet aviation. I should add that strong order intake was interrupted for a two- to three-week period twice during the year, once for a macroeconomic event and the second for a geopolitical event. I refer to the regional bank failures earlier in the year and the conflict initiated by the Hamas attack on Israel and the resultant conflict in Gaza. In each case, order intake resumed after a brief pause. As we go into the New Year, the sales pipeline remained strong and sales activity is at a solid pace. Aerospace backlog is up 72% since the first quarter of 2021 when we first detected a measurable uptake in order activity. In summary, aerospace results are in line with our original forecast, excluding the G700 certification delay. We look forward to a significant increase in deliveries in 2024 and improved operating margin, but I'll say more about this as we get to guidance. We also expect continued growth and margin improvement at Jet Aviation to perform well in the year. Next, combat systems. Revenue in the quarter of $2.36 billion is up 8.5% from the year-ago quarter. Operating earnings of $351 million are up 5.7% on a 40-basis point decrease in operating margin, but still a very good 14.8%. The majority of the growth in the quarter was at ordnance and tactical systems and European land systems. It was largely driven by higher artillery and propellant volume, including programs to expand production volume, higher volume of piranhas, bridges and eagles in Europe, and new international tank programs. Not surprisingly, the sequential comparisons are even better. Revenue is up $140 million or 6.3% and earnings are up $51 million or 17% on the strength of 130 basis point improvement in margins. From an order perspective, combat had a very good year with a 1.1 times book-to-bill, driven by very strong international demand for the Abrams main battle tank, growing demand on the munitions side of the business, and particular strength in Europe. By the way, combat's performance for the year significantly outperformed our expectations. 2023 revenue was up 13% against a flat forecast provided earlier in the year. Operating earnings are up $72 million or 6.7%, with operating margin at 13.9% for the year. In short, this group had a wonderful quarter and a year with strong revenue growth, strong margin performance, good order activity, and a strong pipeline of opportunity as we go forward. Turning to marine, the powerful marine system's growth story continues. Fourth quarter revenue of $3,408,000,000 is up 14.8% over the year ago quarter. Revenue is also up 13.5% sequentially, and 12.9% for the year. This was driven by Columbia class construction and engineering volume, TAO volume, and service contracts at bat. Operating earnings are down 8.4% over the year ago quarter on a 160 basis point reduction in operating margin attributable to EAC rate decreases at electric boats. These rate decreases similarly impact the sequential and annual comparison with respect to operating earnings. The EAC decreases were primarily driven by two factors, later than promised material to EB [ph], which drove additional out of station work at EB, and quality problems from several vendors. On the positive side, we are continuing to work with the Navy and the Congress to help further stabilize the supply chain with additional funding for work. We are also working with certain suppliers to set up process improvements where we can. EB also needs to continue to improve its productivity to help offset some of the financial impacts from the supply chain. Marine Systems had a one-time book-to-bill for the year, a good result for a group of shipyards that began the year with a total backlog of nearly $46 billion. Jason will now give you some color on the Technologies group for which he has responsibility, and then I'll return for our outlook for 2024. So let me provide our operating forecast for 2024 with some color around our outlook for each business group and then the company-wide roll-up. In 2024, we expect aerospace revenue of about $12 billion, up around 40% over 2023. Operating margin is expected to be up 130 basis points to 15%. Gulfstream deliveries will be around 160, materially over the 111 delivered in 2023. This is about 10 fewer deliveries than we anticipated in the multiyear forecast we gave you in January of '22. The mix will include about 50 G700 deliveries and fewer G280s as a result of the Gaza conflict's impact on our Israel-based supplier. As I just noted, we anticipate a 15% operating margin for the year, weaker in the first half, particularly in the second quarter, and then well over 15% in the third and fourth quarters. While the ramp-up is slightly less than previously anticipated, it is not without supply chain challenges. In combat systems at this time last year, we had anticipated revenue to be flat in '23. With a changed threat environment, we had a 13% increase in revenue. For '24, we expect revenue to be up about 3% to $8.5 billion, coupled with a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin to 14.4%. The outlook is the result of the strong order activity we saw in '23 and the demand signals we see in Europe. To the extent that these demand signals start to convert into order activity, we could see some opportunity for additional revenue later in the year, particularly in our armaments and munitions business. As I noted earlier, the Marine group has been on a remarkable growth journey. In 2023, revenue came in much stronger than expected, almost $1.6 billion against a flattish forecast. Our outlook for this year anticipates revenue of about $12.8 billion, with operating margin improvement to 7.6%, which should result in a meaningful improvement in earnings in 2024. In technologies, 2023 revenue was stronger than anticipated in both businesses. 2024 revenue is expected to be up about 1% to $13 billion. Within the group, GDIT will be up low single digits, emissions systems will be down slightly due to a transition from legacy systems and a slow ramp up on new programs. Operating margins are expected to improve 20 basis points to about 9.5%. We see long term low single digit growth for the group and continued industry leading margins. So for 2024 company wide, we expect to see revenue of approximately $46.3 billion to $46.4 billion, an increase of around 9.5%. We anticipate operating margin of 11% up 100 basis points from 2023. All this rolls up to an EPS forecast of around $14.40. A reasonable range would be $14.35 billion to $14.45 billion. On a quarterly basis, the first two quarters look a lot alike with very strong third and fourth quarters. In summary, as we go into this year, we feel very good about the demand environment across all of our businesses. It has been some time since I have seen stronger demand signals and better promise of organic growth. We also have some very good opportunities across the business to improve operating margins. All we must do is execute. It almost goes without saying that we will be laser focused on operations. Nicole, back to you. So we have 15 airplanes ready to go and the hope is that we deliver them this quarter. The notifications that Gulfstream made earlier, I guess, this week, are in the regular order and really have no material impact on the certification process. I tried to give you as much clarity as I could around the certification and where we are. So we're not going to go into what we've assumed for any given airplane in our guidance. So let me give you guys some perspective about this. For the last about eight years, we've tried to give you some clarity about a process over which we have no control and it's kind of like sticking your fingers in a light socket to predict a process that we just don't control. So I think we're going to be silent as we go forward about any specificity around certification timing because then we hear words like slip and miss and these planes are going to get certified, but get certified on the FAA schedule. So let's step back a minute and talk a little bit about the shipbuilding industrial base in general and the submarine industrial base in particular. These are very heavily manpower-driven businesses and industry and an entire supply chain and manpower availability was impacted significantly as a result of COVID in two respects. First, we had a really stunning increase in the timing and the number of retirements of seasoned workers throughout the industrial base. That, coupled with the post-COVID labor shortages, caused considerable perturbation in the supply chain. Those will begin to remedy. We've already seen some stabilization in the labor market. Those won't remedy, but there's clearly learning that has to happen throughout the supply chain. I'd say with respect to capacity, at Electric Boat, we are nicely sufficient capacity at the moment to deal with the demand that we have -- we see at the moment, but should that demand signal increase in the near term, we'll work closely with our Navy customer. I think key to the stabilization of the supply chain is improved delivery and improved quality and that happens as new workers come down their learning curves. We've benefited from Electric Boat because they have a very robust training system in which our new workers come out at a higher level of proficiency, but still they need to come down their learning curves and they're doing so nicely. I think to add a little bit of perspective to that, Electric Boat, we increased our velocity and throughput on Virginia by about 10% this year in '24% and about 30% on Columbia. So Electric Boat is continuing to do well. They just need to continue to improve their productivity, so we can continue to offset some of these financial impacts that we're seeing from the supply chain. But I would finally mention the Navy has been a very good partner in recognizing these challenges and working hard to get orders and certainty of demand into the supply chain and that helps the entire supply chain plan. So I think we're going to look at all of that with the Navy, but let me tell you, the best thing we can do for AUKUS in the moment is get back to two-a-year production. That's one step at a time. So the plane is performing very nicely in excess of the design parameters. We see considerable interest in that end of the market and so we are quite positive about that airplane when it enters into service. Well, it depends on what the orders are for. On faster transaction material like service and munitions, they can move a little more quickly. Longer lead orders on combat vehicles take a little bit longer. So we factored to the best of our ability the known demand signals and the velocity of contracting into our plan. So the extent that there is upside, it'll be I think largely on the armament munition programs that execute at a faster rate and to the extent that we can speed up even further the installation of additional jigs and fixtures for productivity as well as our increased scope on delivery of munitions, that should help as well. But we think we had -- look in all cases, we give you a very balanced I'd say, 50-50 plan with opportunities and risks and we're quite comfortable with the estimates that we've given you at the time. So we have factored in all known funding into our plan and should we see an extensive and continuing resolution, we'll have to see what impact that has on our faster transaction businesses because every CR plays out a bit differently and to the extent that we have a sequester then we have factored some of that, but apparently, clearly you can't do all of it into your plan. So we'll adjust accordingly, but we are hopeful that the Congress is able to pass a critical defense bill, particularly in these times given the threat environment. If you think about it, the demand signals we see and our expected growth make share repurchases increasingly compelling. Hey, one thing that Jason talked about, just mentioned tangentially, and I want to focus a little bit on and just give you guys some perspective, when we talk about a one-to-one book-to-bill in our businesses, that's really for planning purposes. It's not a forecast. So just keep that in mind. Hey, can you repeat the last part of your question? It was kind of coming in. Yeah, the G700 comes in at accretive margins, but as you all know, and many of you are quite expert in this, we've talked about over the years, including on this call, the margin performance at Gulfstream is driven by a host of issues and as I noted in my remarks, mix, pricing, out of station work, all impacted. So I think, again, as I mentioned earlier, the way to think about our plan is a really balanced plan. Not quite the question you asked, but I'd stick with that and I'd think about it that way. But these new airplanes are coming in at very nice margins. Combat is seeing some of it, but I tried to give you some perspective earlier on the impacts of what happened to the industrial base in the Marine group, and it also impacted Gulfstream as a result of COVID. So for us, it's really a question of operating excellence, operating excellence, operating excellence. We're going to focus on that very heavily. So we drive increased profitable growth. That's the value proposition that we're looking at right now. No, I wouldn't look at anything macro with respect to that. In a quickly growing environment, contracts tend to come in a little bit more lumpier, and so this is simply a question of timing. I think we see mid to upper single digits over and toward the higher upper single digits over our planned period, but we've given you the plan that given the faster execution of contracting that we saw last year, we may have a bit of a slowdown in the first couple quarters and then acceleration as the year goes on, but the demand is there. Yes, so we're going to deliver 160 airplanes that's in our plan this year. I will say that '25 will be more deliveries and '26 even more deliveries, but at this point given the issues that you mentioned, we're not going to be any more granular than that. We owe you additional fidelity as time goes on. Well, look, I don't see us particularly burning through backlog given the robust backlog we have and given the robust pipeline that we have. We're off to a good start this year. So I don't see anything that particularly drives an unhealthy burn through the backlog. We have believed for some time and it is turning out to be the case that new clean sheet airplanes drive incremental demand and we're certainly seeing that and we don't see much of an abatement in that. Well, look, our order rate has been quite healthy and quite wholesome and we would expect additional orders supported by the pipeline to come in this year. So we're not going to give you any real granularity around orders per quarter, but we see nice demand, continuing interest, and a very solid pipeline. To me, those are the sort of foundational elements that we rely on for looking on a going forward basis, looking at what production can ultimately be. Okay. Right. So look, let's agree that we shouldn't in any given moment infer something from an implied margin. I think as you know probably better than most that the margin performance in any given quarter is driven by a myriad of factors that we have gone over multiple, multiple times and I think in this environment where we are encouraged by the supply chain, but we've got more ways to go, we think that we have given you a very, very balanced plan and I really stick to that plan. That's how I think about it. With respect to the G280, we have properly adjusted our plan to deal with the realities of what they are facing there. They are continuing to perform with retirees and management and as I say, we factored all of that into our expectations for the year. I wouldn't say it's a P&L drag. It's just a reality of the multiplicity of factors that are impacting us. '24 is a pivotal year. We saw a significant improvement in the supply chain during the course of the year that frankly allowed us to increase production in the latter half of the year. If you recall, we were delivering between 24 aircraft and 25 aircraft and we delivered 39 aircraft in the fourth quarter. That makes us pretty optimistic that we can continue to increase production, but we are cautious about the ability of the supply chain to keep up. All indicators are that they're doing quite well, but this is one step at a time and there's more risk. As I say, we're optimistic, but we've got a ways to go. Hey, you guys are reverse engineering incremental margin and it's almost impossible to deal with in the complexity of this business. I would infer nothing from it. Look, let's talk about the underlying capabilities. Gulfstream has a lot of operating leverage. They've always been a good since we acquired them at GD years ago. They have been strong operating performers, with very good margin performance and gross margins coming out of their operations. That won't change, but the mix of business, the level of any given quarters, timing around supply chain and its impact on out-of-station work and mix of service, jet aviation, all of those things are contributing. So, there is nothing systemic other than those issues that you know, and they are temporary and we will work through the supply chain issues, but there's nothing systemic that should concern you about where we stand on Gulfstream and its ability to increase margins, earnings and revenue over time here. Well, EPA adjustments can always be a good source of income. Look, I think the way that we've always talked about Marine growth being somewhat lumpy, $300 million to $500 million in any given year, but in the next two years, we expect between $600 million and $1 billion in per annum growth. So the growth is there. It just comes in on a lumpier basis than one might want, but it is there. So with respect to Virginia and any EPA adjustments, we're continuing to work with the Navy. We had contemplated the impact of Columbia prioritization, as had the Navy, on Virginia and that's just a work in progress as we work through all the particulars with the Navy, but we think we've given you a pretty good indicator of this year's revenue and we'll adjust it accordingly if anything changes on the upside. No. I think it's premature to put numbers in before you've got an agreement with your customers. And Audra, I think we have time for just one more question. So we have been pretty well resourced by the Navy and for many, many years in anticipation of particularly the Columbia and Block 5. So I think from our perspective where we really need some assistance and continued assistance from the Navy is stabilization of on-time delivery and quality coming out of the out of the supply chain. So I think that as we go through this year, I'm sure there'll be additional opportunities for us to work with the Navy and find some ability to relieve those pain points that remain in the supply chain. Hey, and listen, before we leave, I just wanted, this is for many of you may know, this is Jason's last earnings call, and I wanted to thank him for his excellent years of service as a CFO. He will be missed, but his work will continue at Technologies. So I'm sure all of you will join me in congratulating Jason on a superb CFO job well done over the years."

On the call today are Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer, and Bill Moss, Vice President and Controller. With the introductions complete, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jason.\nJason Aiken: Thank you Nicole. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. The first thing I\u2019ll note is that our Chairman and CEO, Phebe Novakovic, is under the weather today, so I\u2019ll be conducting today\u2019s call along with Bill.  Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.04 per diluted share on revenue of $10.6 billion, operating earnings of $1.06 billion and net income of $836 million. Revenue was up $596 million or 6% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $41 million or 3.7%. Net earnings were down $66 million and earnings per share were down 6.7%. The quarter-over-quarter results show significant growth in revenue but a 100 basis point contraction in operating margin. On the other hand, sequential results are quite good across the board. Here, we beat last quarter\u2019s revenue by 4.1%, operating earnings by 9.9%, net earnings by 12.4%, and EPS by 12.6%. From a different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.13 per share on higher revenue and better operating earnings than anticipated. Operating margin is about the same as expected. The beat came almost entirely from operations. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up 7.2%, operating earnings were down less than 1%, and diluted earnings per share were down 2.6%. We had another very strong quarter from a cash perspective. Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $1.32 billion and free cash flow was $1.1 billion, which is 131% of net earnings. This follows very good cash performance in the first half. Order performance was good in the quarter in all segments and particularly strong at Gulfstream and the marine segment. You\u2019ll hear more detail on cash and backlog, as well as some of the other financial particulars from Bill in just a minute. In short, we enjoyed a strong quarter, particularly so in light of the supply chain and program mix headwinds that time will cure, so let me move right ahead with some color around the performance of the business segments. First, aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $2.03 billion and operating earnings of $268 million with a 13.2% operating margin. Revenue was down $315 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by fewer deliveries at Gulfstream due to supply chain constraints. Operating earnings were down $44 million on lower revenue and a 10 basis point contraction in margin. The sequential comparison is much better - revenue was up $79 million or 4%, and operating earnings were up $32 million or 13.6% on 110 basis point improvement in margin. There were 27 deliveries in the quarter, three more than in the second quarter. To provide some additional color here, Gulfstream has made 72 aircraft deliveries through the end of the quarter. We are on track to deliver between 40 and 45 currently in-service aircraft in the fourth quarter. All-in including G700s, we anticipate in excess of 60 deliveries in the quarter, assuming we\u2019re granted FAA certification before the end of the year. That said, as you can tell, there\u2019s a considerable amount of uncertainty as we get closer to certification. Moving to the demand environment, this was yet another positive quarter reflecting continuing strong demand. Aerospace book-to-bill was 1.4 to 1, and Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.5 to 1. We continue to have vibrant sales activity going into the fourth quarter and expect strong orders. It would, however, be a stretch to get to 1 to 1 in the fourth quarter, given our expectation of over 60 deliveries. A wildcard in the quarter will be the conflict in Israel and its impact on demand, if any. The period of significant increased aircraft demand began in mid-February of 2021, over two and a half years ago. In 2021, Gulfstream\u2019s book-to-bill was 1.7 to 1, in \u201922 it was 1.5 to 1, and year-to-date 2023 it\u2019s 1.3 to 1. This includes the first quarter of 2023, when there was a three-week hiatus in orders as a result of the failure of several regional banks. In that quarter, we still managed a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill.  All of this leads quite naturally to an astonishing build of the aerospace backlog. It grew from $11.6 billion at the end of 2020 to $20.1 billion at the end of the third quarter 2023, an increase of over 70% in two and three-quarter years. This all speaks to me of the underlying strength of the market for our products. The G700 flight test and certification program continues to move closer to its ultimate conclusion. We continue to plan for certification in the fourth quarter of this year, largely dependent upon the availability of FAA resources and a credit the FAA may allow for company flying. We currently are spending most of our engineering time on final reports and data submission. Operationally, Gulfstream continues to make good progress under difficult circumstances, but as a result of the supply chain issues that we\u2019ve previously discussed, we plan to deliver 10 to 12 fewer aircraft this year than the 145 we had originally forecast in the beginning of the year. On the other hand, we continue to expect more service revenue than initially predicted. Next, combat systems. Combat systems had revenue of $2.22 billion, up a stunning 24.4% over the year-ago quarter with growth at each of the business units, but particularly at OTS and European land systems. Earnings were $300 million, which was up 10.7%. Margins at 13.5% represent 170 basis point reduction versus the year-ago quarter, so once again we saw powerful revenue performance coupled with more modest operating margins in large part attributable to mix and new program starts. Some of our revenue increase is a result of facilities contracts to increase our artillery production capacity taken at lower margin. As you\u2019d expect, these contracts will result in additional production at accretive margins over time. On the subject of munitions, we\u2019re working very closely with our government customer and have accelerated production faster than planned. The large capacity expansion that we\u2019re putting in place today will further increase production. We have a ways to go, but we\u2019re making progress. The increase in combat revenue also came from new international vehicle programs, the ramp-up of the M10 Booker, higher artillery program volume, and higher volume on Piranha and Eagle vehicles in Europe. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $300 million or 15.6%, and earnings were up $49 million or 19.5% on a 50 basis point improvement in margin. Year-to-date, revenue was up $775 million or 15.1% and operating earnings were up $53 million or 7.1% over last year, so the numbers are quite impressive quarter-over-quarter, sequentially and year-to-date. Combat systems experienced very good order performance. Orders in the quarter resulted in a one-to-one book-to-bill, a very strong performance given the increased revenue and evidencing strong demand for munitions and international combat vehicles. Year-to-date, the book-to-bill is 1.3 to 1, which fully supports the growth outlook. Turning to marine systems, once again our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Marine systems revenue of $3 billion was up $233 million or 8.4% against the year-ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering drove the growth. Operating earnings were $211 million, down $27 million versus the year-ago quarter with 160 basis point decrement in operating margin. The year-ago quarter had a number of favorable EAC adjustments which did not repeat this quarter. Sequentially, both revenue and operating earnings were down somewhat. Importantly, year-to-date revenue was up $982 million, 12.2%; however, earnings were essentially flat on a 90 basis point contraction in operating margin.  The real driver of the margin difficulty has been the late deliveries at Electric Boat from the supply chain, which causes out-of-station work and internal scheduling disruptions. Electric Boat has continued to improve its throughput, but not fast enough to offset the cost of late material. We continue with the help of the Navy to work this issue. At Bath, while we\u2019re seeing signs of improved productivity, it has yet to manifest in the business\u2019 financial performance. All that said, we\u2019re looking for slow but steady incremental margin growth over time. Importantly, marine systems enjoyed a very good quarter from an orders perspective with a 2.3 to 1 book-to-bill. This is a very large enduring backlog. Lastly, technologies. It was another strong quarter with revenue of $3.3 billion, which is up 8% over the prior year and continues to build on the strong first half of the year. That growth was spread pretty evenly between GDIT and mission systems; in fact, each business grew both year-over-year and sequentially. At GDIT, we\u2019re seeing particular strength in the defense and federal civilian portfolios as our technology accelerator investments and capabilities like zero trust, artificial intelligence, digital engineering and 5G are really resonating with customers and driving increased demand.  At mission systems, the cyber and naval platform markets have been particularly strong. The production and delivery cadence on the hardware side appears to have stabilized, so we expect their results to be somewhat more predictable despite the lingering fragility in the supply chain that will continue to be the new normal. Based on the strength of the first three quarters, the group is on track to achieve our increased sales forecast of $12.7 billion for the year. Operating earnings in the quarter were $315 million, up 10.5%, yielding a margin of 9.5% - that\u2019s up 20 basis points year-over-year and up 70 basis points sequentially, so a very solid performance on strong revenue growth in the quarter. This is a drumbeat we expect to see continue in the fourth quarter. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $12.7 billion. Through the first nine months, the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1 to 1, keeping pace with the strong revenue growth across the business. Prospects remain strong with a qualified funnel of over $125 billion in opportunities they\u2019re pursuing across the portfolio. Let me close with a review of the defense units in aggregate. As a whole on a quarter-over-quarter basis, defense had revenue of $8.54 billion, up $911 million or 11.9% over the year-ago quarter. On the same basis, earnings of $826 million were up $32 million or 4%. On a sequential basis, the pattern is similar - revenue was up $340 million or 4.1% and earnings were up $57 million or 7.4%. Year-to-date against the same period last year, revenue of $24.7 billion was up 10.2% and operating earnings were up $60 million or 2.6%. In short, our defense businesses are experiencing significant growth in revenue and to a lesser degree in earnings; however, we need to continue to work with our supply chain in order to achieve appropriate operating leverage. With that, let me turn it over to Bill.\nBill Moss: Thank you Jason, and good morning. We had another very good quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 to 1 for the company. This is particularly impressive with the strong revenue growth in the quarter. Marine systems and aerospace led the way with book-to-bill ratios of 2.3 and 1.4 respectively. For the second quarter in a row, this led to record level backlog of $95.6 billion at the end of the quarter, up 4.6% from last quarter and up 7.6% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter just shy of $133 billion. Moving to our cash performance, this was another strong story in the quarter with over $1.3 billion of operating cash flow. This brings us to $3.5 billion of operating cash flow through the first nine months of the year. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.1 billion for the quarter and $2.9 billion year-to-date, or 126% of net income through the first nine months. This conversion rate was achieved on the strength of the Gulfstream orders, additional scheduled progress payment on combat systems international programs, and continued strong cash performance in technologies. We are well positioned to achieve our target for the year of a cash conversion rate over 100% of net income. Looking at capital deployment, capital expenditures were $227 million in the quarter, or 2.1% of sales. For the first nine months, we\u2019re at 2% of sales. We\u2019re still targeting to be slightly below 2.5% of sales for the full year, so that implies an uptick in capital investments in the fourth quarter. We paid $363 million in dividends and repurchased a little over a quarter million shares during the quarter, bringing the total deployed in dividends and share repurchases through the first nine months to $1.5 billion. We also repaid $500 million of debt that matured in August and ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $1.3 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $7.9 billion, down nearly $1.4 billion from year end. Net interest expense in the quarter was $85 million, bringing interest expense for the first nine months of the year to $265 million, down from $279 million for the same period in 2022.  Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 15.6%, bringing the rate for the first nine months to 16.2%. This is consistent with our guidance last quarter to expect a lower rate in the third quarter and a higher rate in the fourth, so no change to our outlook of 17% for the full year, which again implies a higher tax rate in the discrete fourth quarter. Now let me turn it back to Jason for some final remarks.\nJason Aiken: Thanks Bill. As far as year-end guidance is concerned, we\u2019re holding at $12.65 for the year. There will be a number of puts and takes from what we published last quarter, but it should all come about the same place. Nicole, that will conclude our remarks, so I\u2019ll turn the call back to you.\nNicole Shelton: Thanks Jason. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate.  Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\nOperator: Yes, thank you. [Operator instructions] We will take our first question from Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open.\nPeter Arment: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Jason and Bill. Jason, it sounds like there\u2019s just obviously a lot of moving parts for Q4 at Gulfstream. Is there a cut-off date, you know, if certification happens in December versus November, about your ability to kind of push out those deliveries, and then any commentary on just--I know you\u2019ve had a long term forecast of 170 deliveries for \u201924, whether you still think that holds. Obviously if certification slips, there would be more potentially, but maybe just some commentary there. Thanks.\nJason Aiken: Yes, thanks Peter. As it relates to certification, I think what we\u2019ve said for some time now is that if we can achieve certification in the, call it early to mid December time frame, then we\u2019ve got a good shot at getting the planned deliveries of G700s out the door this year. Obviously if that pushes further to the right, that puts that a little bit at risk. To your point about 2024, it\u2019s probably not appropriate to get into specifics about next year until we go through our plan period, which we\u2019ll engage in coming up here in the next month or two, but I think the way to think about this is a lot of what we\u2019ve been talking about this year between the supply chain challenges, as well as the G700 cert timing, is really timing issues, and to your point, to the extent some of the deliveries that we anticipated this year don\u2019t happen, that really just pushes into next year, so that naturally is an adder to the outlook for 2024.  But what we can\u2019t do yet is declare victory on the supply chain issues and say that by early next year, they\u2019re going to be completely solved, so a lot remains to be seen as to the timing of how that ultimately works itself out. I think it\u2019s that that will determine the net impact to 2024, so I think a little bit more time is going to be needed to see between what pushes out of 2023 into 2024 and the timing of the supply chain fix, what the net impact is to that \u201924 outlook. I think we\u2019ll have a better sense of that when we come back to you with guidance in January.\nPeter Arment: Appreciate the color, thanks Jason.\nOperator: We will take our next question from David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is open.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks, good morning.\nJason Aiken: Good morning David.\nDavid Strauss: Hey. Jason, at the beginning of the year, you guys had forecasted marine and combat to be relatively flat. At this point, we\u2019re looking at probably double-digit growth for both of those businesses this year. Does any of that--as we start thinking about how those businesses could look next year, does any of this represent any sort of pull-forward that would potentially moderate the growth that we could see out of those two businesses next year?\nJason Aiken: Yes, so I think as it relates to marine systems, David, nothing has really fundamentally changed from the narrative that we\u2019ve talked about for some time, which is to expect roughly $400 million to $500 million on average per year, year-over-year growth in that business. Obviously this year has turned out to be quite a bit different than we originally anticipated, and that\u2019s largely attributable to the increased throughput that we\u2019ve seen at Electric Boat in particular as the hiring and retention dynamics have really improved faster than we thought, so that\u2019s really driven a lot of the revenue acceleration into this year. That backlog is so large and so long term, I don\u2019t really see that having a direct effect on next year or any given year, but obviously again we\u2019ll have to go through the specific planning period that we\u2019re about to engage in before we get too specific about next year, so we\u2019ll be back with more on that, but not a direct correlation in my mind from that marine systems increase in throughput. On combat systems, to your point, we had been expecting sort of flat to down-ish revenue before the threat environment really took a turn in the opposite direction, and as you\u2019ve seen through the first part of the year, up 15% so far year-to-date, almost 25% in the quarter - that certainly was well beyond what our original expectations were, and frankly we don\u2019t see that demand signal slowing down. When you think about the munitions side of the business as well as the international demand we\u2019re seeing, along with the new program starts in the U.S., I don\u2019t necessarily see that as being a pull forward or something that creates a headwind into 2024. Again, not being specific about that outlook because we\u2019ll get into the planning period and get back to you in January.\nDavid Strauss: As a follow-up, the IRS came out with updated guidance on Section 174 R&D. What impact does that have on your cash flow outlook?\nJason Aiken: Really, nothing other than what we\u2019ve told you before. We\u2019ve actually been pretty consistent on this throughout the drama on this issue over the years. We didn\u2019t originally anticipate the law to be changed, so our guidance was predicated on the law as it is. It turned out not to be changed, and our expectation of what that would mean for us, ultimately you can call it lucky or good, we expected the net impact from a cash perspective to be right on course with what we\u2019re seeing right now.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nKen Herbert: Yes, hi. Good morning, Jason and Bill. Maybe just to start, Jason, again on Gulfstream. Last quarter, you called out sort of 19 as the expected 700 delivery number, depending upon cert timing this year. Is that still a number we should expect into the fourth quarter, assuming you get certification in time, and can you just comment on any potential risk around 280 production levels, considering some of the uncertainty in the Middle East?\nJason Aiken: Yes, so far as the G700 is concerned, 19 is the number that we have targeted and are still striving to get to. Again, as you note, that is predicated on timing of cert. What I can tell you in terms of a little bit of color behind that is we\u2019ve got 15 of those 19 that are ready to go and are in good shape, and we\u2019re working toward the others, so again predicated on when the cert comes, we should be in good shape to be somewhere in that range for deliveries this year. As it relates to the 280s, what I would tell you is the modest down-tick that we--that I talked about earlier this morning in terms of our overall 2024--excuse me, 2023 deliveries, that five or six aircraft reduction from our previous guidance in July, that is largely related to G280s. I would tell you that what we planned to deliver this year, we now have in hand at our Dallas facility for completion, so there\u2019s really not any incremental risk to 2023. We will have to see, obviously, how the events in Israel play out and what impact that may have in 2024, but a little premature to get into that at this point.\nKen Herbert: Okay, great. Thanks Jason.\nJason Aiken: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks very much, good morning. \nJason Aiken: Morning Rob.\nRobert Stallard: Jason, on the supply chain, maybe I\u2019m just reading too much into this, it sounds as if it actually got a bit worse than what you talked about last quarter, so I wonder if you can elaborate on what you\u2019ve been seeing, whether there are any specific pinch points that are causing you trouble.\nJason Aiken: Rob, I\u2019m going to guess you\u2019re talking about supply chain in aerospace, and if so, I would tell you that actually we\u2019re seeing modest signs throughout the quarter that things are actually getting better. It\u2019s not, as you\u2019d imagine, a straight line to the finish line on this issue, so there will be some bumps in the road and some curves along the way, but things are starting to trend better. What we saw here was a specific issue in terms of, as I mentioned, G280s in terms of the reduced in-service aircraft production, but on the large cabin aircraft, we are starting to see things trend in the right direction, so I think it\u2019s a little bit maybe in the other direction of what your intuition is pointing you to.\nRobert Stallard: Okay, good to hear. Just as a follow-up, I was wondering if you could elaborate on where you stand on supply chain in, I think, mission systems had a few issues, and also in the labor situation at marine, that that seems to have improved.\nJason Aiken: Sorry, it broke up there, Rob, at the end. You said mission systems supply chain and then labor--?\nRobert Stallard: At marine.\nJason Aiken: Oh, labor at marine - okay. On the mission systems side, I feel very good about what they\u2019ve done. The supply chain, to be completely candid with you, remains, and I think we expect it to remain what I\u2019d call fragile. I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to get back to what we saw pre-pandemic for the foreseeable future, but the fact is the team at mission systems has fully incorporated that new reality into their outlook, and so I expect their future to be a lot more stable and predictable as they\u2019ve incorporated the new normal, if you will, on supply chain on the electronic side for them. In terms of the labor side on marine systems, as I mentioned earlier, I think we\u2019ve seen stabilization in both attraction and retention of labor in the shipyards at a faster rate than we anticipated, so that\u2019s an encouraging sign. That drives the throughput in the yard, and over time as those new shipbuilders become more tenured, more experienced, more proficient, we would expect at that point, that\u2019s one of the factors that will really drive over time the margin improvement in the shipyard, so it\u2019s an encouraging start for them. We\u2019ve just got to see that play out, because as you know, shipbuilding is a long term venture.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning.\nJason Aiken: Morning.\nScott Deuschle: Jason, can you walk through some of the high level puts and takes for aerospace incremental margins next year, and I guess maybe to ask another way, are the right things to focus on from our perspective the G700 mix, less out-of-sequence work, the learning curve on G700, and then presumably R&D either leveling off or coming down, or is there anything else here that we should be considering? Thank you.\nJason Aiken: I\u2019d say you nailed most of the high level items there for next year, and again the G700 is a bit piece of it. Obviously we\u2019ve talked about how that will come into service with favorable entry level margins, accretive entry level margins for the group, so that\u2019s a big driver. I think the other major one, and you alluded to it, really is the resolution and straightening out of the supply chain issues. One of the things Gulfstream has really worked towards here and planned towards, I think very effectively and we\u2019ll see it over time, is driving the efficiency of the operation with this new family of aircraft. Between the facilities that have been built, the commonality between the airplanes, the ability to service those airplanes efficiently, that is really what we are driving towards and one of the major underpinnings behind the long term trajectory back to the mid to high teens margins for that group. Obviously timing of when those things get straightened out in the supply chain will be important, because that\u2019s really what\u2019s sort of inhibiting us getting to that point of efficiency.  We will see a little bit of modest down-tick in R&D - I wouldn\u2019t call that a major factor, but you should expect to see that tick down a little as we finish up the 700 this year and get through the 800 next year, but again, have 800 and 400 to go, so we\u2019re not out of things yet from an R&D standpoint there. Those are the major puts and takes, I\u2019d say. All in all, we would expect to see revenue--or excuse me, margin continuing on its trajectory again toward that mid to high teens rate. We\u2019ll see improvement here in the fourth quarter, and I expect to see good improvement in 2024.\nScott Deuschle: Okay, great. Then as a follow-up, are there any major company-funded growth capex projects still underway in \u201924 and \u201925, or is most of that complete this year? If it does complete this year, does the nearly billion dollars of capex included in current Bloomberg incentives for \u201924 and \u201925 make directional sense, because that\u2019s basically still in line with \u201923, I think? Thank you.\nJason Aiken: Yes, the major internal capex projects are done this year. We\u2019ve got a little bit of trailing cost and activity going on in the shipyards as we finish out that capacity expansion, particularly at Electric Boat, but that will wrap up next year. The investments we\u2019re making on the Army side from an artillery perspective, that\u2019s being funded by the customer, and so bottom line, we ought to see our capex level trend back towards 2%. We\u2019ll be below 2.5% this year, which is directionally headed the right way, and we\u2019ll be back toward--if not at 2%, headed toward 2% next year.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKristine Liwag: Hey, good morning Jason and Bill. Maybe first on the president\u2019s $106 billion supplemental request, it includes $3.4 billion for the submarine industrial base. With this request out there now and with respect to AUKUS, can you talk more about what this means for GD? Does this change timing at all?\nJason Aiken: Bottom line, Kristine, I think the short answer is no. Obviously any additional support that can be provided in terms of that supplemental or other funding to shore up the industrial base is helpful. There\u2019s a lot of talk around AUKUS and obviously we\u2019re going to do everything we can to support our customer in that regard, but the fact is this supply chain still remains very fragile.  We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do to get this whole industry back to--from a submarine perspective, back to two per year. We\u2019ve got to get to that point on Virginia while delivering Columbias, and I think we\u2019ve got some more work to do to get there, and so any additional funding and support, whether it\u2019s through the supplemental or other Navy support, would be extremely helpful, but that\u2019s our focus today, is to get to that two per year plus Columbia, and then we\u2019ll look to AUKUS beyond that.\nKristine Liwag: Following up on your comments on the fragile supply chain, has there been changes in your contracting terms with the customer to reflect this, and how do we think about long term margins?\nJason Aiken: I think the main way this has been reflected in our contracting with the customer is to recognize the impacts that we\u2019ve had and to price that in, and accommodate what is this current state of affairs in our contracting. One example of that is the DDG multi-year that we just saw awarded in the quarter - we feel like that\u2019s been appropriately considered there, and we\u2019ll continue to consider the state that the industry is in as we go forward. I wouldn\u2019t point to necessarily any other macro or overarching contract structures or other terms that have changed. In terms of margins, we expect them to get better, frankly. My expectation is that this quarter would be the trough for the group. We expect to see improvement in the fourth quarter and we expect to see modest sequential incremental improvement over time in this group. That said, this is a challenging task. Shipbuilding is a challenging endeavor and so it\u2019s not going to be straightforward, but our expectation, to be completely straightforward, is to have gradual increasing margins in this group over time as we march back toward that 8% to 9%-plus margin range.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nSeth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much, and good morning everyone. Maybe just a follow-up on that last topic. The Q3 margin in marine, similar to Q1. In Q1, we know there were some charges on Virginia, I believe Block 4 and Block 5. Were there significant negative EACs on Virginia in the third quarter that drove the margin that we ended up seeing, and I guess any--I know you talked about supply chain at Electric Boat, but any additional color about what assumptions have really changed there, and with the new assumptions, how that affects your ability to expand margins?\nJason Aiken: In the quarter, Seth, nothing material in terms of EACs in the quarter. What you\u2019re seeing there, obviously we are still experiencing pressure from delayed material coming out of the supply chain that\u2019s affecting Electric Boat\u2019s schedule and delivery and man hour in the yard. But the other implication that you\u2019re seeing is having reduced the margin rates through the earlier EAC adjustments, we\u2019re now seeing the aggregate impact of that in the booking rates that we are recognizing on the programs today, so it\u2019s sort of the aggregate confluence of all those factors are driving the margin rate that you see in the quarter. But again, as we start to continue to improve the throughput and improve the efficiency in the yards, we do expect to see incremental improvement in the margin, starting in the fourth quarter. In terms of supply chain changes, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s anything changing. I think it\u2019s as we go to contract, we have 2020 hindsight, or full visibility if you will, into the current state of affairs, and so we\u2019re working through that with our customer and they understand the situation we\u2019re in, so we\u2019re basically incorporating the current state of the supply chain, as well as the implications of increasing cost of skilled labor as you\u2019ve seen with a lot of the labor negotiations going on out in the market. It\u2019s those types of factors that are being incorporated, that we\u2019re putting into the new contracts and that we feel like will put us in a good position to perform from a margin perspective as we look ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Okay, okay, thanks. Then just for clarification, when you talked about at the overall company and despite some changes, the EPS outlook being unchanged, was that sort of--that was based on that new Gulfstream delivery outlook that you talked about with the 60-plus in Q4. If the G700 wasn\u2019t to be certified this year, I assume that that\u2019s kind of a different story, and what\u2019s the last date roughly that you could see that certification happen and still deliver, I don\u2019t know, double-digit G700s?\nJason Aiken: Yes, so the EPS reaffirmed at $12.65 is based on the updated Gulfstream delivery number that I mentioned earlier. As I said, that\u2019s mostly--the reduced number from the July outlook is mostly associated with G280s, so not as significant an earnings impact to that. As you can imagine, some puts and takes, none of which are particularly material, across the rest of the portfolio, including some upward pressure across the defense businesses from a revenue perspective, as you might imagine, improved, customer service revenue at the aerospace group and so on, some below-the-line things like lower interest expense and share count, net-net kind of putting us in the same place, so that\u2019s sort of why the guidance stays where it is. In terms of the 700 outlook, I think the key issue is, and the question so many people around why the uncertainty, is we don\u2019t have a date certain. This is the FAA\u2019s process. We need to let them go through that process. We are supporting them in that process. They\u2019re going through flying now and we\u2019re doing the necessary paperwork and reporting to support that, and so we have a path, we have an expectation to get there in early to mid-December, but there\u2019s not a red line or a date certain on the calendar that we\u2019re looking at, at this point.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nDoug Harned: Good morning, thank you.\nJason Aiken: Morning Doug.\nDoug Harned: I wanted to go back to marine because when you look at Electric Boat, and your backlogs have been--have built way up, as you mentioned, the Navy wants to be at two VCS deliveries per year, can you describe, like, what scenarios you can even look at here? I mean, my understand it\u2019s about 1.2 now, it\u2019s way off what clearly Congress wants, what the Navy wants. Are there scenarios that you think about in terms of how soon in a good situation we might get to that two per year, or what would be a negative scenario? What\u2019s the range of outcomes here?\nJason Aiken: No, you point out the landscape appropriately, Doug. I think the way I think about that is prior to COVID, if you look at the couple quarters leading up to 2020, we were--as a team, we were right on the threshold of getting to two per year on the Virginia-class program, so it is imminently doable in terms of the industrial base and the team that\u2019s working that program. Obviously COVID set us on our heels, as well as the generational changeover in shipbuilders in terms of retirements and new hires. I think the way to think about that now is there\u2019s a number of factors that are going to help us get back to that point. One is, again, the maturing and tenuring of that new workforce to get the efficiency in the workforce, to get us back to where we were. The investments that the Navy is making in the industrial base, which are extremely helpful to stabilize that, and then other initiatives like what we call strategic sourcing, where we\u2019re trying to take bottlenecks out of the shipyards and move subsystem construction and capacity into other facilities and other yards around the country, so that we can take some of the pressure off of the two main production and assembly yards. Those are the types of things that are going to drive us back toward two per year. I\u2019d be remiss to try and give you a timeline on when it\u2019s going to be to get there - this is long term, challenging stuff, but I think with us and our partner and the Navy all working in the same direction and in a very strong partnership, I feel optimistic about our path to get there.\nDoug Harned: Then as a follow-up, if you add one more factor into this, which is Columbia class, obviously in a very different stage in the program, but also you\u2019ve got an overlapping supply chain. How does progress on the Columbia class right now look, and how does that affect your ability to push forward on this VCS ramp?\nJason Aiken: Yes, Columbia, as you know, is the Navy\u2019s and the DoD\u2019s number one priority, so that\u2019s going to continue to be the case. I don\u2019t see that being a trade-off necessarily to get to two per year for Virginia. Right now, we\u2019re a little over 40% complete on the first boat, and we\u2019re right on schedule for the targeted completion of that first boat. We\u2019ve still got obviously about four years to go before delivery, so a lot of the way to go and a lot can happen between now and then, but all the resources that can be brought to bear are on that priority. I think the way to think about it is because of its priority position, it is essentially a headwind to those other factors that I gave you about what we\u2019re trying to do on Virginia class, and we\u2019ve got to be able to manage both of those within the yard and within the team arrangement and with our customer, but those are some of the puts and takes. Columbia will be the priority, and it\u2019s our job to make Virginia happen notwithstanding that priority.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes, thank you very much, and good quarter. Jason, you said you\u2019re still looking for 12.7 in technologies, but when I look at all of your defense numbers, you really beat in revenues across the board, so maybe if you can--you know, if I look at where the model was before, it looks like we have a softer fourth quarter to get us home, but that doesn\u2019t seem realistic given the spectacular revenues you had here in the third quarter, so maybe update us, if you could, on where you\u2019re looking for revenues in each of the defense sectors for the year, and should we feel a bigger step-up next year?\nJason Aiken: I think the way to think about the fourth quarter, Cai, is as I alluded to earlier, there is obviously some upward pressure on the revenue on the defense side, nothing to get too specific about and I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s particularly material with just a couple months to go here in the year.  But one way to think about this is this year, let\u2019s talk group by group, in technologies you may remember, last year we had a significant surge in the fourth quarter because we had had a big back-up on the supply chain side at mission systems through the third quarter, and a lot of that flowed through in the fourth quarter, so really a big hockey stick or upswing in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s not the pattern this year. As I mentioned before, they\u2019ve been on a more regular order and a more regular drumbeat, and so we\u2019ll see a more steady state revenue pattern for technologies in the fourth quarter. In combat, likewise it\u2019s historically for some time now been the traditional seasonal pattern for combat to rise throughout the year and have its biggest quarter in the fourth quarter, and we saw that again last year. In this case in 2023, it\u2019s a much more steady drumbeat - again, steady demand, strong volume, but not the traditional seasonal fourth quarter uptick in combat.  In marine, again we\u2019ve already seen tremendous volume well in excess of our expectations. We\u2019re up a billion dollars almost through the first nine months, which is roughly what we expected for the year, so again I\u2019d say more stable quarter to quarter. To summarize, we\u2019re seeing more stable volumes across all three of the defense segments from first quarter to fourth quarter, whereas in the past they\u2019ve risen from first to fourth, so a little bit of an aberration in the pattern. I do expect--again, not to get ahead of the planning process we\u2019re going through, but I expect each of the businesses to show growth going into next year. Can\u2019t get too much more specific about that at this point, but you should see growth in the defense business across all three of the segments going into 2024.\nCai von Rumohr: Very helpful, and then maybe a quick comment on Israel - Hamas has created additional demand, we have this $106 billion request from the President. Can you give us some general color in terms of areas where you think you could see incremental acceleration in demand?\nJason Aiken: You know, the Israel situation obviously is a terrible one, frankly, and one that\u2019s just evolving as we speak. But I think if you look at the incremental demand potential coming out of that, the biggest one to highlight and that really sticks out is probably on the artillery side. Obviously that\u2019s been a big pressure point up to now with Ukraine, one that we\u2019ve been doing everything we can to support our Army customer. We\u2019ve gone from 14,000 rounds per month to 20,000 very quickly. We\u2019re working ahead of schedule to accelerate that production capacity up to 85,000, even as high as 100,000 rounds per month, and I think the Israel situation is only going to put upward pressure on that demand, so that\u2019s the biggest stick-out that I can see.\nNicole Shelton: Abbie, I think we have time for just one more question.\nOperator: Excellent, thank you. We will take our final question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nRon Epstein: Hey, good morning. \nJason Aiken: Morning Ron.\nRon Epstein: Maybe just two. On land systems, given truly the surge in demand relative to where everybody thought it would be, from a capacity point of view, from a labor point of view, how are you guys set up there to handle it all?\nJason Aiken: You know, I have to give a hand to the guys in the combat systems group in general, and land systems specifically. You\u2019ve really not heard us talk about supply chain bottlenecks, labor capacity or other issues in that group, and that does not mean they have not faced them, they are just--they stand out amongst even a spectacular crowd in the way they\u2019ve handled it. I don\u2019t have any expectation that we\u2019ll see any issues as we look ahead, even as the demand for their product, both domestically as well as internationally, continues to grow.\nRon Epstein: Then maybe just changing gears a bit, nobody really asked a heck of a lot about GDIT. \nJason Aiken: Thank you for that - finally!\nRon Epstein: Let\u2019s talk about that, it\u2019s a big piece of the company, right? You know a lot about it in particular.  When we think about a path to double-digit margins, how do we get there, and then maybe from an operational point of view, why does not integrating mission and GDIT together kind of make sense, because there\u2019s this bigger demand for software-driven solutions and software and hardware, and you\u2019re seeing this synergy coming out particularly with the application of AI to legacy systems, and so on and so forth. \nJason Aiken: On the margin side, just to be clear, as I think about double-digit margin for the group, not specifically GDIT - it\u2019s the mix of the two of them together, I absolutely expect this group to be on the march back to low double-digit margin. It\u2019s where they\u2019ve been historically. I think if anything I could articulate as a headwind to that, it\u2019s to the extent that the GDIT side grows faster than the mission systems side, that obviously creates a bit of a macro mix issue that could be a little bit of a headwind in terms of how long it takes us to get there. But frankly, I expect to see us get back into the double-digit margin range here in the fourth quarter, and we\u2019ll see how quickly we can get there in the outlook as we look at \u201924 and beyond, but I do expect them to get back on the trajectory toward low double-digit margin. In terms of integration, the way we see this is while they\u2019re very symbiotic businesses and they are dealing with a market that\u2019s dealing with a convergence, to your point in terms of their capabilities, we think that having them separate is appropriate because the investment thesis and the way you run an inherently people business versus an inherently technology development, hardware and production business, are fundamentally different and take different leadership, different priorities and sort of different investment theses.  The good news is that by having them together in the same group and in a coordinated way, we are making investments and addressing the evolving technologies jointly as a group, and we are making sure we are being efficient at that and effective at that, not duplicative, not missing anything, and bringing the requisite skills, to your point, from end to end, whether it\u2019s the hardware side, the services, the software capabilities, solutions as a service, software services and so on, together in joint capability. I think we get the best of both worlds that way in terms of the way we manage and run the businesses, but also the way we can bring combined capabilities to the customer set.\nNicole Shelton: Great. Everyone, thank you for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the third quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3152.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call, and we thank you for your participation.

            "name": "Bill Moss",
            "content": "Thank you Jason, and good morning. We had another very good quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 to 1 for the company. This is particularly impressive with the strong revenue growth in the quarter. Marine systems and aerospace led the way with book-to-bill ratios of 2.3 and 1.4 respectively. For the second quarter in a row, this led to record level backlog of $95.6 billion at the end of the quarter, up 4.6% from last quarter and up 7.6% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter just shy of $133 billion. Moving to our cash performance, this was another strong story in the quarter with over $1.3 billion of operating cash flow. This brings us to $3.5 billion of operating cash flow through the first nine months of the year. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.1 billion for the quarter and $2.9 billion year-to-date, or 126% of net income through the first nine months. This conversion rate was achieved on the strength of the Gulfstream orders, additional scheduled progress payment on combat systems international programs, and continued strong cash performance in technologies. We are well positioned to achieve our target for the year of a cash conversion rate over 100% of net income. Looking at capital deployment, capital expenditures were $227 million in the quarter, or 2.1% of sales. For the first nine months, we're at 2% of sales. We're still targeting to be slightly below 2.5% of sales for the full year, so that implies an uptick in capital investments in the fourth quarter. We paid $363 million in dividends and repurchased a little over a quarter million shares during the quarter, bringing the total deployed in dividends and share repurchases through the first nine months to $1.5 billion. We also repaid $500 million of debt that matured in August and ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $1.3 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $7.9 billion, down nearly $1.4 billion from year end. Net interest expense in the quarter was $85 million, bringing interest expense for the first nine months of the year to $265 million, down from $279 million for the same period in 2022.  Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 15.6%, bringing the rate for the first nine months to 16.2%. This is consistent with our guidance last quarter to expect a lower rate in the third quarter and a higher rate in the fourth, so no change to our outlook of 17% for the full year, which again implies a higher tax rate in the discrete fourth quarter. Now let me turn it back to Jason for some final remarks."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Thank you Nicole. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. The first thing I'll note is that our Chairman and CEO, Phebe Novakovic, is under the weather today, so I'll be conducting today's call along with Bill.  Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.04 per diluted share on revenue of $10.6 billion, operating earnings of $1.06 billion and net income of $836 million. Revenue was up $596 million or 6% against the third quarter last year. Operating earnings were down $41 million or 3.7%. Net earnings were down $66 million and earnings per share were down 6.7%. The quarter-over-quarter results show significant growth in revenue but a 100 basis point contraction in operating margin. On the other hand, sequential results are quite good across the board. Here, we beat last quarter's revenue by 4.1%, operating earnings by 9.9%, net earnings by 12.4%, and EPS by 12.6%. From a different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.13 per share on higher revenue and better operating earnings than anticipated. Operating margin is about the same as expected. The beat came almost entirely from operations. On a year-to-date basis, revenue was up 7.2%, operating earnings were down less than 1%, and diluted earnings per share were down 2.6%. We had another very strong quarter from a cash perspective. Net cash flow provided by operating activities was $1.32 billion and free cash flow was $1.1 billion, which is 131% of net earnings. This follows very good cash performance in the first half. Order performance was good in the quarter in all segments and particularly strong at Gulfstream and the marine segment. You'll hear more detail on cash and backlog, as well as some of the other financial particulars from Bill in just a minute. In short, we enjoyed a strong quarter, particularly so in light of the supply chain and program mix headwinds that time will cure, so let me move right ahead with some color around the performance of the business segments. First, aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $2.03 billion and operating earnings of $268 million with a 13.2% operating margin. Revenue was down $315 million from the year-ago quarter, driven by fewer deliveries at Gulfstream due to supply chain constraints. Operating earnings were down $44 million on lower revenue and a 10 basis point contraction in margin. The sequential comparison is much better - revenue was up $79 million or 4%, and operating earnings were up $32 million or 13.6% on 110 basis point improvement in margin. There were 27 deliveries in the quarter, three more than in the second quarter. To provide some additional color here, Gulfstream has made 72 aircraft deliveries through the end of the quarter. We are on track to deliver between 40 and 45 currently in-service aircraft in the fourth quarter. All-in including G700s, we anticipate in excess of 60 deliveries in the quarter, assuming we're granted FAA certification before the end of the year. That said, as you can tell, there's a considerable amount of uncertainty as we get closer to certification. Moving to the demand environment, this was yet another positive quarter reflecting continuing strong demand. Aerospace book-to-bill was 1.4 to 1, and Gulfstream alone had a book-to-bill of 1.5 to 1. We continue to have vibrant sales activity going into the fourth quarter and expect strong orders. It would, however, be a stretch to get to 1 to 1 in the fourth quarter, given our expectation of over 60 deliveries. A wildcard in the quarter will be the conflict in Israel and its impact on demand, if any. The period of significant increased aircraft demand began in mid-February of 2021, over two and a half years ago. In 2021, Gulfstream's book-to-bill was 1.7 to 1, in '22 it was 1.5 to 1, and year-to-date 2023 it's 1.3 to 1. This includes the first quarter of 2023, when there was a three-week hiatus in orders as a result of the failure of several regional banks. In that quarter, we still managed a 0.9 to 1 book-to-bill.  All of this leads quite naturally to an astonishing build of the aerospace backlog. It grew from $11.6 billion at the end of 2020 to $20.1 billion at the end of the third quarter 2023, an increase of over 70% in two and three-quarter years. This all speaks to me of the underlying strength of the market for our products. The G700 flight test and certification program continues to move closer to its ultimate conclusion. We continue to plan for certification in the fourth quarter of this year, largely dependent upon the availability of FAA resources and a credit the FAA may allow for company flying. We currently are spending most of our engineering time on final reports and data submission. Operationally, Gulfstream continues to make good progress under difficult circumstances, but as a result of the supply chain issues that we've previously discussed, we plan to deliver 10 to 12 fewer aircraft this year than the 145 we had originally forecast in the beginning of the year. On the other hand, we continue to expect more service revenue than initially predicted. Next, combat systems. Combat systems had revenue of $2.22 billion, up a stunning 24.4% over the year-ago quarter with growth at each of the business units, but particularly at OTS and European land systems. Earnings were $300 million, which was up 10.7%. Margins at 13.5% represent 170 basis point reduction versus the year-ago quarter, so once again we saw powerful revenue performance coupled with more modest operating margins in large part attributable to mix and new program starts. Some of our revenue increase is a result of facilities contracts to increase our artillery production capacity taken at lower margin. As you'd expect, these contracts will result in additional production at accretive margins over time. On the subject of munitions, we're working very closely with our government customer and have accelerated production faster than planned. The large capacity expansion that we're putting in place today will further increase production. We have a ways to go, but we're making progress. The increase in combat revenue also came from new international vehicle programs, the ramp-up of the M10 Booker, higher artillery program volume, and higher volume on Piranha and Eagle vehicles in Europe. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $300 million or 15.6%, and earnings were up $49 million or 19.5% on a 50 basis point improvement in margin. Year-to-date, revenue was up $775 million or 15.1% and operating earnings were up $53 million or 7.1% over last year, so the numbers are quite impressive quarter-over-quarter, sequentially and year-to-date. Combat systems experienced very good order performance. Orders in the quarter resulted in a one-to-one book-to-bill, a very strong performance given the increased revenue and evidencing strong demand for munitions and international combat vehicles. Year-to-date, the book-to-bill is 1.3 to 1, which fully supports the growth outlook. Turning to marine systems, once again our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Marine systems revenue of $3 billion was up $233 million or 8.4% against the year-ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering drove the growth. Operating earnings were $211 million, down $27 million versus the year-ago quarter with 160 basis point decrement in operating margin. The year-ago quarter had a number of favorable EAC adjustments which did not repeat this quarter. Sequentially, both revenue and operating earnings were down somewhat. Importantly, year-to-date revenue was up $982 million, 12.2%; however, earnings were essentially flat on a 90 basis point contraction in operating margin.  The real driver of the margin difficulty has been the late deliveries at Electric Boat from the supply chain, which causes out-of-station work and internal scheduling disruptions. Electric Boat has continued to improve its throughput, but not fast enough to offset the cost of late material. We continue with the help of the Navy to work this issue. At Bath, while we're seeing signs of improved productivity, it has yet to manifest in the business' financial performance. All that said, we're looking for slow but steady incremental margin growth over time. Importantly, marine systems enjoyed a very good quarter from an orders perspective with a 2.3 to 1 book-to-bill. This is a very large enduring backlog. Lastly, technologies. It was another strong quarter with revenue of $3.3 billion, which is up 8% over the prior year and continues to build on the strong first half of the year. That growth was spread pretty evenly between GDIT and mission systems; in fact, each business grew both year-over-year and sequentially. At GDIT, we're seeing particular strength in the defense and federal civilian portfolios as our technology accelerator investments and capabilities like zero trust, artificial intelligence, digital engineering and 5G are really resonating with customers and driving increased demand.  At mission systems, the cyber and naval platform markets have been particularly strong. The production and delivery cadence on the hardware side appears to have stabilized, so we expect their results to be somewhat more predictable despite the lingering fragility in the supply chain that will continue to be the new normal. Based on the strength of the first three quarters, the group is on track to achieve our increased sales forecast of $12.7 billion for the year. Operating earnings in the quarter were $315 million, up 10.5%, yielding a margin of 9.5% - that's up 20 basis points year-over-year and up 70 basis points sequentially, so a very solid performance on strong revenue growth in the quarter. This is a drumbeat we expect to see continue in the fourth quarter. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $12.7 billion. Through the first nine months, the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1 to 1, keeping pace with the strong revenue growth across the business. Prospects remain strong with a qualified funnel of over $125 billion in opportunities they're pursuing across the portfolio. Let me close with a review of the defense units in aggregate. As a whole on a quarter-over-quarter basis, defense had revenue of $8.54 billion, up $911 million or 11.9% over the year-ago quarter. On the same basis, earnings of $826 million were up $32 million or 4%. On a sequential basis, the pattern is similar - revenue was up $340 million or 4.1% and earnings were up $57 million or 7.4%. Year-to-date against the same period last year, revenue of $24.7 billion was up 10.2% and operating earnings were up $60 million or 2.6%. In short, our defense businesses are experiencing significant growth in revenue and to a lesser degree in earnings; however, we need to continue to work with our supply chain in order to achieve appropriate operating leverage. With that, let me turn it over to Bill. Thanks Bill. As far as year-end guidance is concerned, we're holding at $12.65 for the year. There will be a number of puts and takes from what we published last quarter, but it should all come about the same place. Nicole, that will conclude our remarks, so I'll turn the call back to you. Yes, thanks Peter. As it relates to certification, I think what we've said for some time now is that if we can achieve certification in the, call it early to mid December time frame, then we've got a good shot at getting the planned deliveries of G700s out the door this year. Obviously if that pushes further to the right, that puts that a little bit at risk. To your point about 2024, it's probably not appropriate to get into specifics about next year until we go through our plan period, which we'll engage in coming up here in the next month or two, but I think the way to think about this is a lot of what we've been talking about this year between the supply chain challenges, as well as the G700 cert timing, is really timing issues, and to your point, to the extent some of the deliveries that we anticipated this year don't happen, that really just pushes into next year, so that naturally is an adder to the outlook for 2024.  But what we can't do yet is declare victory on the supply chain issues and say that by early next year, they're going to be completely solved, so a lot remains to be seen as to the timing of how that ultimately works itself out. I think it's that that will determine the net impact to 2024, so I think a little bit more time is going to be needed to see between what pushes out of 2023 into 2024 and the timing of the supply chain fix, what the net impact is to that '24 outlook. I think we'll have a better sense of that when we come back to you with guidance in January. Good morning David. Yes, so I think as it relates to marine systems, David, nothing has really fundamentally changed from the narrative that we've talked about for some time, which is to expect roughly $400 million to $500 million on average per year, year-over-year growth in that business. Obviously this year has turned out to be quite a bit different than we originally anticipated, and that's largely attributable to the increased throughput that we've seen at Electric Boat in particular as the hiring and retention dynamics have really improved faster than we thought, so that's really driven a lot of the revenue acceleration into this year. That backlog is so large and so long term, I don't really see that having a direct effect on next year or any given year, but obviously again we'll have to go through the specific planning period that we're about to engage in before we get too specific about next year, so we'll be back with more on that, but not a direct correlation in my mind from that marine systems increase in throughput. On combat systems, to your point, we had been expecting sort of flat to down-ish revenue before the threat environment really took a turn in the opposite direction, and as you've seen through the first part of the year, up 15% so far year-to-date, almost 25% in the quarter - that certainly was well beyond what our original expectations were, and frankly we don't see that demand signal slowing down. When you think about the munitions side of the business as well as the international demand we're seeing, along with the new program starts in the U.S., I don't necessarily see that as being a pull forward or something that creates a headwind into 2024. Again, not being specific about that outlook because we'll get into the planning period and get back to you in January. Really, nothing other than what we've told you before. We've actually been pretty consistent on this throughout the drama on this issue over the years. We didn't originally anticipate the law to be changed, so our guidance was predicated on the law as it is. It turned out not to be changed, and our expectation of what that would mean for us, ultimately you can call it lucky or good, we expected the net impact from a cash perspective to be right on course with what we're seeing right now. Yes, so far as the G700 is concerned, 19 is the number that we have targeted and are still striving to get to. Again, as you note, that is predicated on timing of cert. What I can tell you in terms of a little bit of color behind that is we've got 15 of those 19 that are ready to go and are in good shape, and we're working toward the others, so again predicated on when the cert comes, we should be in good shape to be somewhere in that range for deliveries this year. As it relates to the 280s, what I would tell you is the modest down-tick that we--that I talked about earlier this morning in terms of our overall 2024--excuse me, 2023 deliveries, that five or six aircraft reduction from our previous guidance in July, that is largely related to G280s. I would tell you that what we planned to deliver this year, we now have in hand at our Dallas facility for completion, so there's really not any incremental risk to 2023. We will have to see, obviously, how the events in Israel play out and what impact that may have in 2024, but a little premature to get into that at this point. You're welcome. Morning Rob. Rob, I'm going to guess you're talking about supply chain in aerospace, and if so, I would tell you that actually we're seeing modest signs throughout the quarter that things are actually getting better. It's not, as you'd imagine, a straight line to the finish line on this issue, so there will be some bumps in the road and some curves along the way, but things are starting to trend better. What we saw here was a specific issue in terms of, as I mentioned, G280s in terms of the reduced in-service aircraft production, but on the large cabin aircraft, we are starting to see things trend in the right direction, so I think it's a little bit maybe in the other direction of what your intuition is pointing you to. Sorry, it broke up there, Rob, at the end. You said mission systems supply chain and then labor--? Oh, labor at marine - okay. On the mission systems side, I feel very good about what they've done. The supply chain, to be completely candid with you, remains, and I think we expect it to remain what I'd call fragile. I don't think that that's going to get back to what we saw pre-pandemic for the foreseeable future, but the fact is the team at mission systems has fully incorporated that new reality into their outlook, and so I expect their future to be a lot more stable and predictable as they've incorporated the new normal, if you will, on supply chain on the electronic side for them. In terms of the labor side on marine systems, as I mentioned earlier, I think we've seen stabilization in both attraction and retention of labor in the shipyards at a faster rate than we anticipated, so that's an encouraging sign. That drives the throughput in the yard, and over time as those new shipbuilders become more tenured, more experienced, more proficient, we would expect at that point, that's one of the factors that will really drive over time the margin improvement in the shipyard, so it's an encouraging start for them. We've just got to see that play out, because as you know, shipbuilding is a long term venture. Morning. I'd say you nailed most of the high level items there for next year, and again the G700 is a bit piece of it. Obviously we've talked about how that will come into service with favorable entry level margins, accretive entry level margins for the group, so that's a big driver. I think the other major one, and you alluded to it, really is the resolution and straightening out of the supply chain issues. One of the things Gulfstream has really worked towards here and planned towards, I think very effectively and we'll see it over time, is driving the efficiency of the operation with this new family of aircraft. Between the facilities that have been built, the commonality between the airplanes, the ability to service those airplanes efficiently, that is really what we are driving towards and one of the major underpinnings behind the long term trajectory back to the mid to high teens margins for that group. Obviously timing of when those things get straightened out in the supply chain will be important, because that's really what's sort of inhibiting us getting to that point of efficiency.  We will see a little bit of modest down-tick in R&D - I wouldn't call that a major factor, but you should expect to see that tick down a little as we finish up the 700 this year and get through the 800 next year, but again, have 800 and 400 to go, so we're not out of things yet from an R&D standpoint there. Those are the major puts and takes, I'd say. All in all, we would expect to see revenue--or excuse me, margin continuing on its trajectory again toward that mid to high teens rate. We'll see improvement here in the fourth quarter, and I expect to see good improvement in 2024. Yes, the major internal capex projects are done this year. We've got a little bit of trailing cost and activity going on in the shipyards as we finish out that capacity expansion, particularly at Electric Boat, but that will wrap up next year. The investments we're making on the Army side from an artillery perspective, that's being funded by the customer, and so bottom line, we ought to see our capex level trend back towards 2%. We'll be below 2.5% this year, which is directionally headed the right way, and we'll be back toward--if not at 2%, headed toward 2% next year. Bottom line, Kristine, I think the short answer is no. Obviously any additional support that can be provided in terms of that supplemental or other funding to shore up the industrial base is helpful. There's a lot of talk around AUKUS and obviously we're going to do everything we can to support our customer in that regard, but the fact is this supply chain still remains very fragile.  We've got a lot of work to do to get this whole industry back to--from a submarine perspective, back to two per year. We've got to get to that point on Virginia while delivering Columbias, and I think we've got some more work to do to get there, and so any additional funding and support, whether it's through the supplemental or other Navy support, would be extremely helpful, but that's our focus today, is to get to that two per year plus Columbia, and then we'll look to AUKUS beyond that. I think the main way this has been reflected in our contracting with the customer is to recognize the impacts that we've had and to price that in, and accommodate what is this current state of affairs in our contracting. One example of that is the DDG multi-year that we just saw awarded in the quarter - we feel like that's been appropriately considered there, and we'll continue to consider the state that the industry is in as we go forward. I wouldn't point to necessarily any other macro or overarching contract structures or other terms that have changed. In terms of margins, we expect them to get better, frankly. My expectation is that this quarter would be the trough for the group. We expect to see improvement in the fourth quarter and we expect to see modest sequential incremental improvement over time in this group. That said, this is a challenging task. Shipbuilding is a challenging endeavor and so it's not going to be straightforward, but our expectation, to be completely straightforward, is to have gradual increasing margins in this group over time as we march back toward that 8% to 9%-plus margin range. In the quarter, Seth, nothing material in terms of EACs in the quarter. What you're seeing there, obviously we are still experiencing pressure from delayed material coming out of the supply chain that's affecting Electric Boat's schedule and delivery and man hour in the yard. But the other implication that you're seeing is having reduced the margin rates through the earlier EAC adjustments, we're now seeing the aggregate impact of that in the booking rates that we are recognizing on the programs today, so it's sort of the aggregate confluence of all those factors are driving the margin rate that you see in the quarter. But again, as we start to continue to improve the throughput and improve the efficiency in the yards, we do expect to see incremental improvement in the margin, starting in the fourth quarter. In terms of supply chain changes, I don't know that it's anything changing. I think it's as we go to contract, we have 2020 hindsight, or full visibility if you will, into the current state of affairs, and so we're working through that with our customer and they understand the situation we're in, so we're basically incorporating the current state of the supply chain, as well as the implications of increasing cost of skilled labor as you've seen with a lot of the labor negotiations going on out in the market. It's those types of factors that are being incorporated, that we're putting into the new contracts and that we feel like will put us in a good position to perform from a margin perspective as we look ahead. Yes, so the EPS reaffirmed at $12.65 is based on the updated Gulfstream delivery number that I mentioned earlier. As I said, that's mostly--the reduced number from the July outlook is mostly associated with G280s, so not as significant an earnings impact to that. As you can imagine, some puts and takes, none of which are particularly material, across the rest of the portfolio, including some upward pressure across the defense businesses from a revenue perspective, as you might imagine, improved, customer service revenue at the aerospace group and so on, some below-the-line things like lower interest expense and share count, net-net kind of putting us in the same place, so that's sort of why the guidance stays where it is. In terms of the 700 outlook, I think the key issue is, and the question so many people around why the uncertainty, is we don't have a date certain. This is the FAA's process. We need to let them go through that process. We are supporting them in that process. They're going through flying now and we're doing the necessary paperwork and reporting to support that, and so we have a path, we have an expectation to get there in early to mid-December, but there's not a red line or a date certain on the calendar that we're looking at, at this point. Morning Doug. No, you point out the landscape appropriately, Doug. I think the way I think about that is prior to COVID, if you look at the couple quarters leading up to 2020, we were--as a team, we were right on the threshold of getting to two per year on the Virginia-class program, so it is imminently doable in terms of the industrial base and the team that's working that program. Obviously COVID set us on our heels, as well as the generational changeover in shipbuilders in terms of retirements and new hires. I think the way to think about that now is there's a number of factors that are going to help us get back to that point. One is, again, the maturing and tenuring of that new workforce to get the efficiency in the workforce, to get us back to where we were. The investments that the Navy is making in the industrial base, which are extremely helpful to stabilize that, and then other initiatives like what we call strategic sourcing, where we're trying to take bottlenecks out of the shipyards and move subsystem construction and capacity into other facilities and other yards around the country, so that we can take some of the pressure off of the two main production and assembly yards. Those are the types of things that are going to drive us back toward two per year. I'd be remiss to try and give you a timeline on when it's going to be to get there - this is long term, challenging stuff, but I think with us and our partner and the Navy all working in the same direction and in a very strong partnership, I feel optimistic about our path to get there. Yes, Columbia, as you know, is the Navy's and the DoD's number one priority, so that's going to continue to be the case. I don't see that being a trade-off necessarily to get to two per year for Virginia. Right now, we're a little over 40% complete on the first boat, and we're right on schedule for the targeted completion of that first boat. We've still got obviously about four years to go before delivery, so a lot of the way to go and a lot can happen between now and then, but all the resources that can be brought to bear are on that priority. I think the way to think about it is because of its priority position, it is essentially a headwind to those other factors that I gave you about what we're trying to do on Virginia class, and we've got to be able to manage both of those within the yard and within the team arrangement and with our customer, but those are some of the puts and takes. Columbia will be the priority, and it's our job to make Virginia happen notwithstanding that priority. I think the way to think about the fourth quarter, Cai, is as I alluded to earlier, there is obviously some upward pressure on the revenue on the defense side, nothing to get too specific about and I don't know that it's particularly material with just a couple months to go here in the year.  But one way to think about this is this year, let's talk group by group, in technologies you may remember, last year we had a significant surge in the fourth quarter because we had had a big back-up on the supply chain side at mission systems through the third quarter, and a lot of that flowed through in the fourth quarter, so really a big hockey stick or upswing in the fourth quarter. That's not the pattern this year. As I mentioned before, they've been on a more regular order and a more regular drumbeat, and so we'll see a more steady state revenue pattern for technologies in the fourth quarter. In combat, likewise it's historically for some time now been the traditional seasonal pattern for combat to rise throughout the year and have its biggest quarter in the fourth quarter, and we saw that again last year. In this case in 2023, it's a much more steady drumbeat - again, steady demand, strong volume, but not the traditional seasonal fourth quarter uptick in combat.  In marine, again we've already seen tremendous volume well in excess of our expectations. We're up a billion dollars almost through the first nine months, which is roughly what we expected for the year, so again I'd say more stable quarter to quarter. To summarize, we're seeing more stable volumes across all three of the defense segments from first quarter to fourth quarter, whereas in the past they've risen from first to fourth, so a little bit of an aberration in the pattern. I do expect--again, not to get ahead of the planning process we're going through, but I expect each of the businesses to show growth going into next year. Can't get too much more specific about that at this point, but you should see growth in the defense business across all three of the segments going into 2024. You know, the Israel situation obviously is a terrible one, frankly, and one that's just evolving as we speak. But I think if you look at the incremental demand potential coming out of that, the biggest one to highlight and that really sticks out is probably on the artillery side. Obviously that's been a big pressure point up to now with Ukraine, one that we've been doing everything we can to support our Army customer. We've gone from 14,000 rounds per month to 20,000 very quickly. We're working ahead of schedule to accelerate that production capacity up to 85,000, even as high as 100,000 rounds per month, and I think the Israel situation is only going to put upward pressure on that demand, so that's the biggest stick-out that I can see. Morning Ron. You know, I have to give a hand to the guys in the combat systems group in general, and land systems specifically. You've really not heard us talk about supply chain bottlenecks, labor capacity or other issues in that group, and that does not mean they have not faced them, they are just--they stand out amongst even a spectacular crowd in the way they've handled it. I don't have any expectation that we'll see any issues as we look ahead, even as the demand for their product, both domestically as well as internationally, continues to grow. Thank you for that - finally! On the margin side, just to be clear, as I think about double-digit margin for the group, not specifically GDIT - it's the mix of the two of them together, I absolutely expect this group to be on the march back to low double-digit margin. It's where they've been historically. I think if anything I could articulate as a headwind to that, it's to the extent that the GDIT side grows faster than the mission systems side, that obviously creates a bit of a macro mix issue that could be a little bit of a headwind in terms of how long it takes us to get there. But frankly, I expect to see us get back into the double-digit margin range here in the fourth quarter, and we'll see how quickly we can get there in the outlook as we look at '24 and beyond, but I do expect them to get back on the trajectory toward low double-digit margin. In terms of integration, the way we see this is while they're very symbiotic businesses and they are dealing with a market that's dealing with a convergence, to your point in terms of their capabilities, we think that having them separate is appropriate because the investment thesis and the way you run an inherently people business versus an inherently technology development, hardware and production business, are fundamentally different and take different leadership, different priorities and sort of different investment theses.  The good news is that by having them together in the same group and in a coordinated way, we are making investments and addressing the evolving technologies jointly as a group, and we are making sure we are being efficient at that and effective at that, not duplicative, not missing anything, and bringing the requisite skills, to your point, from end to end, whether it's the hardware side, the services, the software capabilities, solutions as a service, software services and so on, together in joint capability. I think we get the best of both worlds that way in terms of the way we manage and run the businesses, but also the way we can bring combined capabilities to the customer set."

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the Company\u2019s outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company\u2019s 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer. With the introductions complete, I turn the call over to Phebe.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Before I discuss the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the loss of our long-time Board member and Lead Director, Jim Crown. Jim has a record of distinguished service on the GD Board for over 35 years. Throughout that time, Jim provided guidance to more than five different management teams. We mourn his passing, and our prayers are with his family. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $2.70 per diluted share on revenue of $10.2 billion, operating earnings of $962 million and net income of $744 million. We enjoyed revenue increases at each of our four business segments. Importantly, we had a 12% revenue increase across the Defense segments, with a more modest 4.6% increase at Aerospace. While revenue is up by $963 million or 10.5%, operating earnings are down $16 million and net earnings are down $22 million against last year\u2019s second quarter. So, we had significant revenue increase but lower operating margin against the year-ago quarter. From a different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.14 per share on significantly higher revenue and modestly lower operating margin than anticipated by the sell side. The earnings beat was exclusively operations-driven. We enjoyed very nice sequential improvement. Revenue was up $271 million, and operating earnings are up $24 million on identical operating margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $20 billion is up $1.45 billion or 7.8% over last year\u2019s first half. Operating earnings of $1.9 billion are up less than 1% and net earnings are down $22 million, largely as a result of below-the-line items, including a higher provision for income taxes. As Jason will amplify, cash from operating activities and cash after capital expenditures in the quarter continued at a very good pace. For the first half, free cash flow was 123% of net income. Obviously, we are off to a very good start from a cash perspective. As is clear from the press release, we also had a powerful order quarter across the business, extending our already large backlog. Jason will provide full color around that item as well. In summary, this is from a revenue perspective, a very strong quarter and a good first half. Supply chain issues and past COVID labor issues have impacted operating margins, but there is relief in sight. We expect improvement as we progress. At this point, let me ask Jason to provide some detail on our strong order activity, growing backlog and very strong cash performance as well as commentary about the Technologies group in the quarter.\nJason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a very good quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.2:1 for the Company. Order activity was strong across the board, as each segment had a book-to-bill of 1:1 or greater in the quarter. This is quite impressive in light of the strong revenue growth. Combat Systems and Aerospace did particularly well with book-to-bills of 1.4 times and 1.3 times, respectively. This led to record-level backlog of $91.4 billion at the end of the quarter, up 1.7% from last quarter and up 4.3% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at more than $129 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. We generated $731 million of operating cash flow, which, following our strong first quarter performance, brings us to $2.2 billion for the first six months of the year. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $519 million for the quarter and over $1.8 billion year-to-date, yielding a cash conversion rate of 123% for the first half. This conversion rate reflects continued strong cash performance in Aerospace and Technologies and a particularly strong start to the year for the Combat Systems group from payments received on our large international vehicle programs. The year-to-date results are consistent with our expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate in excess of 100%. Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $212 million, or 2.1% of sales in the quarter, which brings us to 1.9% of sales for the first six months. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to be higher in the second half of the year, but in line with our expectation to be just under 2.5% of sales for the year. Also in the quarter, we paid $360 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of stock for $288 million. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 1.8 million shares for $378 million. We also repaid $750 million of debt that matured in May and ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $1.1 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $8.6 billion, down nearly $700 million from year-end. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million maturing in the third quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $89 million compared to $95 million last year. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $180 million, down from $193 million for the same period in 2022. At this point, our expectation for interest expense for the year remains unchanged at approximately $360 million. Finally, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 16%, bringing the tax rate for the first half to 16.5%. There\u2019s no change to our outlook for the full year of approximately 17%. But of course, that implies a rate in the mid-17% range for the second half of the year. To shape that for you, we\u2019d expect the rate to be somewhat lower in the third quarter and higher in the fourth due to typical timing items. Now turning to operating performance in Technologies. It was another solid quarter with revenue of $3.2 billion, which is up 7% over the prior year and continues to build on the strong start to the year we saw in the first quarter. In fact, each business grew year-over-year, both in the quarter and the first half. The measures implemented at Mission Systems to overcome what seems to be the new normal in the supply chain are taking effect. So we feel good about their prospects for the balance of the year. GDIT had another solid quarter, in fact, their highest second quarter revenues since before the pandemic as they continue to deliver on their steady year-over-year growth trajectory. Operating earnings in the quarter were $283 million, yielding a margin of 8.8%. As you know, margins are driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volume, and in this case, were further impacted by the mix of new start programs that are driving the strong growth trajectory. Backlog grew during the quarter, with the group achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1:1 on solid order activity that outpaced the strong revenue growth across the business. In fact, GDIT booked the highest first-half orders they\u2019ve seen since mid-2019, and their pipeline remains robust with $20 billion in submitted bids awaiting customer decision and another $81 billion in qualified opportunities identified. Now, let me turn it back to Phebe to review the other business segments and give an update on our guidance for 2023.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. Now, let me continue to review the quarter in the context of the other business segments and provide color as appropriate and guidance for the full year. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $1.95 billion and operating earnings of $236 million with a 12.1% operating margin. Revenue was $86 million more than last year\u2019s second quarter on the strength of additional new aircraft deliveries, coupled with higher Gulfstream service center volume, partially offset by less volume in Jet Aviation\u2019s completion center. The 24 deliveries are modestly fewer than planned and are a result of supply chain issues. On the good news side of the equation, supply chain conditions are improving. We still have a significant backlog of late parts, but processes are in place to catch up, deliveries are trending positive and we have greater transparency. In short, the suppliers are more predictable and are complying with catch-up schedules. This will help both revenue and margins as we do less out-of-station work. Operating earnings of $236 million are $2 million behind last year\u2019s second quarter as a result of a 60 basis-point reduction in operating margin. Operating margin in the quarter was off largely as a result of the supply chain issues and higher R&D expense. The shortage of parts continues to cause significant out-of-station work, impacting efficiency. As mentioned earlier, we see improvement here, and that should help as we go through the second half. Sequentially, Aerospace had a 3.2% increase in revenue and a 3.1% increase in operating earnings on identical operating margins. Moving to the demand environment. Aerospace had a very good quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 in dollar terms and even higher for Gulfstream aircraft alone. Vibrant sales activity and strong pipeline replenishment were evident in the quarter. The U.S., particularly large corporations, led the way with the Mid East and Asia participating to a lesser degree. The 700 flight test and certification program continues to progress. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature. However, we now target certification in the fourth quarter and see no major obstacles in our path. To give you a little more insight, we will complete our FAA Type Inspection Authorization in September. This is a flying we are required to do pursuant to FAA requirement and plan. When we are finished, the FAA will fly some confirmatory flight tests to verify portions of our results. That will be followed by a brief period of paper submission, followed by FAA review. As most of you know, we had planned to deliver considerable number of G700s in the third and fourth quarters. That has now flipped into the fourth quarter. We now expect to deliver 27 aircraft in the third quarter, with a rapid increase in the fourth quarter deliveries. In short, we are making good progress under difficult circumstances. However, we expect to deliver 5 to 6 fewer aircraft than the 145 we forecast at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, we expect more service revenue than initially anticipated. I\u2019ll have more on this later in my remarks. Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $1.92 billion, up a stunning 15.5% over the year-ago quarter with growth in each of the business units. Earnings of $251 million are up 2.4%. Margins at 13% represent a 170 basis-point reduction over the year-ago quarter. So, we saw powerful revenue performance, coupled with more modest operating margin, in large part attributable to mix. The increase in revenue came from international vehicle programs at both Land Systems and European Land Systems. OTS has also enjoyed higher artillery program volume, including programs to expand production capacity for the U.S. government. These programs carry dilutive margins, but will result in more production at accretive margins over time. On a sequential basis, revenue is up $168 million or 9.6%, and earnings are up $6 million or 2.4% on a 100 basis-point reduction in margin for the reasons described. Year-to-date, revenue is up $339 million or 10.1%, and operating earnings are up $24 million or 5.1%. We also experienced very strong order performance. Orders in the quarter resulted in a 1.4:1 book-to-bill, evidencing strong demand for munitions and domestic combat vehicles. International programs also contributed to the strong book-to-bill. So, a very exciting first half for Combat. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.1 billion is up $408 million, a robust 15.4% against the year-ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume drove the growth, and to a lesser degree, TAO growth. Operating earnings are $235 million, up $24 million over the year-ago quarter, with a 30 basis-point decrement in operating margin. We anticipate that all of our yards are now well positioned for slow but steady incremental margin growth over time with fewer perturbations. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $67 million or 2.2%, and operating earnings are up $24 million or 11.4% on a 60 basis-point improvement in margin. For the first half, revenue was up $749 million or 14.1% and earnings are up $24 million or 5.7%. So, a good quarter and first half. So, let me move on to give you our updated forecast for the year. The figures I\u2019m about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I won\u2019t repeat. There is, however, a chart with respect to all of this, will be posted on our website, which should be helpful. In Aerospace, revenue will be down almost $200 million due to the 5 or 6 fewer aircraft deliveries, offset in part by stronger service activity. So look for revenue of $10.2 billion. We also expect margins to be down from a projected 14.6% to 14.1%. This implies operating earnings of $1.4 billion. With respect to the Defense businesses, Combat Systems will have revenue of $400 million to $500 million higher than previously projected due to new program starts and an increased threat environment. So look for the total revenue of around $7.75 billion. Margins will be down 50 basis points from 14.7% to 14.2% on mix. All-in, operating earnings will be up $25 million over the previous forecast. Marine Systems revenue should be up $900 million or $1 billion on acceleration of work throughout the yards. This is a leading indicator of improving efficiency. So, we will have annual revenue around $11.8 billion with an operating margin around 7.6% for the reasons I have previously described to you. Operating earnings for the year should be up $20 million over the previous forecast. Technologies revenue will be $100 million to $200 million better than previous guidance, but operating margin will be 9.4%, 10 basis points lower than previously forecast. So for the group, we expect annual revenue of about $12.7 billion, with operating earnings around $1.2 billion, steady with prior guidance. There is some opportunity here to capture 10 to 20 basis points of margin. On a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue higher than our initial guidance and an overall operating margin about 40 basis points lower. So look for total revenue to be around $42.45 billion, about $1.2 billion up from previous guidance. Operating earnings should be down modestly from prior guidance, but below-the-line items and lower share count will leave our EPS guidance the same. One final note before I conclude my comments. Howard has informed the Company that he intends to retire later this year. So, this will be his last earnings call. We are grateful for the excellent work that Howard has done since joining our team. I hope many of you will join me in congratulating Howard on a job well done. Nicole Shelton, whom some of you know already, will be taking over the mantle with the third quarter call. That concludes my remarks, and we will be happy to take your questions.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you for your kind words and friendship. It\u2019s been a pleasure and a great experience to have had the opportunity to represent General Dynamics to the investment community these nearly six years. I have grown working side by side with many of the talented people of this tremendous enterprise. I look forward to working with Nicole over the next few months to ensure there are proper introductions and a seamless transition. There will be time ahead to say goodbye, but today, I want to say thank you. Now, let\u2019s turn to the question-and-answer period of this call. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JP Morgan.\nSeth Seifman: Hey. Thanks very much. Good morning, and congratulations, Howard. Thanks for everything. Just on the new Aerospace guidance, I guess, maybe if you could walk through how you thought about the setup for that. And I appreciate that this is mainly a timing issue and that any airplanes that don\u2019t get delivered in \u201823 can kind of move to \u201824. But just kind of the way we get level set. With 27 deliveries in the third quarter, we\u2019re talking about something quite high to get to 140-ish for the year. And also, I mean, with 27 deliveries, I assume we\u2019ll be looking at a margin in Q3 that\u2019s probably still in the 12s and so also getting to 14.1% for the year. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the margin -- the initial margin accretion from the new aircraft and what that contribution will be to the total deliveries.\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So, I think you\u2019ve put your finger on a nub of an issue. So, what we have given you with respect to Aerospace is Gulfstream\u2019s plan, and the guidance that we gave you reflects their plan. Our January guidance, just for context, contemplated a very high Q4 delivery rate. That rate increased with the certification delay on the 700. 700 will be fully built and ready for delivery. Remember, too, our new planes are all built in purpose-built facilities. We\u2019ve expanded our wing line. In short, we\u2019ve facilitized for increased production. And finally, the fact that we have planes -- and you can see this from the increase in inventory that are awaiting parts, we now have a schedule, and all of that taken together allows us to -- will give us the ability to deliver. With respect to margin, we\u2019ve got a number of higher-margin airplanes, as you would expect, delivering in the fourth quarter. So, that provides significant uplift. So, we kind of explained how we intend to get the revenue through the deliveries, and the margin is really a question of mix of higher deliveries of higher-margin -- greater deliveries of higher-margin airplanes.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. And just a follow-up real quick on this topic. The 27 deliveries in Q3 would be down year-on-year. And so in terms of -- there\u2019s the issue of the G700 certification, which we\u2019re all kind of looking at and it\u2019s hard to analyze. But just for the non-G700 deliveries, is there any risk around what the plan was there and what Gulfstream expects to do?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, as I noted in my remarks, our supply chain is increasing its transparency, improving its processes. And we have reliable -- increasingly reliable schedules. That said, they\u2019re more likely -- likely to anticipate more catch-up in the fourth quarter, which will allow us to complete a number of those airplanes, but they\u2019re still impacting the third quarter deliveries.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research.\nRobert Stallard: I can\u2019t believe Howard\u2019s retiring. He\u2019s so young.\nPhebe Novakovic: That\u2019s what we say.\nRobert Stallard: Anyway, I\u2019ve got a couple of questions for you, Phebe. First of all, on the revised Aerospace guidance, you mentioned that you\u2019ve increased your expectations for services for the full year. I was wondering if you could square this with what we\u2019ve been seeing in Biz Jet flight hours year-to-date, which have been down year-on-year. And then secondly, a great Combat Systems order quarter, but how do you expect these orders to flow through to revenue growth over the next couple of years? Thank you.\nPhebe Novakovic: So, our flying hours are not down. But I think, too, the way to think about our service business is we expect service to increase as the fleet of airplanes -- new airplanes in the market increases. So, we expect steady growth in service. And we haven\u2019t seen any impact so far on any change in flying hours. I said that mostly other people flying hours. With respect to Combat, the world has become a less safe place, and that\u2019s reflected in the increased demand, both internationally and in the United States. So we expect the -- this year to be considerably higher than last year. And we\u2019ll give you clarity around 2024 in January. But as you may recall, we had anticipated flat to down growth in this business segment. Clearly, that trajectory has changed. We won\u2019t be able to -- we can\u2019t quantify it right now, but we\u2019ll give you more clarity on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: So, back on the G700, would you expect to make up the missed deliveries this year? Would you expect them to make those up next year? So does the -- I think, what was -- 170 go higher in terms of what you\u2019re expecting for deliveries next year?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, we\u2019ll get into next year, next year. But the deliveries are lower, are -- 5 to 6 deliveries that won\u2019t deliver this year are not 700s. So, it\u2019s other airplanes.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. Got it. And then as a follow-up -- quick follow-up. Combat Systems, you\u2019ve mentioned this during the prepared remarks, the lower margins in the quarter, and then it looks like you\u2019re forecasting a bit of a snapback in the second half of the year, but still a fair amount lower than what you were initially forecasting. Could you just give a little bit more detail on the mix and how that\u2019s impacting? Thanks.\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So mix in this instance is comprised of two elements. One is the capacity expansion, which I noted carries lower margin. And then it\u2019s really the transition from more mature programs to newer programs, and those margins will improve as we come down our learning curves.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. Thanks so much. So -- and Howard, let me say, you\u2019ve been terrific to work with and a great friend, and I wish you all the best.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you, Cai.\nCai von Rumohr: So, Phebe, how many 700s are you assuming to deliver in the fourth quarter? And what kind of margin for error is there in terms of timing in terms of...\nPhebe Novakovic: We will deliver 19 G700s, and we\u2019re not going to tell you margins will be accretive. Nice try. Well, have we ever given you margins by airplane?\nCai von Rumohr: No, no, no. I just -- so -- and next -- I didn\u2019t mean -- I meant how much time-wise, a cushion you have in the schedule if the certification slips.\nPhebe Novakovic: You mean the schedule for the 700 certification?\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. I mean, is your best guess that you certify in the middle of November, in middle of December, which could impact the amount number of planes you get out\u2026\nPhebe Novakovic: So, what we\u2019ve told you is our best estimate right now of the certification process. Clearly, if it comes very late in the year, we\u2019ll deliver airplanes, but we won\u2019t necessarily be able to deliver all of them. That will bleed over into the best first quarter GD has ever had in its history. But we\u2019re not anticipating that at the moment. So, I don\u2019t have real good clarity because we don\u2019t know yet with precision on when in the fourth quarter. But our best estimate, what we\u2019re planning for right now is that we will be able to have sufficient time to deliver these airplanes. Remember, they\u2019re built -- the pilot training will start, and that will help significantly with deliveries.\nCai von Rumohr: Got it. And with all of these deliveries in the fourth quarter, maybe, Jason, can you give us some color in terms of the cash flow profile? I mean, do we have just a momentous fourth quarter cash? And is there any upside to the 105%?\nJason Aiken: The way I think you need to think about that, Cai, is when it comes to Gulfstream, we have a sequence of progress payments that occurs from the time of the initial order through delivery and entry into service. So, the vast majority of the cash receipts associated with an aircraft order and aircraft delivery are in-house before the actual airplane is delivered. So, while there\u2019s obviously an implied set of progress payments, final delivery payments would occur at that point. When those aircraft enter into service, it\u2019s not an outsized level of cash, one way or the other. So, the bigger issue is you\u2019ve got an ongoing sequence and series of progress payments associated with all of the orders in the order book. And with the significant order volume that we\u2019ve had over the past 2, 2.5 years, that is sort of a machine that\u2019s just churning those progress payments over time as we continue to make progress on each of those airplane builds as well as the certification process.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Wolfe Research.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. And congratulations on retirement, Howard. Miss you. In terms of the -- the outlook for Aerospace orders, could you just comment, Phebe, what you\u2019re seeing for the rest of the year? Obviously, the second quarter was probably helped a little bit because of the anomaly you mentioned in March around the banking crisis. And then also if you can comment on churn in the backlog, I think your net book-to-bill was a couple of hundred million lighter than your gross book-to-bill. So maybe just talk about any cancellations.\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So, the demand in the second quarter was at the same level as the demand in the first quarter. It felt very, very similar. As you quite rightly note, we had a three-week hiatus coincident with the banking -- many banking crisis. But the demand levels have remained about the same. And as we enter Q3, we have a very strong pipeline. And so far, activity is quite good in Q3. We had six defaults in the quarter, but nothing that is notable to us. And the backlog is holding up very, very well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citigroup.\nJason Gursky: Congrats, Howard. I look forward to getting some postcards from our in distant places. Phebe, just sticking with Gulfstream for one last question, hopefully here. On the pipeline and kind of what you see from a bottom-up perspective, can you give us a little flavor from a geographic perspective and customer type? How is high net worth doing versus corporate? And are we beginning to see some green shoots in geographies outside the United States?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So, the United States was strong, has been strong, particularly with the Fortune 500. I would say that high net worth is about the same. And the Mid East is pretty good, as is Asia, but it\u2019s really the Fortune 500 that are really driving the demand. These are long-established customers as well as new Fortune 500 customers.\nJason Gursky: Okay, great. And then, Jason, over to you on Technologies. It sounds like you\u2019ve got a robust pipeline of opportunities in front of you. Can you talk a little bit about the mix of that? We had some margin degradation here in the quarter. I\u2019m just kind of curious, as you look out at that pipeline, do you see anything that would suggest we\u2019re going to see a departure in any -- either higher or lower from a margin perspective as you bid on this work and bring it in?\nJason Aiken: I think bottom line, the short answer to that is no. We don\u2019t see any fundamental change, as we\u2019ve talked about. You\u2019re going to see some level of aggregate margin perturbation between the two businesses, the IT services side being somewhat lower obviously than the hardware side. I think in this quarter, we saw it a little more pronounced because as we\u2019re seeing this turn for the group to a stronger growth level, a lot of that is driven by not only new starts, but it\u2019s actually replacement contracts, or I should say, recompetes that we\u2019ve won. So, you had in the prior year the trailing off of very mature-level legacy contracts that were closing out at higher margin rates as compared to the entry-level margin rates we\u2019re seeing now. So, that\u2019s sort of the driver of the year-over-year delta that you\u2019re seeing. But barring any major structural shift between the percentage contributions of the IT services versus defense hardware parts of the business, we continue to expect this to be a low double-digit margin business over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America.\nRon Epstein: Yes. Hey. Good morning. And ditto Cai\u2019s remarks, Howard, you will be missed. It\u2019s been a pleasure working with you. So quickly, a couple of questions. On Technologies, what should we be looking for? I mean, sometimes the contracts there aren\u2019t as obvious in the horizon. So, Jason, what should we be looking out for in the second half of the year as potential things you guys could win?\nJason Aiken: Ron, it\u2019s always tough in this business to point to a singular event or a contract that is going to drive the overall business. As you know, it\u2019s a wide portfolio of literally thousands of contracts. I think -- the thing I would tell you is, when you look at Mission Systems on the one hand, they are really seeing strong support in their -- what I\u2019d call, their Navy platform support businesses, whether it\u2019s the strategic side or the mission computing side. They\u2019re also seeing really great support in their cyber portfolio. So, those are two areas I would expect to see continued growth in particular out of that business. When you look at GDIT, they\u2019re seeing strength in all three of their customer segments: the defense, the intelligence community and the Fed SIV side. So, really good across-the-board support in GDIT. And I think if I could point to any one thing in particular on that side of the portfolio, we\u2019ve talked for the past few weeks, a couple of months about some selective technology investments they\u2019ve been making to accelerate their growth, and we\u2019re seeing that really start to take hold. And of course, we\u2019re talking about things like artificial intelligence, machine learning, hybrid cloud, Zero Trust and so on. And that\u2019s really starting to bear fruit. We\u2019ve seen already several hundred million dollars worth of award wins as well as organic growth on existing contracts that\u2019s resulting directly from those investments. They\u2019ve got some $7 billion in change in post-submittal submissions that are awaiting award decisions. And they\u2019ve got another 20-plus, I think, between $20 billion, $25 billion of opportunities in the pipeline that are directly tied to those targeted investments. So, I think some really intelligent capital allocation over there at GDIT to try and drive that growth, and we\u2019d expect to see the results of that continue in the second half of the year and beyond.\nRon Epstein: Okay, great. And then maybe one follow-on for Phebe. When we think about Aero, when things start to normalize, right, supply chain kind of gets back to a normal cadence and all that, what should we be thinking about broadly as like a realistic margin target?\nPhebe Novakovic: We\u2019re thinking in the higher teens when we get on a steady state with upside potential.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair.\nLouie DiPalma: Howard, thank you for your deep aerospace-defense expertise in your current position and your former position on the sell side, your high standards raised the level of those around you. For Jason, for the Army\u2019s CHS-6 $8 billion recompete that should be announced, I think, very soon. GD Mission Solutions is teaming with GDIT. Do you feel these synergistic joint bids between IT and Mission will become more common and a significant strategic advantage for you? And could it help return the overall Technologies segment to mid-single-digit growth over the long term?\nJason Aiken: Yes. And bottom line answer, you kind of hit the nail on the head there. We absolutely expect the synergistic benefits of these two businesses working together to be to our benefit over the long run. It\u2019s -- the predicate for all that is that what we\u2019ve seen both in the customer demand environment, what they\u2019re requiring in terms of end-to-end solutions, including both software, services and the hardware elements of what we provide. We\u2019re seeing the peer group migrate that way with some of their M&A activities that you\u2019ve seen in the market. And so, we believe that is the thesis that we\u2019ll see play out. You noted CHS-6, we\u2019re obviously participating in and anticipating that -- resolution to that competition. We\u2019ve seen that program migrate over time from one that was traditionally very much focused on high-end, customized, ruggedized hardened-type defense hardware to one that is a combination of that type of capability as well as a more traditional, sort of off-the-shelf catalog-type product. And so, we believe that having the attributes of both GDIT and Mission Systems involved in that program would be the best suited to serve our customer there. So, that\u2019s just one good example of it. But absolutely, we see that over time. And as far as long-term growth rates, we\u2019ll have to see where this leads. Right now, we continue to track low- to mid-single digit, but we\u2019ll see if we can\u2019t get some juice out of that over time.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Howard, exactly what Louie said, and then, thank you for being such a great colleague and a teacher to me and all those around you, so thank you. Phebe or Jason, whoever, on the Defense business, when you look at your 2023 guidance, Defense growth is up solidly up 5% for the year versus the 9% growth you did in the first half. But this is not necessarily leading to operating leverage with margin contraction of 40 bps and flat operating profit. So, how do you think about the return to operating margin expansion either on a total company level or a segment basis? It seems like Technologies is more temporary, Combat mix maybe continues for some time.\nPhebe Novakovic: So, Technologies and Combat are simply a question of mix. And I suspect Combat will quickly return to its normal operating leverage. The Marine Group has significant supply chain challenges that have impacted for the Virginia-class in particular. That\u2019s going to take some time to resolve. We\u2019ll talk about that in a little bit more detail. So, as I noted, we expect slow quarter-over-quarter margin growth in the Marine Group, perhaps an occasional perturbation by quarter, but slow and steady improvement over time.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets.\nKen Herbert: Congratulations, Howard. Phebe, I just wanted to dig into Marine again a little deeper. The full year guide implies a pretty significant deceleration in growth into the back half of the year. Two questions, really. First, as we go back six months, you were talking about a much more conservative outlook for the top line in Marine. And clearly, maybe any comments on really what\u2019s changed because the first half has really been much stronger than expected. But then also, as you think about the remainder of the year, what will drive the significant step down and how much conservatism does the Marine outlook reflect in terms of the growth?\nPhebe Novakovic: So, growth in the quarter was driven by improved -- increased volume on Columbia and on the oiler program as well as additional throughput throughout each one of those yards, which is often a precursor to better margin performance. And finally, just the -- revenue came in faster than we had anticipated, really across the board. And that will drive our expectations. With respect to the margin performance, we have -- Columbia is doing very well. We\u2019ve got nice performance on the oiler. We see some deck plate improvements of Bath, but that has yet to translate into financial performance. Electric Boat needs to continue to get better to offset likely additional supply chain challenges as the Virginia supply chain begins to improve. And with respect to that supply chain, we see improvements and some very nice improvement in some area. But that supply chain was hit hard by COVID. And I think a little bit of explanation there is helpful. COVID impacted that supply chain, Virginia supply chain, in particular, in a couple of ways. Obviously, the impact of COVID itself, the workforce disruption. Then we had the large demographic changeover. And finally, Virginia was impacted by the Columbia prioritization. All of that made it difficult for that supply chain to begin to get back on cadence. They\u2019re getting better, but we\u2019ve got a while to go before they hit their two-a-year or more cadence.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.\nPeter Arment: Thank you. Good morning, Phebe and Jason. Congrats, Howard. Hey Phebe, within Combat, munitions kind of is viewed as a potential source of kind of upside volume, and thanks for all the color on the segment. But how should we be thinking about the munitions growth profile? I mean, it\u2019s about -- finished last year, about 27% of your mix. Do you expect that mix to continue to grow? And any comments on the supply chain there as my follow-up, just because I know there\u2019s been talk about challenges there. Thanks.\nPhebe Novakovic: The supply chain in the Combat group has been less of an issue. I suspect that the -- at least for the foreseeable future, the munitions portion of the business will remain about that, same as we see uplift in all of our all three businesses. We\u2019ll see OTS at about that same level. We\u2019ve already increased munitions capacity and working with the federal government and the Army and OSD in particular, we have a very detailed plan to further increase capacity, which will allow us then to increase production very rapidly and move to the left, the munition availability to meet the United States\u2019 needs and, frankly, external needs as well.\nHoward Rubel: Operator, we\u2019ll just take one more question, please.\nOperator: And our final question for today comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.\nGeorge Shapiro: Good morning, and congratulations, Howard. I didn\u2019t figure I\u2019d outlast you, but we\u2019ve known each other a lot of years and...\nHoward Rubel: George, it\u2019s over 40, just counting.\nGeorge Shapiro: That\u2019s right. Phebe, on the defaults that you mentioned, can you just mention what kind of customers they might have been? And I assume you keep the down-payments that might have been made on the aircraft that they order?\nPhebe Novakovic: So I think you know we have very strong terms and conditions that you forfeit some of your value in the airplane when you cancel. I don\u2019t actually know the context of the default, that won\u2019t -- nothing that was of note or interest, otherwise, I\u2019d know it.\nGeorge Shapiro: Okay. And Jason, the unbilled receivables was actually up like $100 million sequentially. So, does that mean you didn\u2019t get any payments from the expected customers in the quarter? And how much would you expect the rest of the year to come in?\nJason Aiken: Actually, George, we did receive additional payments on schedule as per the plan that was set forth several years ago. And I\u2019m actually happy to tell you that at this point -- and maybe this terminates this line of dialogue for the foreseeable future. The arrears that you all may remember from many years ago on that Canadian international program has now effectively been paid down, and we are down to what I would call a normal run rate of operating working capital on that program. So I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019ve passed through that phase. In terms of what we expect to receive for the balance of the year, there are some more progress payments to come in, but I don\u2019t have that quantified off the top of my head.\nGeorge Shapiro: Something you had kind of given what the specifics were on that in the Q.\nHoward Rubel: We\u2019ll follow up on that.\nJason Aiken: Yes.\nHoward Rubel: Operator, that now ends the call. And for those that are interested in connecting later, we\u2019ll have follow-up questions. Please don\u2019t hesitate to call me. Thank you for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. And as I said, if you have any additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a very good quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.2:1 for the Company. Order activity was strong across the board, as each segment had a book-to-bill of 1:1 or greater in the quarter. This is quite impressive in light of the strong revenue growth. Combat Systems and Aerospace did particularly well with book-to-bills of 1.4 times and 1.3 times, respectively. This led to record-level backlog of $91.4 billion at the end of the quarter, up 1.7% from last quarter and up 4.3% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at more than $129 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. We generated $731 million of operating cash flow, which, following our strong first quarter performance, brings us to $2.2 billion for the first six months of the year. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $519 million for the quarter and over $1.8 billion year-to-date, yielding a cash conversion rate of 123% for the first half. This conversion rate reflects continued strong cash performance in Aerospace and Technologies and a particularly strong start to the year for the Combat Systems group from payments received on our large international vehicle programs. The year-to-date results are consistent with our expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate in excess of 100%. Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $212 million, or 2.1% of sales in the quarter, which brings us to 1.9% of sales for the first six months. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to be higher in the second half of the year, but in line with our expectation to be just under 2.5% of sales for the year. Also in the quarter, we paid $360 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of stock for $288 million. That brings year-to-date repurchases to 1.8 million shares for $378 million. We also repaid $750 million of debt that matured in May and ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $1.1 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $8.6 billion, down nearly $700 million from year-end. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million maturing in the third quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $89 million compared to $95 million last year. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $180 million, down from $193 million for the same period in 2022. At this point, our expectation for interest expense for the year remains unchanged at approximately $360 million. Finally, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 16%, bringing the tax rate for the first half to 16.5%. There's no change to our outlook for the full year of approximately 17%. But of course, that implies a rate in the mid-17% range for the second half of the year. To shape that for you, we'd expect the rate to be somewhat lower in the third quarter and higher in the fourth due to typical timing items. Now turning to operating performance in Technologies. It was another solid quarter with revenue of $3.2 billion, which is up 7% over the prior year and continues to build on the strong start to the year we saw in the first quarter. In fact, each business grew year-over-year, both in the quarter and the first half. The measures implemented at Mission Systems to overcome what seems to be the new normal in the supply chain are taking effect. So we feel good about their prospects for the balance of the year. GDIT had another solid quarter, in fact, their highest second quarter revenues since before the pandemic as they continue to deliver on their steady year-over-year growth trajectory. Operating earnings in the quarter were $283 million, yielding a margin of 8.8%. As you know, margins are driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volume, and in this case, were further impacted by the mix of new start programs that are driving the strong growth trajectory. Backlog grew during the quarter, with the group achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1:1 on solid order activity that outpaced the strong revenue growth across the business. In fact, GDIT booked the highest first-half orders they've seen since mid-2019, and their pipeline remains robust with $20 billion in submitted bids awaiting customer decision and another $81 billion in qualified opportunities identified. Now, let me turn it back to Phebe to review the other business segments and give an update on our guidance for 2023. The way I think you need to think about that, Cai, is when it comes to Gulfstream, we have a sequence of progress payments that occurs from the time of the initial order through delivery and entry into service. So, the vast majority of the cash receipts associated with an aircraft order and aircraft delivery are in-house before the actual airplane is delivered. So, while there's obviously an implied set of progress payments, final delivery payments would occur at that point. When those aircraft enter into service, it's not an outsized level of cash, one way or the other. So, the bigger issue is you've got an ongoing sequence and series of progress payments associated with all of the orders in the order book. And with the significant order volume that we've had over the past 2, 2.5 years, that is sort of a machine that's just churning those progress payments over time as we continue to make progress on each of those airplane builds as well as the certification process. I think bottom line, the short answer to that is no. We don't see any fundamental change, as we've talked about. You're going to see some level of aggregate margin perturbation between the two businesses, the IT services side being somewhat lower obviously than the hardware side. I think in this quarter, we saw it a little more pronounced because as we're seeing this turn for the group to a stronger growth level, a lot of that is driven by not only new starts, but it's actually replacement contracts, or I should say, recompetes that we've won. So, you had in the prior year the trailing off of very mature-level legacy contracts that were closing out at higher margin rates as compared to the entry-level margin rates we're seeing now. So, that's sort of the driver of the year-over-year delta that you're seeing. But barring any major structural shift between the percentage contributions of the IT services versus defense hardware parts of the business, we continue to expect this to be a low double-digit margin business over time. Ron, it's always tough in this business to point to a singular event or a contract that is going to drive the overall business. As you know, it's a wide portfolio of literally thousands of contracts. I think -- the thing I would tell you is, when you look at Mission Systems on the one hand, they are really seeing strong support in their -- what I'd call, their Navy platform support businesses, whether it's the strategic side or the mission computing side. They're also seeing really great support in their cyber portfolio. So, those are two areas I would expect to see continued growth in particular out of that business. When you look at GDIT, they're seeing strength in all three of their customer segments: the defense, the intelligence community and the Fed SIV side. So, really good across-the-board support in GDIT. And I think if I could point to any one thing in particular on that side of the portfolio, we've talked for the past few weeks, a couple of months about some selective technology investments they've been making to accelerate their growth, and we're seeing that really start to take hold. And of course, we're talking about things like artificial intelligence, machine learning, hybrid cloud, Zero Trust and so on. And that's really starting to bear fruit. We've seen already several hundred million dollars worth of award wins as well as organic growth on existing contracts that's resulting directly from those investments. They've got some $7 billion in change in post-submittal submissions that are awaiting award decisions. And they've got another 20-plus, I think, between $20 billion, $25 billion of opportunities in the pipeline that are directly tied to those targeted investments. So, I think some really intelligent capital allocation over there at GDIT to try and drive that growth, and we'd expect to see the results of that continue in the second half of the year and beyond. Yes. And bottom line answer, you kind of hit the nail on the head there. We absolutely expect the synergistic benefits of these two businesses working together to be to our benefit over the long run. It's -- the predicate for all that is that what we've seen both in the customer demand environment, what they're requiring in terms of end-to-end solutions, including both software, services and the hardware elements of what we provide. We're seeing the peer group migrate that way with some of their M&A activities that you've seen in the market. And so, we believe that is the thesis that we'll see play out. You noted CHS-6, we're obviously participating in and anticipating that -- resolution to that competition. We've seen that program migrate over time from one that was traditionally very much focused on high-end, customized, ruggedized hardened-type defense hardware to one that is a combination of that type of capability as well as a more traditional, sort of off-the-shelf catalog-type product. And so, we believe that having the attributes of both GDIT and Mission Systems involved in that program would be the best suited to serve our customer there. So, that's just one good example of it. But absolutely, we see that over time. And as far as long-term growth rates, we'll have to see where this leads. Right now, we continue to track low- to mid-single digit, but we'll see if we can't get some juice out of that over time. Actually, George, we did receive additional payments on schedule as per the plan that was set forth several years ago. And I'm actually happy to tell you that at this point -- and maybe this terminates this line of dialogue for the foreseeable future. The arrears that you all may remember from many years ago on that Canadian international program has now effectively been paid down, and we are down to what I would call a normal run rate of operating working capital on that program. So I'm pleased to report that we've passed through that phase. In terms of what we expect to receive for the balance of the year, there are some more progress payments to come in, but I don't have that quantified off the top of my head. Yes."

            "name": "Phebe Novakovic",
            "content": "Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Before I discuss the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the loss of our long-time Board member and Lead Director, Jim Crown. Jim has a record of distinguished service on the GD Board for over 35 years. Throughout that time, Jim provided guidance to more than five different management teams. We mourn his passing, and our prayers are with his family. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $2.70 per diluted share on revenue of $10.2 billion, operating earnings of $962 million and net income of $744 million. We enjoyed revenue increases at each of our four business segments. Importantly, we had a 12% revenue increase across the Defense segments, with a more modest 4.6% increase at Aerospace. While revenue is up by $963 million or 10.5%, operating earnings are down $16 million and net earnings are down $22 million against last year's second quarter. So, we had significant revenue increase but lower operating margin against the year-ago quarter. From a different perspective, we beat consensus by $0.14 per share on significantly higher revenue and modestly lower operating margin than anticipated by the sell side. The earnings beat was exclusively operations-driven. We enjoyed very nice sequential improvement. Revenue was up $271 million, and operating earnings are up $24 million on identical operating margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $20 billion is up $1.45 billion or 7.8% over last year's first half. Operating earnings of $1.9 billion are up less than 1% and net earnings are down $22 million, largely as a result of below-the-line items, including a higher provision for income taxes. As Jason will amplify, cash from operating activities and cash after capital expenditures in the quarter continued at a very good pace. For the first half, free cash flow was 123% of net income. Obviously, we are off to a very good start from a cash perspective. As is clear from the press release, we also had a powerful order quarter across the business, extending our already large backlog. Jason will provide full color around that item as well. In summary, this is from a revenue perspective, a very strong quarter and a good first half. Supply chain issues and past COVID labor issues have impacted operating margins, but there is relief in sight. We expect improvement as we progress. At this point, let me ask Jason to provide some detail on our strong order activity, growing backlog and very strong cash performance as well as commentary about the Technologies group in the quarter. Thanks, Jason. Now, let me continue to review the quarter in the context of the other business segments and provide color as appropriate and guidance for the full year. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had revenue of $1.95 billion and operating earnings of $236 million with a 12.1% operating margin. Revenue was $86 million more than last year's second quarter on the strength of additional new aircraft deliveries, coupled with higher Gulfstream service center volume, partially offset by less volume in Jet Aviation's completion center. The 24 deliveries are modestly fewer than planned and are a result of supply chain issues. On the good news side of the equation, supply chain conditions are improving. We still have a significant backlog of late parts, but processes are in place to catch up, deliveries are trending positive and we have greater transparency. In short, the suppliers are more predictable and are complying with catch-up schedules. This will help both revenue and margins as we do less out-of-station work. Operating earnings of $236 million are $2 million behind last year's second quarter as a result of a 60 basis-point reduction in operating margin. Operating margin in the quarter was off largely as a result of the supply chain issues and higher R&D expense. The shortage of parts continues to cause significant out-of-station work, impacting efficiency. As mentioned earlier, we see improvement here, and that should help as we go through the second half. Sequentially, Aerospace had a 3.2% increase in revenue and a 3.1% increase in operating earnings on identical operating margins. Moving to the demand environment. Aerospace had a very good quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1 in dollar terms and even higher for Gulfstream aircraft alone. Vibrant sales activity and strong pipeline replenishment were evident in the quarter. The U.S., particularly large corporations, led the way with the Mid East and Asia participating to a lesser degree. The 700 flight test and certification program continues to progress. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature. However, we now target certification in the fourth quarter and see no major obstacles in our path. To give you a little more insight, we will complete our FAA Type Inspection Authorization in September. This is a flying we are required to do pursuant to FAA requirement and plan. When we are finished, the FAA will fly some confirmatory flight tests to verify portions of our results. That will be followed by a brief period of paper submission, followed by FAA review. As most of you know, we had planned to deliver considerable number of G700s in the third and fourth quarters. That has now flipped into the fourth quarter. We now expect to deliver 27 aircraft in the third quarter, with a rapid increase in the fourth quarter deliveries. In short, we are making good progress under difficult circumstances. However, we expect to deliver 5 to 6 fewer aircraft than the 145 we forecast at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, we expect more service revenue than initially anticipated. I'll have more on this later in my remarks. Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $1.92 billion, up a stunning 15.5% over the year-ago quarter with growth in each of the business units. Earnings of $251 million are up 2.4%. Margins at 13% represent a 170 basis-point reduction over the year-ago quarter. So, we saw powerful revenue performance, coupled with more modest operating margin, in large part attributable to mix. The increase in revenue came from international vehicle programs at both Land Systems and European Land Systems. OTS has also enjoyed higher artillery program volume, including programs to expand production capacity for the U.S. government. These programs carry dilutive margins, but will result in more production at accretive margins over time. On a sequential basis, revenue is up $168 million or 9.6%, and earnings are up $6 million or 2.4% on a 100 basis-point reduction in margin for the reasons described. Year-to-date, revenue is up $339 million or 10.1%, and operating earnings are up $24 million or 5.1%. We also experienced very strong order performance. Orders in the quarter resulted in a 1.4:1 book-to-bill, evidencing strong demand for munitions and domestic combat vehicles. International programs also contributed to the strong book-to-bill. So, a very exciting first half for Combat. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.1 billion is up $408 million, a robust 15.4% against the year-ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume drove the growth, and to a lesser degree, TAO growth. Operating earnings are $235 million, up $24 million over the year-ago quarter, with a 30 basis-point decrement in operating margin. We anticipate that all of our yards are now well positioned for slow but steady incremental margin growth over time with fewer perturbations. On a sequential basis, revenue was up $67 million or 2.2%, and operating earnings are up $24 million or 11.4% on a 60 basis-point improvement in margin. For the first half, revenue was up $749 million or 14.1% and earnings are up $24 million or 5.7%. So, a good quarter and first half. So, let me move on to give you our updated forecast for the year. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which I won't repeat. There is, however, a chart with respect to all of this, will be posted on our website, which should be helpful. In Aerospace, revenue will be down almost $200 million due to the 5 or 6 fewer aircraft deliveries, offset in part by stronger service activity. So look for revenue of $10.2 billion. We also expect margins to be down from a projected 14.6% to 14.1%. This implies operating earnings of $1.4 billion. With respect to the Defense businesses, Combat Systems will have revenue of $400 million to $500 million higher than previously projected due to new program starts and an increased threat environment. So look for the total revenue of around $7.75 billion. Margins will be down 50 basis points from 14.7% to 14.2% on mix. All-in, operating earnings will be up $25 million over the previous forecast. Marine Systems revenue should be up $900 million or $1 billion on acceleration of work throughout the yards. This is a leading indicator of improving efficiency. So, we will have annual revenue around $11.8 billion with an operating margin around 7.6% for the reasons I have previously described to you. Operating earnings for the year should be up $20 million over the previous forecast. Technologies revenue will be $100 million to $200 million better than previous guidance, but operating margin will be 9.4%, 10 basis points lower than previously forecast. So for the group, we expect annual revenue of about $12.7 billion, with operating earnings around $1.2 billion, steady with prior guidance. There is some opportunity here to capture 10 to 20 basis points of margin. On a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue higher than our initial guidance and an overall operating margin about 40 basis points lower. So look for total revenue to be around $42.45 billion, about $1.2 billion up from previous guidance. Operating earnings should be down modestly from prior guidance, but below-the-line items and lower share count will leave our EPS guidance the same. One final note before I conclude my comments. Howard has informed the Company that he intends to retire later this year. So, this will be his last earnings call. We are grateful for the excellent work that Howard has done since joining our team. I hope many of you will join me in congratulating Howard on a job well done. Nicole Shelton, whom some of you know already, will be taking over the mantle with the third quarter call. That concludes my remarks, and we will be happy to take your questions. Yes. So, I think you've put your finger on a nub of an issue. So, what we have given you with respect to Aerospace is Gulfstream's plan, and the guidance that we gave you reflects their plan. Our January guidance, just for context, contemplated a very high Q4 delivery rate. That rate increased with the certification delay on the 700. 700 will be fully built and ready for delivery. Remember, too, our new planes are all built in purpose-built facilities. We've expanded our wing line. In short, we've facilitized for increased production. And finally, the fact that we have planes -- and you can see this from the increase in inventory that are awaiting parts, we now have a schedule, and all of that taken together allows us to -- will give us the ability to deliver. With respect to margin, we've got a number of higher-margin airplanes, as you would expect, delivering in the fourth quarter. So, that provides significant uplift. So, we kind of explained how we intend to get the revenue through the deliveries, and the margin is really a question of mix of higher deliveries of higher-margin -- greater deliveries of higher-margin airplanes. So, as I noted in my remarks, our supply chain is increasing its transparency, improving its processes. And we have reliable -- increasingly reliable schedules. That said, they're more likely -- likely to anticipate more catch-up in the fourth quarter, which will allow us to complete a number of those airplanes, but they're still impacting the third quarter deliveries. That's what we say. So, our flying hours are not down. But I think, too, the way to think about our service business is we expect service to increase as the fleet of airplanes -- new airplanes in the market increases. So, we expect steady growth in service. And we haven't seen any impact so far on any change in flying hours. I said that mostly other people flying hours. With respect to Combat, the world has become a less safe place, and that's reflected in the increased demand, both internationally and in the United States. So we expect the -- this year to be considerably higher than last year. And we'll give you clarity around 2024 in January. But as you may recall, we had anticipated flat to down growth in this business segment. Clearly, that trajectory has changed. We won't be able to -- we can't quantify it right now, but we'll give you more clarity on that. Well, we'll get into next year, next year. But the deliveries are lower, are -- 5 to 6 deliveries that won't deliver this year are not 700s. So, it's other airplanes. Yes. So mix in this instance is comprised of two elements. One is the capacity expansion, which I noted carries lower margin. And then it's really the transition from more mature programs to newer programs, and those margins will improve as we come down our learning curves. We will deliver 19 G700s, and we're not going to tell you margins will be accretive. Nice try. Well, have we ever given you margins by airplane? You mean the schedule for the 700 certification? So, what we've told you is our best estimate right now of the certification process. Clearly, if it comes very late in the year, we'll deliver airplanes, but we won't necessarily be able to deliver all of them. That will bleed over into the best first quarter GD has ever had in its history. But we're not anticipating that at the moment. So, I don't have real good clarity because we don't know yet with precision on when in the fourth quarter. But our best estimate, what we're planning for right now is that we will be able to have sufficient time to deliver these airplanes. Remember, they're built -- the pilot training will start, and that will help significantly with deliveries. Yes. So, the demand in the second quarter was at the same level as the demand in the first quarter. It felt very, very similar. As you quite rightly note, we had a three-week hiatus coincident with the banking -- many banking crisis. But the demand levels have remained about the same. And as we enter Q3, we have a very strong pipeline. And so far, activity is quite good in Q3. We had six defaults in the quarter, but nothing that is notable to us. And the backlog is holding up very, very well. Yes. So, the United States was strong, has been strong, particularly with the Fortune 500. I would say that high net worth is about the same. And the Mid East is pretty good, as is Asia, but it's really the Fortune 500 that are really driving the demand. These are long-established customers as well as new Fortune 500 customers. We're thinking in the higher teens when we get on a steady state with upside potential. So, Technologies and Combat are simply a question of mix. And I suspect Combat will quickly return to its normal operating leverage. The Marine Group has significant supply chain challenges that have impacted for the Virginia-class in particular. That's going to take some time to resolve. We'll talk about that in a little bit more detail. So, as I noted, we expect slow quarter-over-quarter margin growth in the Marine Group, perhaps an occasional perturbation by quarter, but slow and steady improvement over time. So, growth in the quarter was driven by improved -- increased volume on Columbia and on the oiler program as well as additional throughput throughout each one of those yards, which is often a precursor to better margin performance. And finally, just the -- revenue came in faster than we had anticipated, really across the board. And that will drive our expectations. With respect to the margin performance, we have -- Columbia is doing very well. We've got nice performance on the oiler. We see some deck plate improvements of Bath, but that has yet to translate into financial performance. Electric Boat needs to continue to get better to offset likely additional supply chain challenges as the Virginia supply chain begins to improve. And with respect to that supply chain, we see improvements and some very nice improvement in some area. But that supply chain was hit hard by COVID. And I think a little bit of explanation there is helpful. COVID impacted that supply chain, Virginia supply chain, in particular, in a couple of ways. Obviously, the impact of COVID itself, the workforce disruption. Then we had the large demographic changeover. And finally, Virginia was impacted by the Columbia prioritization. All of that made it difficult for that supply chain to begin to get back on cadence. They're getting better, but we've got a while to go before they hit their two-a-year or more cadence. The supply chain in the Combat group has been less of an issue. I suspect that the -- at least for the foreseeable future, the munitions portion of the business will remain about that, same as we see uplift in all of our all three businesses. We'll see OTS at about that same level. We've already increased munitions capacity and working with the federal government and the Army and OSD in particular, we have a very detailed plan to further increase capacity, which will allow us then to increase production very rapidly and move to the left, the munition availability to meet the United States' needs and, frankly, external needs as well. So I think you know we have very strong terms and conditions that you forfeit some of your value in the airplane when you cancel. I don't actually know the context of the default, that won't -- nothing that was of note or interest, otherwise, I'd know it."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Howard Rubel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the press release and slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com.  On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jason Aiken, Executive Vice President, Technologies and Chief Financial Officer. With the introductions complete, I turn the call over to Phebe.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.64 per diluted share on revenue of $9.9 billion, operating earnings of $938 million and net earnings of $730 million. Revenue is up $489 million or 5.2% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $30 million and net earnings are flat against the year ago quarter. This increase in operating earnings was offset by a $31 million increase in the tax provision.  Recall that the first quarter 2022 tax provision was only 14%. Nevertheless, earnings per share are up $0.03 as a result of the stronger operating earnings and a lower share count. The operating margin for the entire company was 9.5%, 20 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This reflected lower operating margins in Aerospace and Marine, which I will address in some detail later in these remarks. Revenue was $489 million better than first quarter '22. All of the defense units were up and Aerospace down slightly, less than 1% on fewer aircraft deliveries. We beat consensus by $0.05 per share. We have roughly $550 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and lower-than-anticipated margins, leading to operating earnings basically consistent with expectations. The earnings per share beat was largely attributable to below the line items.  As Jason will amplify, cash from operating activities and cash after CapEx was very strong. This is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in '22 and not at all typical for us in the first quarter. Obviously, we were off to a very good start from a cash perspective. This is an important respects, a strong quarter, a good foundation for the year, subject to some supply chain issues that I will try to eliminate as we discuss the business segments.  At this point, let me ask Jason to provide detail on our order activity, solid backlog and very strong cash performance as well as commentary about the Technologies group in the quarter.\nJason Aiken: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 0.9:1 for the company. Order activity was particularly strong in the Combat Systems group, which had a book-to-bill of 1.5x. We ended the quarter with total backlog of $89.8 billion, off 1.4% from the end of last year, but up 3% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at more than $128 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. It was another exceptional start to the year, with operating cash flow of $1.46 billion, representing 200% of net income. This very strong cash flow was heavily loaded in the last few weeks of the quarter. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a cash conversion rate of 178%. While we continue to enjoy strong cash performance in Aerospace & Technologies, the Combat Systems group, in particular, delivered outstanding free cash flow this quarter. As expected, the U.K. resumed payments on the AJAX program. This coupled with the ongoing progress payments on our other large international vehicle program drove the group's cash performance. This is consistent with our expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate in excess of 100%.  Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $161 million or 1.6% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to increase in subsequent quarters throughout the year. Also in the quarter, we paid $345 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 400,000 shares of stock for $90 million at just over $220 per share. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $2 billion and a net debt position of $8.5 billion, down nearly $800 million from year-end. As a reminder, we have $750 million of debt maturing in the second quarter and we are in a position to pay that down with the cash on hand following the receipts at the end of the first quarter.  Our net interest expense in the quarter was $91 million compared to $98 million last year. Benefiting from the debt repayment in the fourth quarter of 2022. Finally, we had a 17% effective tax rate in the quarter, consistent with our full year guidance.  Now turning to operating performance in Technologies. We're off to a solid start. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion was up 2.5% over the prior year, modestly ahead of our expectations for the start of the year. The measures implemented at Mission Systems to overcome what seems to be the new normal in the supply chain are taking effect, which gives us confidence about their outlook for the balance of the year. And GDIT had their highest quarterly revenue and earnings in 4 years as they continue to deliver on their year-over-year growth trajectory. Operating earnings of $299 million were consistent with last year, yielding a margin of 9.2%.  As we discussed in January, margins will continue to be driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volume. Backlog grew during the quarter with the group achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1 on strong order activity in IT services that included some important wins not yet factored into the backlog. This includes the Army's flight test school training support services contract valued at $1.7 billion. And Air Force IDIQ with a total potential value of $4.5 billion between 2 awardees for security support services, and a pair of IDIQ contracts with the EPA with a potential value of $380 million to support the agency's environmental and climate initiatives.  In fact, GDIT booked the highest orders they've seen since the second quarter of 2019. And their pipeline remains robust with $19 billion in submitted bids awaiting customer decision and another $84 billion in qualified opportunities identified.  Now let me turn it back to Phebe to review the other business segments.\nPhebe Novakovic: Thanks, Jason. Now I may review the quarter in the context of the other business segments and provide detailed color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace held its own in a very difficult operating environment. It had revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $229 million with a 12.1% operating margin. Revenue was $11 million less than last year's first quarter despite the delivery of 4 fewer aircraft. The fewer aircraft deliveries were almost completely offset by higher ball stream services, debt aviation volume and special missions work at Gulfstream. The 21 deliveries in the quarter are 3 fewer than planned, two 280s did not deliver because of late engine deliveries. The other plan, a large cabin for an international customer didn't deliver because of simple bureaucratic registration delays in the owner's country.  Importantly, this is the first quarter in which we have missed an airplane delivery as a result of supply chain issues. Up until now, we have managed to work around late to schedule parts delivery. Operating earnings of $229 million or $14 million behind last year's first quarter as a result of a 70 basis point degradation in operating margin. Operating margin in the quarter was under pressure as a result of fewer new airplane deliveries, a less attractive mix, severe supply chain issues, some modest cost increases from suppliers and the prebuild of G700. Let's take a look at some of these elements in greater detail.  The shortage of parts to schedule from the supply chain, especially from Honeywell has created significant out-of-station work, which is inherently less efficient. We have a young, well trained and capable workforce. They have, however, never previously been exposed out of station work. They are doing well. I am pleased to report, but it had an impact. The other impact of latest scheduled parts deliveries, apart from cost growth is that we cannot increase our build rate until the supply of parts is more predictable. The good news is that there is light at the end of the tunnel. We see the vast majority of this problem resolving early in the third quarter, but for 2 large suppliers who will take a little longer to resolve.  As most of you know, we plan to deliver a considerable number of G700s in the third and fourth quarters. To do that, we must build them now and incur some period costs without the related revenue. This has impacted the first quarter and will impact the second quarter, but relief is in sight as deliveries commence. Aerospace had a decent quarter from an order perspective with a book-to-bill of 0.9:1 in dollar terms and 1:1 in units. The quarter was looking quite good until the 2 regional bank failures in early March. This created a pause in the market for about 3 weeks. I am pleased to report that normal activity has resumed. Strong sales activity and customer interest is evident in this quarter. The U.S. has been strong and the Middle East as well. China remains slow. The G700 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. The aircraft design, manufacture and the overall program are very mature. We continue to target certification of the G700 for late summer this year.  Gulfstream remains committed to a safe and comprehensive certification test program. Production of customer G700 is well underway, and we are preparing for entry into service. We will deliver a mature, high-quality aircraft.  Looking forward to the next quarter, we expect to deliver 26 aircrafts with rapid increases in the third and fourth quarter deliveries, as we have previously indicated. In short, the Aerospace team did a good job under difficult circumstances.  Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $1.76 billion, up 4.8% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $245 million are up 7.9% and margins at 14% represent a 40 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter. So we saw a strong operating performance coupled with a nice revenue uptick. At Land Systems, Increased revenue came from the MPF ramp-up, Stryker SHORAD and new international vehicle programs for Poland and Australia. At European Land Systems, we had higher Parana volume and OTS enjoyed higher artillery program volume. So we saw increased revenue performance at each of the businesses. Here's a little additional color on Combat Systems revenue results. Foreign exchange fluctuations negatively impacted Combats revenue in the quarter due to the strength of the dollar versus the Canadian dollar, Euro and the British pound. But for the FX headwind, Combat Systems revenue growth would have been up 7.1% over the last year rather than the 4.8% we have just reported. We also experienced very strong order performance at Combat. Orders in the quarter are at their highest level in more than 8 years, evidencing the strong demand for munitions and international combat vehicles. There is clear upward pressure on our forecast for Combat Systems revenue and earnings in the year. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. As an aside, let me repeat a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter of '19. The first quarter of '21 was up 10.6% over '20 and first quarter 2022 was up 6.8% over '21. Finally, this quarter revenue of almost $3 billion is up 12.9% over 2022. This is an impressive growth ramp by any standard. This quarter's growth was led by Columbia class construction and engineering, DDG-51 construction and some T-AO volume. Operating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, exactly the same as a year ago, but with a 90 basis point decrement in operating margin. The primary driver of lower margins during the quarter was a charge on the Virginia program to reflect cost pressure within our supply chain and efficiency impacts at electric boat as a result of late material deliveries. This was partially offset by Colombia margin improvement.  Other modest margin impacts included an earnings decline at Bath as a result of a onetime pickup in the year ago quarter and cost inflation reimbursement that does not carry profits. Overall, earnings are what we expected, but revenue was higher, resulting in lower margins. We anticipate that this will improve as we progress through the year. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of the year. I would say, however, that our quarterly progression differs from prior years and that the second quarter will be our lowest quarter because of mix and volume across the business.  Nonetheless, we look forward to very strong third and fourth quarters. We will give you a comprehensive update at the end of next quarter as is our custom. This concludes my remarks with respect to what was a challenging but in many respects, rewarding quarter.\nHoward Rubel: Thanks, Phebe. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much, and good morning, everyone. Phebe, I wonder to ask a question about Marine and at the risk of asking the question that you just said that we never update guidance at this time of year. If you can just give us some color, given what we thought about revenue and margin at Marine coming in. The revenue is clearly much stronger in Q1, the margin weaker for the obvious reason of the Virginia charge. Can you help us from here in terms of how the Virginia contribution changes from Q1 going forward now that the charge is done? And it seems Columbia is maybe coming in stronger. And if I could tack on one follow-up, there's been a lot of talk about the Columbia schedule, both in congressional testimony, GAO reports, et cetera. If you can give us the latest update on how you view the schedule for Columbia.\nPhebe Novakovic: So we think that we plan to have Q1 as our lowest margin quarter. And we'll continue to work to that. Virginia is -- it will stabilize once we get the schedule and supply chain issues resolved. But at this point, it's some comment on electric boat to continue to do better to offset those costs. So with respect to revenue, there's clearly some upside pressure there, but we're going to hold any other additional comment for the moment.  So let's go to Colombia. And I think just the Navy has clearly articulated it -- firmly articulated that we are ahead of the contract schedule. The contract schedule is what matters. So let's put a little context on this. We are on the Colombia. We are 16 years into the 20-year lead ship schedule. I think within that context, it's indicative of the actions we have taken heretofore and those that we will continue to take to keep this program on schedule.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research.\nRobert Stallard: Phebe, I may be wrong, but it sounds like these supply chain issues in Q1 got worse. So I was wondering if you could comment on that. And also, what sort of mitigation plans you're putting in place to correct these problems?\nPhebe Novakovic: Specifically, are you talking about a particular group?\nRobert Stallard: Well, it seems like it's Aerospace and the Virginia-class submarine and marine.\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So with Aerospace, we have -- let's be clear, we have been dealing with supply chain issues for some time, and we've been able to manage through them. This quarter, we had 2 large suppliers get worse. We have, however, as I noted in my remarks, light at the end of the tunnel by our clear visibility in -- through our clear visibility into the third and fourth quarters where the majority of the supply chain improves. And we're working very hard with all suppliers, both in terms of teams and additional production help and to also encourage them to allocate the necessary resources in order to make their contracting schedules. So we are pretty comfortable that we can resolve these issues in the third and fourth quarter. But Gulfstream has done a magnificent job heretofore in even this quarter and managing through these challenges. With respect to the Virginia-class program, we have been talking about the supply chain challenges for some time. And as with all heavy manufacturing and labor-intensive manufacturing construction projects, manpower is a significant impact and the impact from the -- and the ramifications from the pandemic hit that supply chain pretty hard. We're beginning to see that remedy with the help of the Navy and a lot of support. So we'll continue to work with our supply chain and all elements of that supply chain as well as our customer who is very engaged to ensure that we can get that Virginia cadence back on schedule.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.\nDouglas Harned: Phebe, on -- when we're looking at the situation in Europe right now, I mean, 2 things seem to stand out to us with respect to Combat. One is, as you mentioned, the demand for munitions. But we've seen in the 2024 budget, there was actually a reduction in the budget for munitions, which we found somewhat surprising. How do you think about the trajectory there? And your ability to -- assuming we are going to see significant growth in munitions demand and your ability to ramp up production over time?\nPhebe Novakovic: We have been working very closely with DoD and the Army to ensure that we increase production and move...\nDouglas Harned: Hello?\nPhebe Novakovic: Hello, can you hear us?\nJason Aiken: Operator?\nOperator: He appears to have lost audio.\nJason Aiken: Okay. Are we still...\nPhebe Novakovic: Let me answer, Doug. Can the rest of the call here us?\nOperator: Yes, we are still live.\nPhebe Novakovic: Okay. So let me answer Doug's question. We've been working very closely with DoD and the Army to increase production and throughput. And we've done that in a couple of ways, upgrading existing facilities increasing the number of shifts and building new facilities with more modern equipment. So to, again, accelerate production, we have already done so and are quite confident in our ability to do even more.  So we are -- we've been receiving adequate and -- completely adequate funding to execute all of this. And we are quite confident that we will move throughput much quicker and will expedite the delivery of this critical capability to the Army.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird.\nPeter Arment: Phebe, thanks for the color on Gulfstream. Just on the overall demand kind of restrengthening in the quarter post the banks in the Middle East and certainly the U.S. Are you still seeing kind of broad interest across all the models? I know you've mentioned G650 in particular the last like 2 years has been very strong.\nPhebe Novakovic: Broad interest across all the models. We're doing quite well. Do you want to ask another question?\nPeter Arment: Yes, sure. No, I appreciate that. Just staying within Gulfstream. Just I know that you're not going to update kind of guidance, but I -- the deliveries that you missed this quarter, are they expected to recover in the second quarter? How are we thinking about that? Or is this all kind of second half related?\nPhebe Novakovic: We will resolve -- we expect to resolve all of the supply chain issues. And what you ought to think about is the third quarter and fourth quarter being quite robust. And I think what you're getting at is the deliveries that we expect to execute for the year at about 145. We're pretty confident we can get there. If we miss, it's just going to be by a little.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Wolfe Research.\nMyles Walton: Phebe, I was hoping you could talk to how you balance within Marine higher-priority national -- the national level of the Columbia class, which is under a lower financial risk cost plus contract versus the higher financial pressure, Virginia class which is under fixed price contract, but you might have to pull resources away and just how you're managing that from a financial risk perspective?\nPhebe Novakovic: So implicit in your question is the fact that Colombia enjoys a higher national rating in terms of urgency than Virginia. We had fully contemplated that with the U.S. Navy when we negotiated the most recent block of Virginia that was in concert timing wise with the Columbia negotiation. So we're working with the Navy to ensure that the language that we had incorporated into the Virginia contract to accommodate any such impacts on Virginia from a Columbia prioritization could be addressed. And the Navy has been working very closely with us. So we were mindful of that and have been for some time.\nMyles Walton: And so I guess just for a clarification, Phebe. Did the current financials reflect that assumption playing out? Or would there be a sort of equitable relief in the future if they agree with the position?\nPhebe Novakovic: I'm not going to speculate on how this will be addressed ultimately with our customer. But, this is more of a future issue rather than in the moment issue. That was not the primary driver of the quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.\nGeorge Shapiro: If you hadn't had the loss of 3 weeks from the bank failures, I assume then the book-to-bill would have been above 1 in the first quarter. And is that likely to continue then in the second quarter where you're saying we are seeing significant strength now?\nPhebe Novakovic: So our plan going before March 10, was that, in fact, we had anticipated a book-to-bill -- full book-to-bill of 1:1 on at that point, higher deliveries. So on a going-forward basis, it's our working assumption that we will continue to see 1:1. And at the moment, we see no reason why that can't be achieved.\nGeorge Shapiro: Okay. So the delivery expectations for next year would still be the same as what you had laid out before?\nPhebe Novakovic: We are holding to what we gave you in terms of out-year expectations for Aerospace.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair.\nLouie DiPalma: Is the lead Columbia approximately 1/3 complete now?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. And as a follow-up, you referenced supply chain headwinds with Virginia and Aerospace. Is the supply chain for Mission Systems improving at all?\nJason Aiken: It absolutely is. We saw a good trajectory and gaining some traction in the quarter. That's part of the reason why volume was up nicely in the quarter, and they seem to be on a good path to overcoming that bottleneck in their system. So gives us confidence for the opportunities we have in the second half of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley.\nKristine Liwag: Phebe, per new plans unveiled last month under the August pack, it looks like Australia could buy up to 5 Virginia-class submarines potentially in the early 2030s. So with the backlog now of 17 Virginia is delivering through 2032, how are you thinking about this opportunity? And what's the production capacity required to meet this demand?\nPhebe Novakovic: So we are working with our Navy customer to clarify timing and capacity and throughput. But at the moment, we have no particular insight, not really deferring to the Navy on and the timing and specificity of their long-range planning?\nKristine Liwag: And if I could sneak another one, maybe switching to combat. Look, it seems like the Army is pushing significantly to ramp artillery production, particularly the 155-millimeter shells and planning to double monthly production to about 24 per month by year-end. And then increasing production 6x over the next 5 years. How are you thinking about this opportunity? And again, do you see -- what do you need to do in order to meet this demand? Should it materialize? And are you seeing the orders come through?\nPhebe Novakovic: We have seen the orders come through. And we do not yet have out your clarity on the exact timing of the additional production, but we will see additional production. And because of the priority of the 155, I think the nation has learned a lot about 155 artillery shelf. So we've done a lot to increase production already, and we are quite confident that we can go even faster.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Akers from Wells Fargo.\nMatthew Akers: I wanted to ask kind of a high-level question on pilots for biz jet. On the commercial side, lack of kind of staffing with standing like pilots and crews has been kind of a pacing item. What's your sense for business jets or your customers kind of better off in that respect? Or could that potentially be a bottleneck for biz jet as well?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, I think during the height of COVID, there was so much disruption at all labor markets that we may have seen some issue then. But frankly, it didn't impact us. We're not seeing anything at the moment that is impacting our ability to fly, our customers' ability to fly or frankly, flying hours.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss from Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: The G700 is in there. Is software validation, the pacing item still? And if so, how far are the way through that are you?\nPhebe Novakovic: No, it is not. And we are in pretty good shape here with respect to our certification. And look, this is an extremely mature, safe and sophisticated aircraft. So we're working very closely with the FAA to ensure that they've got the proper resources here to execute the certification, but it is coming.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. A quick follow-up. Jason, you mentioned 8 resumptions of the AJAX payments. Can you update us on kind of the schedule for the liquidation there? How you expect that to play out and also on the Canada program?\nJason Aiken: Yes. So obviously, it was a positive development to see the payments resume here in the first quarter as we expected. The path forward with the customer is an ongoing discussion, we've worked through the revised schedule for the program. But some of the other particulars around milestone payments and progress on that schedule are still in the works. So it would be probably remiss of me to get out ahead of that.  In terms of the Canadian program, things are continuing to proceed well. That customer for the past 3-plus years has paid on time as per that schedule we negotiated. And so a couple more payments to come this year. And then really, what you can think about it is the entire arrears that we were dealing with some 2, 3 years ago will have been paid down and will be in a normal program cadence and schedule at that point, so by the end of this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets.\nKenneth Herbert: I just wanted to see -- I wanted to see if we could put a finer point on the Aerospace margins in the second quarter with supply chain issues and other timing around the certification and prebuild. Is it -- or second quarter margins expected to be similar to first quarter or was first quarter expected to be the trough for the year?\nPhebe Novakovic: I think you may need to think about the second quarter being our lowest quarter and then with a very steep and executable ramp-up in third -- third and fourth quarter, I tried to give you guys an awful lot of color in the remarks about the puts and takes on all the margins with respect to Aerospace. But we -- we'll get through the second quarter. And frankly, these first 2 quarters are aberrational in terms of Gulfstream margins, and then we ought to see nice pickup in third and fourth quarter.\nKenneth Herbert: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, just considering the roughly 100 aircraft implied in the guidance for the second half deliveries and the supply chain issues, are you having at this point to maybe look at second sources? Or is there anything else you're doing now? Obviously, it's very late in the game, but to maybe improve or do you further derisk the supply chain beyond just the execution?\nPhebe Novakovic: So we've been doing that for some time. As you all know, the supply chain on the Aerospace side has been taxed for quite a bit of time. So they were not taking any new actions that we haven't already executed, and we're just ramping up some of those actions as we -- in the first quarter and then as we go into the second.  But we have, as I said earlier, a very clear line of sight into the third and fourth quarters and the majority of these suppliers fully anticipate getting better. And we'll work with the remaining ones to ensure they've got the resources to execute the contract.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America.\nRonald Epstein: Maybe just a quick question, maybe 2. What are the synergies so far from merging the 2 businesses in kind of mission Tech? How has that gone?\nJason Aiken: So keep in mind, Ron, when we talk about merging those businesses, they still remain 2 independent and stand-alone operating units within our model. So not really anything to think about from a cost synergy perspective, I think the way to think about that is more of a revenue synergy point of view in that what we talked about is -- those 2 businesses are seeing a real convergence on a number of fronts within their markets, what their customers are interested in procuring in terms of end-to-end solutions that include the IT service side, software solutions as well as hardware as well as where their competitors are going in the market to address those demands.  So bringing those 2 businesses together has put us on a good footing to address that market and those demands. And that's what we're seeing, and you're seeing that in the positive order performance in the quarter and book-to-bill, capture rates, win rates and so on. So all of that gives us good confidence in terms of the trajectory of the outlook that we see for each of those businesses.\nRonald Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then maybe just one quick follow-on. How much of the free cash flow in the quarter can be attributed to AJAX?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So we have factored the net of payments to the supply chain, which has been very patient through this whole period into our estimates for the year.\nJason Aiken: Yes. So I want to make sure I understood your question correctly. It was a roughly GBP 480 million payment that was received. And to Phebe's point, that the net impact of that after paying out supply chain elements on the program, all of that's factored into the outlook that we have for the year. So that 105-ish percent conversion rate for the year that we talked about is now intact and all that much more certain based on the activity in the first quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global.\nPeter Skibitski: The issues on the Virginia supply chain, it seems like it's been a little bit of a black box. So just -- I was wondering if I can get more detail. Does it relate to multiple suppliers? And can you give us a sense of what parts are involved? And then are we feeling good that as the mix shifts to the Block 5 that margins will improve there?\nPhebe Novakovic: So it's multiple suppliers, some large and some small. And we have, again, continued to work with the Navy to address the challenges that they all have faced. And even though you have different sized businesses, many of them have been confronted with the same labor dysfunctions that we saw coming out of COVID. The Navy has been providing as well as the Congress been and providing funding to address some of the challenges within the industry -- some Marine industrial base, and we're hopeful that over time, that will resolve.  And we'll continue to see, I believe, improvement as we get into Block 5 and the supply chain stabilizes, but we've got ways to go there. And I think importantly, and this is the way we certainly think about it, Electric Boat just has to get better and faster to overcome any unexpected additional future supply chain challenges that may hit us. But we're not going to get into listing parts. This is an enormous supply chain. You can imagine with thousands of suppliers all over the nation.\nPeter Skibitski: That's fair. And kind of one follow-up Phebe. How is the -- how are you judging the pace of hiring and the labor risk kind of through the midterm at EB, just given the kind of the huge increases in volume that are required there?\nPhebe Novakovic: So again, coming out of COVID, I think we all felt a little bit of the labor constraint. But one of the reasons that we saw increased revenue in this quarter was extremely strong throughput coming out of as a result of robust hiring that they have executed and the training of those workers so that they hit the ground running, and we're able to have additional -- execute additional throughput up at So we consider that a good bellwether for our ability to continue to hire to meet our needs.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn from Melius Research.\nRobert Spingarn: Phebe, Combat has been discussed throughout the call, but just a couple of quick things. Would you -- is it fair to assume that the book-to-bill will continue to be above 1 for this year and beyond, just given the strength? And then the second part of this is, as armament munition sales grow will they be margin accretive or dilutive to the overall segment?\nPhebe Novakovic: So when you look at historically Combat orders, they tend to be pretty lumpy. I think the important way to think about it is the underlying credit could exist, let's say, it is an increasingly insecure and threat-driven environment, and that will drive additional orders, when those execute, will be a little bit lumpy, but we have -- we expect to see a continued demand, including on the munition side. But we have planned in -- for our plan this year, we've executed, we've anticipated margins that are pretty consistent with what they've been doing. It's just executing, operating, ensuring that we've got operating leverage, including on these new facilities that we're putting in place. But recall, this is a group that has extremely strong operating leverage and based on their efficiency and blocking and tackling on the shop floor. So we'll expect to see margins continue.\nHoward Rubel: And operator, we'll take this one last question, please, and then we'll wrap up the call.\nOperator: Certainly, your final question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. So Phebe, I'm still a little confused about your statement that Q2 earnings should be the lowest because pretty clearly, it looks like Marine should be better absent the VCM charge. Combat usually is a little better. GDIT is stable. And you've highlighted Aerospace, but the volume is going to be higher than it was in the first quarter. Margins given where the volume was actually looked pretty good in the first quarter. So it would seem to imply a pretty steep drop-off in margins. Could you give us some color in terms of what is creating that situation? And is that something we should be worried about will continue in the third and fourth quarter?\nPhebe Novakovic: I tried to be pretty clear that we do not anticipate any -- at Gulfstream, the margin performance in these 2 first quarters replicating in third and fourth quarter. In fact, we see a fairly strong ramp to increase margins. These margins are aberrational and we do expect some additional perturbations on the supply chain and out of station work Gulfstream as well as mix issues.  With respect to Marine systems, it's material timing between first and second quarters. And in technologies, it's transitioned from mature programs that are winding down and being replaced by some follow-on new starts. So in each one of these groups, we are seeing a convergence of in the quarter, particularly lower margins and lower earnings and sales than we typically see. We usually have a steady build through the year. This is rather, as I said, aberrational, but we'll get through this. And importantly, we don't see these issues leading into third and fourth quarter, we anticipate a very strong third and fourth quarter, and that is unchanged.\nHoward Rubel: Thank you for joining our call today. And as a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the first quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3117.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jason Aiken",
            "content": "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 0.9:1 for the company. Order activity was particularly strong in the Combat Systems group, which had a book-to-bill of 1.5x. We ended the quarter with total backlog of $89.8 billion, off 1.4% from the end of last year, but up 3% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at more than $128 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. It was another exceptional start to the year, with operating cash flow of $1.46 billion, representing 200% of net income. This very strong cash flow was heavily loaded in the last few weeks of the quarter. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow for the quarter was $1.3 billion, a cash conversion rate of 178%. While we continue to enjoy strong cash performance in Aerospace & Technologies, the Combat Systems group, in particular, delivered outstanding free cash flow this quarter. As expected, the U.K. resumed payments on the AJAX program. This coupled with the ongoing progress payments on our other large international vehicle program drove the group's cash performance. This is consistent with our expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate in excess of 100%.  Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $161 million or 1.6% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to increase in subsequent quarters throughout the year. Also in the quarter, we paid $345 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 400,000 shares of stock for $90 million at just over $220 per share. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $2 billion and a net debt position of $8.5 billion, down nearly $800 million from year-end. As a reminder, we have $750 million of debt maturing in the second quarter and we are in a position to pay that down with the cash on hand following the receipts at the end of the first quarter.  Our net interest expense in the quarter was $91 million compared to $98 million last year. Benefiting from the debt repayment in the fourth quarter of 2022. Finally, we had a 17% effective tax rate in the quarter, consistent with our full year guidance.  Now turning to operating performance in Technologies. We're off to a solid start. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion was up 2.5% over the prior year, modestly ahead of our expectations for the start of the year. The measures implemented at Mission Systems to overcome what seems to be the new normal in the supply chain are taking effect, which gives us confidence about their outlook for the balance of the year. And GDIT had their highest quarterly revenue and earnings in 4 years as they continue to deliver on their year-over-year growth trajectory. Operating earnings of $299 million were consistent with last year, yielding a margin of 9.2%.  As we discussed in January, margins will continue to be driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volume. Backlog grew during the quarter with the group achieving a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1 on strong order activity in IT services that included some important wins not yet factored into the backlog. This includes the Army's flight test school training support services contract valued at $1.7 billion. And Air Force IDIQ with a total potential value of $4.5 billion between 2 awardees for security support services, and a pair of IDIQ contracts with the EPA with a potential value of $380 million to support the agency's environmental and climate initiatives.  In fact, GDIT booked the highest orders they've seen since the second quarter of 2019. And their pipeline remains robust with $19 billion in submitted bids awaiting customer decision and another $84 billion in qualified opportunities identified.  Now let me turn it back to Phebe to review the other business segments. Operator? Okay. Are we still... It absolutely is. We saw a good trajectory and gaining some traction in the quarter. That's part of the reason why volume was up nicely in the quarter, and they seem to be on a good path to overcoming that bottleneck in their system. So gives us confidence for the opportunities we have in the second half of the year. Yes. So obviously, it was a positive development to see the payments resume here in the first quarter as we expected. The path forward with the customer is an ongoing discussion, we've worked through the revised schedule for the program. But some of the other particulars around milestone payments and progress on that schedule are still in the works. So it would be probably remiss of me to get out ahead of that.  In terms of the Canadian program, things are continuing to proceed well. That customer for the past 3-plus years has paid on time as per that schedule we negotiated. And so a couple more payments to come this year. And then really, what you can think about it is the entire arrears that we were dealing with some 2, 3 years ago will have been paid down and will be in a normal program cadence and schedule at that point, so by the end of this year. So keep in mind, Ron, when we talk about merging those businesses, they still remain 2 independent and stand-alone operating units within our model. So not really anything to think about from a cost synergy perspective, I think the way to think about that is more of a revenue synergy point of view in that what we talked about is -- those 2 businesses are seeing a real convergence on a number of fronts within their markets, what their customers are interested in procuring in terms of end-to-end solutions that include the IT service side, software solutions as well as hardware as well as where their competitors are going in the market to address those demands.  So bringing those 2 businesses together has put us on a good footing to address that market and those demands. And that's what we're seeing, and you're seeing that in the positive order performance in the quarter and book-to-bill, capture rates, win rates and so on. So all of that gives us good confidence in terms of the trajectory of the outlook that we see for each of those businesses. Yes. So I want to make sure I understood your question correctly. It was a roughly GBP 480 million payment that was received. And to Phebe's point, that the net impact of that after paying out supply chain elements on the program, all of that's factored into the outlook that we have for the year. So that 105-ish percent conversion rate for the year that we talked about is now intact and all that much more certain based on the activity in the first quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Howard. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.64 per diluted share on revenue of $9.9 billion, operating earnings of $938 million and net earnings of $730 million. Revenue is up $489 million or 5.2% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up $30 million and net earnings are flat against the year ago quarter. This increase in operating earnings was offset by a $31 million increase in the tax provision.  Recall that the first quarter 2022 tax provision was only 14%. Nevertheless, earnings per share are up $0.03 as a result of the stronger operating earnings and a lower share count. The operating margin for the entire company was 9.5%, 20 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This reflected lower operating margins in Aerospace and Marine, which I will address in some detail later in these remarks. Revenue was $489 million better than first quarter '22. All of the defense units were up and Aerospace down slightly, less than 1% on fewer aircraft deliveries. We beat consensus by $0.05 per share. We have roughly $550 million more in revenue than anticipated by the sell side and lower-than-anticipated margins, leading to operating earnings basically consistent with expectations. The earnings per share beat was largely attributable to below the line items.  As Jason will amplify, cash from operating activities and cash after CapEx was very strong. This is particularly impressive following a very strong cash performance in '22 and not at all typical for us in the first quarter. Obviously, we were off to a very good start from a cash perspective. This is an important respects, a strong quarter, a good foundation for the year, subject to some supply chain issues that I will try to eliminate as we discuss the business segments.  At this point, let me ask Jason to provide detail on our order activity, solid backlog and very strong cash performance as well as commentary about the Technologies group in the quarter. Thanks, Jason. Now I may review the quarter in the context of the other business segments and provide detailed color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace held its own in a very difficult operating environment. It had revenue of $1.9 billion and operating earnings of $229 million with a 12.1% operating margin. Revenue was $11 million less than last year's first quarter despite the delivery of 4 fewer aircraft. The fewer aircraft deliveries were almost completely offset by higher ball stream services, debt aviation volume and special missions work at Gulfstream. The 21 deliveries in the quarter are 3 fewer than planned, two 280s did not deliver because of late engine deliveries. The other plan, a large cabin for an international customer didn't deliver because of simple bureaucratic registration delays in the owner's country.  Importantly, this is the first quarter in which we have missed an airplane delivery as a result of supply chain issues. Up until now, we have managed to work around late to schedule parts delivery. Operating earnings of $229 million or $14 million behind last year's first quarter as a result of a 70 basis point degradation in operating margin. Operating margin in the quarter was under pressure as a result of fewer new airplane deliveries, a less attractive mix, severe supply chain issues, some modest cost increases from suppliers and the prebuild of G700. Let's take a look at some of these elements in greater detail.  The shortage of parts to schedule from the supply chain, especially from Honeywell has created significant out-of-station work, which is inherently less efficient. We have a young, well trained and capable workforce. They have, however, never previously been exposed out of station work. They are doing well. I am pleased to report, but it had an impact. The other impact of latest scheduled parts deliveries, apart from cost growth is that we cannot increase our build rate until the supply of parts is more predictable. The good news is that there is light at the end of the tunnel. We see the vast majority of this problem resolving early in the third quarter, but for 2 large suppliers who will take a little longer to resolve.  As most of you know, we plan to deliver a considerable number of G700s in the third and fourth quarters. To do that, we must build them now and incur some period costs without the related revenue. This has impacted the first quarter and will impact the second quarter, but relief is in sight as deliveries commence. Aerospace had a decent quarter from an order perspective with a book-to-bill of 0.9:1 in dollar terms and 1:1 in units. The quarter was looking quite good until the 2 regional bank failures in early March. This created a pause in the market for about 3 weeks. I am pleased to report that normal activity has resumed. Strong sales activity and customer interest is evident in this quarter. The U.S. has been strong and the Middle East as well. China remains slow. The G700 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. The aircraft design, manufacture and the overall program are very mature. We continue to target certification of the G700 for late summer this year.  Gulfstream remains committed to a safe and comprehensive certification test program. Production of customer G700 is well underway, and we are preparing for entry into service. We will deliver a mature, high-quality aircraft.  Looking forward to the next quarter, we expect to deliver 26 aircrafts with rapid increases in the third and fourth quarter deliveries, as we have previously indicated. In short, the Aerospace team did a good job under difficult circumstances.  Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $1.76 billion, up 4.8% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $245 million are up 7.9% and margins at 14% represent a 40 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter. So we saw a strong operating performance coupled with a nice revenue uptick. At Land Systems, Increased revenue came from the MPF ramp-up, Stryker SHORAD and new international vehicle programs for Poland and Australia. At European Land Systems, we had higher Parana volume and OTS enjoyed higher artillery program volume. So we saw increased revenue performance at each of the businesses. Here's a little additional color on Combat Systems revenue results. Foreign exchange fluctuations negatively impacted Combats revenue in the quarter due to the strength of the dollar versus the Canadian dollar, Euro and the British pound. But for the FX headwind, Combat Systems revenue growth would have been up 7.1% over the last year rather than the 4.8% we have just reported. We also experienced very strong order performance at Combat. Orders in the quarter are at their highest level in more than 8 years, evidencing the strong demand for munitions and international combat vehicles. There is clear upward pressure on our forecast for Combat Systems revenue and earnings in the year. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. As an aside, let me repeat a little recent history. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against the first quarter of '19. The first quarter of '21 was up 10.6% over '20 and first quarter 2022 was up 6.8% over '21. Finally, this quarter revenue of almost $3 billion is up 12.9% over 2022. This is an impressive growth ramp by any standard. This quarter's growth was led by Columbia class construction and engineering, DDG-51 construction and some T-AO volume. Operating earnings are $211 million in the quarter, exactly the same as a year ago, but with a 90 basis point decrement in operating margin. The primary driver of lower margins during the quarter was a charge on the Virginia program to reflect cost pressure within our supply chain and efficiency impacts at electric boat as a result of late material deliveries. This was partially offset by Colombia margin improvement.  Other modest margin impacts included an earnings decline at Bath as a result of a onetime pickup in the year ago quarter and cost inflation reimbursement that does not carry profits. Overall, earnings are what we expected, but revenue was higher, resulting in lower margins. We anticipate that this will improve as we progress through the year. As you know, we never update guidance at this time of the year. I would say, however, that our quarterly progression differs from prior years and that the second quarter will be our lowest quarter because of mix and volume across the business.  Nonetheless, we look forward to very strong third and fourth quarters. We will give you a comprehensive update at the end of next quarter as is our custom. This concludes my remarks with respect to what was a challenging but in many respects, rewarding quarter. So we think that we plan to have Q1 as our lowest margin quarter. And we'll continue to work to that. Virginia is -- it will stabilize once we get the schedule and supply chain issues resolved. But at this point, it's some comment on electric boat to continue to do better to offset those costs. So with respect to revenue, there's clearly some upside pressure there, but we're going to hold any other additional comment for the moment.  So let's go to Colombia. And I think just the Navy has clearly articulated it -- firmly articulated that we are ahead of the contract schedule. The contract schedule is what matters. So let's put a little context on this. We are on the Colombia. We are 16 years into the 20-year lead ship schedule. I think within that context, it's indicative of the actions we have taken heretofore and those that we will continue to take to keep this program on schedule. Specifically, are you talking about a particular group? Yes. So with Aerospace, we have -- let's be clear, we have been dealing with supply chain issues for some time, and we've been able to manage through them. This quarter, we had 2 large suppliers get worse. We have, however, as I noted in my remarks, light at the end of the tunnel by our clear visibility in -- through our clear visibility into the third and fourth quarters where the majority of the supply chain improves. And we're working very hard with all suppliers, both in terms of teams and additional production help and to also encourage them to allocate the necessary resources in order to make their contracting schedules. So we are pretty comfortable that we can resolve these issues in the third and fourth quarter. But Gulfstream has done a magnificent job heretofore in even this quarter and managing through these challenges. With respect to the Virginia-class program, we have been talking about the supply chain challenges for some time. And as with all heavy manufacturing and labor-intensive manufacturing construction projects, manpower is a significant impact and the impact from the -- and the ramifications from the pandemic hit that supply chain pretty hard. We're beginning to see that remedy with the help of the Navy and a lot of support. So we'll continue to work with our supply chain and all elements of that supply chain as well as our customer who is very engaged to ensure that we can get that Virginia cadence back on schedule. We have been working very closely with DoD and the Army to ensure that we increase production and move... Hello, can you hear us? Let me answer, Doug. Can the rest of the call here us? Okay. So let me answer Doug's question. We've been working very closely with DoD and the Army to increase production and throughput. And we've done that in a couple of ways, upgrading existing facilities increasing the number of shifts and building new facilities with more modern equipment. So to, again, accelerate production, we have already done so and are quite confident in our ability to do even more.  So we are -- we've been receiving adequate and -- completely adequate funding to execute all of this. And we are quite confident that we will move throughput much quicker and will expedite the delivery of this critical capability to the Army. Broad interest across all the models. We're doing quite well. Do you want to ask another question? We will resolve -- we expect to resolve all of the supply chain issues. And what you ought to think about is the third quarter and fourth quarter being quite robust. And I think what you're getting at is the deliveries that we expect to execute for the year at about 145. We're pretty confident we can get there. If we miss, it's just going to be by a little. So implicit in your question is the fact that Colombia enjoys a higher national rating in terms of urgency than Virginia. We had fully contemplated that with the U.S. Navy when we negotiated the most recent block of Virginia that was in concert timing wise with the Columbia negotiation. So we're working with the Navy to ensure that the language that we had incorporated into the Virginia contract to accommodate any such impacts on Virginia from a Columbia prioritization could be addressed. And the Navy has been working very closely with us. So we were mindful of that and have been for some time. I'm not going to speculate on how this will be addressed ultimately with our customer. But, this is more of a future issue rather than in the moment issue. That was not the primary driver of the quarter. So our plan going before March 10, was that, in fact, we had anticipated a book-to-bill -- full book-to-bill of 1:1 on at that point, higher deliveries. So on a going-forward basis, it's our working assumption that we will continue to see 1:1. And at the moment, we see no reason why that can't be achieved. We are holding to what we gave you in terms of out-year expectations for Aerospace. Yes. So we are working with our Navy customer to clarify timing and capacity and throughput. But at the moment, we have no particular insight, not really deferring to the Navy on and the timing and specificity of their long-range planning? We have seen the orders come through. And we do not yet have out your clarity on the exact timing of the additional production, but we will see additional production. And because of the priority of the 155, I think the nation has learned a lot about 155 artillery shelf. So we've done a lot to increase production already, and we are quite confident that we can go even faster. Well, I think during the height of COVID, there was so much disruption at all labor markets that we may have seen some issue then. But frankly, it didn't impact us. We're not seeing anything at the moment that is impacting our ability to fly, our customers' ability to fly or frankly, flying hours. No, it is not. And we are in pretty good shape here with respect to our certification. And look, this is an extremely mature, safe and sophisticated aircraft. So we're working very closely with the FAA to ensure that they've got the proper resources here to execute the certification, but it is coming. I think you may need to think about the second quarter being our lowest quarter and then with a very steep and executable ramp-up in third -- third and fourth quarter, I tried to give you guys an awful lot of color in the remarks about the puts and takes on all the margins with respect to Aerospace. But we -- we'll get through the second quarter. And frankly, these first 2 quarters are aberrational in terms of Gulfstream margins, and then we ought to see nice pickup in third and fourth quarter. So we've been doing that for some time. As you all know, the supply chain on the Aerospace side has been taxed for quite a bit of time. So they were not taking any new actions that we haven't already executed, and we're just ramping up some of those actions as we -- in the first quarter and then as we go into the second.  But we have, as I said earlier, a very clear line of sight into the third and fourth quarters and the majority of these suppliers fully anticipate getting better. And we'll work with the remaining ones to ensure they've got the resources to execute the contract. Yes. So we have factored the net of payments to the supply chain, which has been very patient through this whole period into our estimates for the year. So it's multiple suppliers, some large and some small. And we have, again, continued to work with the Navy to address the challenges that they all have faced. And even though you have different sized businesses, many of them have been confronted with the same labor dysfunctions that we saw coming out of COVID. The Navy has been providing as well as the Congress been and providing funding to address some of the challenges within the industry -- some Marine industrial base, and we're hopeful that over time, that will resolve.  And we'll continue to see, I believe, improvement as we get into Block 5 and the supply chain stabilizes, but we've got ways to go there. And I think importantly, and this is the way we certainly think about it, Electric Boat just has to get better and faster to overcome any unexpected additional future supply chain challenges that may hit us. But we're not going to get into listing parts. This is an enormous supply chain. You can imagine with thousands of suppliers all over the nation. So again, coming out of COVID, I think we all felt a little bit of the labor constraint. But one of the reasons that we saw increased revenue in this quarter was extremely strong throughput coming out of as a result of robust hiring that they have executed and the training of those workers so that they hit the ground running, and we're able to have additional -- execute additional throughput up at So we consider that a good bellwether for our ability to continue to hire to meet our needs. So when you look at historically Combat orders, they tend to be pretty lumpy. I think the important way to think about it is the underlying credit could exist, let's say, it is an increasingly insecure and threat-driven environment, and that will drive additional orders, when those execute, will be a little bit lumpy, but we have -- we expect to see a continued demand, including on the munition side. But we have planned in -- for our plan this year, we've executed, we've anticipated margins that are pretty consistent with what they've been doing. It's just executing, operating, ensuring that we've got operating leverage, including on these new facilities that we're putting in place. But recall, this is a group that has extremely strong operating leverage and based on their efficiency and blocking and tackling on the shop floor. So we'll expect to see margins continue. I tried to be pretty clear that we do not anticipate any -- at Gulfstream, the margin performance in these 2 first quarters replicating in third and fourth quarter. In fact, we see a fairly strong ramp to increase margins. These margins are aberrational and we do expect some additional perturbations on the supply chain and out of station work Gulfstream as well as mix issues.  With respect to Marine systems, it's material timing between first and second quarters. And in technologies, it's transitioned from mature programs that are winding down and being replaced by some follow-on new starts. So in each one of these groups, we are seeing a convergence of in the quarter, particularly lower margins and lower earnings and sales than we typically see. We usually have a steady build through the year. This is rather, as I said, aberrational, but we'll get through this. And importantly, we don't see these issues leading into third and fourth quarter, we anticipate a very strong third and fourth quarter, and that is unchanged."

Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning we have reported earnings of $3.35 per diluted share on revenue over 11.67 billion, operating earnings of 1.18 billion and net income of 930 million. Across the company revenue increased 1.1 billion, a strong 10.4% led by a 22% increase from our Aerospace segment and a 20% increase in Marine Systems. We enjoyed revenue increases at three of our four business segments compared to the year ago quarter, only Combat Systems is flat. This is strong growth by any reasonable standard. Importantly operating earnings of 1.18 billion are up 124 million or 11.7%. Similarly, net earnings increased 94 million or 11.2% and earnings per share are up $0.31 or 10.2% over the year ago quarter. When earnings are up at a greater rate than revenue in a growth environment, the business is demonstrating solid operating leverage. We are doing just that. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $34.4 billion is up $3.77 billion or 12.3% over last year. Operating earnings of $3.37 billion are up 14.1%. Net earnings of $2.63 billion are up 14% despite a higher tax rate. Nevertheless, we mistreat EPS consensus by a fair amount because we were able to deliver only four G700s in the quarter. So without further ado, let me move right into aerospace and give you as much insight into this issue as I can, and its implications for the remainder of the year. At the outset, let me give you some comparative numbers that are quite good despite the shortfall of anticipated G700 delivery. Then I will put all of this in some reasonable context for you. Aerospace had revenue of $2.48 billion and operating earnings of $305 million with a 12.3% operating margin. Revenue is $450 million more than last year's third quarter, a solid 22% increase. The revenue increase was driven by the four G700 deliveries, higher service center and special missions volume, and higher FBO and MRO volume, particularly in the Asia Pacific region at Jet Aviation. We delivered 28 aircrafts, including four G700s this quarter. This is 11 fewer G700s than we expected to deliver. We also delivered one less G600, G500 and G280 than we did a year ago quarter. The deliveries of these aircraft are at a reasonably steady state and the modest shortfall is a typical variance, having to do largely with timing and customer convenience. Operating earnings of $305 million are up $37 million or 13.8% over the year ago quarter. The 12.3% operating margin was 90 basis points lower than the year ago quarter for a host of reasons, including inefficiencies caused by supply chain deficiencies. So despite a very good quarter, we had planned to do better and sell side consensus reflected our expectations. You might recall that I told you we expected to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year and that the deliveries would be more or less evenly divided over the last three quarters of the year. While we planned 15 for Q2 and delivered 11, we planned 15 to 16 for Q3 and delivered four. Three weeks before the end of the quarter, we still had a reasonable belief that we would deliver at least 11 in the quarter. So what happened? Whenever we miss our forecast so badly, it is almost always for a number of reasons that all play a part, so let me identify the most important and impactful ones. First, due to the timing of engine certification, aircraft engines arrived late to schedule. We painted the aircraft before the engines arrived and then painted and installed the engines. This led to a significant amount of repaint that resulted in increased cost and time spent. Second, many of the aircraft planned for delivery in this quarter have highly customized interiors. First of tight intricacies. These intricacies are considered to be major changes for regulatory purposes. This resulted in longer-than-anticipated efforts to finalize and achieve supplemental-type certificates. Related to this, the size and complexity of the G700 cabins has also elongated the customer reviews during final delivery of these planes. Third and maybe most important, late in the quarter, a supplier quality escape on a specific component caused the exchange of several components on each planned aircraft delivery up to 16 per aircraft. The supplier is fully cooperative and is providing components for all our needs, but this rework has increased the number of test flights necessary to obtain the final certificate of airworthiness for each aircraft. So the removal and replacement of these components has impacted labor costs and schedule adversely. We are nonetheless working our way nicely through this problem with the cooperation of the vendor. Finally, if that wasn't enough, we lost four days of productivity as a result of Hurricane Helene. Several customers who were in Savannah working with us to accept delivery left and went home to avoid the storm. So given that there is always risk and precise estimates, I will describe our delivery cadence a bit later and provide some monthly forecast so that you can monitor the quarter from publicly available data. Alright, back to some good numerical comparisons. For the year-to-date, aerospace revenue is up $1.63 billion, an increase of 27.7%. Operating earnings were up $146 million, an increase of almost 20%. I recite these figures, which will reflect even more growth by the end of the year so that we do not get lost in the third quarter delivery issue. This is still eye-watering growth. So what impact should we now expect for the fourth quarter and the year given the fewer-than-planned G700 deliveries in the second quarter and third quarters. You may recall that we expected to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year, we now expect to deliver around 42 for the year with 27 in the fourth quarter. This number is not without risk, but there's also some opportunity to bring planes forward. The real issue here is supply chain support during this critical period. Let me give you some insight into the sequencing of the 27 planned deliveries in the quarter. We anticipate five in October, nine in November and 13 in December, recognizing there is some risk as these numbers could vary a little bit up or down through the quarter. You can, as I have said, follow this with fairly accurate but not perfect publicly available data. Turning to market demand, the interest level of buyers and the expiration of accelerated depreciation at year's end suggests a reasonably strong order intake in the fourth quarter, and that is what we are seeing. After some slowing in the U.S. during the second and third quarters, we are seeing improved interest across all models in the fourth quarter. Europe and Middle East activity is quite strong, but current activity in Southeast Asia and China has slowed. Interestingly, the overall number of prospects in all areas continues to increase. The overall number of prospects in our pipeline is at an all-time high, with the most active models being the G500, G600 and G700. We have a good cross-section of U.S. businesses in this mix. In summary, the Aerospace team had a very good quarter, albeit disappointing from the perspective of G700 deliveries. We look forward to a strong finish to the year in the fourth quarter but will fall somewhat short of our midyear forecast. So let's move on to the defense businesses. As a collective, we once again saw strong growth and good operating performance across the portfolio. I may walk you through each segment in turn. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems had revenue of $2.2 billion for the quarter, similar to a year ago. Earnings of $325 million are up 8.3% and margins at 14.7% represents a 120 basis point increase over Q3 last year. Each of the businesses increased earnings with particularly strong operating leverage in munitions and customer service businesses. On a sequential basis, while revenue decreased 3%, earnings rose almost 4%. Year-to-date, revenue of $6.6 billion is up almost 12% and earnings of $920 million are up $124 million or almost 16%. Combat saw robust order activity over $3.3 billion awarded in Q3, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.5:1 for the quarter. Orders came from across the portfolio with notable orders in munitions and near defense vehicles for the U.S. Army. Overall, demand remains solid across Combat, particularly in our ordinance and international combat vehicle businesses. In the U.S., we are increasing production of 155-millimeter ammunition projectiles as well as expanding our support to the U.S. Army across several other areas, including final loading and assembly of artillery. Our Combat Systems backlog at roughly $18 billion reflects the strong demand. All in all, a strong performance quarter for Combat. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating strong revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.6 billion is up $597 million, 20% against the year ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume as well as Virginia-class volume drove the growth. DDG-51 revenue also increased somewhat. Just to put this in some context, this 20% growth follows 15% growth in Q4 2023, 11% growth in Q1 of 2024, and 13% growth in Q2 of 2024, impressive growth by any standard. Operating earnings are $258 million, up $47 million over the year ago quarter, with a 20 basis point increase in operating margin. However, margins continue to be adversely affected by additional delays from the submarine industrial base, partially offset by improved margin performance at NASCO. Sequentially, revenue increased 4.2% and earnings improved 5.3% in Q3 driven by volume at EB. Year-to-date, marine revenue of $10.4 billion is up 14.7% and earnings of $735 million are up 12%. So across the business, we have seen rapid growth of revenue and earnings but stagnant margin performance. As I noted last quarter, although the supply chain is improving in places, EB continues to be severely impacted by late deliveries from major component suppliers, which has delayed schedule and is continuing to impact cost. Our out-of-sequence work on modules weighing thousands of tons is time-consuming and therefore, expensive, sometimes up to eight times the cost of in-sequence work. The operating metrics tell us that we have, in fact, increased our productivity to somewhat offset cost. As I noted last quarter, throughput, a significant measure of productivity continues to improve. And while we will continue to work on improved productivity, there is no point hurting portions of the boat only to have to stop and wait increasingly extended periods of time for major components to arrive. It is not good for the bulk over time nor cost. Given the recent projections from the supply chain on deliveries, we need to get our cadence in sync with the supply chain and take costs out of the business if we are to hope to see incremental margin growth. Put another way, the supply chain is not getting better at a fast enough rate as we had hoped. Through our internal efficiency, we have now outpaced them. This is the reality of the post COVID environment for many of our most important suppliers. Finally, to be clear, current submarine delivery projections are not incrementally impacted since they already reflect the anticipated delays from the supply chain. We will, of course, carefully monitor supply chain performance and accelerate our work should their deliveries to us improve. And lastly, technologies. It was another strong quarter with revenue of almost $3.4 billion, which is up 2% over the prior year. Operating earnings in the quarter were $326 million, up 3.5% on a margin of 9.7%. That is a 20 basis point improvement year-over-year. The year-to-date comparisons are similar. Revenue at $9.9 billion is up 1.2%, but earnings of $941 million are up almost 5% on a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin. The growth for this quarter and the first nine months was driven by GDIT's investments in their digital accelerators. Mission Systems was flat year-over-year as they continue to transition from legacy programs to new franchises. Strong operating performance across the group more than offset the relative growth in services of GDIT compared to hardware at Mission Systems. Sequentially, the group grew 2.5%, spread relatively evenly over both businesses with margins steady at 9.7%. Order activity was particularly strong in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1, that resulted in backlog at the end of the quarter of $14.4 billion, up 13.5% from the year ago quarter. Through the first nine months, the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2:1 more than keeping pace with the strong revenue growth across the business. GDIT and Mission Systems have shared in the robust order activity so far this year, demonstrating the strength of this portfolio and prospects remain strong with a large qualified funnel of more than $120 billion in opportunities they are pursuing across the group. That concludes my comments about the defense businesses. Let me now turn the call over to our CFO, Kim Kuryea, and then we'll wrap up with our guidance for the remainder of the year.\nKimberly A. Kuryea: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 for the company. This is particularly impressive with the continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. Combat Systems and Technologies led the way with book-to-bill of 1.5 times and 1.3 times, respectively. This order activity led to our backlog increasing to $92.6 billion at the end of the quarter. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at a record level of $137.6 billion. Moving to our cash performance, this was another good story in the quarter. Cash flow improved as anticipated over the prior two quarters. We produced $1.4 billion of operating cash flow. All segments contributed to the results with particularly strong cash generation in technologies. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.2 billion for the quarter, or 131% of net income. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting free cash flow to again be greater than 100% of net income, but we now expect the full year to fall short of our 100% conversion target as G700 deliveries pushed into 2025. As a reminder, total free cash flow generation between 2021 and 2023 was quite strong with a three-year conversion rate of 107%. Looking at capital deployment, capital expenditures were $201 million in the quarter or 1.7% of sales. We're still targeting to be around 2% of sales for the full year given the commitments that remain. We paid $390 million in dividends and repurchased a little over 150,000 shares of stock for $44 million during the quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $2.1 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $7.2 billion, down over $700 million from last quarter. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million of fixed rate notes maturing in the fourth quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Net interest expense in the quarter was $82 million, bringing interest expense for the first nine months of the year to $248 million, down from $265 million for the same period in 2023. Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 16.5%, bringing the rate for the first nine months to 17%. The rate was slightly lower than expected, principally due to increased U.S. and foreign tax credits and benefits and other timing items. As a result, for the year, we believe our full year tax rate will be closer to 17%. Now let me turn it back over to Phebe for some final remarks.\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Thanks, Kim. In light of the things I have just discussed, let me give you some clarity for the remainder of the year. The figures I am about to give you are all compared to our July update, which will be posted along with today's guidance on our website. In Aerospace, we expect sales to be about $12.3 billion with a 13.2% margin. We are expecting 150 versus 160 deliveries with 10 of the deliveries slipping into next year. This will, of course, benefit next year. With respect to the defense businesses, Combat Systems and Technology remain unchanged from July. Marine Systems revenue should be about $13.9 billion with margins of 6.9% for all the reasons I've previously noted. On a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue of around $48 billion and margins of around 10.3%. All up, that indicates EPS guidance of approximately $14 per share, about $0.45 below our previous expectations. That concludes my remarks, and we will be happy to take your questions.\nNicole Shelton: Thank you, Phebe. As a reminder we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Seth Seifman at J.P. Morgan.\nSeth Seifman: Hey, hi, thanks and good morning.\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Good morning Seth.\nSeth Seifman: Phebe, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about this year is kind of an unusual year in terms of the various things that have come up with the G700. But as we think about going forward and where the profitability can go in the Aerospace segment, I know it's early for 2025, but maybe even qualitatively talking about the things that are weighing down margin this year and how things can evolve taking into account also the introduction of the G800 and kind of what the progression looks like?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: So I think as we've discussed through most of this year, we still have supply chain challenges that require -- at Gulfstream that require out of station work, and we still have late deliveries of material. The supply chain has gotten much better as evidenced by our ability to ramp up production, but they still got ways to go. And until we get that supply chain quality as well as delivery timing stabilized, we'll continue to have out of station work. That, however, should be behind us before too terribly long let's talk about the 700. So the 700 we've talked throughout the year about some of the margin pressures of the first lot, but when we look forward, as we've talked about before, we see gross margin improvement of about 600 to 700 basis points, that remains the same. As I look forward in the Aerospace Group, we see very, very strong margins going forward and we'll see good margins in Q4, not as high as we expected because a lot of 700s was into next year, but we'll have very nice margin expansion as we go through into next year. With respect to the 800, we expect it to come out of the blocks pretty good and have some nice margin impacts over the course of its year. So I would say that we're pretty optimistic over -- starting about next year and into the future of the margin performance at Aerospace.\nSeth Seifman: Okay, thanks. And maybe just a follow-up on Combat, with the -- understand the growth trajectory kind of slowing down here in the second half, how much of that reflects kind of the end of the facilitization process for the 155-millimeter shells and how do we think about kind of the interplay of growth and margin going forward, it would seem that the backlog here would allow this to be, as we look across the industry, maybe one of the faster growing businesses across the industry, is that a fair assessment? And then have we -- has this quarter indicated that some of the margin pressure from facilitization is behind us?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: So look, if we look at our backlog and the threat environment and the performance at Combat in general, over time, I think we expected in our market space we will continue to grow and perform very well. Facilitization for increased munition production is largely behind us. We're moving into production. We'll see increased revenue from our combat vehicle business and so we do see a pretty good solid growth pattern as we go forward. This year, we accelerated growth into the first half so we expect fourth quarter to be relatively flat but still have about 5.9% growth for the group in the year. And we expect to see very nice growth going forward. I would add this, in a high-performing organization like Combat Systems, variability in revenue and margin is almost always a question of timing, so just to give you a little context on that score.\nOperator: We'll move next to Robert Stallard at Vertical Research Partners.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much, good morning.\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Good morning.\nRobert Stallard: First of all, a question on Marine, Phebe, you mentioned about the supply chain issues there. I was wondering if you could elaborate on why it's not improved as much as you would have hoped and also at what point does this start to negatively impact submarine schedules?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Well, I think that it already has impacted schedule and that's been pretty well publicized by the Navy. Until recently, we had a reasonable hope, and it was a reasonable set of expectations based on the indicators that the supply chain would continue to get better. But most recently, we've seen that, in fact, that's not the case. And they're not getting better at the rate at which we had hoped for a whole series of reasons. And I think that and some of those have been very well documented, the Navy and Congress have been well aware of that. So they've been pumping additional support into the parts of the supply chain and some parts are doing well, but others are continuing to struggle. And I'd say that it was not a typical number of manufacturing sectors. If you go back from December of 2019, the PPI for manufacturing has increased by 25%. Overlay that with the demographic challenges that we've had with the smaller cohort of new hires and wage growth that span and added pressure on some of our suppliers at the same time, almost quintupling the throughput on -- and the demand on submarines. So there's been a lot of pressure, parts of the supply chain. I think that's well understood by our customer and the Congress. So we're going to continue to work with them and help where we can. But in the meantime, we're going to control what we can control. And that is we're going to adjust our pace to align with what we now see as more predictable supply chain schedules that have elongated. It will take cost out of our business, and we'll continue to work productivity on the debt plates [ph] with an increasingly capable and skilled and experienced workforce. So you can control what you can control, and we're simply in the moment adjusting to what we see as the inability of the supply chain to improve at the rate that we had hoped and that frankly I believe our customer had hoped.\nRobert Stallard: Yes. And just as a quick follow-up, do you think the supply chain issues jeopardize the aspiration to move back to two boats a year on the Virginia-class?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Well, I think that in the short term, there's going to be pressure on that, considerable pressure on that. So I think that's something for us to work through with our customer and, frankly, the customer to work with the supply chain. I think it's a well-known issue.\nOperator: We'll go next to Myles Walton at Wolfe Research.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. Phebe, if I could follow up on Rob's question there. The implied fourth quarter margin at mid-6% range for Marine, is there something in the third quarter positively offsetting to get to the low 7s, I don't know if there's a positive EAC you might have taken? And then looking to 2025, is the mid-6% margin, the right run rate that you're looking for now in that business?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: So this quarter, we had some strong performance out of NASCO. We had some good performance at Electric Boat. But that's going to, in this environment, vary quarter-by-quarter. So we anticipate some more supply chain impacts in the fourth quarter. And as we project next year, and I'll give you that clarity about in our regular order in January but as we project next year, the ability to continue to drive incremental margins in the short-term is just how fast we can take our pace down at cost and improve our productivity. So we'll work through all that with the shipyard and give you a sense of what we're seeing in margins. I'd say they are going to be kind of lumpy probably through next year and maybe even beyond.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And then one clarification. I know it's super granular and near term, so I apologize in advance. But in October to date, have you gotten more than one G7 out the door?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Yes, I think I was -- yes, we have. And I think I've given you some pretty good clarity of what we expect for October. That's pretty much on schedule. And then November and December, I gave you that clarity as well. I'm trying to be as transparent with you all so that you can better understand where we anticipate and as you well know, you can follow some of that with publicly available data, which is directionally correct.\nOperator: We'll go next to David Strauss at Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks, good morning. Phebe, following up on the items that you highlight in terms of what's impacting the G700 delivery. I guess just to clarify, is roles from an engine perspective, are they behind, is that part of the issue? And then on the interior side, do you view this as kind of a temporary issue or could it linger just given a much larger cabin here, and I would assume a lot more in the way of complexity on the interior side on a go-forward basis?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So we control the interiors. So we're very comfortable in our projections on how we work those interiors. So I don't -- I'm not worried or even concerned about our interiors. Engines on stations have improved, so that is definitely a benefit. And I tried to give you some color around that particular issue in my remarks, but there's improvement.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. And a quick follow-up. The [indiscernible] announcement with partnership with Lockheed in the quarter. Can you just give some color around that and how that might materialize over the next couple of years in terms of numbers? Thanks.\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So we'll make some investment over the next couple of years. And then I think that -- and I don't have an exact start date off the tip of my tongue. But a lot of the number of motors will be driven by -- overall by the demand for the rock that itself, but we're pretty comfortable that this is well within our capability set, and we'll work through that with our partner.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks very much.\nOperator: We'll move next to Peter Arment at Baird.\nPeter Arment: Hey good morning Phebe. Phebe, maybe just to focus on Combat, you guys have had really strong growth through the first three quarters of the year, and you're obviously -- your profit margins reflect a lot of really good execution. Just how are you thinking about just kind of the long-term visibility here, how big of a business do you see in terms of the bookings environment, you mentioned Middle East and Europe, maybe just describe, I think, how you're seeing the visibility on Combat?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: So our book-to-bill and backlog supports nice growth. The unfortunate threat environment also continues to drive demand. And we see our pipeline is pretty robust, but domestically and outside the United States. So at least for the foreseeable future, we see nice steady growth in Combat. [Multiple Speakers] with good margin performance.\nPeter Arment: Yes. Then my follow-up is on the margin front, I mean almost 14% for the first nine months. I mean, is there opportunities to further enhance margins, I know there are some limits here and mix is a factor, but you've got a lot of growth and a lot of us are just focused on kind of what actually this business can generate?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: So historically, this -- when we've talked about this before in previous calls over the years, this tends to be a 14.5% margin business given some margin variability quarter-to-quarter, again, largely driven by mix. And I suspect that will continue in that range. Again, some margins will be better. Could we make long-term incremental structural improvement in that. I don't see that at the moment, but there's always opportunity. So we'll continue to pursue this. As I said, this is a -- this has always been a very high operating leverage company. So -- and groups of company, the three of them. So I think we'll continue to see both nice growth and good earnings expansion.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ron Epstein at Bank of America.\nRonald Epstein: Good morning. So maybe back to the supply chain. If we look at the supply chain for the shipyards, I mean, we all kind of know that's been an issue. And if we look at the land systems business, I mean it's growing. Do you worry about the supply chain there and I guess, broadly, what has the supply chain in your munitions business and the businesses that are growing in land systems doing better than the supply chain in the shipyards?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: So I think it's a function of the type of material that we use in Combat Systems versus the scope, size of the material and inputs we use both at Marine Group and particularly submarine and Gulfstream. I mean, Gulfstream supply chain got perturbated by a lot of factors that have been well reported. But I think it's really a question of just the types of materials we use and the overall demand even outside of the Combat particularly vehicle business that tends to be a more robust supply chain on component parts given that there's other uses for a lot of that material. Materials, the inputs for Aerospace and for Gulfstream and the Marine Group are one of a kind. They don't replicate anywhere else in industry. So I think that, that explains why we've had fewer issues. I mean we had some issues with supply at Combat, but those are largely behind us. And I think that I tried to give you some color on what that is.\nRonald Epstein: Yes. And then maybe as a follow-on, back to Marine, sorry, I know it's what everybody is focusing on at the moment. When we look at Marine, you say supply chain, supply chain is a huge thing, right? And I think we all have a good understanding in Aero where the type points are. And what in Marine is the issue, I mean, what kind of component -- if you just kind of broadly want to understand if we peel back the onion, where are the suppliers not supplying, is it bearing -- what is it?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Well, we have a number of smaller parts that remain -- they get produced by single-source suppliers and often small ones, that remain a bit of -- remain an issue. I think it's a large component parts that -- and I think the navy has reported on some of that, that tend to be highly complex. Costs have risen significantly, and you've got green workforce in a lot of these areas. So those are -- it's a large group. I think that's all I'm about the most color I'm going to give you on where some of the challenges are because the navy has been kind of explicit in some instances about that. And I think that's just a better place to be.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ken Herbert at RBC Capital Markets.\nKenneth Herbert: Yeah, hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first, Phebe, on services within Aerospace, you had nice growth here again. You've sort of reset, it looks like at a sort of a much higher level. I know you've added capacity. Is this a good run rate to think about for the services business within this and maybe if you could talk about how dilutive this part of the business is relative to the aircraft side within this segment?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: So we have long said that services is going to grow at the rate of the fleet expansion. And think about it this way, we gather -- we garner between 85% and 90% plus of all Gulfstream service. And so as the fleet expands, service expands. Its impact on overall margins tends to be rather lumpy, but it is in some instances in some quarters, it's about even, so it's certainly not any large dilution impact and hasn't been for some time. So this is a nice, steady growth business.\nKenneth Herbert: Okay. And on the quality escape, I guess, with how deliveries are trending in this month and your confidence, you feel good about that risk getting retired or is there anything -- it sounds like there is clearly still some caution into the back half of the year, but do you feel good about that particular supplier and getting back on schedule?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Yes. They're working very cooperatively with us, but I think it's emblematic or at least descriptive of the fact that we don't have all of these risks behind us and that we're slipping airplanes into next year. So I've tried to give you my best estimate both on cadence and timing and of what we see, but for the remainder of this year and then as I said, some of these airplanes will go into next year. But we've worked well with the supplier, understand the scope. So that is not any particularly long-term issue, nor is it a complete anomaly just in terms of the type of thing that happened here. So we're just fixing that in the regular order. It was a timing problem, but not a systemic one, think about it that way.\nKenneth Herbert: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Harned at Bernstein.\nDouglas Harned: Good morning, thank you. Going back to Marine and Electric Boat. When you look at the supply chain issues there and the delays in the programs, how do you think of the Virginia-class and Columbia-class in a sense separately, how do you prioritize work or are you making decisions to prioritize one over the other?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Well, that is a national security decision dictated by the Navy. So Columbia has across the entirety of the industrial base priority, and it has since its inception. So yes, so by definition, Virginia gets behind in terms of priority Columbia. And that has ramifications for Virginia. It's well understood by our customer, particularly in an environment in which supply chain material is constrained. Columbia gets the first of the pick, again, given its national security imperative.\nDouglas Harned: Well, given the importance of these programs, not just to Navy, but the overall Defense, you have got money in the supplemental for supporting the shipbuilding industrial base. But when you work with your customer, how is that helping and are there subsequent steps that can be taken within the budget to help build this industrial base better?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: So the Navy and the Congress have recognized that there are portions of the industrial base that need help. And that's what the shipbuilding and submarine industrial-based funding is attended to address both expanding the capacity and shoring up the capacity. There has been significant cost growth, as I noted earlier, across manufacturing business in particular and by extension into the submarine industrial base. So costs are increasing. Back to life cost or economic realities. And the funding is going to have to adjust to these fundamental changes in inputs and that will need to happen over time.\nDouglas Harned: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move next to Gautam Khanna at TD Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Yeah, thank you. Good morning. So just to follow up on Marine. I know that you guys are in negotiations with the Navy on the Columbia-class, five of those, and I think it's 10 or 12 Virginia-class boat. I was curious what sort of your expectation is for the timing of when those contracts get agreed to and is there any cash or margin implications once those are signed to what's in the yard now and just if you could talk about that?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: So cash, no. Margin impact happens over time as we begin to execute those programs. I don't have a good sense of timing. I expect that the FY 2024 ships that are not yet under contract maybe in the next few months. But I don't have a good sense of timing for the remainder of the negotiations on Block 6, the contract on Block 6 or Built 2 of Columbia. It's going to be hard to get those contracts under -- the ships under contract, given that we've had the kind of cost increases in inputs, frankly, throughout the economy. But as I noted earlier, manufacturing PPI high, and those costs have increased for inputs. So we're going to have to work that with our customer and Congress.\nGautam Khanna: Just as a follow-up, I guess what I'm asking is, do you -- is there any expectation that there would be relief provided for higher labor inflation you've -- that everyone's experienced on boats that are already in production as perhaps part of that negotiation?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Well, I don't know if part of that negotiation, I wouldn't link it necessarily to those negotiations, but we are constantly in negotiation with our customer on a whole -- on any number of contracting actions and now is no different. We also have entitlements in our contracts for which we will seek remedy. So there's a lot of ongoing discussions with our customer about these costs these fact-of-life cost increases and labor cost increases. And that plus the remedy to which we're entitled. We're going to continue to work both of those issues with our customers.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Gavin Parsons at UBS.\nGavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning. Phebe, you of course have delivered some G700s out of inventory this year and maybe some out of inventory again next year. Can you help us with what the underline\u2026?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: We are out of inventory. Help me with what you mean by out of inventory. I mean, we don't have 700 in inventory. And 700 that are in some stage of production, but just picking a nit there with you.\nRonald Epstein: Yes, fair. I guess can you help us with the underlying production rate?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So I try to be as explicit as I could be for the remainder of the year. Some of these airplanes will go into next year, that will help next year. And then we'll give you a lot of clarity around what next year looks like in our ordinary course when we give you our guidance in January. The airplane is performing very well. But we still, as I've noted, frequently, we still got out of station work, that needs to get behind us.\nRonald Epstein: Okay. And I'll try one more. I don't know if this is just an accounting question, but you called out all the elevated cost on paint interiors component replacement on G700. How does the 600 to 700 basis point margin step-up remain intact?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Well, that will happen. I don't have exact clarity on when those gross margin improvements will happen, but I think relatively soon and over the course of potentially the next year, we have to see some really nice margin expansion. We're seeing it in the fourth quarter right off the bat. And I expect to see that margin expansion continue throughout next year and beyond.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jason Gursky at Citi.\nJason Gursky: Hello there, good morning everybody. I was wondering if you could just step back for minute and maybe talk a little bit about the things that you're most excited about and where you are kind of spending the most amount of your time as it relates to technology investments and the business development pipeline across...?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: In technology?\nJason Gursky: In -- across the defense business as a whole.\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Yes. So I would say that we need to continue to capitalize on the very strong growth profile we see going forward in the Marine Group. We spend an awful lot of time on improving our own capability within our own shipyards. I think the technologies group, in general, has shown nice growth and they have positioned themselves in faster currents within their highly competitive businesses. So we're pretty excited about what we see there. And then I think Combat Systems performance continues to be strong and how we then translate demand into revenue in the out years and continue the strong operating performance we've had there is sort of where we focus our time. There's a lot to be excited about in terms of performance of the company.\nJason Gursky: Yes, understood. Okay. It's helpful to understand the prioritization. And then maybe this is a question where we get Kim involved as well, but just kind of philosophically how you guys are -- how you all, excuse me, are approaching the balance sheet and the capital structure and leverage. I'm just kind of -- as we think about the future of the company, where you want to operate?\nKimberly A. Kuryea: Yes. Well, Obviously, we have a very strong balance sheet. We were recently upgraded in terms of our credit rating, and we have some debt repayments coming due that we expect to pay on schedule, and we'll consistently look at where we stand, but we feel pretty good about where we stand right now.\nJason Gursky: Right. And just philosophically, you want to keep your leverage under externs of leverage. I'm just kind of curious how you're thinking about?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Yes. I don't think at this point in time, I think we're continuing to work the growth environment that we're in and determining in terms of where the cash is going to come out for 2025, especially. And I think it's a matter of time in terms of taking a look at where we stand. So Audrey, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take that question from Scott Deuschle at Deutsche Bank.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning. Phebe, just to clarify your response to David's question earlier, do the certifications you're getting this year on those highly customized interiors for G700, do those derisk this as an item from being a constraint next year?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Yes. I mean these are the first ones out of the block. So we don't see that as a constraining item next year. Does that answer the question?\nScott Deuschle: Yes, does Combat Systems have many products that are approved for export on a direct commercial sale basis and then are you seeing much traction for DCS sales, either in terms of the bookings you put up recently at Combat or in terms of orders that are in the pipeline?\nPhebe N. Novakovic: Not out of the United States, but out of our European businesses, yes, those tend to be direct sales, and that's been true for 25 years. And the demand for those products in Europe, in Eastern and Western Europe remains very, very strong.\nScott Deuschle: Thank you.\nNicole Shelton: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the third quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at 703-876-3152.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kimberly A. Kuryea",
            "content": "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 for the company. This is particularly impressive with the continued strong revenue growth in the quarter. Combat Systems and Technologies led the way with book-to-bill of 1.5 times and 1.3 times, respectively. This order activity led to our backlog increasing to $92.6 billion at the end of the quarter. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at a record level of $137.6 billion. Moving to our cash performance, this was another good story in the quarter. Cash flow improved as anticipated over the prior two quarters. We produced $1.4 billion of operating cash flow. All segments contributed to the results with particularly strong cash generation in technologies. Including capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $1.2 billion for the quarter, or 131% of net income. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting free cash flow to again be greater than 100% of net income, but we now expect the full year to fall short of our 100% conversion target as G700 deliveries pushed into 2025. As a reminder, total free cash flow generation between 2021 and 2023 was quite strong with a three-year conversion rate of 107%. Looking at capital deployment, capital expenditures were $201 million in the quarter or 1.7% of sales. We're still targeting to be around 2% of sales for the full year given the commitments that remain. We paid $390 million in dividends and repurchased a little over 150,000 shares of stock for $44 million during the quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of over $2.1 billion. That brings us to a net debt position of $7.2 billion, down over $700 million from last quarter. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million of fixed rate notes maturing in the fourth quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Net interest expense in the quarter was $82 million, bringing interest expense for the first nine months of the year to $248 million, down from $265 million for the same period in 2023. Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 16.5%, bringing the rate for the first nine months to 17%. The rate was slightly lower than expected, principally due to increased U.S. and foreign tax credits and benefits and other timing items. As a result, for the year, we believe our full year tax rate will be closer to 17%. Now let me turn it back over to Phebe for some final remarks. Yes. Well, Obviously, we have a very strong balance sheet. We were recently upgraded in terms of our credit rating, and we have some debt repayments coming due that we expect to pay on schedule, and we'll consistently look at where we stand, but we feel pretty good about where we stand right now."

            "name": "Phebe N. Novakovic",
            "content": "Thank you Nicole. Good morning everyone and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning we have reported earnings of $3.35 per diluted share on revenue over 11.67 billion, operating earnings of 1.18 billion and net income of 930 million. Across the company revenue increased 1.1 billion, a strong 10.4% led by a 22% increase from our Aerospace segment and a 20% increase in Marine Systems. We enjoyed revenue increases at three of our four business segments compared to the year ago quarter, only Combat Systems is flat. This is strong growth by any reasonable standard. Importantly operating earnings of 1.18 billion are up 124 million or 11.7%. Similarly, net earnings increased 94 million or 11.2% and earnings per share are up $0.31 or 10.2% over the year ago quarter. When earnings are up at a greater rate than revenue in a growth environment, the business is demonstrating solid operating leverage. We are doing just that. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $34.4 billion is up $3.77 billion or 12.3% over last year. Operating earnings of $3.37 billion are up 14.1%. Net earnings of $2.63 billion are up 14% despite a higher tax rate. Nevertheless, we mistreat EPS consensus by a fair amount because we were able to deliver only four G700s in the quarter. So without further ado, let me move right into aerospace and give you as much insight into this issue as I can, and its implications for the remainder of the year. At the outset, let me give you some comparative numbers that are quite good despite the shortfall of anticipated G700 delivery. Then I will put all of this in some reasonable context for you. Aerospace had revenue of $2.48 billion and operating earnings of $305 million with a 12.3% operating margin. Revenue is $450 million more than last year's third quarter, a solid 22% increase. The revenue increase was driven by the four G700 deliveries, higher service center and special missions volume, and higher FBO and MRO volume, particularly in the Asia Pacific region at Jet Aviation. We delivered 28 aircrafts, including four G700s this quarter. This is 11 fewer G700s than we expected to deliver. We also delivered one less G600, G500 and G280 than we did a year ago quarter. The deliveries of these aircraft are at a reasonably steady state and the modest shortfall is a typical variance, having to do largely with timing and customer convenience. Operating earnings of $305 million are up $37 million or 13.8% over the year ago quarter. The 12.3% operating margin was 90 basis points lower than the year ago quarter for a host of reasons, including inefficiencies caused by supply chain deficiencies. So despite a very good quarter, we had planned to do better and sell side consensus reflected our expectations. You might recall that I told you we expected to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year and that the deliveries would be more or less evenly divided over the last three quarters of the year. While we planned 15 for Q2 and delivered 11, we planned 15 to 16 for Q3 and delivered four. Three weeks before the end of the quarter, we still had a reasonable belief that we would deliver at least 11 in the quarter. So what happened? Whenever we miss our forecast so badly, it is almost always for a number of reasons that all play a part, so let me identify the most important and impactful ones. First, due to the timing of engine certification, aircraft engines arrived late to schedule. We painted the aircraft before the engines arrived and then painted and installed the engines. This led to a significant amount of repaint that resulted in increased cost and time spent. Second, many of the aircraft planned for delivery in this quarter have highly customized interiors. First of tight intricacies. These intricacies are considered to be major changes for regulatory purposes. This resulted in longer-than-anticipated efforts to finalize and achieve supplemental-type certificates. Related to this, the size and complexity of the G700 cabins has also elongated the customer reviews during final delivery of these planes. Third and maybe most important, late in the quarter, a supplier quality escape on a specific component caused the exchange of several components on each planned aircraft delivery up to 16 per aircraft. The supplier is fully cooperative and is providing components for all our needs, but this rework has increased the number of test flights necessary to obtain the final certificate of airworthiness for each aircraft. So the removal and replacement of these components has impacted labor costs and schedule adversely. We are nonetheless working our way nicely through this problem with the cooperation of the vendor. Finally, if that wasn't enough, we lost four days of productivity as a result of Hurricane Helene. Several customers who were in Savannah working with us to accept delivery left and went home to avoid the storm. So given that there is always risk and precise estimates, I will describe our delivery cadence a bit later and provide some monthly forecast so that you can monitor the quarter from publicly available data. Alright, back to some good numerical comparisons. For the year-to-date, aerospace revenue is up $1.63 billion, an increase of 27.7%. Operating earnings were up $146 million, an increase of almost 20%. I recite these figures, which will reflect even more growth by the end of the year so that we do not get lost in the third quarter delivery issue. This is still eye-watering growth. So what impact should we now expect for the fourth quarter and the year given the fewer-than-planned G700 deliveries in the second quarter and third quarters. You may recall that we expected to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year, we now expect to deliver around 42 for the year with 27 in the fourth quarter. This number is not without risk, but there's also some opportunity to bring planes forward. The real issue here is supply chain support during this critical period. Let me give you some insight into the sequencing of the 27 planned deliveries in the quarter. We anticipate five in October, nine in November and 13 in December, recognizing there is some risk as these numbers could vary a little bit up or down through the quarter. You can, as I have said, follow this with fairly accurate but not perfect publicly available data. Turning to market demand, the interest level of buyers and the expiration of accelerated depreciation at year's end suggests a reasonably strong order intake in the fourth quarter, and that is what we are seeing. After some slowing in the U.S. during the second and third quarters, we are seeing improved interest across all models in the fourth quarter. Europe and Middle East activity is quite strong, but current activity in Southeast Asia and China has slowed. Interestingly, the overall number of prospects in all areas continues to increase. The overall number of prospects in our pipeline is at an all-time high, with the most active models being the G500, G600 and G700. We have a good cross-section of U.S. businesses in this mix. In summary, the Aerospace team had a very good quarter, albeit disappointing from the perspective of G700 deliveries. We look forward to a strong finish to the year in the fourth quarter but will fall somewhat short of our midyear forecast. So let's move on to the defense businesses. As a collective, we once again saw strong growth and good operating performance across the portfolio. I may walk you through each segment in turn. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems had revenue of $2.2 billion for the quarter, similar to a year ago. Earnings of $325 million are up 8.3% and margins at 14.7% represents a 120 basis point increase over Q3 last year. Each of the businesses increased earnings with particularly strong operating leverage in munitions and customer service businesses. On a sequential basis, while revenue decreased 3%, earnings rose almost 4%. Year-to-date, revenue of $6.6 billion is up almost 12% and earnings of $920 million are up $124 million or almost 16%. Combat saw robust order activity over $3.3 billion awarded in Q3, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.5:1 for the quarter. Orders came from across the portfolio with notable orders in munitions and near defense vehicles for the U.S. Army. Overall, demand remains solid across Combat, particularly in our ordinance and international combat vehicle businesses. In the U.S., we are increasing production of 155-millimeter ammunition projectiles as well as expanding our support to the U.S. Army across several other areas, including final loading and assembly of artillery. Our Combat Systems backlog at roughly $18 billion reflects the strong demand. All in all, a strong performance quarter for Combat. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating strong revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.6 billion is up $597 million, 20% against the year ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume as well as Virginia-class volume drove the growth. DDG-51 revenue also increased somewhat. Just to put this in some context, this 20% growth follows 15% growth in Q4 2023, 11% growth in Q1 of 2024, and 13% growth in Q2 of 2024, impressive growth by any standard. Operating earnings are $258 million, up $47 million over the year ago quarter, with a 20 basis point increase in operating margin. However, margins continue to be adversely affected by additional delays from the submarine industrial base, partially offset by improved margin performance at NASCO. Sequentially, revenue increased 4.2% and earnings improved 5.3% in Q3 driven by volume at EB. Year-to-date, marine revenue of $10.4 billion is up 14.7% and earnings of $735 million are up 12%. So across the business, we have seen rapid growth of revenue and earnings but stagnant margin performance. As I noted last quarter, although the supply chain is improving in places, EB continues to be severely impacted by late deliveries from major component suppliers, which has delayed schedule and is continuing to impact cost. Our out-of-sequence work on modules weighing thousands of tons is time-consuming and therefore, expensive, sometimes up to eight times the cost of in-sequence work. The operating metrics tell us that we have, in fact, increased our productivity to somewhat offset cost. As I noted last quarter, throughput, a significant measure of productivity continues to improve. And while we will continue to work on improved productivity, there is no point hurting portions of the boat only to have to stop and wait increasingly extended periods of time for major components to arrive. It is not good for the bulk over time nor cost. Given the recent projections from the supply chain on deliveries, we need to get our cadence in sync with the supply chain and take costs out of the business if we are to hope to see incremental margin growth. Put another way, the supply chain is not getting better at a fast enough rate as we had hoped. Through our internal efficiency, we have now outpaced them. This is the reality of the post COVID environment for many of our most important suppliers. Finally, to be clear, current submarine delivery projections are not incrementally impacted since they already reflect the anticipated delays from the supply chain. We will, of course, carefully monitor supply chain performance and accelerate our work should their deliveries to us improve. And lastly, technologies. It was another strong quarter with revenue of almost $3.4 billion, which is up 2% over the prior year. Operating earnings in the quarter were $326 million, up 3.5% on a margin of 9.7%. That is a 20 basis point improvement year-over-year. The year-to-date comparisons are similar. Revenue at $9.9 billion is up 1.2%, but earnings of $941 million are up almost 5% on a 30 basis point improvement in operating margin. The growth for this quarter and the first nine months was driven by GDIT's investments in their digital accelerators. Mission Systems was flat year-over-year as they continue to transition from legacy programs to new franchises. Strong operating performance across the group more than offset the relative growth in services of GDIT compared to hardware at Mission Systems. Sequentially, the group grew 2.5%, spread relatively evenly over both businesses with margins steady at 9.7%. Order activity was particularly strong in the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.3:1, that resulted in backlog at the end of the quarter of $14.4 billion, up 13.5% from the year ago quarter. Through the first nine months, the group achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2:1 more than keeping pace with the strong revenue growth across the business. GDIT and Mission Systems have shared in the robust order activity so far this year, demonstrating the strength of this portfolio and prospects remain strong with a large qualified funnel of more than $120 billion in opportunities they are pursuing across the group. That concludes my comments about the defense businesses. Let me now turn the call over to our CFO, Kim Kuryea, and then we'll wrap up with our guidance for the remainder of the year. Thanks, Kim. In light of the things I have just discussed, let me give you some clarity for the remainder of the year. The figures I am about to give you are all compared to our July update, which will be posted along with today's guidance on our website. In Aerospace, we expect sales to be about $12.3 billion with a 13.2% margin. We are expecting 150 versus 160 deliveries with 10 of the deliveries slipping into next year. This will, of course, benefit next year. With respect to the defense businesses, Combat Systems and Technology remain unchanged from July. Marine Systems revenue should be about $13.9 billion with margins of 6.9% for all the reasons I've previously noted. On a company-wide basis, we see annual revenue of around $48 billion and margins of around 10.3%. All up, that indicates EPS guidance of approximately $14 per share, about $0.45 below our previous expectations. That concludes my remarks, and we will be happy to take your questions. Good morning Seth. So I think as we've discussed through most of this year, we still have supply chain challenges that require -- at Gulfstream that require out of station work, and we still have late deliveries of material. The supply chain has gotten much better as evidenced by our ability to ramp up production, but they still got ways to go. And until we get that supply chain quality as well as delivery timing stabilized, we'll continue to have out of station work. That, however, should be behind us before too terribly long let's talk about the 700. So the 700 we've talked throughout the year about some of the margin pressures of the first lot, but when we look forward, as we've talked about before, we see gross margin improvement of about 600 to 700 basis points, that remains the same. As I look forward in the Aerospace Group, we see very, very strong margins going forward and we'll see good margins in Q4, not as high as we expected because a lot of 700s was into next year, but we'll have very nice margin expansion as we go through into next year. With respect to the 800, we expect it to come out of the blocks pretty good and have some nice margin impacts over the course of its year. So I would say that we're pretty optimistic over -- starting about next year and into the future of the margin performance at Aerospace. So look, if we look at our backlog and the threat environment and the performance at Combat in general, over time, I think we expected in our market space we will continue to grow and perform very well. Facilitization for increased munition production is largely behind us. We're moving into production. We'll see increased revenue from our combat vehicle business and so we do see a pretty good solid growth pattern as we go forward. This year, we accelerated growth into the first half so we expect fourth quarter to be relatively flat but still have about 5.9% growth for the group in the year. And we expect to see very nice growth going forward. I would add this, in a high-performing organization like Combat Systems, variability in revenue and margin is almost always a question of timing, so just to give you a little context on that score. Good morning. Well, I think that it already has impacted schedule and that's been pretty well publicized by the Navy. Until recently, we had a reasonable hope, and it was a reasonable set of expectations based on the indicators that the supply chain would continue to get better. But most recently, we've seen that, in fact, that's not the case. And they're not getting better at the rate at which we had hoped for a whole series of reasons. And I think that and some of those have been very well documented, the Navy and Congress have been well aware of that. So they've been pumping additional support into the parts of the supply chain and some parts are doing well, but others are continuing to struggle. And I'd say that it was not a typical number of manufacturing sectors. If you go back from December of 2019, the PPI for manufacturing has increased by 25%. Overlay that with the demographic challenges that we've had with the smaller cohort of new hires and wage growth that span and added pressure on some of our suppliers at the same time, almost quintupling the throughput on -- and the demand on submarines. So there's been a lot of pressure, parts of the supply chain. I think that's well understood by our customer and the Congress. So we're going to continue to work with them and help where we can. But in the meantime, we're going to control what we can control. And that is we're going to adjust our pace to align with what we now see as more predictable supply chain schedules that have elongated. It will take cost out of our business, and we'll continue to work productivity on the debt plates [ph] with an increasingly capable and skilled and experienced workforce. So you can control what you can control, and we're simply in the moment adjusting to what we see as the inability of the supply chain to improve at the rate that we had hoped and that frankly I believe our customer had hoped. Well, I think that in the short term, there's going to be pressure on that, considerable pressure on that. So I think that's something for us to work through with our customer and, frankly, the customer to work with the supply chain. I think it's a well-known issue. So this quarter, we had some strong performance out of NASCO. We had some good performance at Electric Boat. But that's going to, in this environment, vary quarter-by-quarter. So we anticipate some more supply chain impacts in the fourth quarter. And as we project next year, and I'll give you that clarity about in our regular order in January but as we project next year, the ability to continue to drive incremental margins in the short-term is just how fast we can take our pace down at cost and improve our productivity. So we'll work through all that with the shipyard and give you a sense of what we're seeing in margins. I'd say they are going to be kind of lumpy probably through next year and maybe even beyond. Yes, I think I was -- yes, we have. And I think I've given you some pretty good clarity of what we expect for October. That's pretty much on schedule. And then November and December, I gave you that clarity as well. I'm trying to be as transparent with you all so that you can better understand where we anticipate and as you well know, you can follow some of that with publicly available data, which is directionally correct. Yes. So we control the interiors. So we're very comfortable in our projections on how we work those interiors. So I don't -- I'm not worried or even concerned about our interiors. Engines on stations have improved, so that is definitely a benefit. And I tried to give you some color around that particular issue in my remarks, but there's improvement. Yes. So we'll make some investment over the next couple of years. And then I think that -- and I don't have an exact start date off the tip of my tongue. But a lot of the number of motors will be driven by -- overall by the demand for the rock that itself, but we're pretty comfortable that this is well within our capability set, and we'll work through that with our partner. So our book-to-bill and backlog supports nice growth. The unfortunate threat environment also continues to drive demand. And we see our pipeline is pretty robust, but domestically and outside the United States. So at least for the foreseeable future, we see nice steady growth in Combat. [Multiple Speakers] with good margin performance. So historically, this -- when we've talked about this before in previous calls over the years, this tends to be a 14.5% margin business given some margin variability quarter-to-quarter, again, largely driven by mix. And I suspect that will continue in that range. Again, some margins will be better. Could we make long-term incremental structural improvement in that. I don't see that at the moment, but there's always opportunity. So we'll continue to pursue this. As I said, this is a -- this has always been a very high operating leverage company. So -- and groups of company, the three of them. So I think we'll continue to see both nice growth and good earnings expansion. So I think it's a function of the type of material that we use in Combat Systems versus the scope, size of the material and inputs we use both at Marine Group and particularly submarine and Gulfstream. I mean, Gulfstream supply chain got perturbated by a lot of factors that have been well reported. But I think it's really a question of just the types of materials we use and the overall demand even outside of the Combat particularly vehicle business that tends to be a more robust supply chain on component parts given that there's other uses for a lot of that material. Materials, the inputs for Aerospace and for Gulfstream and the Marine Group are one of a kind. They don't replicate anywhere else in industry. So I think that, that explains why we've had fewer issues. I mean we had some issues with supply at Combat, but those are largely behind us. And I think that I tried to give you some color on what that is. Well, we have a number of smaller parts that remain -- they get produced by single-source suppliers and often small ones, that remain a bit of -- remain an issue. I think it's a large component parts that -- and I think the navy has reported on some of that, that tend to be highly complex. Costs have risen significantly, and you've got green workforce in a lot of these areas. So those are -- it's a large group. I think that's all I'm about the most color I'm going to give you on where some of the challenges are because the navy has been kind of explicit in some instances about that. And I think that's just a better place to be. So we have long said that services is going to grow at the rate of the fleet expansion. And think about it this way, we gather -- we garner between 85% and 90% plus of all Gulfstream service. And so as the fleet expands, service expands. Its impact on overall margins tends to be rather lumpy, but it is in some instances in some quarters, it's about even, so it's certainly not any large dilution impact and hasn't been for some time. So this is a nice, steady growth business. Yes. They're working very cooperatively with us, but I think it's emblematic or at least descriptive of the fact that we don't have all of these risks behind us and that we're slipping airplanes into next year. So I've tried to give you my best estimate both on cadence and timing and of what we see, but for the remainder of this year and then as I said, some of these airplanes will go into next year. But we've worked well with the supplier, understand the scope. So that is not any particularly long-term issue, nor is it a complete anomaly just in terms of the type of thing that happened here. So we're just fixing that in the regular order. It was a timing problem, but not a systemic one, think about it that way. Well, that is a national security decision dictated by the Navy. So Columbia has across the entirety of the industrial base priority, and it has since its inception. So yes, so by definition, Virginia gets behind in terms of priority Columbia. And that has ramifications for Virginia. It's well understood by our customer, particularly in an environment in which supply chain material is constrained. Columbia gets the first of the pick, again, given its national security imperative. So the Navy and the Congress have recognized that there are portions of the industrial base that need help. And that's what the shipbuilding and submarine industrial-based funding is attended to address both expanding the capacity and shoring up the capacity. There has been significant cost growth, as I noted earlier, across manufacturing business in particular and by extension into the submarine industrial base. So costs are increasing. Back to life cost or economic realities. And the funding is going to have to adjust to these fundamental changes in inputs and that will need to happen over time. So cash, no. Margin impact happens over time as we begin to execute those programs. I don't have a good sense of timing. I expect that the FY 2024 ships that are not yet under contract maybe in the next few months. But I don't have a good sense of timing for the remainder of the negotiations on Block 6, the contract on Block 6 or Built 2 of Columbia. It's going to be hard to get those contracts under -- the ships under contract, given that we've had the kind of cost increases in inputs, frankly, throughout the economy. But as I noted earlier, manufacturing PPI high, and those costs have increased for inputs. So we're going to have to work that with our customer and Congress. Well, I don't know if part of that negotiation, I wouldn't link it necessarily to those negotiations, but we are constantly in negotiation with our customer on a whole -- on any number of contracting actions and now is no different. We also have entitlements in our contracts for which we will seek remedy. So there's a lot of ongoing discussions with our customer about these costs these fact-of-life cost increases and labor cost increases. And that plus the remedy to which we're entitled. We're going to continue to work both of those issues with our customers. We are out of inventory. Help me with what you mean by out of inventory. I mean, we don't have 700 in inventory. And 700 that are in some stage of production, but just picking a nit there with you. Yes. So I try to be as explicit as I could be for the remainder of the year. Some of these airplanes will go into next year, that will help next year. And then we'll give you a lot of clarity around what next year looks like in our ordinary course when we give you our guidance in January. The airplane is performing very well. But we still, as I've noted, frequently, we still got out of station work, that needs to get behind us. Well, that will happen. I don't have exact clarity on when those gross margin improvements will happen, but I think relatively soon and over the course of potentially the next year, we have to see some really nice margin expansion. We're seeing it in the fourth quarter right off the bat. And I expect to see that margin expansion continue throughout next year and beyond. In technology? Yes. So I would say that we need to continue to capitalize on the very strong growth profile we see going forward in the Marine Group. We spend an awful lot of time on improving our own capability within our own shipyards. I think the technologies group, in general, has shown nice growth and they have positioned themselves in faster currents within their highly competitive businesses. So we're pretty excited about what we see there. And then I think Combat Systems performance continues to be strong and how we then translate demand into revenue in the out years and continue the strong operating performance we've had there is sort of where we focus our time. There's a lot to be excited about in terms of performance of the company. Yes. I don't think at this point in time, I think we're continuing to work the growth environment that we're in and determining in terms of where the cash is going to come out for 2025, especially. And I think it's a matter of time in terms of taking a look at where we stand. So Audrey, I think we have time for one more question. Yes. I mean these are the first ones out of the block. So we don't see that as a constraining item next year. Does that answer the question? Not out of the United States, but out of our European businesses, yes, those tend to be direct sales, and that's been true for 25 years. And the demand for those products in Europe, in Eastern and Western Europe remains very, very strong."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.26 per diluted share on revenue of $11.98 billion, operating earnings of $1.16 billion and net income of $905 million. We enjoyed revenue increases at each of our four business segments compared to the year ago quarter. Across the company, revenue increased a strong 18%, with a 51% increase in our Aerospace segment and a 10% increase across our defense units, strong growth by any standard. Importantly, operating earnings of $1.16 billion are up almost $200 million or 20.2%, demonstrating solid operating leverage. Similarly, net earnings are up 21.6% and earnings per share up 21% over the year ago quarter. You will note, we missed Street EPS consensus by $0.02 due entirely to the slip of 4 G700 deliveries from the last week in the quarter to the beginning Q3. One has since been delivered, three are imminent. From a different perspective, the sequential comparisons are also quite favorable. Revenue was up $1.2 billion and operating earnings are up $120 million on steady margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $22.7 billion is up $2.67 billion or 13.3% over last year's first half. Operating earnings of nearly $2.2 billion are up 15.4%. Net earnings of $1.7 billion are up 15.6% despite a higher provision for income taxes. In a few minutes, our CFO, Kim Kuryea, will provide you with free cash flow for the first half and remainder of the year, our strong continued order activity and backlog, as well as some additional relevant financial information. But first, I will take you through each of the segments. We'll start with Aerospace. Let me give you some comparative numbers that will show the front end of a tremendous growth surge for Aerospace that will progress favorably throughout the year. Then I will attempt to put all of this in some reasonable perspective for you. Aerospace had revenue of $2.94 billion and operating earnings of $319 million with a 10.9% operating margin. Revenue is $987 million more than last year's second quarter, a remarkable 51% increase. The revenue increase was driven by additional new aircraft deliveries, coupled with higher service revenue. We delivered 37 aircraft, including 11 newly certified G700s in the quarter. This is four fewer than we expected to deliver, but more about that in a minute. Operating earnings of $319 million are up $83 million, 35% over the year ago quarter. The 10.9% operating margin was 120 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was driven by G700 deliveries that carried more than expected costs from three things: First, retrofit; second, out-of-station work related to the late arrival of parts; and three, the extended certification period. This cost burden will affect 20 lot one aircraft, which includes five test aircraft that will not deliver this year. So we are through the lot one cost burden for this year within the next four deliveries. The good news is that margins on the G700 are expected to increase by 600 to 700 basis points in lot two and by a similar increment in lot three. By the time we reach lot three production and deliveries, we will have reached a steady state in terms of productivity and predictability. A few comments on predictability. You might recall that I told you we expected to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year and that the deliveries would be more or less evenly divided over the last three quarters of the year. But we planned 15 for Q2 and deliver 11. So much for predictability. We actually had the remaining four completed and ready to go, but could not get through the preflight delivery testing in time. You might be surprised to learn that each G700 has flown about 30 hours of tests before delivery. Two of the planes also needed a supplemental type certificate because of a very different cabin configuration. That wasn't done by the end of the quarter. All right, back to some numerical comparisons. The sequential numbers are equally impressive. Revenue is up $856 million, a strong 41% increase, and operating earnings are up $64 million, about 25%, affected by 130 basis point degradation in operating margins for the reason I just mentioned a moment ago. You will see much stronger operating margins in the third quarter, followed by even better operating margin and related earnings in the fourth quarter. Separately, we still expect to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year. Look for about 16 in the third quarter and 23 to 25 in the fourth quarter. From an orders perspective, we had a respectable quarter at 0.9:1 book-to-bill in dollar terms. There is strong interest in a fair pipeline across the product mix. As I noted last quarter, bringing transactions to close has elongated somewhat, as there is some caution, while customers digest the impact of geopolitical events in general and U.S. presidential election in particular. The United States remains our strongest market, but the yield is improving. The Middle East shows very strong potential. And just very recently, we have seen some improvement in China. The interest level of buyers and the expiration of accelerated depreciation at the end of the year suggests a reasonably strong order intake in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. We are pleased to have both G700 FAA and EASA certifications behind us. The Aerospace comparative revenue and earnings numbers in the quarter are very good by any reasonable standard, but still behind consensus, largely attributable to deliveries that did not make it to the wire. In summary, the Aerospace team had a very good quarter. It is handling the rapid increase in deliveries and revenue on a methodical and disciplined fashion. We look forward to a powerful second half with increasing revenue and earnings quarter-over-quarter as we forecasted at the end of last quarter. Moving to the defense business as a collective. We once again saw strong growth and good operating performance across the portfolio. Let me walk you through each segment in turn. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems had revenue of almost $2.3 billion, up 19% over the year ago quarter, with growth at each of the three business units. Earnings of $313 million are up almost 25%, and margins at 13.7% represent a 70 basis point increase over the Q2 last year. In short, very strong operating performance from Combat Systems. The increased revenue came from facilities expansion and artillery work in our ammo business, coupled with increases in international tank and wheeled vehicle sales and U.S. Army programs of record. Each of the businesses increased earnings nicely, with particularly strong operating leverage in our international vehicle business. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 8.8% and earnings rose 11%. Year-to-date, revenue of about $4.4 billion is up 19.3% and earnings of $595 million are up almost $100 million, or 20%. Combat saw robust order intake with over $3.4 billion awarded in Q2, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.5:1 for the quarter. Orders came from across the portfolio, ranging from ammunition to main battle tanks for the U.S. Army and wheeled vehicles for an international customers. Demand remained steady, particularly for the Abrams main battle tank and international wheeled vehicles. We expect demand for ammo to continue to rise for some time to come as we rapidly increase production of our artillery shells and components. All in all, a very strong growth and performance quarter for Combat Systems. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating strong revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.45 billion is up $394 million, almost 13% against the year ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume drove the growth, while Virginia-class and DDG-51 revenue also increased nicely. Operating earnings are $245 million, up $10 million over the year ago quarter with a 60 basis points decrease in operating margin. Margins were impacted by continued delays to EB from the submarine industrial base, partially offset by improvement in DDG-51 performance of Bath and continued steady performance at NASSCO. Sequentially, revenue increased 3.7% and earnings improved 5.6% in Q2, driven by volume at EB, as we saw some quarter-over-quarter improvement in supply chain deliveries to the yard and continued positive performance at NASSCO. Year-to-date, Marine revenue of $6.8 billion is up 12.1% and earnings of $477 million are up 7%. As I noted a moment ago, although the supply chain is improving in places, EB continues to be impacted by late deliveries from the supply chain, which both delay schedule and impacts costs. At a sequence work on multi-ton modules is time-consuming and expensive. Our strategy, as you know, has been to increase our productivity to somewhat offset that impact. To that end, throughput, a significant measure of productivity, continues to improve, hiring is good and attrition is lower, so all good signs. In summary, we are starting to see some momentum build in our shipyards to meet the delivery and repair requirements of our customer, the U.S. Navy. We anticipate that all of our yards are now well positioned for slow, but steady incremental margin growth over time with fewer perturbations. Finally, Technologies. The group had another good quarter with revenue of nearly $3.3 billion, up 2.5% over the year ago quarter and operating earnings of $320 million, up 13.1% on a 90 basis point improvement in margin. This nice improvement in operating performance was across both businesses. GDIT margins increased 40 basis points, emission systems margins were up 130 basis points as they continue to recover from supply chain impacts experienced in 2023 and before. Sequentially, revenue was up $81 million or 2.5% and operating earnings are up 8.5% on a 50 basis points improvement in margin. And the story is much the same for the year-to-date with revenue of $6.5 billion, up about 1%, and operating earnings of $615 million, up 5.7% against the first six months of last year. As a result, margins for the group were up 40 basis points year-to-date to 9.4%. So all relevant comparisons this quarter show revenue and earnings growth and a margin expansion of both businesses, positioning them well going forward. In short, GDIT is holding its industry-leading margins, while consistently delivering year-over-year growth, while Mission Systems is delivering nice margin expansion as it transitions from sunsetting legacy programs. The group received $3.3 billion in orders in the quarter, bringing the total of $7.2 billion for the first six months. That results in a book-to-bill for the group of 1.0 for the quarter and 1.1 for the year-to-date. Total awards for the group in the first half were up 30% compared with the first six months of 2023. This is on the strength of win rates consistently around 80% for the group and capture rates at roughly 65%, both very strong for this industry. Backlog was down slightly from the end of the first quarter due to the removal of backlog associated with an international divestiture in the quarter, but was up almost $200 million from a year ago. As importantly, the qualified pipeline remains very robust at over $120 billion. So the group is well positioned to continue its growth trajectory. Let me now turn the call over to Kim.\nA - Kimberly Kuryea: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with orders. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective at $10 billion, with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 0.8:1 for the company. This was achieved in the quarter when revenue grew 18% over last year, and there were no significant shipbuilding contracts awarded. Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 0.9:1, while revenue grew over 40% sequentially with the initial deliveries of the G700. On the defense side of the business, Combat Systems did particularly well with a book-to-bill of 1.5:1, and Technologies was 1:1. We ended the quarter with backlog of $91.3 billion, essentially even with where we were a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at nearly $130 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. We generated $814 million of operating cash flow. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $613 million for the quarter, yielding a cash conversion rate of 68%. Technologies led the segments with strong cash flow generation in the quarter. When you consider the free cash flow through the first half of 2024, we are slightly positive at $176 million and about $250 million ahead of what we had planned. After the planned slow start in the first half, we expect significant second half growth. With the majority of the cash generated in the fourth quarter, we are still planning a cash conversion rate around 100% for the year. So you may be wondering what's driving cash to be so backloaded this year. It's apparent from our balance sheet that we have been building up working capital in the first half of the year, which we expect to substantially unwind in the second half. One obvious driver of this is Gulfstream with the ramp-up for the certification and deliveries of the G700. The planned G700 deliveries in the second half are significant, which will reduce working capital. Another large contributor to the growth in working capital has been Combat Systems. They have several programs that pay at delivery. Thus, we are buying material in the first half of the year that results in product deliveries and cash in the second half of the year. Combat is also subject to the timing of deposits on international programs, and the first half of the year has been a period of liquidating deposits received in prior periods. Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $201 million or 1.7% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year and slightly above 2% of sales when the year wraps up. Also in the quarter, we paid $389 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 119,000 shares of stock for $34 million. Through the first half, we repurchased only a modest number of shares for a total of $139 million, driven largely by our 2024 cash profile. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $1.4 billion and a net debt position of $7.9 billion, down over $300 million from last quarter. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million of fixed rate notes maturing in the fourth quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $84 million compared to $89 million last year. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $166 million, down from $180 million for the same period in 2023 on lower debt balances. At this point, our expectation for interest expense for the year remains unchanged at approximately $320 million. Finally, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 17%, bringing the tax rate for the first half to 17.2%. This rate is a little lower than our outlook for the full-year, which remains around 17.5%. For the second half of the year, we expect the rate to be lower in the third quarter and then a bit higher in the fourth due to typical timing items. Phebe, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you.\nPhebe Novakovic: All right. Thanks, Kim. Let me move on to give you updated forecast for the year. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which will be posted along with today's guidance on our website. In Aerospace, we are sticking with our same earnings estimate, but we'll get there with higher revenue and about a 100 basis point drop in margins for all the reasons I mentioned to you a few minutes ago. We are still holding to our delivery estimate of about 160 airplanes. With respect to the defense businesses, Combat will have revenue of about $200 million higher than previously projected as a result of continued demand. So look for total revenue of about $8.7 billion. Margin should be about the same. All in, operating earnings will be up $30 million over the previous forecast. Marine Systems revenue should be up $1 billion of Electric Boat and somewhat at Bath. So we will have annual revenue between $13.4 billion and $13.8 billion with an operating margin around 7.4%, with operating earnings up around $45 million over the January forecast. For Technologies, we are not changing our earlier guidance to you. On a company wide basis, we see annual revenue up about $2 billion, with overall margins down about 30 basis points. So total revenue of $47.8 billion to $48.2 billion, and operating earnings up modestly. All up, that indicates EPS guidance of $14.40 to $14.50, $0.05 over prior guidance. I will note that normally, this time of year, we have solid insight into revenue and margin. In this growth environment, the upside has been difficult to predict with equal clarity. Should anything materially change in Q3, I will give you another credit guidance. That concludes my remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions.\nNicole Shelton: Thank you, Phebe. As a reminder, we ask participants to ask one question and one follow-up so that everyone has a chance to participate. Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. We'll go to our first question from David Strauss at Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Phebe, on the G700, as I understand, there are some issues that you have to fix with these prebuilt airplanes. Can you just talk about what exactly the issue is, how far of the way you are through that? And whether this is still an issue in terms of airplanes that are on the line? Thanks.\nPhebe Novakovic: Sure. So very late in the certification process, we had a requirement to bind together some wires in the tail of the airplane. So relatively simple fix. For those airplanes that we had already built, we took the tails off. For those that we were building, we just didn't put them on. So this is largely behind us. And contributed to a bit to the cost impact on lot one. But I would note that it's extremely hard to discern anything meaningful looking from the outside in here. This is, as I said, largely behind us and was pretty late in the process. And not particularly difficult to do.\nDavid Strauss: Great. And so none of the slips relate to kind of supply chain issues? It was more about just fixing the certification issue?\nPhebe Novakovic: Right. Think about the supply chain as more a question of cost than delivery.\nDavid Strauss: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move next to Peter Arment at Baird.\nPeter Arment: Thanks. Good morning, Phebe.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nPeter Arment: Yes, it's really encouraging to hear about the 50 to 52 is still intact for the G700. Maybe you could just touch upon, I think expectations around bookings? I know you've talked about in the past about geopolitics and a lot of just volatility in the world. Just your thoughts on just bookings for the year? Thanks.\nPhebe Novakovic: So we tried to give you some color around that. In the remarks, I'd say that we typically see in any U.S. presidential election, a slowdown around the election. And I think this won't be any different. But we do expect, as I noted in my remarks, a more robust fourth quarter because we've got the expiration of the accelerated depreciation. And the pipeline is quite good. And I gave you also some color around the geographical distribution there. So all in all, there's quite a bit of interest in our airplanes.\nPeter Arment: That's great to hear. Just as a quick follow-up. Just your latest thoughts on just the G400. Is that still tracking to meet your kind of original plan?\nPhebe Novakovic: It is, and we ought to fly very soon.\nOperator: We'll go next to Robert Spingarn at Melius Research.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey, good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nRobert Spingarn: Phebe, maybe sort of a two-parter on Marine. I wanted to ask you, first, with the recent supplemental, there was money, a little over $3 billion to help support the submarine industrial base. And you did mention last time that there were a few sole-source suppliers of complex components that were causing some of the delays. So wondering if that money has gotten to them and is resolving the issue or if you had to qualify alternate sources? And then the longer-term question is, a decade ago or maybe a little bit longer, Marine was a 10% type margin business. And given the supply chain issues, the impact to the shipbuilding workforce in the aftermath of COVID, is that a realistic target at some point in the future? And what might be the timing on that? Thank you.\nPhebe Novakovic: Sure. So let me take each part of your question in turn. So the Navy, working quite closely with the Congress, allocated significant funding for the industrial base, as you noted. That money has begun to flow, and it is intended for another, and it's targeted for a number of uses. One, increased throughput; two, some facilitization, some training, increased hiring. And so it's been really critical, and we've been pushing very hard to get that money as fast as we possibly can into the supply chain to help stabilize them. And let me put it to you this way. There are some supply chain providers who are improving and improving quite nicely. We still have some challenges out there that are pretty well publicized, but we're continuing to work with the U.S. Navy on how to the extent that those can be mitigated. So we continue to see cost impacts from late deliveries of out-of-sequence work, as I noted in my remarks. But we continue to be hopeful. We are hopeful that the additional funding that we're putting into the supply chain should help stabilize over time. So with respect to your 10% margin, that certainly is our goal. I think the supply chain has to stabilize. We've got to come down our learning curves on Columbia. Virginia throughput has to increase. So we will ultimately stabilize in the Marine group. And I will notice, by the way, I think you mentioned something about the workforce. We have, in the last year or so had no difficulty in hiring at our shipyards, and our training program has been pretty robust. So we've got shipbuilders coming out of that training program with a higher than typical level of proficiency. Our retention is also much better. So that gives us some confidence in the throughput and productivity capacity of the shipyards. But everything in shipbuilding is slow. So it's small, incremental improvement over time. But I think 10% is a reasonable goal over time, and there's no way to estimate that with any precision. Not going to speculate, but it is objective.\nRobert Spingarn: Thank you very much.\nOperator: We'll go next to Cai von Rumohr at TD Cowen.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much, Phebe.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nCai von Rumohr: Good morning. So the tail issue at Gulfstream, does the required rework extend beyond the first 20 units in the first block? And should we be looking for a sequential build in terms of unit deliveries, so that I would assume then you have less first block impact in the third quarter than the second and even less or none in the fourth. And therefore, you should see a strong lift in the margin sequentially. Is that the way to look at it?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So I tried to give you a lot of color on that in my remarks. But with respect to the binding of some of those wires in the tail, that's largely behind us. And with respect to the margin trajectory, we see nice margin improvement in this quarter and then again in the fourth quarter. Think about the fourth quarter as mid- to high-upper teens.\nCai von Rumohr: Okay. And because of this rework, should we assume that the profitability on Block 2 for the G700 that the sequential step-up from 1 to 2 will be somewhat bigger than one might normally look for?\nPhebe Novakovic: I tried to give you that in my remarks, but this is really a Lot 1 issue.\nCai von Rumohr: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Gursky at Citi.\nJason Gursky: Hey, good morning everybody. Phebe, I just wanted to spend a few minutes talking about the services business in Aerospace. And just some of the trends that you're seeing there with the fleet utilization and what you're seeing in the competitive environment in that business as well?\nPhebe Novakovic: So on the service side, services, as we said before, will grow with the expansion of the fleet. Our objective is to get as much of the Gulfstream worked as possible, and we've got the vast preponderance of that already. Services is growing this year. As is, by the way, special mission, which is driving a lot of the revenue increase this year, but we should see nice steady growth over time in the service sector. And there's no real -- with respect to services, there's no real difference in any of the competitive environment.\nJason Gursky: Okay. Great. And then turning to Technologies and maybe using a bit of your crystal ball on the pipeline and the outlook for bookings and book-to-bill there. What's the environment look like there for you all over the next, I don't know, 12, 18 months on the pipeline and the outlook for book-to-bill for the Technologies business?\nPhebe Novakovic: So we continue to see a very active pipeline. I think the available market at the moment is over $120 billion, it's pretty robust. And we've been winning our fair share and a little bit more than our fair share. So we believe that over time, that will continue as it has in the last couple of years drive services growth and frankly, at Mission Systems as well. So I think technology is positioned for a nice steady slow growth, which is exactly what we have promised in the past and what we're delivering. So pretty steady.\nOperator: We'll go next to George Shapiro at Shapiro Research.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes. Good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Hi, George.\nGeorge Shapiro: Phebe, I just wanted some clarification. You had said that the pretty much all the costs were, incorporated yet you delivered 11, five you said won't be delivered until next year, but there's still four left. Is that the four that you just delivered in the first week or so of the second -- of the third quarter?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So the Lot 1 consisted of about 20 or so airplanes. All five are test airplanes, they'll deliver next year. But this year, the Lot 1 costs are going to be behind us imminently. We've delivered one of the four. And I tried to give you some color on the delivery process. And the other three imminent here. So I think we're in pretty good shape on that. Does that help you?\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes, that helps. And then just a quick follow-up on the usual question. If I look at the gross bookings versus the net bookings from your backlog, it's like a $171 million difference. Was that just forfeiture cancellation, currency-related? Do you have any comments on that?\nPhebe Novakovic: Nothing that I can put my finger on, to be quite honest, in the moment.\nGeorge Shapiro: Okay. And one last one and aftermarket growth in the quarter at Gulfstream?\nPhebe Novakovic: Pretty good for us. The service business, and we expect it to continue to grow this year, which is driving a lot of the revenue increase, along with special mission.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ken Herbert at RBC.\nKenneth Herbert: Yes, hi, Phebe. Good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nKenneth Herbert: I wanted to see if you could make some comments on Combat. And specifically, the outlook for bookings in Europe and other regions. But also, how should we think about with the orders you're booking today, the impact on the backlog and to what extent are they accretive to segment margins? Or how accretive could they be as some of the more recent bookings flow into the backlog of revenues?\nPhebe Novakovic: So the bookings continue to reflect the threat environment. Both that they were driven in the quarter, both by international vehicle orders and U.S. ammunition and Army programs of record. And I think we'll see as we're going forward, I'd say that Combat Systems is typically, as we talked about in the past, probably a mid-14% margin business, but it will have quarter variability, sometimes up around 15%. So it's really a question of mix. In the moment, we see increased what we call sustainment, think about repair and support, which tends to carry a little higher margin. And you didn't exactly ask this question, but I'll sort of answer it. As we move from the lower margin facilitization work to the higher-margin throughput on -- that's generated like the throughput on ammunition, you'll see a little bit of margin expansion there.\nKenneth Herbert: And just can you quantify the cash impact in the second half and the fourth quarter from the timing of some of the cash receipts on Combat?\nPhebe Novakovic: I don't think we've broken out cash for you by business group. I think Kim tends to give you a fair amount of color on what was going on in the third and particularly the fourth quarter of unwinding some of the prebuilds in Combat with the deliveries of those vehicles and material.\nOperator: We'll go next to Doug Harned at Bernstein.\nDouglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you.\nPhebe Novakovic: Hi, Doug.\nDouglas Harned: If we look at Gulfstream and kind of look through the current margin issues, and when you get out to 2026, you should be at a point where you've got a full portfolio of maturing aircraft, commonality. And if we go back to the days when you could get to those 18% to 20%-type margins, is there a way to think about the progression here? There are clearly near-term issues. You've got the G800 to 400. How do you see working through those, the implication for margins? And where you would come out when you're what I would say, more of a normalized mode?\nPhebe Novakovic: I'd say there's good potential for higher margins along the lines that we had seen in the past. But exactly when at this point, it's hard to pinpoint. But I think we're pretty confident and pleased with long-term margin trajectory at Aerospace for all the reasons that I think you quite potently listed.\nDouglas Harned: And then just changing gears. When you look at munitions, I know you're expanding capacity substantially. A lot of people look at the situation in Europe. We've got an election coming up. And when you look at the demand for munitions, if you run that out five, six, seven years, how do you see that? Because others are -- Rheinmetall and others are also ramping up here. How do you see that extending over time?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, it's hard to look into a crystal ball much past a planning period. But we anticipate for the next couple of years, increased munitions orders as dictated by the threat environment. And we're pretty confident in that. So that's kind of how I look at it. It's awfully difficult to predict the threat environment with any kind of clarity other than pure speculation outside the next couple of years.\nDouglas Harned: I was asking because as you think about this build out. And for what period of time are you looking at is kind of what I was getting at in terms of growth?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes, a couple of years. I wasn't clear on that. I apologize. Yes, I'd say a couple of years of this. I'd say three, four years max, somewhere along those lines. And then we'll see. I think there have been some profound lessons learned about the criticality of munitions, ammunition. So I expect those to be incorporated in force is thinking.\nDouglas Harned: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Myles Walton at Wolfe Research.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering, Phebe, you increased the sales at Gulfstream, but no change in deliveries. Is that an ASP or a services-driven higher revenue base?\nPhebe Novakovic: A couple of things, including services, as I had noticed, increase in services and also an increase in special mission which are kind of lumpy, as you know, and we've talked about in the past.\nMyles Walton: Okay. Got it. And then just another detailed question. Thanks for the color on the unit improvement in margins. Are the unit quantities about 20 aircraft is Lot 1? And then secondarily, when you move to the 800, the G800, should we anticipate a similar profile of profitability? Or do you think you'll be at higher profit sooner on the 800 out of the gates? Thanks.\nPhebe Novakovic: Planning purposes is the latter. But that's probably all the clarity we've got at the moment. It all depends on the certification process, but we anticipate, I think and reasonably anticipate that they'll come out of the gate very strong.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And where that lost quantity is about [indiscernible]?\nPhebe Novakovic: Yes.\nMyles Walton: Okay, thanks.\nPhebe Novakovic: It's typical lot quantities.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scott Deuschle at Deutsche Bank.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Phebe, can you characterize the ramp-up of this new munitions facility in Texas you opened up during the quarter? I guess, are you likely to exit 3Q at a relatively full run rate? Or is the ramp more gradual from that? Thank you.\nPhebe Novakovic: So we opened up the facility. The first line is running and producing as we anticipated. We are standing up lines 3 and 4. So that's a material increase in the throughput of that facility, but it's a modern facility with a very strong and good workforce. So we're pretty encouraged that we will quickly come down our learning curves and produce at or above our plan.\nScott Deuschle: Great. And Kim, just to clarify your earlier comments, are you expecting working capital to be a source of cash in 3Q?\nKimberly Kuryea: Yes. But I would say that when you look at the cash profile for the rest of the year, most of that cash does come in the fourth quarter. So most of that working capital will unwind in the fourth quarter, not the third quarter.\nScott Deuschle: Okay. So modestly positive in 3Q?\nKimberly Kuryea: Yes.\nScott Deuschle: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move to our next question from Robert Stallard at Vertical Research.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nRobert Stallard: Phebe, a couple of physical questions for you. First of all, on the U.S., if the Ukraine supplemental were to be 0, what sort of risk could that present to GD in the future? And then second, in the U.K., a change of government over here, whether there's any implications for AJAX down the line? Thank you.\nPhebe Novakovic: I will take that in the inverse order. Don't anticipate any particular changes in AJAX. The vehicle is performing extremely well. The U.K. Army is pleased with it. So I think that, that's a standard piece of kit for the U.K. Army. With respect to the U.S., I think it's -- the Ukrainian supplemental certainly helped, but was not the only source of funding for munitions. And frankly, the munitions demand is a reality independent of, I think a lot of other things based on the lessons learned that most land forces, I believe have incorporated at this point. So we expect that to continue.\nRobert Stallard: Okay, thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman at JPMorgan.\nSeth Seifman: Good morning.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nSeth Seifman: One quick specific one on Gulfstream. The out-of-station work you talked about due to late supplier deliveries, is that behind us now as well?\nPhebe Novakovic: The supply chain has improved, but it is not completely healed yet. So I suspect we'll continue to have some out-of-station work.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. Okay. And then more broadly, the comment you made at the end of the prepared remarks about potentially revisiting the guidance with the Q3 earnings. Is that because of uncertainty in any particular area or just kind of broadly across the businesses?\nPhebe Novakovic: I think that in this growth environment, revenue has been harder for us to predict. And just the input of contract executions and the impact of contract execution. So that's why we have a little less clarity than we typically do at this point, as revenue is a bit harder for us to identify with the kind of certainty that we typically can.\nSeth Seifman: Okay, very good. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ellen Page at Jefferies.\nEllen Page: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just starting on the G700. You mentioned Block 3 was at a steady-state margin. How do we think about that relative to the G650? When would that kind of peak margin?\nPhebe Novakovic: I don't have that exact comparison, but these are going to be very healthy margins, as you can imagine, on these airplanes.\nEllen Page: Okay. Thank you. And then just moving to Marine. As we think about the high growth this year, how do we think about that continuing into 2025? Or should we assume?\nPhebe Novakovic: So this is -- we continue to see a strong growth profile for the Marine Group for the foreseeable future. In fact, for some time to come. Driven by, as I noted before, the threat environment. So growth is continuing. Some years, it will be a higher rate of growth than others, but it is a growth trajectory.\nEllen Page: Thank you. I'll leave it there.\nOperator: And next, we'll move to Noah Poponak at Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak: Good morning everyone.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nNoah Poponak: Phebe, I guess if I look at the funded backlog at Gulfstream, it's been relatively flattish over the last kind of year, 1.5 years. I know you have overall good demand for the new products. But how are you thinking about matching supply to demand as you're going to ramp deliveries here? Do you have visibility that the orders will keep pace with that? Do you have any concern about taking the revenue run rate above the order rate?\nPhebe Novakovic: So I think we've got a very balanced plan through this year and the way we think about the market. Certainly, the pipeline supports that and has supported it. There's an awful lot of interest in these new airplanes. So I think we've planned accordingly. And I think as I tried to give you some color in the remarks, the pipeline remains strong, and that's the best indicator of near-term future growth.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. How far out into the future does the pipeline go in terms of your level of visibility and confidence in what the order flow will look like?\nPhebe Novakovic: It doesn't stand to reason that the further out you go in the future, the less your confidence is? It's actually, I think a truism. But for what we can see, we're -- we like what we see in the pipeline.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. And Kim, did you -- I apologize if I missed it, did you provide a new free cash flow to net income conversion goal for the year? And then, I guess just any comment on how to think about that next year if there are some abnormalities this year that reverse next year?\nKimberly Kuryea: So in terms of for this year, we're still targeting the conversion rate of approaching 100%. Obviously, a lot of that cash is going to come in the fourth quarter of this year, based on our profile this year. And honestly, we are still in the planning process for next year. So we're not at the point that we're ready to give any cash flow guidance for next year.\nNoah Poponak: Okay, thank you.\nPhebe Novakovic: So Adra [ph], I think we have time for just one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. That question comes from Matt Akers at Wells Fargo.\nMatthew Akers: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question.\nPhebe Novakovic: Good morning.\nMatthew Akers: There was a fire at the Camden, Arkansas facility. Can you guys comment if that was material at all and if that is back online at this point?\nPhebe Novakovic: Well, that was a tragedy for the individual, the family and for us. From a business perspective, it's a very small line.\nMatthew Akers: Got it. Thanks. And I guess if you could comment on maybe the outlook at NASSCO? Just between the repair work and you guys recently won the sub tender work there, just kind of how you see the outlook for that yard?\nPhebe Novakovic: So NASSCO learning and performance on the T-AO, the oiler is going quite well. We're delivering the seventh of the A-class ESB, and repair continues to be pretty strong as the demand from the U.S. Navy is increasing.\nNicole Shelton: Thank you, everyone for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the second quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have any additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3152.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "A - Kimberly Kuryea",
            "content": "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with orders. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective at $10 billion, with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 0.8:1 for the company. This was achieved in the quarter when revenue grew 18% over last year, and there were no significant shipbuilding contracts awarded. Aerospace had a book-to-bill of 0.9:1, while revenue grew over 40% sequentially with the initial deliveries of the G700. On the defense side of the business, Combat Systems did particularly well with a book-to-bill of 1.5:1, and Technologies was 1:1. We ended the quarter with backlog of $91.3 billion, essentially even with where we were a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at nearly $130 billion. Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. We generated $814 million of operating cash flow. After capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $613 million for the quarter, yielding a cash conversion rate of 68%. Technologies led the segments with strong cash flow generation in the quarter. When you consider the free cash flow through the first half of 2024, we are slightly positive at $176 million and about $250 million ahead of what we had planned. After the planned slow start in the first half, we expect significant second half growth. With the majority of the cash generated in the fourth quarter, we are still planning a cash conversion rate around 100% for the year. So you may be wondering what's driving cash to be so backloaded this year. It's apparent from our balance sheet that we have been building up working capital in the first half of the year, which we expect to substantially unwind in the second half. One obvious driver of this is Gulfstream with the ramp-up for the certification and deliveries of the G700. The planned G700 deliveries in the second half are significant, which will reduce working capital. Another large contributor to the growth in working capital has been Combat Systems. They have several programs that pay at delivery. Thus, we are buying material in the first half of the year that results in product deliveries and cash in the second half of the year. Combat is also subject to the timing of deposits on international programs, and the first half of the year has been a period of liquidating deposits received in prior periods. Now turning to capital deployment. Capital expenditures were $201 million or 1.7% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year and slightly above 2% of sales when the year wraps up. Also in the quarter, we paid $389 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 119,000 shares of stock for $34 million. Through the first half, we repurchased only a modest number of shares for a total of $139 million, driven largely by our 2024 cash profile. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $1.4 billion and a net debt position of $7.9 billion, down over $300 million from last quarter. As a reminder, we have an additional $500 million of fixed rate notes maturing in the fourth quarter that we plan to repay with cash on hand. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $84 million compared to $89 million last year. That brings the interest expense for the first half of the year to $166 million, down from $180 million for the same period in 2023 on lower debt balances. At this point, our expectation for interest expense for the year remains unchanged at approximately $320 million. Finally, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 17%, bringing the tax rate for the first half to 17.2%. This rate is a little lower than our outlook for the full-year, which remains around 17.5%. For the second half of the year, we expect the rate to be lower in the third quarter and then a bit higher in the fourth due to typical timing items. Phebe, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you."

            "content": "Yes. But I would say that when you look at the cash profile for the rest of the year, most of that cash does come in the fourth quarter. So most of that working capital will unwind in the fourth quarter, not the third quarter. Yes. So in terms of for this year, we're still targeting the conversion rate of approaching 100%. Obviously, a lot of that cash is going to come in the fourth quarter of this year, based on our profile this year. And honestly, we are still in the planning process for next year. So we're not at the point that we're ready to give any cash flow guidance for next year."

            "name": "Phebe Novakovic",
            "content": "Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. Earlier this morning, we reported earnings of $3.26 per diluted share on revenue of $11.98 billion, operating earnings of $1.16 billion and net income of $905 million. We enjoyed revenue increases at each of our four business segments compared to the year ago quarter. Across the company, revenue increased a strong 18%, with a 51% increase in our Aerospace segment and a 10% increase across our defense units, strong growth by any standard. Importantly, operating earnings of $1.16 billion are up almost $200 million or 20.2%, demonstrating solid operating leverage. Similarly, net earnings are up 21.6% and earnings per share up 21% over the year ago quarter. You will note, we missed Street EPS consensus by $0.02 due entirely to the slip of 4 G700 deliveries from the last week in the quarter to the beginning Q3. One has since been delivered, three are imminent. From a different perspective, the sequential comparisons are also quite favorable. Revenue was up $1.2 billion and operating earnings are up $120 million on steady margins. On a year-to-date basis, revenue of $22.7 billion is up $2.67 billion or 13.3% over last year's first half. Operating earnings of nearly $2.2 billion are up 15.4%. Net earnings of $1.7 billion are up 15.6% despite a higher provision for income taxes. In a few minutes, our CFO, Kim Kuryea, will provide you with free cash flow for the first half and remainder of the year, our strong continued order activity and backlog, as well as some additional relevant financial information. But first, I will take you through each of the segments. We'll start with Aerospace. Let me give you some comparative numbers that will show the front end of a tremendous growth surge for Aerospace that will progress favorably throughout the year. Then I will attempt to put all of this in some reasonable perspective for you. Aerospace had revenue of $2.94 billion and operating earnings of $319 million with a 10.9% operating margin. Revenue is $987 million more than last year's second quarter, a remarkable 51% increase. The revenue increase was driven by additional new aircraft deliveries, coupled with higher service revenue. We delivered 37 aircraft, including 11 newly certified G700s in the quarter. This is four fewer than we expected to deliver, but more about that in a minute. Operating earnings of $319 million are up $83 million, 35% over the year ago quarter. The 10.9% operating margin was 120 basis points lower than the year ago quarter. This was driven by G700 deliveries that carried more than expected costs from three things: First, retrofit; second, out-of-station work related to the late arrival of parts; and three, the extended certification period. This cost burden will affect 20 lot one aircraft, which includes five test aircraft that will not deliver this year. So we are through the lot one cost burden for this year within the next four deliveries. The good news is that margins on the G700 are expected to increase by 600 to 700 basis points in lot two and by a similar increment in lot three. By the time we reach lot three production and deliveries, we will have reached a steady state in terms of productivity and predictability. A few comments on predictability. You might recall that I told you we expected to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year and that the deliveries would be more or less evenly divided over the last three quarters of the year. But we planned 15 for Q2 and deliver 11. So much for predictability. We actually had the remaining four completed and ready to go, but could not get through the preflight delivery testing in time. You might be surprised to learn that each G700 has flown about 30 hours of tests before delivery. Two of the planes also needed a supplemental type certificate because of a very different cabin configuration. That wasn't done by the end of the quarter. All right, back to some numerical comparisons. The sequential numbers are equally impressive. Revenue is up $856 million, a strong 41% increase, and operating earnings are up $64 million, about 25%, affected by 130 basis point degradation in operating margins for the reason I just mentioned a moment ago. You will see much stronger operating margins in the third quarter, followed by even better operating margin and related earnings in the fourth quarter. Separately, we still expect to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year. Look for about 16 in the third quarter and 23 to 25 in the fourth quarter. From an orders perspective, we had a respectable quarter at 0.9:1 book-to-bill in dollar terms. There is strong interest in a fair pipeline across the product mix. As I noted last quarter, bringing transactions to close has elongated somewhat, as there is some caution, while customers digest the impact of geopolitical events in general and U.S. presidential election in particular. The United States remains our strongest market, but the yield is improving. The Middle East shows very strong potential. And just very recently, we have seen some improvement in China. The interest level of buyers and the expiration of accelerated depreciation at the end of the year suggests a reasonably strong order intake in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. We are pleased to have both G700 FAA and EASA certifications behind us. The Aerospace comparative revenue and earnings numbers in the quarter are very good by any reasonable standard, but still behind consensus, largely attributable to deliveries that did not make it to the wire. In summary, the Aerospace team had a very good quarter. It is handling the rapid increase in deliveries and revenue on a methodical and disciplined fashion. We look forward to a powerful second half with increasing revenue and earnings quarter-over-quarter as we forecasted at the end of last quarter. Moving to the defense business as a collective. We once again saw strong growth and good operating performance across the portfolio. Let me walk you through each segment in turn. First, Combat Systems. Combat Systems had revenue of almost $2.3 billion, up 19% over the year ago quarter, with growth at each of the three business units. Earnings of $313 million are up almost 25%, and margins at 13.7% represent a 70 basis point increase over the Q2 last year. In short, very strong operating performance from Combat Systems. The increased revenue came from facilities expansion and artillery work in our ammo business, coupled with increases in international tank and wheeled vehicle sales and U.S. Army programs of record. Each of the businesses increased earnings nicely, with particularly strong operating leverage in our international vehicle business. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 8.8% and earnings rose 11%. Year-to-date, revenue of about $4.4 billion is up 19.3% and earnings of $595 million are up almost $100 million, or 20%. Combat saw robust order intake with over $3.4 billion awarded in Q2, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.5:1 for the quarter. Orders came from across the portfolio, ranging from ammunition to main battle tanks for the U.S. Army and wheeled vehicles for an international customers. Demand remained steady, particularly for the Abrams main battle tank and international wheeled vehicles. We expect demand for ammo to continue to rise for some time to come as we rapidly increase production of our artillery shells and components. All in all, a very strong growth and performance quarter for Combat Systems. Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding group is demonstrating strong revenue growth. Marine Systems revenue of $3.45 billion is up $394 million, almost 13% against the year ago quarter. Columbia-class construction and engineering volume drove the growth, while Virginia-class and DDG-51 revenue also increased nicely. Operating earnings are $245 million, up $10 million over the year ago quarter with a 60 basis points decrease in operating margin. Margins were impacted by continued delays to EB from the submarine industrial base, partially offset by improvement in DDG-51 performance of Bath and continued steady performance at NASSCO. Sequentially, revenue increased 3.7% and earnings improved 5.6% in Q2, driven by volume at EB, as we saw some quarter-over-quarter improvement in supply chain deliveries to the yard and continued positive performance at NASSCO. Year-to-date, Marine revenue of $6.8 billion is up 12.1% and earnings of $477 million are up 7%. As I noted a moment ago, although the supply chain is improving in places, EB continues to be impacted by late deliveries from the supply chain, which both delay schedule and impacts costs. At a sequence work on multi-ton modules is time-consuming and expensive. Our strategy, as you know, has been to increase our productivity to somewhat offset that impact. To that end, throughput, a significant measure of productivity, continues to improve, hiring is good and attrition is lower, so all good signs. In summary, we are starting to see some momentum build in our shipyards to meet the delivery and repair requirements of our customer, the U.S. Navy. We anticipate that all of our yards are now well positioned for slow, but steady incremental margin growth over time with fewer perturbations. Finally, Technologies. The group had another good quarter with revenue of nearly $3.3 billion, up 2.5% over the year ago quarter and operating earnings of $320 million, up 13.1% on a 90 basis point improvement in margin. This nice improvement in operating performance was across both businesses. GDIT margins increased 40 basis points, emission systems margins were up 130 basis points as they continue to recover from supply chain impacts experienced in 2023 and before. Sequentially, revenue was up $81 million or 2.5% and operating earnings are up 8.5% on a 50 basis points improvement in margin. And the story is much the same for the year-to-date with revenue of $6.5 billion, up about 1%, and operating earnings of $615 million, up 5.7% against the first six months of last year. As a result, margins for the group were up 40 basis points year-to-date to 9.4%. So all relevant comparisons this quarter show revenue and earnings growth and a margin expansion of both businesses, positioning them well going forward. In short, GDIT is holding its industry-leading margins, while consistently delivering year-over-year growth, while Mission Systems is delivering nice margin expansion as it transitions from sunsetting legacy programs. The group received $3.3 billion in orders in the quarter, bringing the total of $7.2 billion for the first six months. That results in a book-to-bill for the group of 1.0 for the quarter and 1.1 for the year-to-date. Total awards for the group in the first half were up 30% compared with the first six months of 2023. This is on the strength of win rates consistently around 80% for the group and capture rates at roughly 65%, both very strong for this industry. Backlog was down slightly from the end of the first quarter due to the removal of backlog associated with an international divestiture in the quarter, but was up almost $200 million from a year ago. As importantly, the qualified pipeline remains very robust at over $120 billion. So the group is well positioned to continue its growth trajectory. Let me now turn the call over to Kim. All right. Thanks, Kim. Let me move on to give you updated forecast for the year. The figures I'm about to give you are all compared to our January forecast, which will be posted along with today's guidance on our website. In Aerospace, we are sticking with our same earnings estimate, but we'll get there with higher revenue and about a 100 basis point drop in margins for all the reasons I mentioned to you a few minutes ago. We are still holding to our delivery estimate of about 160 airplanes. With respect to the defense businesses, Combat will have revenue of about $200 million higher than previously projected as a result of continued demand. So look for total revenue of about $8.7 billion. Margin should be about the same. All in, operating earnings will be up $30 million over the previous forecast. Marine Systems revenue should be up $1 billion of Electric Boat and somewhat at Bath. So we will have annual revenue between $13.4 billion and $13.8 billion with an operating margin around 7.4%, with operating earnings up around $45 million over the January forecast. For Technologies, we are not changing our earlier guidance to you. On a company wide basis, we see annual revenue up about $2 billion, with overall margins down about 30 basis points. So total revenue of $47.8 billion to $48.2 billion, and operating earnings up modestly. All up, that indicates EPS guidance of $14.40 to $14.50, $0.05 over prior guidance. I will note that normally, this time of year, we have solid insight into revenue and margin. In this growth environment, the upside has been difficult to predict with equal clarity. Should anything materially change in Q3, I will give you another credit guidance. That concludes my remarks, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Sure. So very late in the certification process, we had a requirement to bind together some wires in the tail of the airplane. So relatively simple fix. For those airplanes that we had already built, we took the tails off. For those that we were building, we just didn't put them on. So this is largely behind us. And contributed to a bit to the cost impact on lot one. But I would note that it's extremely hard to discern anything meaningful looking from the outside in here. This is, as I said, largely behind us and was pretty late in the process. And not particularly difficult to do. Right. Think about the supply chain as more a question of cost than delivery. Good morning. So we tried to give you some color around that. In the remarks, I'd say that we typically see in any U.S. presidential election, a slowdown around the election. And I think this won't be any different. But we do expect, as I noted in my remarks, a more robust fourth quarter because we've got the expiration of the accelerated depreciation. And the pipeline is quite good. And I gave you also some color around the geographical distribution there. So all in all, there's quite a bit of interest in our airplanes. It is, and we ought to fly very soon. Good morning. Sure. So let me take each part of your question in turn. So the Navy, working quite closely with the Congress, allocated significant funding for the industrial base, as you noted. That money has begun to flow, and it is intended for another, and it's targeted for a number of uses. One, increased throughput; two, some facilitization, some training, increased hiring. And so it's been really critical, and we've been pushing very hard to get that money as fast as we possibly can into the supply chain to help stabilize them. And let me put it to you this way. There are some supply chain providers who are improving and improving quite nicely. We still have some challenges out there that are pretty well publicized, but we're continuing to work with the U.S. Navy on how to the extent that those can be mitigated. So we continue to see cost impacts from late deliveries of out-of-sequence work, as I noted in my remarks. But we continue to be hopeful. We are hopeful that the additional funding that we're putting into the supply chain should help stabilize over time. So with respect to your 10% margin, that certainly is our goal. I think the supply chain has to stabilize. We've got to come down our learning curves on Columbia. Virginia throughput has to increase. So we will ultimately stabilize in the Marine group. And I will notice, by the way, I think you mentioned something about the workforce. We have, in the last year or so had no difficulty in hiring at our shipyards, and our training program has been pretty robust. So we've got shipbuilders coming out of that training program with a higher than typical level of proficiency. Our retention is also much better. So that gives us some confidence in the throughput and productivity capacity of the shipyards. But everything in shipbuilding is slow. So it's small, incremental improvement over time. But I think 10% is a reasonable goal over time, and there's no way to estimate that with any precision. Not going to speculate, but it is objective. Good morning. Yes. So I tried to give you a lot of color on that in my remarks. But with respect to the binding of some of those wires in the tail, that's largely behind us. And with respect to the margin trajectory, we see nice margin improvement in this quarter and then again in the fourth quarter. Think about the fourth quarter as mid- to high-upper teens. I tried to give you that in my remarks, but this is really a Lot 1 issue. So on the service side, services, as we said before, will grow with the expansion of the fleet. Our objective is to get as much of the Gulfstream worked as possible, and we've got the vast preponderance of that already. Services is growing this year. As is, by the way, special mission, which is driving a lot of the revenue increase this year, but we should see nice steady growth over time in the service sector. And there's no real -- with respect to services, there's no real difference in any of the competitive environment. So we continue to see a very active pipeline. I think the available market at the moment is over $120 billion, it's pretty robust. And we've been winning our fair share and a little bit more than our fair share. So we believe that over time, that will continue as it has in the last couple of years drive services growth and frankly, at Mission Systems as well. So I think technology is positioned for a nice steady slow growth, which is exactly what we have promised in the past and what we're delivering. So pretty steady. Hi, George. Yes. So the Lot 1 consisted of about 20 or so airplanes. All five are test airplanes, they'll deliver next year. But this year, the Lot 1 costs are going to be behind us imminently. We've delivered one of the four. And I tried to give you some color on the delivery process. And the other three imminent here. So I think we're in pretty good shape on that. Does that help you? Nothing that I can put my finger on, to be quite honest, in the moment. Pretty good for us. The service business, and we expect it to continue to grow this year, which is driving a lot of the revenue increase, along with special mission. Good morning. So the bookings continue to reflect the threat environment. Both that they were driven in the quarter, both by international vehicle orders and U.S. ammunition and Army programs of record. And I think we'll see as we're going forward, I'd say that Combat Systems is typically, as we talked about in the past, probably a mid-14% margin business, but it will have quarter variability, sometimes up around 15%. So it's really a question of mix. In the moment, we see increased what we call sustainment, think about repair and support, which tends to carry a little higher margin. And you didn't exactly ask this question, but I'll sort of answer it. As we move from the lower margin facilitization work to the higher-margin throughput on -- that's generated like the throughput on ammunition, you'll see a little bit of margin expansion there. I don't think we've broken out cash for you by business group. I think Kim tends to give you a fair amount of color on what was going on in the third and particularly the fourth quarter of unwinding some of the prebuilds in Combat with the deliveries of those vehicles and material. Hi, Doug. I'd say there's good potential for higher margins along the lines that we had seen in the past. But exactly when at this point, it's hard to pinpoint. But I think we're pretty confident and pleased with long-term margin trajectory at Aerospace for all the reasons that I think you quite potently listed. Well, it's hard to look into a crystal ball much past a planning period. But we anticipate for the next couple of years, increased munitions orders as dictated by the threat environment. And we're pretty confident in that. So that's kind of how I look at it. It's awfully difficult to predict the threat environment with any kind of clarity other than pure speculation outside the next couple of years. Yes, a couple of years. I wasn't clear on that. I apologize. Yes, I'd say a couple of years of this. I'd say three, four years max, somewhere along those lines. And then we'll see. I think there have been some profound lessons learned about the criticality of munitions, ammunition. So I expect those to be incorporated in force is thinking. A couple of things, including services, as I had noticed, increase in services and also an increase in special mission which are kind of lumpy, as you know, and we've talked about in the past. Planning purposes is the latter. But that's probably all the clarity we've got at the moment. It all depends on the certification process, but we anticipate, I think and reasonably anticipate that they'll come out of the gate very strong. Yes. It's typical lot quantities. Good morning. So we opened up the facility. The first line is running and producing as we anticipated. We are standing up lines 3 and 4. So that's a material increase in the throughput of that facility, but it's a modern facility with a very strong and good workforce. So we're pretty encouraged that we will quickly come down our learning curves and produce at or above our plan. Good morning. I will take that in the inverse order. Don't anticipate any particular changes in AJAX. The vehicle is performing extremely well. The U.K. Army is pleased with it. So I think that, that's a standard piece of kit for the U.K. Army. With respect to the U.S., I think it's -- the Ukrainian supplemental certainly helped, but was not the only source of funding for munitions. And frankly, the munitions demand is a reality independent of, I think a lot of other things based on the lessons learned that most land forces, I believe have incorporated at this point. So we expect that to continue. Good morning. The supply chain has improved, but it is not completely healed yet. So I suspect we'll continue to have some out-of-station work. I think that in this growth environment, revenue has been harder for us to predict. And just the input of contract executions and the impact of contract execution. So that's why we have a little less clarity than we typically do at this point, as revenue is a bit harder for us to identify with the kind of certainty that we typically can. I don't have that exact comparison, but these are going to be very healthy margins, as you can imagine, on these airplanes. So this is -- we continue to see a strong growth profile for the Marine Group for the foreseeable future. In fact, for some time to come. Driven by, as I noted before, the threat environment. So growth is continuing. Some years, it will be a higher rate of growth than others, but it is a growth trajectory. Good morning. So I think we've got a very balanced plan through this year and the way we think about the market. Certainly, the pipeline supports that and has supported it. There's an awful lot of interest in these new airplanes. So I think we've planned accordingly. And I think as I tried to give you some color in the remarks, the pipeline remains strong, and that's the best indicator of near-term future growth. It doesn't stand to reason that the further out you go in the future, the less your confidence is? It's actually, I think a truism. But for what we can see, we're -- we like what we see in the pipeline. So Adra [ph], I think we have time for just one more question. Good morning. Well, that was a tragedy for the individual, the family and for us. From a business perspective, it's a very small line. So NASSCO learning and performance on the T-AO, the oiler is going quite well. We're delivering the seventh of the A-class ESB, and repair continues to be pretty strong as the demand from the U.S. Navy is increasing."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. \n And I would now like to turn the conference over to Nicole Shelton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nNicole Shelton: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company's 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings. \n We will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional disclosures about these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures, please see the slides that accompany this webcast, which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, investorrelations.gd.com. \n On the call today are Phebe Novakovic, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Kim Kuryea, Chief Financial Officer. \n I will now turn the call over to Phebe. \nPhebe Novakovic: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.88 per diluted share on revenue of $10.7 billion, operating earnings of $1.036 billion and net earnings of $799 million. These results compare quite favorably to the year ago quarter. Revenue is up 8.6% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up 10.4%. Net earnings are up 9.5%. As a result, earnings per diluted share up $0.24, or 9.1% more than the year ago quarter. The operating margin for the entire company was 9.7%, a 20 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter. \n Overall, these numbers represent a very strong quarter and a good start to 2024. However, we fell below our own expectations for the quarter and below analyst consensus, which is predicated at least in part on our forecast. The rather obvious explanation is that we forecast 15 to 17 G700 deliveries in the quarter, which did not happen. \n We received FAA certification for the G700 at the very end of the quarter, too late to make any G700 deliveries. This obviously impacted revenue and earnings in the Aerospace group in the quarter. The good news is that we now have certification, and the delay in deliveries does not change our outlook for the year. Gulfstream still plans to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year. So our Aerospace forecast for the year remains unchanged. I'll give you a little more color on this later in my remarks. Another good news, as you can see, was strong performance across the defense portfolio. In short, we performed very well in the quarter over those things within our control. \n At this point, let me ask Kim Kuryea, our CFO, to provide details on our order activity, solid backlog and cash activity before I come back with segment observations. \nKimberly Kuryea: Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with orders and backlog. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1:1 for the company. Order activity was particularly strong in the Combat Systems group with a book-to-bill of 1.6:1 and in the Aerospace and Technologies segment, which each had a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. We ended the quarter with total backlog of $93.7 billion, up slightly from year-end and up 4% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at approximately $134 billion, up 1.5% from year-end. \n Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. We had an expected slow start to the year, absent the delayed certification and entry into service of the G700 and continued G700 inventory build. \n So let's start with Technologies. We continue to see strong cash performance from that group in the quarter. As anticipated, Combat Systems and Marine Systems both built working capital in the quarter based on their unique mix of contract timing versus expected payments. \n Finally, moving to Aerospace. The lack of G700 deliveries drove us to use cash in the quarter. As a result, our free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $437 million. Since all of what I described is timing related, we still have an expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate around 100%. We expect most of the negative free cash flow to reverse in the second quarter, followed by substantially improving free cash flow in each of the third and fourth quarters. \n Now to discuss our capital deployment activities. Capital expenditures were $159 million, or 1.5% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to increase in subsequent quarters throughout the year, as we anticipate spending between 2% and 2.5% of revenue on CapEx this year. Over 50% of that expected spend will be for infrastructure at our 3 shipyards as we continue to invest to support the Navy submarine and shipbuilding plan. \n Also in the quarter, we paid $361 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 390,000 shares of stock for $105 million at just under $269 per share. When you add it all up, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of around $1 billion and a net debt position of $8.2 billion. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $82 million compared with $91 million for the same quarter last year. The reduction in interest expense was attributed to our lower debt balances. \n Finally, turning to income taxes. We had a 17.5% effective tax rate in the quarter, right in line with our full year guidance, which reflects higher taxes on foreign earnings. \n Phebe, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you. \nPhebe Novakovic: Thanks, Kim. Now let me review the quarter in the context of the business segments and provide detailed color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace did very well in the absence of the G700 delivery. It had revenue of $2.1 billion and operating earnings of $255 million with a 12.2% operating margin. Revenue is $192 million more than last year's first quarter, a 10.1% increase. \n To give you a little detail here, the increase was driven by an increase in new aircraft deliveries and an increase in services at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation, partially offset by significantly lower special mission aircraft activity, which is always lumpy. The 24 deliveries in the quarter are fewer than planned but 3 more than the year ago quarter. The mix in the quarter favored large cabin and the 650 in particular, which helped both revenue and earnings. Operating earnings of $255 million are up $26 million over last year's first quarter, an 11.4% increase. Earnings on both new aircraft and aircraft services enjoyed good increases, offset in part by lower earnings on special mission, higher G&A and net R&D. \n While Gulfstream will continue to experience part shortages that cause significant out-of-station work, which is inherently less efficient, the supply chain is clearly improving and much more predictable. As is now apparent, we plan to deliver a considerable number of G700s in 2024, the first 20 to be delivered or fully built, and deliveries have begun. By the end of this month, the next 7 to 8 will be ready. We plan to deliver these 50 to 52 planes over the quarters in relatively even numbers, with improving margins quarter-over-quarter as we go along. The first one, what we call the lot 1, carries some cost and retrofit burden that will not affect subsequent aircraft deliveries. So expect margins in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter with significant improvement in Q3 and Q4. \n Aerospace had a decent quarter from an orders perspective with a book-to-bill of 1.2:1 in dollar terms. Sales activity and customer interest is evident this quarter, but concerns over persistent inflation and monetary policy in the U.S., together with concerns about conflict in the Middle East, has slowed the consummation of transactions to some degree. It is also worth noting that a significant portion of the demand we see is fleet replenishment for corporations. These multi-aircraft deals usually proceed at a slower pace. \n The G800 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature. We continue to target certification of G800 for 9 months after the G700 certification, although I'm increasingly reluctant to give estimates about these things that are ultimately out of our control. In short, the Aerospace team had a good quarter. G700 FAA certification is in the rearview mirror, and we hope EASA certification is hard on its heels. And we expect nicely improving margins, particularly in the second half. \n Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $2.1 billion, up almost 20% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $282 million are up 15.1%. Margins at 13.4% are down 60 basis points over the year ago quarter. It is interesting to observe that this very strong increase in revenue is in comparison to last year's first quarter, which enjoyed a 5% increase over '22. \n We saw increased revenue performance in each of the 3 businesses. The increase came from higher volume on new international tank programs, higher artillery program volume and higher volume on PIRANHA's programs and bridges. We also experienced very strong order performance. Orders in the quarter drove total backlog to $15.6 billion, up $1.5 billion from this time in the year ago quarter. \n Demand for Combat Systems and products continues to increase, particularly in Europe and in some lines of business in the U.S. Orders for wheeled and tracked combat vehicles are up significantly, reflecting the heightened threat environment. In addition to several new combat vehicle starts, demand for Abrams also continues. We've seen tank orders from new users, and a number of countries will be introducing Abrams into their combat fleets for the first time. \n Since Q1 last year, we have received almost $1 billion in orders from both U.S. allies through FMS and the U.S. Army. In the U.S., we are rapidly increasing ammunition production with the opening of our Texas facility, which will increase current 155-millimeter ammo capacity by 83%. As the year goes on, we will continue to work with our Army customer to further increase ammo capacity to meet their requirements. \n Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me repeat the recent history that I gave you last year at this time with respect to growth in this decade. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against Q1 of 2019; Q1 '21 was up 10.6% over Q1 '20; Q1 '22 was up 6.8% over Q1 '21; and Q1 '23 was up 12.9% over Q1 '22. Finally, this quarter at $3.3 billion is up 11.3% over Q1 '23. \n This is an impressive growth ramp by any standard. However, growth ramps of this character bring with them supply chain and operation issues that are challenging. This particular quarter's growth was almost exclusively Columbia-class construction. \n Operating earnings are $232 million in the quarter, up 10% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin is basically the same as last year's quarter. We anticipate that this will improve as we progress through the year. \n As we have talked about in previous calls, the story at the marine group is efficiently managing the growth propelled by the U.S. Navy's need for ships, particularly submarines. As a labor-intensive heavy manufacturing industry, the shipbuilding industrial base was hit hard by the demographic impacts of COVID. This, coupled with a number of sole-source suppliers of highly complex components, has made it difficult for the industrial base to keep pace with increasing demand. \n The significant financial investments we have made in our shipyards over the last 12 years, particularly at Electric Boat, has mitigated the impact on us, but we are still hit by schedule and quality problems in the supply chain. Our job is to minimize the efficiency and schedule impacts of late material by increasing our throughput. And we are doing that each and every quarter. In Q1 alone, our productivity increased 11%, but there is more to do. Finally, the Navy's investment in the supply chain has helped and will continue to help as we move forward. \n For Technologies, we're off to a solid start. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion is down less than 1% from the prior year but up 2% over the fourth quarter of last year, and modestly ahead of our expectation to the start of the year. Operating earnings of $295 million are consistent with last year, yielding a margin of 9.2%. As we have previously discussed, margins will continue to be driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volumes. \n The group received $4 billion in orders during the quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2:1. Both businesses experienced strong order activity, in GDIT's case, the highest book-to-bill since mid-2019. This led to a total backlog of $13.5 billion, an increase of over 5% from a year ago and total estimated contract value of $42.7 billion. \n The story in Technologies is one of steady growth, particularly at GDIT and increasingly at Mission Systems as they transition from legacy programs to new programs and faster-growth lines of business. Both businesses have robust pipelines driven by their respective investments in different technologies. The group's continued focus on margin performance will result in sequential margin expansion throughout the year as they continue to build their backlog and grow. \n As you know, we never update guidance at this time of year. Apart from what I have already said about Aerospace, I will stick to that custom. We do, however, confirm the guidance we gave you at the end of last quarter, and we'll update it at midpoint of the year, as we typically do. \n This concludes my remarks with respect to what was, in many respects, a rewarding quarter. Let me now turn the call back to Nicole to take your questions. \nNicole Shelton: Thank you, Phebe. [Operator Instructions] Operator, could you please remind participants how to enter the queue? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. \nScott Deuschle: Kim, can you clarify the G700 delivery expectation for the second quarter? Is it the 20 that are ready to go plus the 7 to 8 that will be ready at the end of this month? \nPhebe Novakovic: So let me kind of tackle that. I alluded to it in my opening statement. But we're -- we have 50 to 52 airplanes that are going to deliver in about equal amounts of the 700 in the second through the fourth quarters. So think about it that way. So I think that will help you. \nScott Deuschle: Okay. And then, Phebe, I was hoping you could spend a moment maybe talking about the growth that Combat Systems is currently seeing in Europe and perhaps how you expect that to trend over the coming quarters. \nPhebe Novakovic: So the growth in Europe is clearly driven by the threat environment. We've seen increases in orders for combat, wheeled and tracked vehicles and significant bridge orders. We're also seeing increased orders coming out of various countries in Europe for Abrams through the FMS process. So we see that demand signal continuing until the threat environment, frankly, improves. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. \nSeth Seifman: Looking to marine. When we think about the expectation for the profit margin for the year and kind of where we started, are there kind of visible milestones that you see through the remainder of the year that bring that number higher? Or kind of is it a change in mix? Or kind of what drives the underlying margin improvement through the year? \nPhebe Novakovic: So two things. One is the increase in productivity at each of the shipyards, and we see that and we've been seeing that for the last few quarters. And it's also fewer disruptions from the supply chain. So those are the two primary factors. \nSeth Seifman: Right. Okay, okay. Great. And then just when we think about -- I think you mentioned some of the headwinds to demand at Gulfstream from here in terms of monetary policy, geopolitical issues. Just to kind of affirm the expectation for 160 deliveries this year and the way that the backlog will trend through the year, the expectation is that, that's a very sustainable number with potential for that to grow in the years beyond. \nPhebe Novakovic: So let me clarify a bit. I don't see concerns about inflation or monetary policy impacting demand. It really is just impacting the time from the initiation of a potential interest to the closure of an order, which is also impacted somewhat by large fleet -- airplane fleet orders from corporate customers. So think about it that way, more of a timing issue with the completion of the deals and not a headwind to overall demand. So I think that's an important nuance. And we're still sticking to our delivery guidance for the year. And I think on a going-forward basis, as we've intimated before, we see that those deliveries increasing over time. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. \nRobert Stallard: Phebe, I was wondering if you could comment on the recently passed or soon to be signed supplemental and what implications that could have for the combat business, but also on the submarine side, what sort of additional funding could come from the U.S. Navy? \nPhebe Novakovic: So let me take them in the inverse order. On the submarine side, the preponderance of the funding in the supplemental is to help stabilize the industrial base, ensuring that we continue to drive order activity on a consistent and repeatable basis. So that is really on the submarine side. In combat, I think you can see there's a fair amount of ammo funding, and we had fully anticipated that. \nRobert Stallard: Okay. And then just secondly, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the AJAX program in the U.K. \nPhebe Novakovic: So it is proceeding extremely well through test, continue to work with that customer, but they are very pleased with the performance of the vehicle. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. \nSheila  Kahyaoglu: I wanted to ask one about Aerospace, and I'm sorry for putting you on the spot with the mental math. But last year -- or last quarter, you talked about the G700 profit contribution being around 25%. So when we think about the Q1 performance, it was actually really good relative to our number of 12.1% margin. It would imply you see a deceleration in the underlying business for Aerospace just given G700 comes in at 50 units. So I guess, how do we think about the mix movement throughout the year for Aerospace? \nPhebe Novakovic: Well, let's talk about the first predicate in that question. I don't believe we've ever disclosed any margin on a particular airplane, and we haven't there. I think we can't -- it can't take and discern revenue and earnings in any given quarter as attributable to one airplane. So I think you need to think about it holistically.\n But we see the -- we don't see any real changes in the mix throughout the year. And we'll do a detailed bottom-up review in Q2. But for right now, we're sticking with both our mix, our earnings, our margin and revenue expectations. So we're off to a pretty good start, I'd say. And we're very encouraged at how the outlook looks for the rest of the year. \nSheila  Kahyaoglu: Can we assume that G700 is accretive to the 15% full year guidance? \nPhebe Novakovic: So think about it this way. This is ultimately going to be a very profitable program. But as I explained in my remarks, the first lot of 20 or so carries with it additional cost. We'll see those in -- largely in Q2. So think about Q2 as an increase in revenue of about $1 billion to $1.1 billion and in earnings of about $100 million to $110 million, and then progress nicely thereafter. And again, that's all impacted by the multiplicity of factors in our Aerospace business that drive margins. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from David Strauss with Barclays. \nDavid Strauss: Phebe, so Rob's question on the supplemental and the submarine industrial base money, so there's money there. There's a lot of money in the base budget, it appears. You're spending additional CapEx today that you'll eventually recover through working capital, profit. How does -- I mean, it's a lot of money. I mean how does that manifest itself in your numbers as we think about over the next couple of years? \nPhebe Novakovic: So for the supply chain support, it has minimal impact on us. It's, however, extremely important because the stabilization of the supply chain is critical to the resumption of full cadence on Virginia and the increased cadence on Columbia.\n So funding is also robust for submarines. We've got one we projected in '25. And then it would be extremely helpful to get a full ship set of Virginias also appropriated because that, again, helps stabilize the industrial base with repeatable revenue that they can plan around. \nDavid Strauss: Okay. Last quarter, you made some more kind of positive comments regarding the potential for share repurchase to step up. Obviously, you did a little bit this quarter, but not that much. How are you thinking about that now? Did that have to do with the fact that you ended up burning cash in Q1? Just how you're thinking about share repo and the balance sheet from here. \nPhebe Novakovic: So the way we think about share repurchases, and this will be true going forward, is really in the regular order. Recall what we were facing in Q1. And that was we're looking down the throat of a potential, and at some point looked very likely, government shutdown. And so I think that prudence and conservatism in the face of that kind of uncertainty is really key. But the cash performance for the remainder of the year is going to be very strong, and we will act accordingly. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. \nNoah Poponak: Phebe, what's the framework for the pace of G700 deliveries beyond this year compared to this year? Not asking for quarterly numbers or anything like that, but just given this year's had some abnormalities compared to a recurring airplane. And then, Kim, just what's the updated view on free cash flow to net income conversion for the year? \nPhebe Novakovic: Well, so let me talk about 700. We never, except I think, on 1 or 2 occasions about 5, 6 years ago, give the future year expectations. But 700 is a very, very successful program, and it will continue to execute well.\n I'll turn it over to Kim on cash. \nKimberly Kuryea: On cash. Thank you, Phebe. So with respect to cash and the expectation, we still anticipate achieving about 100% of free cash flow conversion in 2024. We had expected the first quarter to be negative even before considering the fact that we didn't deliver any G700. So we had planned for a negative free cash flow in the first quarter, and that was mostly driven by some contract timing in the Combat Systems segment and some in the Marine Systems segment. But we expect that most of that negative cash will reverse in the second quarter with a stronger third quarter and then a steeper ramp in the fourth quarter. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. \nMyles Walton: Phebe, could you comment on -- or Kim, could you comment on the margin expansion implied at Combat Systems as you move through the rest of the year? I think it has to be 80 to 100 basis points on average up year-on-year for the rest of the year. And maybe the underlying dynamics of given the volume, why we didn't see more of a drop-through margin in the first quarter? \nPhebe Novakovic: So what drove margin in the first quarter were two things: mix as we came off of older legacy programs, particularly in the vehicle world and in the U.S. and then -- and began ramping up newer programs, vehicle programs in the U.S.; and then a significant amount of the revenue growth came from facilities investment which, by definition, carries a lower margin than production. So both of those things will reverse throughout the course of the year, and combat margins will increase. Our expectation is quarter-over-quarter. Remember, this is a high operating leverage group. So they ought to do quite well here. \nMyles Walton: Okay. And one clarification on Gulfstream's backlog, if I could. I think that there were some adjustment downward in the backlog. Were those cancellations or ForEx, maybe 6 large jet cancellations or thereabouts? \nPhebe Novakovic: I don't think that's the way to look at it. But why don't Nicole get back to you on that? But we didn't have any particular notable cancellations. So let us unpack that one with you a little later. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. \nRonald Epstein: So Phebe, with the increased demand on munitions and so on and so forth, I mean, what are you doing to mitigate any of the issues that could arise from growth in those markets, just like we've seen in the Navy markets given all the demand and growth? There's been supply chain issues. Are you expecting... \nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So in the combat world, it's a little bit more of a robust supply chain in general that we typically have not had difficulty with, typically. We know our priority. The suppliers who could conceivably cause issues, and we've been working with them to ensure that they can manage this growth. But we're pretty comfortable that we can execute the growth. Our focus is really on operations and execution. And those will be the  two key drivers of the profitability in that group. \nRonald Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then maybe back to the kind of the naval side of the house and the supply chain. Could you give us any color on where there are actual weaknesses in the supply chain where investment has to be made? \nPhebe Novakovic: So I'd say in the large -- in the single-source, sole-source suppliers who are, by definition, critical. And the Navy has focused quite intensely on those particular products and supply chain items. And I think they've been pretty explicit about where some of that might be. And I think it's best to think about it that way. But we do believe that working with the Navy customer, the continued infusion into that supply chain will help stabilize. But they are the pacing item now for Electric Boat. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Doug Harned with Bernstein. \nDouglas Harned: On marine, the Navy recently described some shipbuilding delays really across programs. And the one that really stood out was Columbia-class delays reported on the turbines and the bow. Can you give us a sense of changes you've seen in schedule that affect you kind of across the program base and particularly on Columbia? \nPhebe Novakovic: So I think you've articulated what the Navy has said. I will tell you, our throughput and productivity has been strong on Columbia. It enjoys the highest national security priority. So we have done pretty well on Columbia and are increasing our throughput on Columbia. So then it's really those pacing items that are out there. And we're working with our Navy customer to see if there are additional things we can do to recover some schedule and if there are any workarounds. But this is going to be a bit of a slog for the supply chain. \nDouglas Harned: And then also on shipbuilding, inflation has affected shipbuilding costs a lot over the last few years. We've seen pricing on new awards go up. And when you look forward in the budget, is there a concern that you're basically, if you're going to -- if the Navy's budget is really going to be able to afford the kinds of inflation increases that may come along with the continued ramp in shipbuilding? \nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So I think you've known over the years, I tend not to comment on individual service budgeting. But inflation certainly has been a factor. And to the extent that we can increase throughput to offset some of that, we will. But the Navy is well aware of the inflation impact and I think is working hard with the whole shipbuilding industrial base to adjust some of that. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. \nKristine Liwag: Phebe, following up on the marine question. In addition to the delay in the Columbia class, the DoD did request one less Virginia class for the fiscal year '25 budget request. So I mean, if we take all this into perspective, can you provide some context on what this means for marine revenue growth over the next few years? And does the margin with a 7 handle on it, is that more the new norm for this business? \nPhebe Novakovic: So let me address that in the inverse order. Margins will be improving at our shipyards. We have every expectation all of our shipyards, NASSCO, Bath and Electric Boat. One of the things, as we've talked frequently about, is the margin impact of quality and schedule problems coming out of the supply chain. And as the supply chain stabilizes, that will help as well. And what was your first part of your question? \nKristine Liwag: The revenue cadence, including the just one Virginia class for fiscal year '25. \nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. Okay. So it has no impact in the short term for Electric Boat because we've got plenty of work in front of us. It could have an impact in the outer years outside of our planning horizon. But critical here is, in fact, the additional ship set of funding. We have long lead material on Virginia. That is very important to the supply chain. And to the extent that we can ensure that we get a full second Virginia ship set so that we're buying it to a year, I think, is very important for the overall health of the industrial -- submarine and industrial base. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Ken Herbert with RBC. \nKenneth Herbert: If we look, Phebe, at your comments around timing in Gulfstream, is it still fair to assume that you should be looking at a book-to-bill at 1 or greater for Gulfstream in '24? \nPhebe Novakovic: So it's a good planning assumption. It is how we are thinking about our internal planning. But let's see how we do as we start to significantly ramp up production and deliveries. So -- but as I said, that's a good planning assumption. \nKenneth Herbert: Okay. Great. And just a clarification for Kim. The comments sound like the free cash flow ramp really sort of accelerates in the second half of the year. But with all the 700 deliveries expected this quarter, free cash flow should be positive in the second quarter, correct? \nKimberly Kuryea: Yes. That's pretty much what you should assume. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. \nRobert Spingarn: Phebe, you said recently that with the -- even though the aerospace supply chain is improving, your ramp this year could challenge that improvement. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit. \nPhebe Novakovic: So we still have -- look, it's definitely improving. Quality is improving and schedule reliability is improving. But make no mistake, we still have a lot of out-of-station work. And that impacts the profitability and margin on airplanes that are experiencing that. So we definitely see improvement. We are optimistic that they can keep pace, but it's not without its margin challenges. \nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then also, I think you commented you had good bookings in Aerospace in the quarter, reflecting strong demand. But I think you've said the U.S. has been very strong. How is aircraft demand elsewhere in the world? \nPhebe Novakovic: So there's no real change, I think, from the previous quarters, U.S. corporations, private and public, high-net-worth individuals, both U.S. and outside the U.S. So no real changes, no real surprises. Sort of the typical customer base that we see is I think the way you should think about it. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Peter Arment with Baird. \nPeter Arment: Phebe, the Army wants to reach 100,000 155 shells by, I think, October 2025. Can you update us on how your ramp is going? You've discussed that, that supply chain is a little more robust. \nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So our ramp there is more about increasing the facilities that we have. And as I noted in my remarks, the opening of our Texas facility, which we worked very, very hard to expedite and frankly did it in almost record time, was very important because it increased the throughput and the productivity of the number of shells by 83%. So we're on track with the Army to get where we need to be, and our objective is to move even faster. And so far, we have been. But the Army has been a critical and extremely important partner here in what is really a national security imperative. \nPeter Arment: Yes. And then just if you could make any comments on the G280 program just given the conflict that's going on in the Middle East. \nPhebe Novakovic: So we had anticipated the impacts on the 280 in our guidance too, but I will tell you that they are doing quite well and are slightly ahead of our schedule. We're still sticking to our deliveries, but I think it's notable that they're managing pretty well in this tough environment. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. \nCai Von Rumohr: Good quarter. \nPhebe Novakovic: Thanks, Cai. \nCai Von Rumohr: So could you update us on the status of the G400? How is it doing? And is it fair to assume that it might have a gap of approximately 12 months between its certification and that of the G800? \nPhebe Novakovic: I think I said last quarter, I'm done predicting process over which we have little control. We've tried in the past to give you indicators of our internal -- or actually, our internal -- our dates. So I'm kind of out of the detailed predicting mode. I will say the program is doing extremely well. And it's -- it will fly in the third quarter, and I think we'll be flying a pretty mature airplane. \nCai Von Rumohr: Excellent. And then your R&D was up a fair amount in the first quarter. Could you give us some color of the pattern of the R&D at Gulfstream this year and looking forward? How should we think about that? \nPhebe Novakovic: Well, pretty much steady as she goes, particularly this year. We've got a number of, as you know, programs in the certification process. And so I'd see that at least through this year is pretty consistent. No real surprise this year, steady as she goes. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Jason Gursky with Citigroup. \nJason Gursky: Phebe, I wanted to just quickly go back to your comments on Aerospace and what, I guess, you described as an elongation of your sales cycle. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the overall size of the pipeline and how that is evolving. I understand things are taking longer to close, but I'd also be kind of curious to know whether there are an increasing number of people that are interested. \nPhebe Novakovic: So the pipeline remains robust. And I look to that as encouraging, a good sign. It's been that way for a while. People want our airplanes, and that's driving demand. \nJason Gursky: Okay. Great. So good metrics going on there, it sounds like. Then just really quickly on -- maybe this is a question targeted at Technologies. But I'd love to get some updated thoughts from you on artificial intelligence, AI, the adoption that you're seeing with your customers. How you see this kind of playing out and affecting your business. And then maybe, as I suggest, focused on Technologies. \nPhebe Novakovic: Yes. So we have been investing in AI to support our customers, and particularly at GDIT and somewhat at Mission Systems. And I would say that there, we're working closely with our customers. They define what the art of the possible is for them in AI. And as you all know, there are some government -- governance challenges around that. But the more sophisticated we get and our ability  to tailor AI solutions, I think the more comfortable our customer becomes and will ultimately drive some increased revenue.\n I haven't seen too much of that yet because I think the government is not like -- unlike other industries where its adoption is. People are careful, and I think properly so. And I would argue that would be true across the entirety of our business. \nOperator: Our final question today comes from Gavin Parsons with UBS. \nGavin Parsons: Phebe, you highlighted the stronger second half Aerospace margins that's a more normal volume and G700 production. Is that more of an appropriate starting point for 2025 than the full year 15%? \nPhebe Novakovic: Nice try. So look, yes, I think once you get through the first lot, our performance from a margin standpoint will continue to improve. And you'll see that, third quarter will be significantly better than second quarter, and fourth quarter will be even better still. But we will update you on our regular order. We kind of keep our discipline, as you well know, around updating guidance, and I think that, that's appropriate. \nGavin Parsons: Yes. I appreciate that detail. And then just in terms of the 100% cash conversion for the year, what's the opportunity to exceed that given last year, you were well above and you built a lot of G700 inventory? \nKimberly Kuryea: I think right now, we're just focused. Given the steep ramp in the second half of the year, we're really focusing on trying to hit that mark at this point in time. \nPhebe Novakovic: And we should get there. \nNicole Shelton: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As a reminder, please refer to the General Dynamics website for the first quarter earnings release and highlights presentation. If you have additional questions, I can be reached at (703) 876-3152. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kimberly Kuryea",
            "content": "Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll start with orders and backlog. We had a solid quarter from an orders perspective with an overall book-to-bill ratio of 1:1 for the company. Order activity was particularly strong in the Combat Systems group with a book-to-bill of 1.6:1 and in the Aerospace and Technologies segment, which each had a book-to-bill of 1.2:1. We ended the quarter with total backlog of $93.7 billion, up slightly from year-end and up 4% from a year ago. Our total estimated contract value, which includes options and IDIQ contracts, ended the quarter at approximately $134 billion, up 1.5% from year-end. \n Turning to our cash performance for the quarter. We had an expected slow start to the year, absent the delayed certification and entry into service of the G700 and continued G700 inventory build. \n So let's start with Technologies. We continue to see strong cash performance from that group in the quarter. As anticipated, Combat Systems and Marine Systems both built working capital in the quarter based on their unique mix of contract timing versus expected payments. \n Finally, moving to Aerospace. The lack of G700 deliveries drove us to use cash in the quarter. As a result, our free cash flow for the quarter was a negative $437 million. Since all of what I described is timing related, we still have an expectation for the year of a cash conversion rate around 100%. We expect most of the negative free cash flow to reverse in the second quarter, followed by substantially improving free cash flow in each of the third and fourth quarters. \n Now to discuss our capital deployment activities. Capital expenditures were $159 million, or 1.5% of sales in the quarter. Similar to last year, you should expect capital expenditures to increase in subsequent quarters throughout the year, as we anticipate spending between 2% and 2.5% of revenue on CapEx this year. Over 50% of that expected spend will be for infrastructure at our 3 shipyards as we continue to invest to support the Navy submarine and shipbuilding plan. \n Also in the quarter, we paid $361 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 390,000 shares of stock for $105 million at just under $269 per share. When you add it all up, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of around $1 billion and a net debt position of $8.2 billion. Our net interest expense in the quarter was $82 million compared with $91 million for the same quarter last year. The reduction in interest expense was attributed to our lower debt balances. \n Finally, turning to income taxes. We had a 17.5% effective tax rate in the quarter, right in line with our full year guidance, which reflects higher taxes on foreign earnings. \n Phebe, that concludes my remarks. I'll turn it back over to you. On cash. Thank you, Phebe. So with respect to cash and the expectation, we still anticipate achieving about 100% of free cash flow conversion in 2024. We had expected the first quarter to be negative even before considering the fact that we didn't deliver any G700. So we had planned for a negative free cash flow in the first quarter, and that was mostly driven by some contract timing in the Combat Systems segment and some in the Marine Systems segment. But we expect that most of that negative cash will reverse in the second quarter with a stronger third quarter and then a steeper ramp in the fourth quarter. Yes. That's pretty much what you should assume. I think right now, we're just focused. Given the steep ramp in the second half of the year, we're really focusing on trying to hit that mark at this point in time."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Phebe Novakovic",
            "content": "Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for being with us. As you can discern from our press release, we reported earnings of $2.88 per diluted share on revenue of $10.7 billion, operating earnings of $1.036 billion and net earnings of $799 million. These results compare quite favorably to the year ago quarter. Revenue is up 8.6% against the first quarter last year. Operating earnings are up 10.4%. Net earnings are up 9.5%. As a result, earnings per diluted share up $0.24, or 9.1% more than the year ago quarter. The operating margin for the entire company was 9.7%, a 20 basis point improvement over the year ago quarter. \n Overall, these numbers represent a very strong quarter and a good start to 2024. However, we fell below our own expectations for the quarter and below analyst consensus, which is predicated at least in part on our forecast. The rather obvious explanation is that we forecast 15 to 17 G700 deliveries in the quarter, which did not happen. \n We received FAA certification for the G700 at the very end of the quarter, too late to make any G700 deliveries. This obviously impacted revenue and earnings in the Aerospace group in the quarter. The good news is that we now have certification, and the delay in deliveries does not change our outlook for the year. Gulfstream still plans to deliver 50 to 52 G700s this year. So our Aerospace forecast for the year remains unchanged. I'll give you a little more color on this later in my remarks. Another good news, as you can see, was strong performance across the defense portfolio. In short, we performed very well in the quarter over those things within our control. \n At this point, let me ask Kim Kuryea, our CFO, to provide details on our order activity, solid backlog and cash activity before I come back with segment observations. Thanks, Kim. Now let me review the quarter in the context of the business segments and provide detailed color as appropriate. First, Aerospace. Aerospace did very well in the absence of the G700 delivery. It had revenue of $2.1 billion and operating earnings of $255 million with a 12.2% operating margin. Revenue is $192 million more than last year's first quarter, a 10.1% increase. \n To give you a little detail here, the increase was driven by an increase in new aircraft deliveries and an increase in services at both Gulfstream and Jet Aviation, partially offset by significantly lower special mission aircraft activity, which is always lumpy. The 24 deliveries in the quarter are fewer than planned but 3 more than the year ago quarter. The mix in the quarter favored large cabin and the 650 in particular, which helped both revenue and earnings. Operating earnings of $255 million are up $26 million over last year's first quarter, an 11.4% increase. Earnings on both new aircraft and aircraft services enjoyed good increases, offset in part by lower earnings on special mission, higher G&A and net R&D. \n While Gulfstream will continue to experience part shortages that cause significant out-of-station work, which is inherently less efficient, the supply chain is clearly improving and much more predictable. As is now apparent, we plan to deliver a considerable number of G700s in 2024, the first 20 to be delivered or fully built, and deliveries have begun. By the end of this month, the next 7 to 8 will be ready. We plan to deliver these 50 to 52 planes over the quarters in relatively even numbers, with improving margins quarter-over-quarter as we go along. The first one, what we call the lot 1, carries some cost and retrofit burden that will not affect subsequent aircraft deliveries. So expect margins in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter with significant improvement in Q3 and Q4. \n Aerospace had a decent quarter from an orders perspective with a book-to-bill of 1.2:1 in dollar terms. Sales activity and customer interest is evident this quarter, but concerns over persistent inflation and monetary policy in the U.S., together with concerns about conflict in the Middle East, has slowed the consummation of transactions to some degree. It is also worth noting that a significant portion of the demand we see is fleet replenishment for corporations. These multi-aircraft deals usually proceed at a slower pace. \n The G800 flight test and certification program continues to progress well. The aircraft design, manufacturing and the overall program are very mature. We continue to target certification of G800 for 9 months after the G700 certification, although I'm increasingly reluctant to give estimates about these things that are ultimately out of our control. In short, the Aerospace team had a good quarter. G700 FAA certification is in the rearview mirror, and we hope EASA certification is hard on its heels. And we expect nicely improving margins, particularly in the second half. \n Next, Combat Systems. Combat had revenue of $2.1 billion, up almost 20% over the year ago quarter. Earnings of $282 million are up 15.1%. Margins at 13.4% are down 60 basis points over the year ago quarter. It is interesting to observe that this very strong increase in revenue is in comparison to last year's first quarter, which enjoyed a 5% increase over '22. \n We saw increased revenue performance in each of the 3 businesses. The increase came from higher volume on new international tank programs, higher artillery program volume and higher volume on PIRANHA's programs and bridges. We also experienced very strong order performance. Orders in the quarter drove total backlog to $15.6 billion, up $1.5 billion from this time in the year ago quarter. \n Demand for Combat Systems and products continues to increase, particularly in Europe and in some lines of business in the U.S. Orders for wheeled and tracked combat vehicles are up significantly, reflecting the heightened threat environment. In addition to several new combat vehicle starts, demand for Abrams also continues. We've seen tank orders from new users, and a number of countries will be introducing Abrams into their combat fleets for the first time. \n Since Q1 last year, we have received almost $1 billion in orders from both U.S. allies through FMS and the U.S. Army. In the U.S., we are rapidly increasing ammunition production with the opening of our Texas facility, which will increase current 155-millimeter ammo capacity by 83%. As the year goes on, we will continue to work with our Army customer to further increase ammo capacity to meet their requirements. \n Turning to Marine Systems. Once again, our shipbuilding units are demonstrating impressive revenue growth. Let me repeat the recent history that I gave you last year at this time with respect to growth in this decade. The first quarter of 2020 was up 9.1% against Q1 of 2019; Q1 '21 was up 10.6% over Q1 '20; Q1 '22 was up 6.8% over Q1 '21; and Q1 '23 was up 12.9% over Q1 '22. Finally, this quarter at $3.3 billion is up 11.3% over Q1 '23. \n This is an impressive growth ramp by any standard. However, growth ramps of this character bring with them supply chain and operation issues that are challenging. This particular quarter's growth was almost exclusively Columbia-class construction. \n Operating earnings are $232 million in the quarter, up 10% from the year ago quarter. Operating margin is basically the same as last year's quarter. We anticipate that this will improve as we progress through the year. \n As we have talked about in previous calls, the story at the marine group is efficiently managing the growth propelled by the U.S. Navy's need for ships, particularly submarines. As a labor-intensive heavy manufacturing industry, the shipbuilding industrial base was hit hard by the demographic impacts of COVID. This, coupled with a number of sole-source suppliers of highly complex components, has made it difficult for the industrial base to keep pace with increasing demand. \n The significant financial investments we have made in our shipyards over the last 12 years, particularly at Electric Boat, has mitigated the impact on us, but we are still hit by schedule and quality problems in the supply chain. Our job is to minimize the efficiency and schedule impacts of late material by increasing our throughput. And we are doing that each and every quarter. In Q1 alone, our productivity increased 11%, but there is more to do. Finally, the Navy's investment in the supply chain has helped and will continue to help as we move forward. \n For Technologies, we're off to a solid start. Revenue in the quarter of $3.2 billion is down less than 1% from the prior year but up 2% over the fourth quarter of last year, and modestly ahead of our expectation to the start of the year. Operating earnings of $295 million are consistent with last year, yielding a margin of 9.2%. As we have previously discussed, margins will continue to be driven by the mix of IT service activity and hardware volumes. \n The group received $4 billion in orders during the quarter for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2:1. Both businesses experienced strong order activity, in GDIT's case, the highest book-to-bill since mid-2019. This led to a total backlog of $13.5 billion, an increase of over 5% from a year ago and total estimated contract value of $42.7 billion. \n The story in Technologies is one of steady growth, particularly at GDIT and increasingly at Mission Systems as they transition from legacy programs to new programs and faster-growth lines of business. Both businesses have robust pipelines driven by their respective investments in different technologies. The group's continued focus on margin performance will result in sequential margin expansion throughout the year as they continue to build their backlog and grow. \n As you know, we never update guidance at this time of year. Apart from what I have already said about Aerospace, I will stick to that custom. We do, however, confirm the guidance we gave you at the end of last quarter, and we'll update it at midpoint of the year, as we typically do. \n This concludes my remarks with respect to what was, in many respects, a rewarding quarter. Let me now turn the call back to Nicole to take your questions. So let me kind of tackle that. I alluded to it in my opening statement. But we're -- we have 50 to 52 airplanes that are going to deliver in about equal amounts of the 700 in the second through the fourth quarters. So think about it that way. So I think that will help you. So the growth in Europe is clearly driven by the threat environment. We've seen increases in orders for combat, wheeled and tracked vehicles and significant bridge orders. We're also seeing increased orders coming out of various countries in Europe for Abrams through the FMS process. So we see that demand signal continuing until the threat environment, frankly, improves. So two things. One is the increase in productivity at each of the shipyards, and we see that and we've been seeing that for the last few quarters. And it's also fewer disruptions from the supply chain. So those are the two primary factors. So let me clarify a bit. I don't see concerns about inflation or monetary policy impacting demand. It really is just impacting the time from the initiation of a potential interest to the closure of an order, which is also impacted somewhat by large fleet -- airplane fleet orders from corporate customers. So think about it that way, more of a timing issue with the completion of the deals and not a headwind to overall demand. So I think that's an important nuance. And we're still sticking to our delivery guidance for the year. And I think on a going-forward basis, as we've intimated before, we see that those deliveries increasing over time. So let me take them in the inverse order. On the submarine side, the preponderance of the funding in the supplemental is to help stabilize the industrial base, ensuring that we continue to drive order activity on a consistent and repeatable basis. So that is really on the submarine side. In combat, I think you can see there's a fair amount of ammo funding, and we had fully anticipated that. So it is proceeding extremely well through test, continue to work with that customer, but they are very pleased with the performance of the vehicle. Well, let's talk about the first predicate in that question. I don't believe we've ever disclosed any margin on a particular airplane, and we haven't there. I think we can't -- it can't take and discern revenue and earnings in any given quarter as attributable to one airplane. So I think you need to think about it holistically.\n But we see the -- we don't see any real changes in the mix throughout the year. And we'll do a detailed bottom-up review in Q2. But for right now, we're sticking with both our mix, our earnings, our margin and revenue expectations. So we're off to a pretty good start, I'd say. And we're very encouraged at how the outlook looks for the rest of the year. \nSheila  Kahyaoglu: Can we assume that G700 is accretive to the 15% full year guidance? So think about it this way. This is ultimately going to be a very profitable program. But as I explained in my remarks, the first lot of 20 or so carries with it additional cost. We'll see those in -- largely in Q2. So think about Q2 as an increase in revenue of about $1 billion to $1.1 billion and in earnings of about $100 million to $110 million, and then progress nicely thereafter. And again, that's all impacted by the multiplicity of factors in our Aerospace business that drive margins. So for the supply chain support, it has minimal impact on us. It's, however, extremely important because the stabilization of the supply chain is critical to the resumption of full cadence on Virginia and the increased cadence on Columbia.\n So funding is also robust for submarines. We've got one we projected in '25. And then it would be extremely helpful to get a full ship set of Virginias also appropriated because that, again, helps stabilize the industrial base with repeatable revenue that they can plan around. So the way we think about share repurchases, and this will be true going forward, is really in the regular order. Recall what we were facing in Q1. And that was we're looking down the throat of a potential, and at some point looked very likely, government shutdown. And so I think that prudence and conservatism in the face of that kind of uncertainty is really key. But the cash performance for the remainder of the year is going to be very strong, and we will act accordingly. Well, so let me talk about 700. We never, except I think, on 1 or 2 occasions about 5, 6 years ago, give the future year expectations. But 700 is a very, very successful program, and it will continue to execute well.\n I'll turn it over to Kim on cash. So what drove margin in the first quarter were two things: mix as we came off of older legacy programs, particularly in the vehicle world and in the U.S. and then -- and began ramping up newer programs, vehicle programs in the U.S.; and then a significant amount of the revenue growth came from facilities investment which, by definition, carries a lower margin than production. So both of those things will reverse throughout the course of the year, and combat margins will increase. Our expectation is quarter-over-quarter. Remember, this is a high operating leverage group. So they ought to do quite well here. I don't think that's the way to look at it. But why don't Nicole get back to you on that? But we didn't have any particular notable cancellations. So let us unpack that one with you a little later. Yes. So in the combat world, it's a little bit more of a robust supply chain in general that we typically have not had difficulty with, typically. We know our priority. The suppliers who could conceivably cause issues, and we've been working with them to ensure that they can manage this growth. But we're pretty comfortable that we can execute the growth. Our focus is really on operations and execution. And those will be the  two key drivers of the profitability in that group. So I'd say in the large -- in the single-source, sole-source suppliers who are, by definition, critical. And the Navy has focused quite intensely on those particular products and supply chain items. And I think they've been pretty explicit about where some of that might be. And I think it's best to think about it that way. But we do believe that working with the Navy customer, the continued infusion into that supply chain will help stabilize. But they are the pacing item now for Electric Boat. So I think you've articulated what the Navy has said. I will tell you, our throughput and productivity has been strong on Columbia. It enjoys the highest national security priority. So we have done pretty well on Columbia and are increasing our throughput on Columbia. So then it's really those pacing items that are out there. And we're working with our Navy customer to see if there are additional things we can do to recover some schedule and if there are any workarounds. But this is going to be a bit of a slog for the supply chain. Yes. So I think you've known over the years, I tend not to comment on individual service budgeting. But inflation certainly has been a factor. And to the extent that we can increase throughput to offset some of that, we will. But the Navy is well aware of the inflation impact and I think is working hard with the whole shipbuilding industrial base to adjust some of that. So let me address that in the inverse order. Margins will be improving at our shipyards. We have every expectation all of our shipyards, NASSCO, Bath and Electric Boat. One of the things, as we've talked frequently about, is the margin impact of quality and schedule problems coming out of the supply chain. And as the supply chain stabilizes, that will help as well. And what was your first part of your question? Yes. Okay. So it has no impact in the short term for Electric Boat because we've got plenty of work in front of us. It could have an impact in the outer years outside of our planning horizon. But critical here is, in fact, the additional ship set of funding. We have long lead material on Virginia. That is very important to the supply chain. And to the extent that we can ensure that we get a full second Virginia ship set so that we're buying it to a year, I think, is very important for the overall health of the industrial -- submarine and industrial base. So it's a good planning assumption. It is how we are thinking about our internal planning. But let's see how we do as we start to significantly ramp up production and deliveries. So -- but as I said, that's a good planning assumption. So we still have -- look, it's definitely improving. Quality is improving and schedule reliability is improving. But make no mistake, we still have a lot of out-of-station work. And that impacts the profitability and margin on airplanes that are experiencing that. So we definitely see improvement. We are optimistic that they can keep pace, but it's not without its margin challenges. So there's no real change, I think, from the previous quarters, U.S. corporations, private and public, high-net-worth individuals, both U.S. and outside the U.S. So no real changes, no real surprises. Sort of the typical customer base that we see is I think the way you should think about it. Yes. So our ramp there is more about increasing the facilities that we have. And as I noted in my remarks, the opening of our Texas facility, which we worked very, very hard to expedite and frankly did it in almost record time, was very important because it increased the throughput and the productivity of the number of shells by 83%. So we're on track with the Army to get where we need to be, and our objective is to move even faster. And so far, we have been. But the Army has been a critical and extremely important partner here in what is really a national security imperative. So we had anticipated the impacts on the 280 in our guidance too, but I will tell you that they are doing quite well and are slightly ahead of our schedule. We're still sticking to our deliveries, but I think it's notable that they're managing pretty well in this tough environment. Thanks, Cai. I think I said last quarter, I'm done predicting process over which we have little control. We've tried in the past to give you indicators of our internal -- or actually, our internal -- our dates. So I'm kind of out of the detailed predicting mode. I will say the program is doing extremely well. And it's -- it will fly in the third quarter, and I think we'll be flying a pretty mature airplane. Well, pretty much steady as she goes, particularly this year. We've got a number of, as you know, programs in the certification process. And so I'd see that at least through this year is pretty consistent. No real surprise this year, steady as she goes. So the pipeline remains robust. And I look to that as encouraging, a good sign. It's been that way for a while. People want our airplanes, and that's driving demand. Yes. So we have been investing in AI to support our customers, and particularly at GDIT and somewhat at Mission Systems. And I would say that there, we're working closely with our customers. They define what the art of the possible is for them in AI. And as you all know, there are some government -- governance challenges around that. But the more sophisticated we get and our ability  to tailor AI solutions, I think the more comfortable our customer becomes and will ultimately drive some increased revenue.\n I haven't seen too much of that yet because I think the government is not like -- unlike other industries where its adoption is. People are careful, and I think properly so. And I would argue that would be true across the entirety of our business. Nice try. So look, yes, I think once you get through the first lot, our performance from a margin standpoint will continue to improve. And you'll see that, third quarter will be significantly better than second quarter, and fourth quarter will be even better still. But we will update you on our regular order. We kind of keep our discipline, as you well know, around updating guidance, and I think that, that's appropriate. And we should get there."
