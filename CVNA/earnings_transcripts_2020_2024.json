Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thanks Mike and thanks everyone for joining our call. 2020 was a defining year for Carvana and one that we will likely look back on as a significant milestone in our journey. When we launched the company eight years ago, we set out to be the first online seller of cars by building modern technology, a new optimized supply chain and integrating vertically to solve modern \u2013 to serve modern customer preferences and deliver the best customer experiences available. When we went public four years ago, we spoke of our most mature market of Atlanta as a proof point that we could build a sizeable business given us 1% market penetration and we set a midterm goal for the company to reach $3,000 GPU. And two years ago, at our Analyst Day, we outlined the audacious goal of becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer of buying as many cars from our customers we were selling and are selling more than 2 million cars per year. Today we are the leading online seller of cars by a wide margin. And for eight years, we've been the leading \u2013 the leader in providing the best experiences available in buying a car. Today, we have over 100 markets above 1% market penetration. For seven consecutive years, we've grown GPU by $400 or more and in 2020 we exceeded our $3,000 GPU goal for a full year and hit $4,000 and our best quarter. Today, we are the second largest seller of used cars in the country marking the final milestone on our path to becoming the largest. And we have levered EBITDA margin for seven consecutive years, demonstrating significant and consistent progress on our path to becoming the most profitable. In the second half of 2020, we bought more cars from our customers than we sold to them and we're celebrating our third consecutive year of being the fastest growing automotive retailer in the country, lighting our path to selling more than 2 million cars per year. Overall life to the company, we have set goals and we have hit them and we have many more goals in front of us. But before diving into more detail about where we are now and how we plan to continue hitting our goals in the years ahead, I want to talk for a moment about what got us here. Our engine of growth has been incredible people with high ambition, boundless energy and discipline, who have chosen to care a little more than most who learn and get a little better every day, who feel like they're part of something and who have fun along the way. This has always been a close group that we are proud to be a part of, but 2020 drew us even closer and made us even prouder. We came into the year position for another year of hyper-growth before rapidly transitioning to a defensive posture when the pandemic hit and rapidly reverting back to growth posture as demand shift in our direction. Our team made those adjustments, managed through three ways of COVID and delivered another year of being the fastest growing automotive retailer in the country while simultaneously growing GPU and levering EBITDA margin. When we moved to a defensive posture our team stuck together, we managed through the pandemic without a single layoff and without furloughs. And when we reduced hours for our operations teams, our team came together. We created the We're All In This Together Fund with contributions from hundreds and hundreds of people throughout the company that generated sufficient funds to ensure that the Carvana team members that were impacted by reduced hours were still able to maintain over 80% of their take-home pay over the entire effective period. To every member of our team, thank you. You have an unbelievable amount to be proud of. So where are we now and where do we go from here? In the short-term as a result of the accelerating adoption of our model and the strength of our customer experiences and our brand, we have far more demand than we were able to satisfy with our current supply chain. As evidence of this demand, in January we grew sales by 80% year-over-year and did so with just half the immediately available inventory that we had a year ago. This demand paired with the operational stresses of three successive waves of COVID have led to constraints across our operational chain, but given that they are most pronounced and hardest result and our IRCs will focus our comments and our progress there. We opened four IRCs in 2020, plan to open two more by the end of 2021 and the team is working at max speed to ramp, hiring and training to catch up to demand as quickly as possible. Since December, we have increased production by 40%. In the medium term, we're working even faster than before to prepare the business to handle the demand. In 2022, we plan to open eight additional IRCs bring our total IRCs between now and the end of 2022 to 10 and bring our total facility capacity to 1.25 million per year at that time. We're also scaling our logistics network capacity and capabilities further and making additional investments in technology to make our customer experiences even better, make us more efficient, enables to scale more quickly. In the long-term the plan remains the same. We've built a platform that delivers the best customer experiences, the best unit economics, and is the most scalable. This is a powerful combination. We got here with execution, innovation and ambition. Execution allows us to cover ground along our path. Innovation allows us to uncover additional opportunities, and ambition keeps us charging forward and we are charging forward. The opportunities in front of us are broadening and are even bigger than they were in the past. Fully achieving our potential will demand that we continue to improve, that we move even faster. Our ambition is only growing, but we must also maintain focus to move fast. We'll continue to prioritize growth, and we must also stay disciplined to continue demonstrating operating leverage. We will do all of that while always keeping our customers at the center of every decision we make and while delivering to them the best customer experiences around. And we'll get a little bit better every day and have fun along the way. It will be hard. All important things are, our teams up for the challenge, the march continues. Mark?\nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to report another year of strong growth in both retail units and revenue. Revenue total $5.6 billion, an increase of 42%, and retail units sold totaled 244,111, an increase of 37% making us the second largest used automotive retailer in the U.S. The fourth quarter retail unit sold totaled 72,172, an increase of 43%. Total revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of 65%. Our exceptional growth in 2020 was driven by rapid growth within our market cohorts. This strong growth overpowered COVID-19 related headwinds and our significant supply chain constraints. In Q4, our 2013 to 2019 cohorts grew retail units sold by 40%, and our oldest cohort of Atlanta grew by 12%, despite an industry-wide decline in used vehicle sales and our election not to run our cyber Monday promotion this year. Our growth accelerated as we exited the year with our 2013 to 2019 cohorts growing by 75% in January and our oldest cohort of Atlanta growing by 45%. In 2020, we completed our seventh consecutive year of $400 or more in GPU improvement and our seventh consecutive year of EBITDA margin leverage. Total gross profit per unit for the year was $3,252. Our growth in GPU was broad-based including increases of $132 in retail, $43 in wholesale, $134 in finance and $90 in ancillary products. Our GPU performance was bolstered by buying cars from customers. In 2020 we acquired 204,000 vehicles from customers, an increase of 95%. Total GPU in Q4 was $3,379, an increase of $549 year-over-year. Sequential changes in GPU were primarily driven by retail GPU, which saw approximately $300 of normal seasonal depreciation, $100 of higher than normal seasonal depreciation and $200 of transitory costs primarily driven by rapidly ramping our reconvening capacity in the midst of the third wave of COVID-19. We expect these transitory costs to flow into Q1, but the moderate beginning in Q2 as we ramp our new IRCs and move further away from the third wave. In 2020, we took another meaningful step forward in our finance platform. In Q4, we successfully completed our first SEC registered securitization selling $405 million in principal balance and contributing to a $421 increase in finance GPU year-over-year. EBITDA margin was negative 3.9% in Q4, an improvement of 4% versus the prior year, reflecting gains in both GPU and SG&A leverage. We ended the year with $1.7 billion in total liquidity resources, giving us significant flexibility to execute our plan. In 2020, we opened 120 new markets bringing our year-end total to 266. With these new market openings we now serve 74% of the U.S. population up from 67% at the end of 2019. We will continue to expand in 2021 and expect to serve 78 to 80% of the U.S. population in more than 300 markets by year-end. In 2020, we also made significant progress scaling our vehicle production capacity, and this continues to be an area of focus for the business. We added four inspection and reconditioning centers in 2020, bringing our annual production capacity at full utilization to over 600,000 units at year end. We expect to open to IRCs in 2021 and eight in 2022, ending 2022 with more than 1.25 million units of annual production capacity at full utilization. Our eyes are squarely focused on achieving our goal of selling more than 2 million units per year. And we will continue to maintain a healthy pipeline of future IRCs to support our growth. As we look forward to 2021, we expect another strong year on retail units sold, revenue, GPU and EBITDA margin. We expect an acceleration of growth in retail units sold in 2021 and expect to level that growth to be governed primarily by the speed at which we scale our production capacity. We expect revenue growth in 2021 to be in line with retail unit sold growth. Finally, we expect total GPU in the mid-3,000s and a small EBITDA margin loss in 2021, improving both metrics year-over-year, while continuing to invest for the long-term. Since becoming a public company nearly four years ago, we have made tremendous progress across all aspects of the business and achieve many major milestones such as achieving our first EBITDA positive quarter this year. Since 2017, we have consistently rapidly grown retail units sold, increased GPU and demonstrated operating leverage. We've made significant progress and are excited about what comes next. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for all of the commentary on the logistics and the reconditioning and kind of what you're facing there. I guess I'm curious as well, there's been a lot of talk about stimulus checks and what that may or may not have meant to January of this year. I know you talked about January, have you seen trends continue strongly into February? And then as you think about delivery times, and I think this was commented on in the shareholder letter, what is the kind of optimal delivery time? I mean, where is that line in the sand where the customer starts to bulk and looks elsewhere? And could you give us an idea of what delivery times are now versus maybe pre-pandemic?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Okay. So I'd really say January 1st with respect to stimulus, I think it's hard to disentangle probably all the different things that had been going on. Stimulus did not result in a large discontinuous super noticeable bump in demand. So I don't think that we would assign too much of what we saw in January to stimulus. I think instead what we would assign the majority of the January shrank to is just ramping up our production capacity. As I said in my remarks we ramped up our production capacity \u2013 excuse me, production level by approximately 40% from December to January and that unlocked additional inventory, which then very rapidly sold, so I think that would probably be the driver. Heading into February, I think from a demand perspective we've largely seen the same. February can be a bit of a tricky month because there's really nothing about February that you would expect to be different from January with the exception of the arrival of tax season, which this year has reportedly been pushed back a couple of weeks. Although I think we're starting to see some evidence that it's showing up at least moderately over the last couple of days. So prior to kind of taxis and hitting, I would say, February looks a lot like January and just the same trends continued. Those trends are just that we've got a lot more demand than we're able to satisfy given our limited inventory. And so our focus is definitely on trying to ramp that up and produce inventory is by far and away the biggest impact. But you also brought up delivery times. The rest of the supply chain is also impacted that obviously includes logistics roughly speaking year-over-year. More recently over the last couple of weeks, logistics has probably been on the order of kind of \u2013 delivery has probably been on the order of 40% give or take longer than they were a year ago. I don't think that there's a magical moment where delivery times get too long and that starts to materially crimp sales. I think it's much more of a continuous effect. And I think that part of that increase in delivery times is just due to the underlying strain of ramping the business as quickly as we are. Although I think a very meaningful portion of that strain has also just been the very large storms that we saw in the middle of the country over the last week or two, which we would expect to be transitory and we expect to work out over the next week or so.\nSharon Zackfia: I guess I fell in love. I mean, knowing what you know now, I mean, at what point do you think you've got reconditioning where it needs to be. You've got logistics where they need to be and we're not talking about the pinch points related to demand.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, I mean, I think \u2013 I do think it's a high quality problem. I think we've dealt with supply constraints many times throughout the company life. Generally speaking the form that takes is we'll see some supply side constraints, and then we will resolve those over maybe a three month period or so. I think 2020 was pretty unique in the sense that we came into the year positioned for our largest growth year ever. And then we were hit by the pandemic. We rapidly pulled in and then kind of customer preference has shifted in our direction. We saw more demand than we'd ever seen before, and we tried to rapidly catch up. And then that was kind of overlaid with three successive waves of COVID, which obviously have kind of impacts across our entire supply chain. So I think this has been a difficult year, and I think we can almost think about it as being kind of three separate events that led to some supply side constraints. I think the team has done an incredible job working out of all three of those different events. And I think that's evidenced by the growth that we saw in the year, despite the pandemic. And then obviously the growth that we saw in January is tremendous. And I think at different points in the year, we kind of worked out of some of the supply side constraint to start to build inventory again, and then we got hit with the next wave and we had to kind of go back and start again. So I think as long as we head into a more normalized world, I think we'll work out of this pretty quickly. We put some materials together in the shareholder letter that are hopefully helpful about the IRC capacity that we are building. That's facility capacity, which is different than active production capacity is producing cars, but we're clearly building for a very large future. And we're trying to make sure that we get in front of ourselves, because when we look at our supply chain the longest lead time components of that supply chain is building the physical facilities to do the reconditioning. The second longest lead time is training and hiring all the people to turn that capacity into active capacity. But we're working very hard to get in front of it. And I think we feel incredible about the plan. And then I would just reiterate the statistic again, increasing total production by 40% from December to today is a pretty incredible move. And I think as I said, the team's done an unbelievable job in light of the circumstances to rapidly catch us up.\nOperator: The next question comes from Zachary Fadem of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nZachary Fadem: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. So the quarter-to-date commentary for January would suggest that you're tracking at about 6,400 units per week. And if we look back since you've been a public company, you've been able to step up that weekly run rate at every single quarter. So when I think about the commentary around capacity and production and inventory constraints, is there anything out there besides those things that would preclude you from continuing to ramp up that, that weekly unit run rate? That's the first question? Could you talk me through that?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So we put some commentary in our outlook about the expected differences in shape this year. And I think that kind of cuts directly to the point that you're making. The demand that we're seeing, I want to just reiterate is very, very strong. We're clearly seeing materially more demand than we're going to be able to satisfy this quarter and probably for the remainder of the entire year. And we're going to work very hard to try to catch back up. And I don't think we want to dive into weekly sales rates, but kind of the numbers that you're pointing to aren't unreasonable. I think it's important to look at those numbers in light of the graph that we provided around immediately available inventory on the website, in our shareholder letter, whereas at the end of January we had 9,500 cars that were immediately available for customers. That means cars that a customer can purchase and are ready to be loaded on a truck, right when the customer purchases them. So selling that number of cars against an inventory of 9,500 cars is an extremely rapid turn. And there is just something to kind of a natural limit of how quickly customers can get on the site, find the car they want and start to go through the purchase process. So I think our expectation is that probably relative to previous years, sales volumes will be pushed a little bit into the future. Partially that's going to be because of tax season being pushed back a couple of weeks. But I think the bigger impact is probably just us catching up to demand and catching up our production capacity. And so I think, you've seen these big discontinuous moves in the past. Those really big discontinuous moves have been supported by a much larger ready inventory than we have today. And so in order to take as big of a discontinuous step, we would have to be turning inventory extremely, extremely quickly. So it's likely that in the immediate term, the setup will not be as severe. But then because we have excess demand as we move through the year and catch up production we may see kind of a more beneficial shape later in the year.\nZachary Fadem: Got it. Okay. That one makes sense. And then Mark as I look at your business today, you sold about 244,000 cars last year, and it took you an operating expense base of about $1.1 billion to support that. So as I look to 2021, can you talk about incremental SG&A per unit and walk me through how to think about the SG&A step-up and what is expected to be a fixed cost, which I guess we could call an investment and then how much would be a variable cost?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So as you sort of alluded to, as we've grown the business, we've been able to show leverage in SG&A. I think that'll continue to be the case going forward as we march for our long-term model. As we take a narrower view into 2021, I think one way that we think about this question of leverage is, is through our cohorts where we've definitely seen leverage over time as cohorts age. I think that happens in several of the line items. One, I think that we've historically seen advertising leverage in our cohorts as they age as word of mouth grows, as awareness grows in the cohorts, we provided some data on that in the shareholder letter. As it relates to some of the other expense line items, we've also seen leveraging the cohorts there. I think that takes the form of benefits from scale. I think it takes the form of benefits of utilization in the logistics network. And then there's also benefits as we scale of spreading some of our fixed cost base out over more and more units and more and more markets. And so I think, we've seen lots of great trends leveraging the business. We provided some guidance on EBITDA margin where we expect another year of improvement. We think that will be coupled with improvement in SG&A as we march for our long-term model; and I think we feel pretty good about the path that we're on.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMichael Montani: Thanks for taking the questions. The first one I had was just to clarify a little bit. In the guidance you had mentioned a small EBITDA margin loss. Does that basically mean like a down low single digit EBITDA margin? Or were you talking about the actual dollar amount itself?\nMark Jenkins: So, I think the \u2013 I think what we were guiding to is mid-3,000 GPU and a small EBITDA margin loss. I think the \u2013 I think that, that again will be driven by some of the sources I was just describing a response to Zach's question. And I think that will be our eighth consecutive year of EBITDA margin improvement.\nMichael Montani: Okay. Thank you. And then the other question I had was, total revenue growing roughly in line with retail units sold, I was thinking it might be up faster given the success that you've seen in wholesale, ancillary and then just the ASP's being up year-over-year. So I'm just wondering if there's something there that I'm missing that we need to consider as well on some of these other lines of business.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think you're hitting on a couple of good points there. I think the major drivers of revenue are vehicle ASP and then wholesale and other revenues. And we've obviously made progress in all of those, really the latter two. I think one point that I would make is we've seen ASP stripped up here a little bit in the back half of the year. Part of that's just the supply and demand and our purchasing algorithms responding to what we're seeing in supply demand. Part of that's also intentional to a degree, as we're constrained in the reconditioning centers, we've tended to shade a little bit more toward, some cars that maybe require less reconditioning on occasion, so that's been a driver. I think the gains that we saw in ASP in the back half of the year, we expect to moderate a little bit in 2021. And so the balance of all of those things is what led to our guidance.\nOperator: The next question comes from Naved Khan of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nRobert Feller: Thanks. This is Robert Feller on for Neved. Congrats on the great performance of a quarter. A couple of questions. So can you just reiterate \u2013 just discuss about what made Atlanta, which is one of your first markets, what made that market very attractive to enter? And then stepping back as we speak broadly about the Rule 40 within the Internet space, we've seen that become the Rule 50 below 60, the Rule 70 and Carvana has shown really great top line growth and improving EBITDA margin. So curious how you're thinking about that general phenomenon moving forward? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Well, first of all, thank you. I can tell you you're internally debating good quarter and great quarter. We appreciate you going with great quarter there. So thank you for that. [indiscernible] distracted market to enter, that's going way back in our history. The short story is basically we had some kind of operational benefits to scaling out of a preexisting reconditioning center in that area. And so that's what kind of led to us choosing that market. There was nothing unique about the market that we thought would uniquely fit our model. It was more about just operational ease on [indiscernible] to choose to go there. And then obviously that market responded really well ever since. And I think we put some commentary in the letter, that 90% of the markets that we've launched are continue to ramp even faster than Atlanta did at the same point it's life. So I think there was nothing special about the choice of that market. It's been a great market for us. It's continued to grow. It had a great January growing at 45%. And I think the other markets are performing very similarly. Mark, do want to hit the Rule 40, 50, 60 and that\u2019s right.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes. I mean I think we're very happy with the comp to fast growing Internet companies. Thank you for that. I think historically we fared extremely well on any rule that you could put together. I think our growth has been historically strong compared to other e-commerce companies. I think we've continued that strong growth, while also showing significantly narrowing EBITDA loss margins. So I think we've continued to fare farewell on those metrics. We're going to look to obviously continue to make progress on both top line growth and simultaneously on EBITDA margin leverage, which is something we've been able to do for seven consecutive years now. So we're going to keep \u2013 trying to keep that number as high as we possibly can.\nErnie Garcia: The other thing that I would just say is as I try to infer what the underlying drivers of that rule are; I also think our business has the unique benefit of having visibility into the underlying cohorts as well. We share data in the third quarter that our oldest cohorts were already approaching our long-term EBITDA target range, and that several of our cohorts were positive from the about perspective. So I think that really does help to clarify that kind of the, while we're making all this progress and constantly narrowing our EBITDA margin losses, we have shown negative EBITDA over time, but that, that kind of investment is clearly going into the growth.\nRobert Feller: Understood. Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rajat Gupta of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRajat Gupta: Hi, good evening. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I just have a couple on like the GPU. The $200 transitionary impact on retail GPU in the fourth quarter. What is assumed for the 2021 mid-3,000 guide with respect to that, does that all come back? Do you still have an element of that flowing through into the guidance and just relatedly could you give us a sense of like how that mid-3,000 breaks out narrow across the three different businesses? That would be helpful and I have a quick follow-up? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Yes. So as it relates to the transitory cost, we do expect them to flow into Q1, but then to moderate beginning in Q2. And the moderation comes from, as we ramp our new IRCs and as we move further away from COVID, the third wave of COVID we expect those impacts to moderate. So that was on your first question. On your second question, consistent with our sort of past outlooks that we've given for the year; we don't plan to break down the mid-3,000 GPU into various components. But I think we've given a pretty good sense there of the progress that we expect to make next year. And I think we're feeling really good about that total GPU progress. Not unlike EBITDA margin, next year we'll make our eighth consecutive year of improvements in total GPU, and we're feeling really good about that.\nRajat Gupta: Got it. That's helpful. Just on the February comment you talked about trends continuing like January and I'm not sure if I missed it, but was there any impact from the adverse weather that's what federally or despite that you continue to see the same level of growth initially in January, just wanted to clarify that point? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Yes. So I think there's several concepts in there. So in terms of underlying demand, we've seen underlying demand be very consistent throughout the early part of this year so far. In terms of sales, we've seen kind of the demand for sales be very consistent, but there have been some delays related to the storms in the middle of the country. We expect to resolve those over the next week or so. As it relates to year-over-year growth, that will be impacted by the storms that we saw, which impacts the timing of sales, but then also by the timing of tax season which is the major catalyst for growth that happens sometime between kind of mid-February and mid-March. And we expect to be later this year than last. But as it relates to just kind of modeling underlying demand and getting that signal for what that implies for the strength of business and what we expect you're looking forward, it's been very consistent so far this year.\nRajat Gupta: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.\nErnie Garcia: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Edward Yruma of KeyBank Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nEdward Yruma: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess two for me. First on the consumer source vehicle, looks like you guys continue to push penetration higher. Just wondering if you're starting to get to the point where the consumers potentially pricing against some of your competitors. Are you having to pay more for vehicles that your consumer sourcing? And then maybe just as a second question now that we're in a rising rate environment, how should we expect that to flow through the P&L, particularly to the fact that you're doing more of your securitization yourself and trying to net those two out? Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So first of all on buying cars from customers that business obviously continues to do incredibly well and grew 96% for 2020. I do think the most impressive statistic there is that in the fourth quarter of the cars that we sold the customers 65% had been bought from customers just to put that in context, we had our Analyst Day two years ago. We set out a long-term goal of 38% to 52%. So for roughly two thirds of our cars that we sold the customers, we bought from other customers that's a pretty remarkable number and something that we're extremely excited about. As it relates to the implications for the future and the remaining opportunity, please keep in mind that on the retail side of the business we're still about 0.7% of the entire market, we remain very, very small compared to the business. And on the purchasing side of the business, you were probably a little bit bigger than that, but not materially bigger than that. And those two businesses are largely independent. They kind of intersect and move together as it relates to trade when a customer simultaneously buys and sells a car. But the majority of each business runs independently. So I think looking forward, we expect those businesses to grow independently to some degree. We expect them to basically race against each other in moments of strain when we are constrained in our logistics network, we will tend to favor retail transactions to vehicle pursing transactions in our delivery scheduler. So that can have some impacts in the near-term and kind of makes the businesses interact together. But over the medium and long-term, we don't expect that to be a big driver and we're just going to work to grow both those businesses as fast as we possibly can. As we think that they are mutually reinforcing and enormous opportunities independently. As far as selling loans goes, there's a lot that goes into that. I would say generally speaking over any kind of medium range period of time kind of consumer spreads or kind of interest rates that we would fund at and consumer facing rates have spreads that are fairly consistent. And so I think generally speaking, the expected finance margin is very similar across time. I do think in a lowering rate environment sometimes those margins can get a little bit bigger for a quarter or two, and then raising rate environment, they can get compressed a little bit for a quarter or two. But those impacts are generally relatively small compared to the entire finance margin. So I think kind of the directional impact you're pointing to is a reasonable factor. Although there are many factors, including just the underlying improvement we've seen in that business over the last year or so. So I think you could model that in, but I don't think it's a big contributor.\nEdward Yruma: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri of Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nChris Bottiglieri: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question.\nErnie Garcia: Hi.\nChris Bottiglieri: I wanted to ask you about inventory selection on your website. Clearly, there's very prolific levels of demand that's outpacing your ability to scale production. From my observations, you've been testing third-party partner inventory on your website for at least a year or two now. Can you talk about any initial results that you've seen? What are the benefits and trade-offs for both Carvana and the third-party dealer from this arrangement? And then from an investor standpoint, how do we evaluate the economic implications of allowing more third parties in your websites?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So there's a lot in there. Let me start with this at in any given quarter, we probably have 100 to 200 tests that we're running across the business. There's a much smaller set of potentially very large test, but we have many, many tests that we're running. We have \u2013 depending on how you break it down, probably 60 to 75 different independent product groups that are made up of engineers and product designers and visual designers and analysts and infrastructure developers and database developers that are all running kind of in their own area and building their own technology. So there's always a lot going on. And in general, our policy is going to be to just discuss things that we believe will have early \u2013 to have the potential to have material impact on our P&L in the near-term. And prior to that, we will probably just choose to not discuss these underlying tests too much. That said that the particular test that you are talking about we are going to be moving into a second phase of that test, to test that at slightly higher scales. We still expect it to be small and to not have a material impact on the business to the extent that changes and we will start to discuss it with you more. But we will be doing a little bit more of that. So you may see some more partners and more inventories showing up there. You then ask question about how we collectively can evaluate all the opportunities that Carvana faces. And generally speaking there are many lens and many ways that we think about these different opportunities, but the lens that we use the most often is we're always trying to pick the opportunities that we think offer the best customer experience, the most compelling unit economics and the most scalability, and we're trying to make good choices and the trade offs of those three dimensions. And that's how we will determine where we put our energies and oftentimes there'll be many tests going on in the background that are helping us to understand what some of those trade-offs may be with some of the things that we could invest energy into.\nChris Bottiglieri: Got you. That's really helpful. And then just a follow up is I want to follow up on the Atlanta performances really eye-popping the 24% to 45% growth in January. What would you attribute the acceleration? When I look at the two IRCs you opened in Westmeath and Orlando, they seem to flank Atlanta from a geographical perspective. Is it reasonable to think that Atlanta some of your earlier markets disproportionately benefited from these IRCs? And are there any other markets where you feel like when you open IRC this year could sustain a similar benefit?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think there's a lot going on there. Let me start with what I think is most important and then we can talk about some of the other impacts as well. The most important impact I think by a long way, we talked a lot about the constraints that we faced as we kind of dealt with COVID and then try to catch up to these three successive waves. I think the right way to look at kind of the back three quarters of 2020 is that we really aren't seeing demand signals when we look at the markets. What we're really looking at is we're looking at the way that we're allocating the very constrained supply that we had. So if you see one market growing faster than other markets, all that's really telling us is just that we were constrained in total sales and the market that grew faster had even more aggressive, underlying demands than the market that grew a little bit slower. And so therefore more of the cars were shifted in that direction. And so I think when you're trying to assess demand growth over the last nine months, I just say it's difficult looking at sales data because we have been so severely constrained. So that I think is the biggest thing. And then I think that that \u2013 while we still are constrained, I think what we saw in January is we saw the benefit of this 40% increase in production that happened from December to now that has been very helpful. So I think that that's probably the biggest underlying driver. I do think that in general as we have opened inspection centers near markets, those markets have benefited from that because those cars are closer by and therefore often and those customers will buy them because the delivery times are faster. So they may have more demands of those cars and customers in other markets. So I think that's an impact. And then we also launched a vending machine in Atlanta recently. So I think that that is probably an impact as well. So I think there's a number of things going on, but I do think the most important is just kind of the \u2013 while we remain very, very supply constraint, I think slightly loosening those constraints was helpful in January.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nick Jones of Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Jones: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. As the demand for consumers to sell cars directly to you, exceeds your original goals, I guess what have you learned and can you revise those goals potentially? Or where do you think I guess both ratios can go overtime customer source ratio? And then also the ratio as a percent of retail sold?\nErnie Garcia: So I think \u2013 let me start with how we arrived at our original goals. Our original goals were arrived at by looking at market leaders over time and what they had been able to achieve and kind of using the heuristic that \u2013 that was a good target for us to aim for. And I think the results that we've seen over the last year are really, really exciting and we think just speak to the extreme simplicity of our offering from a customer experience perspective. but also to the underlying strength of the model, when we've got a model where we can sell cars across geographies and across makes and models and across the price spectrum and we've got very efficient ways to sell even wholesale cars. It puts us in a position where we can be a very high quality buyer. And so, we've seen a lot of success in that business. So I think that we're excited by where we are. I think going forward it's \u2013 there's no \u2013 until we get extremely large, there isn't necessarily a fundamental ratio that we would shoot for with respect to cars bought relative to cars sold. I think we will just seek to grow both businesses as quickly as we possibly can because we set up the business to do so. If we're buying significantly more cars than we're selling then we have the capacity to sell the excess wholesale. If we're not, then we have the capacity to buy cars from other channels. And so we're just going to look to grow both businesses as quickly as we can independently.\nNick Jones: Great, great. And one follow up on \u2013 I guess on as you expand \u2013 cover more population, how should we think about that? Is that \u2013 are there going to be some maybe large new markets? Are these mostly adjacent or maybe \u2013 there's already kind of high Carvana brand awareness? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, I mean, I think \u2013 like always it will likely be a mix of both. I think the way we've historically expanded our network after launching in Atlanta in 2013 is sort of a contiguous expansion out from Atlanta and now crossing most of the U.S. There's still some room for us to expand. There's still some fill in markets available to us within the existing footprint of our network. And so, we're just going to keep marching forward here toward our goal of near nationwide coverage.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question, maybe one bigger picture one and then, and then more specific...\nErnie Garcia: I lost Ron.\nRon Josey: \u2026alleviating some of that\u2026\nErnie Garcia: Hey, Ron. Ron, I apologize. \nRon Josey: Can you hear me?\nErnie Garcia: We lost you at more specific. If you could start that\u2026\nRon Josey: All right. Well, high level question and one more specific question. So \u2013 and it just has to do with just more demand than supply, but then alleviating that in January. So just bigger picture, why is 10 the right number in the next two years for IRCs? If the goal is 2 million, why not just go after that build more in 2021, more in 2022, et cetera because you're clearly seeing the benefits here in January when more supply came on? And then the second question is it looks like advertising rose to 40% in the quarter. And so Mark, as basically demand outstrips supply, can you just talk a little bit more about your advertising plans and just making sure that as awareness grows that you've got the supply to sort of back it up? Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So at a high level, I think, we \u2013 I think the right way to think about how we're growing IRC capacity is basically as fast as we can. And so that is a relatively long lead time undertaking, you have to find different sites around the country and the areas where you want to be. You have to negotiate transactions. You have to work with the city to get your zoning approvals. You have to then build the physical sites and then you have to hire and train all the people in those sites. So I think the simple way to think about that is we're growing as fast as we possibly can. And I think that we recently have added more capacity than ever in our history and our plan over the next 24 months is to add significantly more capacity than we've ever had in our history. And we're working hard behind the scenes to fill in a robust pipeline behind that. So in general, I think we don't intend to miss on the not ambitious side. We're going to be working really hard to try to build as much capacity as we possibly can.\nMark Jenkins: Yes. And then on the advertising point, it's an interesting question that we always face whenever we get constrained in operations. But that question is, hey, do you start to pull back in certain areas of the business, while you are constrained. And I think when we're balancing those questions we always first and foremost take a long-term view. I think we want to continue to build our brand. We want to continue to provide a great experience for the customer, a great value to the customer. And we're going to take a \u2013 you're going to look at those things through a long-term lens. In addition, as Ernie is alluded to we're also \u2013 we have many teams that are working as hard as they can, doing an amazing job, working to scale our production capacity, scale us up in the logistics network and the other parts of our supply chain to help us meet all the demand that we're seeing. And so that's where we're really focused. We know we have a tremendous amount of demand and we're working as hard as we can to make sure that we can fulfill it off.\nErnie Garcia: And maybe just a little additional color there, Ron, in case it's helpful at. I do think that we try to think a little bit differently about brand advertising and direct advertising and I think when we are severely constrained, we will pull back a bit on some of the kind of direct response advertising. But we still got a really long way to go and brand advertising based on our internal surveys that we've done. We still \u2013 we only have approximately 10% unaided awareness nationally. So there's still a lot of room to go there. And just as part of the long-term view, we do try to balance those things, even though we recognize that it can look like a bit of a conflict in the near-term when we're clearly constraint on the supply side and already have an excessive demand.\nRon Josey: Super helpful, thanks guys.\nOperator: Pardon me? This is the conference operator. The question queue was inadvertently clear it out. [Operator Instructions] Thank you for waiting. And our next question comes from John Colantuoni of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Colantuoni: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. On capacity constraints, should we think of the 80% growth in January as a decent proxy for what unit sales could have grown in Q4 had capacity not been a constraining factor and I have a follow-up.\nErnie Garcia: I want to be a little careful not diving into too much hypothetical, but let's just talk about January because we've at least provided the underlying data for that. We grew at 80% in January, and we have half of the available inventory than we had a year before. We also have longer delivery times than we had the year before. So I think the underlying demand in January, we believe was sufficient for sales to have grown materially more than they did in January. And I think kind of on either side of that that is likely true. So, I think that's the right way to think about it. As we look forward, we feel like this is really a question of how quickly can we ramp up production capacity. And that's going to be what drives our sales growth. There seems to be significantly more demand than we're able to handle today.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great. And can you help this aggregate the mid $3000 in GPU expected in 2021 between retail, wholesale and finance and other?\nErnie Garcia: Yes. So consistent with our past outlooks that we've given over the last several years, we don't break the total GPU components out in our guidance, but we hope that the mid $3,000 total GPU guidance for the year will be helpful.\nJohn Colantuoni: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good evening. Nice quarter. Congratulations. So I apologize if it's a bit repetitive. But just one with regard to the supply constraints, you just talked about in your letter and your comments here that those were alleviated somewhat in January and you saw sales improved significantly. When you refer to supply constraints, is there a delineation between what's in your control and what - you're in the process of building out versus external factors that may be persistent for a while longer?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. I would say in our control would be the characterization of our supply side constraints. And so just to be very clear, what we mean by that our supply chain means buying cars, it means transmitting cars to reconditioning centers, putting roughly a thousand dollars of parts and labor into those cars, photographing them, preparing them for sale, listing them on the website, a customer calling into to an advocate and asking questions about the car and then going through the purchase process and then that car being delivered to the customer. That is the sum of the chains. And so, I think the places where we historically have seen constraints are in customer care, the advocates in logistics and in the reconditioning center. Today, they are clearly most pronounced in the reconditioning centers. And so, that's where the constraints are. And we collectively refer to that supply chain as supply side constraints. The constraints are not in just acquiring vehicles. In general, we have ready access to vehicles.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: So Ernie, once upon a time people used to describe Amazon as an online book retailer, today Carvana is described as an online used car dealer. Now, look, I think one of the themes from this call as you guys are really constrained to meet demand. And so this question obviously is quite long-term. And I'm not asking you to break \u2013 major new information on this call, right. But could the Carvana vertically integrated to software and logistics platform that you've built and are growing? Could that have a use in addressing auto or fleet management related markets beyond just used cars, specifically new or mega fleet management/rideshare, et cetera?\nErnie Garcia: So that's a big question. So let me start with this. I think we are clearly constrained today and we clearly have an unbelievable opportunity in front of us, just kind of blocking and tackling and doing exactly what we know how to do. We have 0.7% market share. It's $40 million a year \u2013 per year unit. There's a ton of room to buy more cars from customers. I think there's theoretical room to accelerate the rate at which customers turn over cars between each other, making the market larger. But then I do think that there is also no doubt that we have a lot of really compelling assets. And I think there's probably lots of ways to think about our assets. But I think one way that's maybe useful is to kind of think about kind of any transaction requires a customer, it requires the transaction itself and then it requires a vehicle. And I think when you think about the Carvana business through that lens kind of the customer is our brand, which I think we've built a pretty exceptional customer brand that's known for delivering great customer experiences. And while there's still a ton of room to grow that and we're investing in it, it's one of the better known brands now in automotive. And so, I think, that's exciting. I think when you look at the transaction, I think we built a lot of technology that takes a very complicated vehicle purchase and makes it simple for a customer by kind of taking all the things that go into purchasing a car and the surrounding transactions and just making that easy. And so that's a tool set that we've built. And then when you think about the supply side, we've got a supply chain that enables us to deliver a car to a customer's door with a branded holler and a uniformed Carvana team member to what we hope to be 80% of the U.S. population by the end of this year. So I do think that those are very, very interesting assets. And I think that as we think about the way that automotive \u2013 the automotive industry at large evolves over the next decade or so, I think as you think about many of these opportunities, there are many places where those assets or some combination of those assets may be an extremely important and highly differentiated part of various customer value chains. And so I do think that it doesn't take a ton of creativity to see that. Again I want to reiterate the opportunity in front of us is really, really large. And I think that one of the great problems that we face, and I think this is a very high quality problem as well is trying to find the balance between being extremely focused on the things that we know really well, but making sure that we're ambitious enough to take full advantage of the position which we find ourselves. And I think that our ability to manage that equation and to continue to move fast and continue to put space between us and others that that are looking at this same problem set. I think it's going to end up being the story of Carvana over the next decade. So we're aware of all that and we're trying to make smart decisions as we move forward.\nAdam Jonas: Okay. Ernie, if I could just have a follow-up and then I'll bust out here. And as you're, no doubt, aware, there are a lot of new EV manufacturers entering the U.S. market and they all have one thing in common. They don't want to use franchise dealers, right, not at all. They all want to go direct to consumer. I mean, I count 8 to 10 significant new OEMs in the next three to five years, and I'm counting 15 to 20 by the end of the decade and that's a very open-ended number. So I'm just kind of \u2013 and these guys as they're coming to market, they're teaming up with partners. I think sisters using Cox or Manheim Lucids using Glovis Lordstown, I think, Camping World [ph]. I mean, give me a break. So again I \u2013 could you confirm you're super capacity constrained, but is your team even at a high level entertaining discussions with this flood of new players that will need logistics and support and customer care support when they have products, but no way to kind of serve the customer? Are they even advanced to the discussions and not advanced preliminary, highly preliminary discussions at this time? Or would you care to avoid that question?\nErnie Garcia: I think we're probably smarter to stick with the answer that we gave you to the previous question. And then I would just reiterate that our supply constraints are generally in the reconditioning center. That's generally where they are. So anyway, I appreciate the question. I recognize that there are many opportunities out there. And as I said, I think something we've got to do a really good job of over the next 10 years is finding the balance between focus and ambition.\nAdam Jonas: We're, good. Thank you, Ernie.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you, Adam.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nErnie Garcia: Great. Well, thank you everyone for joining the call. We really appreciate it. And to the entire Carvana team unbelievable year. Thank you so much for everything you did. This year threw more at us than we could have possibly imagined. And I don't think there will ever be a year that all walk out of prouder. And I hope you feel the same way because you did an incredible job. We stuck together as a team. We're in a great spot as a result. So thank you so much. Talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

            "name": "Ernie Garcia",
            "content": "Thanks Mike and thanks everyone for joining our call. 2020 was a defining year for Carvana and one that we will likely look back on as a significant milestone in our journey. When we launched the company eight years ago, we set out to be the first online seller of cars by building modern technology, a new optimized supply chain and integrating vertically to solve modern \u2013 to serve modern customer preferences and deliver the best customer experiences available. When we went public four years ago, we spoke of our most mature market of Atlanta as a proof point that we could build a sizeable business given us 1% market penetration and we set a midterm goal for the company to reach $3,000 GPU. And two years ago, at our Analyst Day, we outlined the audacious goal of becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer of buying as many cars from our customers we were selling and are selling more than 2 million cars per year. Today we are the leading online seller of cars by a wide margin. And for eight years, we've been the leading \u2013 the leader in providing the best experiences available in buying a car. Today, we have over 100 markets above 1% market penetration. For seven consecutive years, we've grown GPU by $400 or more and in 2020 we exceeded our $3,000 GPU goal for a full year and hit $4,000 and our best quarter. Today, we are the second largest seller of used cars in the country marking the final milestone on our path to becoming the largest. And we have levered EBITDA margin for seven consecutive years, demonstrating significant and consistent progress on our path to becoming the most profitable. In the second half of 2020, we bought more cars from our customers than we sold to them and we're celebrating our third consecutive year of being the fastest growing automotive retailer in the country, lighting our path to selling more than 2 million cars per year. Overall life to the company, we have set goals and we have hit them and we have many more goals in front of us. But before diving into more detail about where we are now and how we plan to continue hitting our goals in the years ahead, I want to talk for a moment about what got us here. Our engine of growth has been incredible people with high ambition, boundless energy and discipline, who have chosen to care a little more than most who learn and get a little better every day, who feel like they're part of something and who have fun along the way. This has always been a close group that we are proud to be a part of, but 2020 drew us even closer and made us even prouder. We came into the year position for another year of hyper-growth before rapidly transitioning to a defensive posture when the pandemic hit and rapidly reverting back to growth posture as demand shift in our direction. Our team made those adjustments, managed through three ways of COVID and delivered another year of being the fastest growing automotive retailer in the country while simultaneously growing GPU and levering EBITDA margin. When we moved to a defensive posture our team stuck together, we managed through the pandemic without a single layoff and without furloughs. And when we reduced hours for our operations teams, our team came together. We created the We're All In This Together Fund with contributions from hundreds and hundreds of people throughout the company that generated sufficient funds to ensure that the Carvana team members that were impacted by reduced hours were still able to maintain over 80% of their take-home pay over the entire effective period. To every member of our team, thank you. You have an unbelievable amount to be proud of. So where are we now and where do we go from here? In the short-term as a result of the accelerating adoption of our model and the strength of our customer experiences and our brand, we have far more demand than we were able to satisfy with our current supply chain. As evidence of this demand, in January we grew sales by 80% year-over-year and did so with just half the immediately available inventory that we had a year ago. This demand paired with the operational stresses of three successive waves of COVID have led to constraints across our operational chain, but given that they are most pronounced and hardest result and our IRCs will focus our comments and our progress there. We opened four IRCs in 2020, plan to open two more by the end of 2021 and the team is working at max speed to ramp, hiring and training to catch up to demand as quickly as possible. Since December, we have increased production by 40%. In the medium term, we're working even faster than before to prepare the business to handle the demand. In 2022, we plan to open eight additional IRCs bring our total IRCs between now and the end of 2022 to 10 and bring our total facility capacity to 1.25 million per year at that time. We're also scaling our logistics network capacity and capabilities further and making additional investments in technology to make our customer experiences even better, make us more efficient, enables to scale more quickly. In the long-term the plan remains the same. We've built a platform that delivers the best customer experiences, the best unit economics, and is the most scalable. This is a powerful combination. We got here with execution, innovation and ambition. Execution allows us to cover ground along our path. Innovation allows us to uncover additional opportunities, and ambition keeps us charging forward and we are charging forward. The opportunities in front of us are broadening and are even bigger than they were in the past. Fully achieving our potential will demand that we continue to improve, that we move even faster. Our ambition is only growing, but we must also maintain focus to move fast. We'll continue to prioritize growth, and we must also stay disciplined to continue demonstrating operating leverage. We will do all of that while always keeping our customers at the center of every decision we make and while delivering to them the best customer experiences around. And we'll get a little bit better every day and have fun along the way. It will be hard. All important things are, our teams up for the challenge, the march continues. Mark? Sure. Okay. So I'd really say January 1st with respect to stimulus, I think it's hard to disentangle probably all the different things that had been going on. Stimulus did not result in a large discontinuous super noticeable bump in demand. So I don't think that we would assign too much of what we saw in January to stimulus. I think instead what we would assign the majority of the January shrank to is just ramping up our production capacity. As I said in my remarks we ramped up our production capacity \u2013 excuse me, production level by approximately 40% from December to January and that unlocked additional inventory, which then very rapidly sold, so I think that would probably be the driver. Heading into February, I think from a demand perspective we've largely seen the same. February can be a bit of a tricky month because there's really nothing about February that you would expect to be different from January with the exception of the arrival of tax season, which this year has reportedly been pushed back a couple of weeks. Although I think we're starting to see some evidence that it's showing up at least moderately over the last couple of days. So prior to kind of taxis and hitting, I would say, February looks a lot like January and just the same trends continued. Those trends are just that we've got a lot more demand than we're able to satisfy given our limited inventory. And so our focus is definitely on trying to ramp that up and produce inventory is by far and away the biggest impact. But you also brought up delivery times. The rest of the supply chain is also impacted that obviously includes logistics roughly speaking year-over-year. More recently over the last couple of weeks, logistics has probably been on the order of kind of \u2013 delivery has probably been on the order of 40% give or take longer than they were a year ago. I don't think that there's a magical moment where delivery times get too long and that starts to materially crimp sales. I think it's much more of a continuous effect. And I think that part of that increase in delivery times is just due to the underlying strain of ramping the business as quickly as we are. Although I think a very meaningful portion of that strain has also just been the very large storms that we saw in the middle of the country over the last week or two, which we would expect to be transitory and we expect to work out over the next week or so. Sure. So, I mean, I think \u2013 I do think it's a high quality problem. I think we've dealt with supply constraints many times throughout the company life. Generally speaking the form that takes is we'll see some supply side constraints, and then we will resolve those over maybe a three month period or so. I think 2020 was pretty unique in the sense that we came into the year positioned for our largest growth year ever. And then we were hit by the pandemic. We rapidly pulled in and then kind of customer preference has shifted in our direction. We saw more demand than we'd ever seen before, and we tried to rapidly catch up. And then that was kind of overlaid with three successive waves of COVID, which obviously have kind of impacts across our entire supply chain. So I think this has been a difficult year, and I think we can almost think about it as being kind of three separate events that led to some supply side constraints. I think the team has done an incredible job working out of all three of those different events. And I think that's evidenced by the growth that we saw in the year, despite the pandemic. And then obviously the growth that we saw in January is tremendous. And I think at different points in the year, we kind of worked out of some of the supply side constraint to start to build inventory again, and then we got hit with the next wave and we had to kind of go back and start again. So I think as long as we head into a more normalized world, I think we'll work out of this pretty quickly. We put some materials together in the shareholder letter that are hopefully helpful about the IRC capacity that we are building. That's facility capacity, which is different than active production capacity is producing cars, but we're clearly building for a very large future. And we're trying to make sure that we get in front of ourselves, because when we look at our supply chain the longest lead time components of that supply chain is building the physical facilities to do the reconditioning. The second longest lead time is training and hiring all the people to turn that capacity into active capacity. But we're working very hard to get in front of it. And I think we feel incredible about the plan. And then I would just reiterate the statistic again, increasing total production by 40% from December to today is a pretty incredible move. And I think as I said, the team's done an unbelievable job in light of the circumstances to rapidly catch us up. Sure. So we put some commentary in our outlook about the expected differences in shape this year. And I think that kind of cuts directly to the point that you're making. The demand that we're seeing, I want to just reiterate is very, very strong. We're clearly seeing materially more demand than we're going to be able to satisfy this quarter and probably for the remainder of the entire year. And we're going to work very hard to try to catch back up. And I don't think we want to dive into weekly sales rates, but kind of the numbers that you're pointing to aren't unreasonable. I think it's important to look at those numbers in light of the graph that we provided around immediately available inventory on the website, in our shareholder letter, whereas at the end of January we had 9,500 cars that were immediately available for customers. That means cars that a customer can purchase and are ready to be loaded on a truck, right when the customer purchases them. So selling that number of cars against an inventory of 9,500 cars is an extremely rapid turn. And there is just something to kind of a natural limit of how quickly customers can get on the site, find the car they want and start to go through the purchase process. So I think our expectation is that probably relative to previous years, sales volumes will be pushed a little bit into the future. Partially that's going to be because of tax season being pushed back a couple of weeks. But I think the bigger impact is probably just us catching up to demand and catching up our production capacity. And so I think, you've seen these big discontinuous moves in the past. Those really big discontinuous moves have been supported by a much larger ready inventory than we have today. And so in order to take as big of a discontinuous step, we would have to be turning inventory extremely, extremely quickly. So it's likely that in the immediate term, the setup will not be as severe. But then because we have excess demand as we move through the year and catch up production we may see kind of a more beneficial shape later in the year. Sure. So I think you're hitting on a couple of good points there. I think the major drivers of revenue are vehicle ASP and then wholesale and other revenues. And we've obviously made progress in all of those, really the latter two. I think one point that I would make is we've seen ASP stripped up here a little bit in the back half of the year. Part of that's just the supply and demand and our purchasing algorithms responding to what we're seeing in supply demand. Part of that's also intentional to a degree, as we're constrained in the reconditioning centers, we've tended to shade a little bit more toward, some cars that maybe require less reconditioning on occasion, so that's been a driver. I think the gains that we saw in ASP in the back half of the year, we expect to moderate a little bit in 2021. And so the balance of all of those things is what led to our guidance. Well, first of all, thank you. I can tell you you're internally debating good quarter and great quarter. We appreciate you going with great quarter there. So thank you for that. [indiscernible] distracted market to enter, that's going way back in our history. The short story is basically we had some kind of operational benefits to scaling out of a preexisting reconditioning center in that area. And so that's what kind of led to us choosing that market. There was nothing unique about the market that we thought would uniquely fit our model. It was more about just operational ease on [indiscernible] to choose to go there. And then obviously that market responded really well ever since. And I think we put some commentary in the letter, that 90% of the markets that we've launched are continue to ramp even faster than Atlanta did at the same point it's life. So I think there was nothing special about the choice of that market. It's been a great market for us. It's continued to grow. It had a great January growing at 45%. And I think the other markets are performing very similarly. Mark, do want to hit the Rule 40, 50, 60 and that's right. The other thing that I would just say is as I try to infer what the underlying drivers of that rule are; I also think our business has the unique benefit of having visibility into the underlying cohorts as well. We share data in the third quarter that our oldest cohorts were already approaching our long-term EBITDA target range, and that several of our cohorts were positive from the about perspective. So I think that really does help to clarify that kind of the, while we're making all this progress and constantly narrowing our EBITDA margin losses, we have shown negative EBITDA over time, but that, that kind of investment is clearly going into the growth. Thank you. Sure. Yes. So as it relates to the transitory cost, we do expect them to flow into Q1, but then to moderate beginning in Q2. And the moderation comes from, as we ramp our new IRCs and as we move further away from COVID, the third wave of COVID we expect those impacts to moderate. So that was on your first question. On your second question, consistent with our sort of past outlooks that we've given for the year; we don't plan to break down the mid-3,000 GPU into various components. But I think we've given a pretty good sense there of the progress that we expect to make next year. And I think we're feeling really good about that total GPU progress. Not unlike EBITDA margin, next year we'll make our eighth consecutive year of improvements in total GPU, and we're feeling really good about that. Sure. Yes. So I think there's several concepts in there. So in terms of underlying demand, we've seen underlying demand be very consistent throughout the early part of this year so far. In terms of sales, we've seen kind of the demand for sales be very consistent, but there have been some delays related to the storms in the middle of the country. We expect to resolve those over the next week or so. As it relates to year-over-year growth, that will be impacted by the storms that we saw, which impacts the timing of sales, but then also by the timing of tax season which is the major catalyst for growth that happens sometime between kind of mid-February and mid-March. And we expect to be later this year than last. But as it relates to just kind of modeling underlying demand and getting that signal for what that implies for the strength of business and what we expect you're looking forward, it's been very consistent so far this year. Thanks. Sure. So first of all on buying cars from customers that business obviously continues to do incredibly well and grew 96% for 2020. I do think the most impressive statistic there is that in the fourth quarter of the cars that we sold the customers 65% had been bought from customers just to put that in context, we had our Analyst Day two years ago. We set out a long-term goal of 38% to 52%. So for roughly two thirds of our cars that we sold the customers, we bought from other customers that's a pretty remarkable number and something that we're extremely excited about. As it relates to the implications for the future and the remaining opportunity, please keep in mind that on the retail side of the business we're still about 0.7% of the entire market, we remain very, very small compared to the business. And on the purchasing side of the business, you were probably a little bit bigger than that, but not materially bigger than that. And those two businesses are largely independent. They kind of intersect and move together as it relates to trade when a customer simultaneously buys and sells a car. But the majority of each business runs independently. So I think looking forward, we expect those businesses to grow independently to some degree. We expect them to basically race against each other in moments of strain when we are constrained in our logistics network, we will tend to favor retail transactions to vehicle pursing transactions in our delivery scheduler. So that can have some impacts in the near-term and kind of makes the businesses interact together. But over the medium and long-term, we don't expect that to be a big driver and we're just going to work to grow both those businesses as fast as we possibly can. As we think that they are mutually reinforcing and enormous opportunities independently. As far as selling loans goes, there's a lot that goes into that. I would say generally speaking over any kind of medium range period of time kind of consumer spreads or kind of interest rates that we would fund at and consumer facing rates have spreads that are fairly consistent. And so I think generally speaking, the expected finance margin is very similar across time. I do think in a lowering rate environment sometimes those margins can get a little bit bigger for a quarter or two, and then raising rate environment, they can get compressed a little bit for a quarter or two. But those impacts are generally relatively small compared to the entire finance margin. So I think kind of the directional impact you're pointing to is a reasonable factor. Although there are many factors, including just the underlying improvement we've seen in that business over the last year or so. So I think you could model that in, but I don't think it's a big contributor. Hi. Sure. So there's a lot in there. Let me start with this at in any given quarter, we probably have 100 to 200 tests that we're running across the business. There's a much smaller set of potentially very large test, but we have many, many tests that we're running. We have \u2013 depending on how you break it down, probably 60 to 75 different independent product groups that are made up of engineers and product designers and visual designers and analysts and infrastructure developers and database developers that are all running kind of in their own area and building their own technology. So there's always a lot going on. And in general, our policy is going to be to just discuss things that we believe will have early \u2013 to have the potential to have material impact on our P&L in the near-term. And prior to that, we will probably just choose to not discuss these underlying tests too much. That said that the particular test that you are talking about we are going to be moving into a second phase of that test, to test that at slightly higher scales. We still expect it to be small and to not have a material impact on the business to the extent that changes and we will start to discuss it with you more. But we will be doing a little bit more of that. So you may see some more partners and more inventories showing up there. You then ask question about how we collectively can evaluate all the opportunities that Carvana faces. And generally speaking there are many lens and many ways that we think about these different opportunities, but the lens that we use the most often is we're always trying to pick the opportunities that we think offer the best customer experience, the most compelling unit economics and the most scalability, and we're trying to make good choices and the trade offs of those three dimensions. And that's how we will determine where we put our energies and oftentimes there'll be many tests going on in the background that are helping us to understand what some of those trade-offs may be with some of the things that we could invest energy into. Sure. So I think there's a lot going on there. Let me start with what I think is most important and then we can talk about some of the other impacts as well. The most important impact I think by a long way, we talked a lot about the constraints that we faced as we kind of dealt with COVID and then try to catch up to these three successive waves. I think the right way to look at kind of the back three quarters of 2020 is that we really aren't seeing demand signals when we look at the markets. What we're really looking at is we're looking at the way that we're allocating the very constrained supply that we had. So if you see one market growing faster than other markets, all that's really telling us is just that we were constrained in total sales and the market that grew faster had even more aggressive, underlying demands than the market that grew a little bit slower. And so therefore more of the cars were shifted in that direction. And so I think when you're trying to assess demand growth over the last nine months, I just say it's difficult looking at sales data because we have been so severely constrained. So that I think is the biggest thing. And then I think that that \u2013 while we still are constrained, I think what we saw in January is we saw the benefit of this 40% increase in production that happened from December to now that has been very helpful. So I think that that's probably the biggest underlying driver. I do think that in general as we have opened inspection centers near markets, those markets have benefited from that because those cars are closer by and therefore often and those customers will buy them because the delivery times are faster. So they may have more demands of those cars and customers in other markets. So I think that's an impact. And then we also launched a vending machine in Atlanta recently. So I think that that is probably an impact as well. So I think there's a number of things going on, but I do think the most important is just kind of the \u2013 while we remain very, very supply constraint, I think slightly loosening those constraints was helpful in January. So I think \u2013 let me start with how we arrived at our original goals. Our original goals were arrived at by looking at market leaders over time and what they had been able to achieve and kind of using the heuristic that \u2013 that was a good target for us to aim for. And I think the results that we've seen over the last year are really, really exciting and we think just speak to the extreme simplicity of our offering from a customer experience perspective. but also to the underlying strength of the model, when we've got a model where we can sell cars across geographies and across makes and models and across the price spectrum and we've got very efficient ways to sell even wholesale cars. It puts us in a position where we can be a very high quality buyer. And so, we've seen a lot of success in that business. So I think that we're excited by where we are. I think going forward it's \u2013 there's no \u2013 until we get extremely large, there isn't necessarily a fundamental ratio that we would shoot for with respect to cars bought relative to cars sold. I think we will just seek to grow both businesses as quickly as we possibly can because we set up the business to do so. If we're buying significantly more cars than we're selling then we have the capacity to sell the excess wholesale. If we're not, then we have the capacity to buy cars from other channels. And so we're just going to look to grow both businesses as quickly as we can independently. Sure. So, I mean, I think \u2013 like always it will likely be a mix of both. I think the way we've historically expanded our network after launching in Atlanta in 2013 is sort of a contiguous expansion out from Atlanta and now crossing most of the U.S. There's still some room for us to expand. There's still some fill in markets available to us within the existing footprint of our network. And so, we're just going to keep marching forward here toward our goal of near nationwide coverage. I lost Ron. Hey, Ron. Ron, I apologize. We lost you at more specific. If you could start that... Sure. So at a high level, I think, we \u2013 I think the right way to think about how we're growing IRC capacity is basically as fast as we can. And so that is a relatively long lead time undertaking, you have to find different sites around the country and the areas where you want to be. You have to negotiate transactions. You have to work with the city to get your zoning approvals. You have to then build the physical sites and then you have to hire and train all the people in those sites. So I think the simple way to think about that is we're growing as fast as we possibly can. And I think that we recently have added more capacity than ever in our history and our plan over the next 24 months is to add significantly more capacity than we've ever had in our history. And we're working hard behind the scenes to fill in a robust pipeline behind that. So in general, I think we don't intend to miss on the not ambitious side. We're going to be working really hard to try to build as much capacity as we possibly can. And maybe just a little additional color there, Ron, in case it's helpful at. I do think that we try to think a little bit differently about brand advertising and direct advertising and I think when we are severely constrained, we will pull back a bit on some of the kind of direct response advertising. But we still got a really long way to go and brand advertising based on our internal surveys that we've done. We still \u2013 we only have approximately 10% unaided awareness nationally. So there's still a lot of room to go there. And just as part of the long-term view, we do try to balance those things, even though we recognize that it can look like a bit of a conflict in the near-term when we're clearly constraint on the supply side and already have an excessive demand. I want to be a little careful not diving into too much hypothetical, but let's just talk about January because we've at least provided the underlying data for that. We grew at 80% in January, and we have half of the available inventory than we had a year before. We also have longer delivery times than we had the year before. So I think the underlying demand in January, we believe was sufficient for sales to have grown materially more than they did in January. And I think kind of on either side of that that is likely true. So, I think that's the right way to think about it. As we look forward, we feel like this is really a question of how quickly can we ramp up production capacity. And that's going to be what drives our sales growth. There seems to be significantly more demand than we're able to handle today. Yes. So consistent with our past outlooks that we've given over the last several years, we don't break the total GPU components out in our guidance, but we hope that the mid $3,000 total GPU guidance for the year will be helpful. Sure. I would say in our control would be the characterization of our supply side constraints. And so just to be very clear, what we mean by that our supply chain means buying cars, it means transmitting cars to reconditioning centers, putting roughly a thousand dollars of parts and labor into those cars, photographing them, preparing them for sale, listing them on the website, a customer calling into to an advocate and asking questions about the car and then going through the purchase process and then that car being delivered to the customer. That is the sum of the chains. And so, I think the places where we historically have seen constraints are in customer care, the advocates in logistics and in the reconditioning center. Today, they are clearly most pronounced in the reconditioning centers. And so, that's where the constraints are. And we collectively refer to that supply chain as supply side constraints. The constraints are not in just acquiring vehicles. In general, we have ready access to vehicles. So that's a big question. So let me start with this. I think we are clearly constrained today and we clearly have an unbelievable opportunity in front of us, just kind of blocking and tackling and doing exactly what we know how to do. We have 0.7% market share. It's $40 million a year \u2013 per year unit. There's a ton of room to buy more cars from customers. I think there's theoretical room to accelerate the rate at which customers turn over cars between each other, making the market larger. But then I do think that there is also no doubt that we have a lot of really compelling assets. And I think there's probably lots of ways to think about our assets. But I think one way that's maybe useful is to kind of think about kind of any transaction requires a customer, it requires the transaction itself and then it requires a vehicle. And I think when you think about the Carvana business through that lens kind of the customer is our brand, which I think we've built a pretty exceptional customer brand that's known for delivering great customer experiences. And while there's still a ton of room to grow that and we're investing in it, it's one of the better known brands now in automotive. And so, I think, that's exciting. I think when you look at the transaction, I think we built a lot of technology that takes a very complicated vehicle purchase and makes it simple for a customer by kind of taking all the things that go into purchasing a car and the surrounding transactions and just making that easy. And so that's a tool set that we've built. And then when you think about the supply side, we've got a supply chain that enables us to deliver a car to a customer's door with a branded holler and a uniformed Carvana team member to what we hope to be 80% of the U.S. population by the end of this year. So I do think that those are very, very interesting assets. And I think that as we think about the way that automotive \u2013 the automotive industry at large evolves over the next decade or so, I think as you think about many of these opportunities, there are many places where those assets or some combination of those assets may be an extremely important and highly differentiated part of various customer value chains. And so I do think that it doesn't take a ton of creativity to see that. Again I want to reiterate the opportunity in front of us is really, really large. And I think that one of the great problems that we face, and I think this is a very high quality problem as well is trying to find the balance between being extremely focused on the things that we know really well, but making sure that we're ambitious enough to take full advantage of the position which we find ourselves. And I think that our ability to manage that equation and to continue to move fast and continue to put space between us and others that that are looking at this same problem set. I think it's going to end up being the story of Carvana over the next decade. So we're aware of all that and we're trying to make smart decisions as we move forward. I think we're probably smarter to stick with the answer that we gave you to the previous question. And then I would just reiterate that our supply constraints are generally in the reconditioning center. That's generally where they are. So anyway, I appreciate the question. I recognize that there are many opportunities out there. And as I said, I think something we've got to do a really good job of over the next 10 years is finding the balance between focus and ambition. Thank you, Adam. Great. Well, thank you everyone for joining the call. We really appreciate it. And to the entire Carvana team unbelievable year. Thank you so much for everything you did. This year threw more at us than we could have possibly imagined. And I don't think there will ever be a year that all walk out of prouder. And I hope you feel the same way because you did an incredible job. We stuck together as a team. We're in a great spot as a result. So thank you so much. Talk to you next quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to report another year of strong growth in both retail units and revenue. Revenue total $5.6 billion, an increase of 42%, and retail units sold totaled 244,111, an increase of 37% making us the second largest used automotive retailer in the U.S. The fourth quarter retail unit sold totaled 72,172, an increase of 43%. Total revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of 65%. Our exceptional growth in 2020 was driven by rapid growth within our market cohorts. This strong growth overpowered COVID-19 related headwinds and our significant supply chain constraints. In Q4, our 2013 to 2019 cohorts grew retail units sold by 40%, and our oldest cohort of Atlanta grew by 12%, despite an industry-wide decline in used vehicle sales and our election not to run our cyber Monday promotion this year. Our growth accelerated as we exited the year with our 2013 to 2019 cohorts growing by 75% in January and our oldest cohort of Atlanta growing by 45%. In 2020, we completed our seventh consecutive year of $400 or more in GPU improvement and our seventh consecutive year of EBITDA margin leverage. Total gross profit per unit for the year was $3,252. Our growth in GPU was broad-based including increases of $132 in retail, $43 in wholesale, $134 in finance and $90 in ancillary products. Our GPU performance was bolstered by buying cars from customers. In 2020 we acquired 204,000 vehicles from customers, an increase of 95%. Total GPU in Q4 was $3,379, an increase of $549 year-over-year. Sequential changes in GPU were primarily driven by retail GPU, which saw approximately $300 of normal seasonal depreciation, $100 of higher than normal seasonal depreciation and $200 of transitory costs primarily driven by rapidly ramping our reconvening capacity in the midst of the third wave of COVID-19. We expect these transitory costs to flow into Q1, but the moderate beginning in Q2 as we ramp our new IRCs and move further away from the third wave. In 2020, we took another meaningful step forward in our finance platform. In Q4, we successfully completed our first SEC registered securitization selling $405 million in principal balance and contributing to a $421 increase in finance GPU year-over-year. EBITDA margin was negative 3.9% in Q4, an improvement of 4% versus the prior year, reflecting gains in both GPU and SG&A leverage. We ended the year with $1.7 billion in total liquidity resources, giving us significant flexibility to execute our plan. In 2020, we opened 120 new markets bringing our year-end total to 266. With these new market openings we now serve 74% of the U.S. population up from 67% at the end of 2019. We will continue to expand in 2021 and expect to serve 78 to 80% of the U.S. population in more than 300 markets by year-end. In 2020, we also made significant progress scaling our vehicle production capacity, and this continues to be an area of focus for the business. We added four inspection and reconditioning centers in 2020, bringing our annual production capacity at full utilization to over 600,000 units at year end. We expect to open to IRCs in 2021 and eight in 2022, ending 2022 with more than 1.25 million units of annual production capacity at full utilization. Our eyes are squarely focused on achieving our goal of selling more than 2 million units per year. And we will continue to maintain a healthy pipeline of future IRCs to support our growth. As we look forward to 2021, we expect another strong year on retail units sold, revenue, GPU and EBITDA margin. We expect an acceleration of growth in retail units sold in 2021 and expect to level that growth to be governed primarily by the speed at which we scale our production capacity. We expect revenue growth in 2021 to be in line with retail unit sold growth. Finally, we expect total GPU in the mid-3,000s and a small EBITDA margin loss in 2021, improving both metrics year-over-year, while continuing to invest for the long-term. Since becoming a public company nearly four years ago, we have made tremendous progress across all aspects of the business and achieve many major milestones such as achieving our first EBITDA positive quarter this year. Since 2017, we have consistently rapidly grown retail units sold, increased GPU and demonstrated operating leverage. We've made significant progress and are excited about what comes next. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. Sure. So as you sort of alluded to, as we've grown the business, we've been able to show leverage in SG&A. I think that'll continue to be the case going forward as we march for our long-term model. As we take a narrower view into 2021, I think one way that we think about this question of leverage is, is through our cohorts where we've definitely seen leverage over time as cohorts age. I think that happens in several of the line items. One, I think that we've historically seen advertising leverage in our cohorts as they age as word of mouth grows, as awareness grows in the cohorts, we provided some data on that in the shareholder letter. As it relates to some of the other expense line items, we've also seen leveraging the cohorts there. I think that takes the form of benefits from scale. I think it takes the form of benefits of utilization in the logistics network. And then there's also benefits as we scale of spreading some of our fixed cost base out over more and more units and more and more markets. And so I think, we've seen lots of great trends leveraging the business. We provided some guidance on EBITDA margin where we expect another year of improvement. We think that will be coupled with improvement in SG&A as we march for our long-term model; and I think we feel pretty good about the path that we're on. So, I think the \u2013 I think what we were guiding to is mid-3,000 GPU and a small EBITDA margin loss. I think the \u2013 I think that, that again will be driven by some of the sources I was just describing a response to Zach's question. And I think that will be our eighth consecutive year of EBITDA margin improvement. Sure. Yes. I mean I think we're very happy with the comp to fast growing Internet companies. Thank you for that. I think historically we fared extremely well on any rule that you could put together. I think our growth has been historically strong compared to other e-commerce companies. I think we've continued that strong growth, while also showing significantly narrowing EBITDA loss margins. So I think we've continued to fare farewell on those metrics. We're going to look to obviously continue to make progress on both top line growth and simultaneously on EBITDA margin leverage, which is something we've been able to do for seven consecutive years now. So we're going to keep \u2013 trying to keep that number as high as we possibly can. Yes. And then on the advertising point, it's an interesting question that we always face whenever we get constrained in operations. But that question is, hey, do you start to pull back in certain areas of the business, while you are constrained. And I think when we're balancing those questions we always first and foremost take a long-term view. I think we want to continue to build our brand. We want to continue to provide a great experience for the customer, a great value to the customer. And we're going to take a \u2013 you're going to look at those things through a long-term lens. In addition, as Ernie is alluded to we're also \u2013 we have many teams that are working as hard as they can, doing an amazing job, working to scale our production capacity, scale us up in the logistics network and the other parts of our supply chain to help us meet all the demand that we're seeing. And so that's where we're really focused. We know we have a tremendous amount of demand and we're working as hard as we can to make sure that we can fulfill it off."

The third quarter was an exceptional quarter for us financially and operationally. Let's start with the financial highlights. The biggest headline is that it was our first EBITDA positive quarter as a company. We also crossed $4,000 GPU for the first time. These are incredible milestones and both carry significant meaning and implications for our long-term financial performance and our strategic flexibility. The numbers themselves are exciting. We think they are even more remarkable when putting them in context. In the last four years, we've improved gross profit margin by almost 12%, SG&A as a percent of revenue by over 12%, and EBITDA margin by about 25%. We've made all of that progress while simultaneously making the investments necessary to grow the business more than 10x. In addition the third quarter also saw incredible operational achievements. The first and most notable of these was that we bought more cars from our customers than we sold them for the first time in our history. This is an amazing accomplishment that was only made possible at the quality of experiences we deliver to our customers the quality brand we've created, the infrastructure we are building, and the Herculean effort put forth by our team. In the third quarter, we bought almost twice as many cars from our customers as we bought at our previous peak in Q1 of this year and over three times as many cars as we bought from our customers in the second quarter. That kind of sequential growth is pretty unbelievable, but we think it's even more impressive at our current scale. In order to achieve it our operations team had to handle a one quarter sequential increase in cars bought from customers of over 50,000 units. In addition the ops team made quick progress toward alleviating our inventory constraints. During the quarter, production caught up for retail sales then grew further, enabling us to substantially increase our inventory by the end of the quarter. While this is impressive progress, we still ended the quarter with just half the inventory that was immediately available for our customers as we had prior to the pandemic. At our current demand levels we prefer to be much higher than we were even then and therefore still have a lot of work to do in this area. The team is doing an unbelievable job and we expect to continue to make rapid progress over the next several months to position us very well for another big growth year in 2021. Now, I'd like to take a step back. While the results of the third quarter are exciting and significant, it's important to maintain our perspective and to focus on what is underneath the numbers. Our progress over the last seven and a half years from a fledgling start-up in a single market that delivered one car to one of our customers once every several days to becoming the fastest-growing automotive retailer in the U.S. with $4,000 gross profit per unit and breakeven EBITDA has come from four powerful and persistent forces. One, our clear mission vision and values. We know where we are going and we know how we're going to get there. Two, our unwavering focus on our customers. We know that what really matters is making our customers' lives a little better. We know their expectations are always rising and we are always working to keep us and to surpass those expectations. Three, our long-term focus. We aren't afraid to lay the foundations today that are necessary to build big things tomorrow even when we don't see immediate results. And four, the strength of our team. Companies are collections of people. Our people choose to care. They believe in what we are doing and find meaning in it. They dream big, they aren't satisfied with what they've done, they don't think it's good enough, and they can't wait to make it better. These four forces are powerful. They're what really matter. They provide the relentless pressure that drives long-term progress. They are what brought us here. So, what does this mean for our future? Customer preferences have accelerated their shift in our direction. Our financial performance and positions are stronger than ever before. Our team is executing at the highest level in our history. We're delivering the best customer experiences available in buying or selling a car. We have a scalable offering to get better as it gets bigger. We've demonstrated the power of our mission, our customer-centricity, our long-term focus, and our incredible team. We couldn't ask to be in a better position.  Our job is to keep marching. To never allow ourselves to be satisfied, to overcome the challenges that will continually arise along the way to always get better. If we do that, we're going to hit our goals of selling two million-plus cars per year and of becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. And we're going to fulfill our mission of changing the way people buy cars. Mark? \nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was a record quarter for Carvana. We made significant progress on all key financial metrics and reached several exciting financial milestones. We achieved positive EBITDA for the first time in our company's history, a significant step on our path toward achieving our long-term goals.  Retail units sold in Q3 totaled 64,414 an increase of 39%. Total revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 41%. Retail unit growth accelerated from 25% in Q2, but was nonetheless limited by constraints on production capacity which impacted the selection of vehicles available on our website throughout the quarter.  Total gross profit per unit was $4056 in Q3 the highest level in company history and an increase of $1093 year-over-year. Our record GPU this quarter drove our gross margin to 16.9% near the midpoint of our long-term model.  Retail GPU was $1857 in Q3, an increase of $552. Growth in retail GPU was driven by a significant increase in the share of our vehicles sourced from customers. Vehicles sourced from customers reached 56% of retail units sold in Q3 exceeding the high end of our long-term target laid out in November 2018.  Total vehicles acquired from customers grew by 128% in Q3 leading us to buy 114% as many cars from customers as we sold to customers up from 69% a year ago. We believe the high-quality experience we provide to customers creates a sustainable sourcing advantage, which we expect to continue to benefit GPU over time.  In Q4, we expect retail GPU to have a seasonal change that more closely resembles Q4 2018 than Q4 2019. Wholesale GPU was $266, an increase of $146. This was driven by record gross profit per wholesale unit sold of $1113 and record wholesale volumes. Record gross profit for wholesale units sold was primarily driven by strong industry-wide wholesale pricing.  In Q4, we expect the wholesale market to transition to a more normalized depreciation environment accentuating normal seasonal trends in wholesale GPU. At a higher level, we continue to see improvements in our wholesale channel and expect gains over time toward our long-term goals. Other GPU was $1934 in Q3, an increase of $395. The gain in Other GPU was primarily due to a $337 increase in finance GPU to $1415 from $1078 driven by tightened credit standards and lower benchmark interest rates.  EBITDA margin was positive 1.4% reflecting a nearly 7% improvement from a year ago. The significant milestone of positive EBITDA margin was driven by our progress in both GPU and SG&A. SG&A as a percentage of revenue levered by 1.6% in Q3 primarily reflecting benefits of increased volume and cost efficiencies gained during the pandemic partially offset by renewed investments in growth for 2021.  Looking forward, we expect to make seasonal investments in SG&A expenses in Q4 as we have in past years to prepare the business for 2021 leading to a similar seasonal pattern while also continuing to show leverage versus 2019.  In addition to strong GPU and SG&A leverage, EBITDA was positively impacted by a $10.8 million increase in the carrying values of finance receivable related assets on our balance sheet. This increase partially offsets the decrease in carrying values of these assets that impacted EBITDA in Q1.  During the quarter, we opened our ninth inspection and reconditioning center or IRC near Columbus Ohio. And following quarter end, we opened our tenth IRC near Orlando, Florida. We also expect to open our 11th IRC by year-end increasing our total annual production capacity to approximately 600,000 vehicles at full utilization.  IRCs play a key role in our model by allowing us to expand our selection while also speeding delivery times and increasing logistics network efficiency. We remain focused on our plan of building out our network of IRCs and scaling production capacity to meet demand for our offering.  As we continue to focus on building inventory, we have elected not to run our Cyber Monday promotion this year. As a result, we expect retail unit growth to face a headwind around the time of Cyber Monday and a tailwind as we continue building selection on the website.  Following quarter end, we issued $1.1 billion in new senior notes and redeemed $600 million of existing senior notes due 2023. The new notes reduced our annual interest rate by more than three percentage points and extended maturities to 2025 and 2028.  As part of the refinancing, we incurred a onetime debt extinguishment expense of $33.7 million that we expect to be included in interest expense in Q4.  Following the issuance of our senior notes, we had more than $1.8 billion in total liquidity resources on our balance sheet giving us significant flexibility to drive toward our goal of becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. \nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo.\nZack Fadem: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. So first question with respect to the inventory constraints and IRC bottlenecks that you've been dealing with. Curious if you're willing to comment on how much your demand outpaced vehicles on the website in Q3? And then could you talk about some of the things you're doing to return the inventory back to pre-pandemic levels? And if you think Q4 is the right time frame for your supply to catch up with that demand.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. I'll try the best I can on that. So I think we wouldn't want to quantify precisely what demand would have been in the third quarter had we had significantly higher inventory levels, but there's no doubt that customers are sensitive to selection. And if you have more cars on the site they're more likely to find what they're looking for and therefore conversion goes up. And so I think there's little doubt that it impacted things in a pretty material way most likely. I think our inventory as we exited the third quarter in terms of cars that were available for a customer to buy that were kind of ready they could click on and start the purchase process with that was roughly half what it was pre-pandemic. Pre-pandemic we had significantly lower sales volumes than we have today. So our ideal inventory would be higher than we were pre-pandemic. And then we believe we have that inventory our sales would be higher still and so our ideal inventory would probably be higher again. So I think right now the goal is to build inventory as quickly as we can. The team has done an incredible job. We've made a ton of progress in the last three months. And I think we've laid the foundation to make even faster progress moving forward. Mark talked in his prepared remarks about everything that we're doing in terms of opening new facilities: we opened our ninth in the quarter; we opened our tenth at quarter end; we plan to open our 11th before year-end. So that's going to bring us to a total capacity of about 600,000 units. And then we're doing our best to staff up and train and get ready to build out as many units we possibly can to serve the demand that we expect to come in the future. So I think we're really optimistic about where we are. Right now we're focused on continuing to build out that capacity as quickly we can and to then fill it out with actual production. But I don't know that we want to yet quantify the precise impacts.\nZack Fadem: That makes sense. Thanks, Ernie. And then a quick one for Mark on the GPU line. I'm curious if there's any color that you can provide to bridge the gap from the Q3 GPU to your Q4 expectations. And to what extent you would describe any of the Q3 upside drivers or market forces as transitory across all of the various GPU buckets? And how would you go about quantifying those impacts?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes. So starting with Q3 retail GPU. I mean, I think we sort of looked at in a number of different ways bridging to previous historical period. So I think if you look back in Q3 2019, the biggest driver since then was our progress in buying more cars from customers. I think we saw a significant step-up to our best-ever 56% consumer sourcing rate this quarter which is a meaningful increase from a year ago. And we also saw strong margins on the cars that we source from customers this quarter. I think if you look to Q2 there's a couple of other dynamics that enter into the bridge. I think one averages sale move down meaningfully on the order of 30 days quarter-over-quarter as we started to resume purchasing and we began selling cars in a much more normalized pace following that peak pandemic period. I think bridging to Q1, if you do that I think in Q1 we were roughly $1,700 in retail GPU prior to our end of quarter COVID-related balance sheet adjustment. And so I think you're bridging from Q1 to Q3 sort of a similar story. I think most of the change, primarily driven by more success buying cars from customers. So I think that's sort of \u2013 I think the major drivers as we're looking from Q3 2020 retail GPU back at some previous periods. I think when \u2013 as we look forward to Q4, I think, the way we're currently thinking about is we're expecting seasonality that's more similar to Q4 2018 than Q4 2019 I think \u2013 in Q4 2019, we're still at the sort of early phases of optimizing our buying cars from customers, bidding and pricing. I think that led to some non-normalized dynamics. So when we're thinking about Q4, we're really thinking about seasonality that's more like Q4 2018 than Q4 2019.\nZack Fadem: When seasonality you mean as GPU or gross profit as a percentage of the year? I'm just trying to get a sense of what you mean by that seasonal step down?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. I mean I think we're sort of thinking about it in terms of seasonal changes in retail GPU.\nErnie Garcia: Driven by variation in depreciation rates, et cetera.\nZack Fadem: That makes sense. Appreciate the time guys.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Jones with Citigroup. \nNick Jones: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, I guess, focusing on 4Q again. How would you kind of rank the magnitude of the supply constraint impact on kind of unit growth versus not running the Cyber Monday deal? Like does kind of finding supply kind of -- maybe overshadow the headwind from Cyber Monday? And the second question is, I guess, maybe trying to retain the lines on investment in IRCs and opening two in 4Q. I mean is that -- is it fair to assume from a profitability standpoint, I guess, kind of back to kind of aggressive investment maybe not really replicating what we saw in 3Q from here? Any color there would be great. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So first with Q4 volume, I think, the kind of outlook that we provided in the shareholder letter was that we expect normal seasonal trends across all the major line items and so that would also relate to retail units. And I think you outlined kind of two big differences that will be going on this year versus years prior. One we don't plan to run the Cyber Monday promotion as we focus more on building our inventory and preparing for a big first half 2021. And then two as we continue to build inventory we do expect that to be a tailwind to conversion. And so kind of that's what sits underneath our expectations for a similar seasonal shape to years past. And then as it relates to inspection centers, I think, we're clearly in investment mode in terms of trying to build out capacity to deliver cars to customers and produce cars that are ready for customers and have been for a while and that's been part of our long-term plan. Building out inspection centers is the most operationally intensive and kind of longest lead time lever in the business. And so in general we're always trying to stay out in front of that as best we can. Now from an investment perspective, as you're thinking about cash we've got a lot of different ways that we can finance that. We've obviously got roughly $1.8 billion of liquidity resource on the balance sheet so we can choose just to financial those with our own cash or we can choose to finance those in the sale-leaseback market if we don't want to use cash for that purpose. So I think we're flexible there. And then in terms of the way that it impacts earnings as we open more inspection centers there can be marginal impacts as that kind of the cost of those centers and the depreciation of the centers flows through fewer units, but that's not a super material driver. So I wouldn't expect that to be a huge part of our story. \nNick Jones: Great. Thank you. \nErnie Garcia: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. \nAndrew Boone: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Andrew Boone on for Ron. If I think about the flywheel that you guys laid out of kind of great selection better conversion bringing more users to the platform, it seems that adding third-party inventory would accelerate this effect and really improve selection and therefore conversion. We're increasingly seeing third-party dealer inventory on your site. Can you just talk about Carvana's willingness kind of at a high level if not this test specifically to be more of a marketing platform for dealers? And then additionally now that you're acquiring more cars from sellers versus buyers, can you talk about your ability to convert those to a trade-in meaning you get the sale and the car buyer at the same time? As well as any marketing efficiencies you're seeing leading with a kind of will your car first message? Thank you. \nErnie Garcia: Sure. Thanks for the question. So on the first I think -- we're very, very focused on continuing to build out the business to deliver constantly incredible customer experiences at growing scale and to get that flywheel going where we get better as we get bigger. And I think there's lots of forms that takes. In the letter, we discussed kind of growing inventory, giving customers more selection, having inventory in more locations to the inspection centers, shortening delivery times. So there's a lot of different forms that takes. I think there are also a lot of other theoretic reforms that could take and there are a lot of other things that we could do to build out additional benefits for our customers. We'll continue to invest in those tests and to kind of look at opportunities to make our offering even better for our customers. But at any point in time, we're running several tests that I would say fit into the bucket that you're describing. In general, when we're running those tests. We're going to value those tests through the lens of what do they mean for our customer experience, what do they mean from a scalability perspective, what do they mean from an economics perspective. And when we feel like we've run those tests and got them to a place where we feel really good about the outcome through those three lenses then we'll likely pour resources on them and we'll talk about them a lot more and we'll seek to grow them out in the same way that we've grown buying cars from customers. But I don't think we have any projects that have yet risen to that level of discussion. Going to your second question, I think, there's enormous opportunities there. We're still very, very small compared to the retail market in terms of the number of customers out there buying cars and the fraction of those customers that are buying cars from us. We're also very, very small compared to the market of customers that are disposing of their cars. And so I think those two markets are to some degree independent and then they're connected when a customer chooses to do two transactions simultaneously through a trade-in. What we are going to seek to do is to make sure that we're giving customers the best offering available on both sides of the transaction if they want to buy a car or if they want to sell a car. And then as we get those customer interactions, we have an opportunity to explain to them the other things that we do as well. And I think that can happen simultaneously and would look like a trade-in or I think that it can happen with lag where a seller becomes a buyer six months down the road or a buyer becomes a seller six months down the road. And so again, I think, the thing that matters most there is we want to focus on our customers make sure their experiences are great, make sure our offering is in a really good spot. And then just scale both as quickly as we can because we're very, very small compared to the opportunity. \nRon Josey: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. \nAdam Jonas: Hey everybody. So Ernie they say imitation is the ultimate form of flattery. If anyone's listened to these franchise dealer calls or any other auto retail call, it's like you've really woken them up right? They're always -- they're talking about omnichannel, digital, touch list etcetera, etcetera. Are you seeing any sign at all that some of their admittedly nascent efforts even if they're nowhere near the full flywheel that you have and may never get there, have the attempts at least impacted your business in any way including inventory acquisition or pressure at the auction share anything? \nErnie Garcia: I think the simple answer to that question so far is no. And I'm not sure that should be that surprising because I do think that we're very small compared to this market. In the quarter depending on what I'm using from a market perspective, we are probably around 0.6% of the total transactions in the market. And then probably the list of competitors that you're referencing if we add them all up might add five to -- probably not a lot more than 5% additional market share on top of that. So I think all of the bigger players that I think are starting to get more focused in this direction, even if you sum them are still small compared to the market. So I think the overall opportunity is really, really large. And I think when we think about what's most important for us, you have to kind of decide what you focus on and we would like to think that we're the clear leaders in this space and we think that the important area for our focus to be on is just on our customers because they're telling us where we need to go. And so we're continuing to really focus there. And then we think that the dynamics of the market that we've discussed in the past the fragmentation and the relatively few players that really have the capacity to make large financial investments and building out a true e-commerce platform suggests that that's not necessarily the area where we should be putting most of our focus. We think that we offer the best customer experience that we have the most scalable model and that we've got the capacity now through our balance sheet and also through our financial performance to be able to invest in our offering. And so we're focused on us. We're focused on execution. We're focused on our customers. And I don't think we're yet seeing anything that's impacting us from any competitive moves. \nAdam Jonas: Okay. Great. And my follow-up kind of is in the topic of these test buckets that you talked about. I know you guys look at a lot of different things to improve frequency and all sorts of different ways to improve experiences beyond just buying and selling of used cars. There are a lot of car companies with increasingly these electric car companies, start-ups and even some legacy companies that could get carved out and may want to engage with the consumer in a B2C way in a far better way than the traditional model right? And I'm just wondering if there's an opportunity and I know it doesn't exist right now, it's not part of the 2021 story perhaps. But are you even having discussions internally, if not externally with how the Carvana platform could help a new entrant into the U.S. market engage with the consumer in a digital vastly superior way? Is that an opportunity? We're thinking 5, 10 years out and is something relevant to talk about today? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Yes. Thank you. So what I would say is, our focus has been and remains on delivering great experiences to customers that are buying used cars. I think our platform is you can think of as kind of being the thing that sits between cars and customers. And I think everything that we do, our strategic lens is we're looking at different ways to acquire cars and make sure that we've got inventory available for our customers and we want to make sure that we have the best and simplest transaction that can connect them -- connect our customers up to those cars. And so I think that's kind of interesting opportunities theoretically in the future. But I also think, it's important for any given company to make sure that you stay focused on the things that are most important at any point in time as you continually drive toward those things. And so for us that thing is making sure that we're delivering great experiences to our customers who want to buy or sell used cars. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel Powell with Goldman Sachs. \nDaniel Powell: Hey, thanks for taking the question. One and a follow-up, maybe another run at the retail GPU in 4Q, I guess based on the drivers of the outperformance in 3Q being more consumer sourcing faster sell-through and more reconditioning efficiency, I guess which one of those drivers would you expect to step back enough such that the depreciation schedules and things that you're talking about catching up and for you would actually drive some of that seasonality that you're expecting? Because at first glance it looks like all three of those should still be nice tailwinds for you in 4Q? \nErnie Garcia: So I would just start with normal seasonality. Normally there is variation in depreciation rates across the year with the fourth quarter tending to have the fastest depreciation rates. You can think about depreciating -- depreciation happening in time. And kind of depreciation per day tends to be the highest in the fourth quarter. And so if you look back at our historical numbers and kind of massage out cars bought from customers and days to sale, you just kind of see those sorts of trends in there. And so I think that's the major driver that's underneath our expectation and that's something that we've seen over many years since launching in 2013.\nDaniel Powell: Okay. Thanks. And then on finance GPU, obviously, really strong performance. Similar type question there, with the interest rate environment that we're in, any reason that the strength that you're seeing on the sale of the receivables there would deteriorate for any meaningful reason? And on a somewhat related note was there anything in the tighter credit standards that you felt like impacted conversion on the site in the quarter? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So what I would start with there is I think we also gave some directional color for our expectations for finance GPU in the shareholder letter and said we expect it to follow normal seasonal patterns. So there is some pattern there which relates to a number of relatively small factors, but the data to create the seasonal pattern. So I won't dive into all those underlying factors right now. I think in terms of what happened this quarter with finance GPU, I think there were a lot of things that were moving. And so I'll try to give you a quick list and hopefully that would be helpful in figuring out what we believe is sustainable for the long run. So first and I think most importantly I do believe that we made some fundamental improvements to our credit platform. That includes improvements in credit scoring and credit pricing and credit structuring, and just getting more efficient at all those things. So I think there was some fundamental improvement that we would certainly expect to persist. One is going through the pandemic we tightened credit pretty dramatically. We've maintained tighter than normal credit standards and -- that are continuing today. When you tighten credit all else constant you generally would expect to be originating more valuable loans. You also would tend to expect lower sales volumes. But so I think as it relates to finance GPU that would be a tailwind to finance GPU that at some point we would likely unwind as credit markets normalize and kind of the current environment becomes a little bit clearer. And then you'd expect that to be a tailwind to sales. I think the market clearly got better in terms of the execution of just credit markets in general. So I think that that was a tailwind going from Q2 to Q3, but I think it's that would kind of be just moving more to a more normal function market. Interest rates clearly went down. All else constant interest rates reducing and kind of benchmarks and spreads reducing generally would lead to increases in the value of finance receivables, because consumer prices are -- interest rates are generally stickier than the underlying benchmarks. And so I think that that would be a tailwind. That one can play out over a little bit longer period of time, but I would not expect that to be persistent in the long run. And then I think that's offset to some degree by the fact that we didn't monetize in the ABS markets this quarter. We monetized the vast majority of those we originate in our platform through our partnership with Ally, which is the great partnership we've discussed in the past that provides with so many benefits including flexibility and strength and reliability that we saw going through the pandemic. But that channel generally speaking is not as economically efficient as securitization. So I think that was something that went a different direction and kind of worked against us in the quarter. I think in the immediate term there's a lot of things that potentially could move that make it a little bit hard to forecast but operating under the assumption that kind of big macro factors remain in a similar spot to where they are now, we would expect to see somewhat normal seasonal trends going from Q3 to Q4. And then taking a longer lens where we found ourselves from a finance GPU perspective this quarter was basically at the high end of the long-term model that we put out in November of 2018. And I think that we clearly vetted that at the time and thought about it pretty carefully and we believe that those are kind of long-term sustainable numbers, connecting the dots between here and there. I'm sure there's going to be some bumps along the way, but we don't think there's anything that's clearly not sustainable in the long run in finance GPU. \nDaniel Powell : Thanks, very helpful. Appreciate it.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. \nRajat Gupta: Hi. Good afternoon. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the previous question on finance GPU. You mentioned the long-term target had high $1,400 at the high end. But I think when you put out those targets your benchmark rate assumptions were higher your spread assumptions were also higher. Both are much smaller and tighter now. So is it fair to assume that if rates stay lower for longer your upside potential there is meaningfully higher than that $1,400 or not? And I had a follow-up. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: First order, I think we haven't seen enough yet to make us think that we should materially change our long-term financial targets. I think that we should think about kind of the value of the loans being driven by the spread and capturable value between the consumer interest rate and the underlying benchmarks. And so as benchmarks move down the spread between those and kind of the loss adjusted kind of interest stream that we get it doesn't necessarily move. And so I think that when interest rates are moving that can have a short-term impact, but it probably shouldn't have a sustained long-term impact. So I think that in a vacuum would not be sufficient to change our long-term model.\nRajat Gupta: Got it. Got it. Okay. Makes sense. And then just on SG&A leverage a nice progress here in the third quarter. Within the different buckets, are there any areas maybe around advertising or other overhead expenses where you might have tightened spend temporarily that should start to come back in the future? Or should we view it as being a more normalized level in the third quarter? Just curious as to the puts and takes there as we go forward. Thanks.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So I think on SG&A if we're during into the fourth quarter, I think we're expecting normal seasonal patterns in total SG&A as we start to ramp up for 2021 first half. And normally Q3 and Q4 are investment periods for us where we start the seasonal investment process to prepare for the next year. And so we'd expect that to be the case this year as well on total SG&A while also showing leverage over 2019. So I think that's sort of the leading pattern that I would suggest for Q4. I think in a bigger picture sense I think we're very excited about the leverage that we're now showing year-over-year now that we've moved a couple of steps away from COVID. We certainly expect to show more leverage looking forward into the future. I think one thing that we're very excited about is the patterns that we're seeing in SG&A in our cohorts where older markets tend to have significantly lower advertising expense per unit than newer markets, significantly lower last mile delivery and logistics expense per unit than newer markets, and then much higher market shares, which means lower overhead per unit. And all of that I think all those patterns that we're seeing in the cohorts I think give us a lot of excitement about where we expect SG&A to head over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird.\nDalton Kern: This is Dalton Kern on for Colin. Just another question on the reconditioning capacity looking forward to Q4. I know it sounds like just acquiring inventory and getting it through the pipeline seems like the primary constraint rather than absolute capacity in the network. But can you give a sense for how much if anything the Ohio and Orlando IRCs are going to be able to contribute near term? How long does that take to kind of ramp up and bring them online? And when should we expect that to start to help flow through? And then separately just on the topic of the cohort, profitability and SG&A specifically. A lot of the scale benefits in proximity make sense in terms of lower logistics expenses. But can you talk about how advertising in your older cohorts is trending relative to your long-term targets and kind of anything you've learned there that you think is applicable to your longer term strategy in driving advertising leverage? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So on the new IRCs what I would say is we're working hard to make sure that we're laying out that facility capacity as quickly as we can. And then we have our goal is to ramp that up. We're working to make sure that we build the process to enable it to ramp it up as quickly as we can but it also becomes a choice on how quickly we ramp it up once we have those facilities up and running. Now right now it's a little harder to forecast than normal because I do think coronavirus has impacted things from a hiring perspective from a training perspective and in certain cases from an efficiency perspective. And I think that is more true when caseloads get higher, which we've seen recently. We haven't yet seen that impact the inspection centers today, but there's certainly some risk of that in the future. And so I don't know that we want to be forecasting precisely how quickly we'll be ramping inventory. Right now our expectation is that it will continue to ramp as it has over the last several months and potentially a little bit faster but I don't think we want to quantify it more than that. And Mark can I hand it over to you?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yeah. And then on advertising expense in older cohorts, so I think we're feeling pretty good about the patterns that we're seeing there. I think we've always seen cohorts that are older and have had more time to accumulate awareness in word of mouth, have meaningfully lower advertising expense per unit or ad ex as a percent of revenue than newer cohorts where we're just getting ramped up in terms of raising awareness of our offering. I think what that means is our older cohorts are significantly closer to our long-term model than the company average as a whole or certainly newer cohorts that are in that early phase. I think in Q3 our older cohorts are probably on the order of maybe 50 basis points or so outside of our long-term target. And so I think obviously we feel pretty good about that just given all the opportunities for continued improvement and continued growth that we have. And as I was mentioning earlier I think we're very encouraged by the trends that we're seeing in cohort unit economics, which give us a lot of conviction about our path to the long-term model and SG&A.\nDalton Kern: Perfect. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Exane Paribas.\nChris Bottiglieri: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on your early profitability milestones. By my math, I have you your earliest markets with EBITDA margins of around 7% to 7.5%. If your overhead was at your long-term target you'd essentially be at the midpoint of your long-term margins. Yet your market share in these early markets it's still a little bit below your long-term targets. So I guess the question is with that backdrop, is there anything you've seen today that's made you more constructive or bullish on your long-term targets? Are there's sort of like certain segments or cost structures, where you have better visibility into than you might have had two years ago?\nErnie Garcia: I think we're obviously extremely happy with, where we are. We're extremely happy with how the company has performed. We hit a bunch of milestones this quarter. I think the underlying cohorts look great. We're extremely happy about that. I also think, it's early to be focusing too much on, kind of raising the long-term model. I think that long-term model we put out there we put a lot of thought into. We believe we've got a very clear path there. And we think that path is becoming, clearer at least to the outside world all the time. We feel like, it's been clear for a while. But I think it's getting clear to the outside all the time. So we're going to keep marching toward that. At the company level, we still obviously have a lot of work to do as we continue to expand and lever that SG&A further. But I think things are looking really good. We're very confident. I'm not sure it would be prudent to raise the long-term financial model, at this point though.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lee Krowl with B. Riley Securities.\nLee Krowl: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First question, in the shareholder letter you mentioned consumer preference migration several times. I wondered to get a little bit more detail on that, particularly against the dynamics of kind of new versus used mix as we've seen it shift over the summer, but also just kind of the dynamic of purchasing digitally versus the dealership. What have you guys seen? What seems a little bit faster than expected? And what seems a little bit more durable versus kind of the near-term dynamics?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think it's probably a number of things that have happened. I think one is clearly is a move toward digital in everything, not just in buying a car, but in everything. I think as people choose to stay home more. And choose to distance more from others. I think just more things in general are happening online. And as more things happen online people get more comfortable doing things online. And I think that generates habit formation. I think generally speaking, the biggest inhibitor to change is pre-existing habits. And when, you go through something like this where habits are forced to change people try new things. They like new things. And new habits are created. And so, I think our expectation there would be that that is likely to be a persistent change. And it's an acceleration of trends that were already clearly underway, given the results that we've shown over the last 6.5 years prior to the last year. But I do think that's likely an acceleration, I think another thing that is happening is there seems to be a shift toward personal car ownership. I think it's hard to say exactly how persistent that will be over time. But that seems to be a trend that is real and seems fairly strong at the moment. It seems like the underlying drivers of that have a high likelihood of being able to persist over time. I think the shift from new to used is, most likely transitory. I think that the biggest driver is just the mechanical driver of there being fewer new cars, and production being impacted with the manufacturers. And then, that's just kind of putting a just cap on how many sales you actually can have. So that's probably the biggest driver. The other driver is generally speaking in periods of economic distress there tends to be substitution into less expensive cars. And so, that is probably also at play to a lesser degree. I think both of those we should think of as transitory. And those probably have implications for all kinds of different things, including the way that car prices will migrate over time. And I think it's hard to forecast. But I think those are the major trends. I think the other trend that was present early in the pandemic was basically a lack of other options. There just weren't other places to buy a car. I think we've moved through that. And so I think that was the most transitory of forces. But I think that that one is behind us at this point.\nLee Krowl: Got it. And then, just a quick follow-up, obviously the priority is to scale inventory and broaden the offering. Could you maybe just talk about shifting from your core kind of center inventory out into the value and luxury type SKUs, that some of your competitors focus on and perhaps the GPU implications of those?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. At a high level going back to the spring that we discussed earlier, I think we view our job as building the best transactions just between, customers and cars. And then, we don't think our offering is specific, in any way shape or form to a specific type of car. We think that we could go way up to more expensive cars. And we think we can go way down to less expensive cars. We think customers when they're looking to buy a car, they want a great selection. They want to find the car they're looking for. They want a fair deal. They want a simple process. They want a process that's fast once they've decided what they're going to do. They want confidence the car is in good shape. They want confidence that if they make a mistake and doesn't fit their life they can return it. And those things really have nothing to do with the specifics of a car. So I think we feel like, we've got an opportunity to serve a very broad swath of customers looking for all types of cars over time. And I think we're just trying to do the best job we can with all of our other priorities just managing which things we're tackling at what point in time. And we have been steadily broadening our car offering. But I think there's a lot of room to go, but especially buying cars from customers has given us access to both, cheaper cars and more expensive cars and more diverse cars. So I think that, that's -- that is happening today. But there's clearly more room for that. And then from a GPU perspective, at a very high level I think the simplest way to think about it is the cars that we're selling don't impact GPU, in a super material way. They would flow through, retail with a kind of moderate impact that would be related to the kind of expense level of the car. More expensive cars do have moderately higher GPUs and cheaper cars can have moderately lower GPUs. But that's not a huge impact and it's -- you can kind of think of it as being a large portion of the margins being fixed and then a relatively small portion of the margin being related to the price of the car. And then from a finance GPU perspective, I think, generally speaking, that one is more proportionate to the price of the car. So I think you can kind of think about that as having the relationships that you'd expect there. Wholesale, I don't think has a very strong relationship to the car, nor does the other. So it's not a huge driver of that. And I think inside of the likely bands that we would move at an aggregate company level, I don't know that you should expect that to be a huge driver of GPU migrations in the long run. But I do think, as we broaden, that's an opportunity to just broaden our offering and positively impact more customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Erickson with Needham & Company. \nBrad Erickson: Hi. Thanks. Just a couple for me. I guess another one on the oldest five cohorts in Q3 you called out in the letter, which I guess were solidly EBITDA positive. Can you give us a sense of growth rates going on in those markets, just relative to corporate average? I get that they may be lower, just because inherently they're more mature, but just curious if that's wrong, any color you can provide there?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, I think, generally that frame is correct. I would say, the trends we've historically seen is, newer markets tend to grow faster. They benefit from pre-existing awareness and a lot of inventory early in their life. And then older markets tend to grow slower. As they get bigger, they're just working off of a bigger base, so they continue to grow quickly. I think, right now, we're in an especially unique time. When you're looking at different markets, the different markets are impacted in different ways by the different operational constraints that we've got in the business. And so, I think, when we're looking at this internally, what we're always focused on is what's happening to underlying demand. And we can kind of massage out what's happening to underlying demand by looking at what's happening to sales and looking at the drivers of conversion that impacts sales, which include where inventory is how much inventory is close to different markets, what delivery times are in different markets, what our inventory distribution looks like relative to the distribution that is traditionally sold in different markets, what our credit policies are relative to the distribution of credits in different markets. There can be a lot of different drivers there that can impact things between those markets and that's why we generally, outside of annual and aggregating at the cohort level, we haven't provided a ton of detail on individual markets. But when you look at all that together and just say what's happening to demand, generally across the country, whether it's looking at newer cohorts and older cohorts or looking at different geos or anything else, we're seeing very consistent trends in demand growth.\nBrad Erickson: Got it. That's helpful. And then, just wanted to follow up. I'm still a little confused on kind of what you're saying about the sustainability of the strong pricing you're seeing lately. So, on the one hand, like, it seems like some of the inventory constraints are going to persist a little bit here. You're not committing the sort of a magnitude of improvement in Q4. On the other hand, you mentioned wholesale channels should sort of display a little more normal back half depreciation characteristics. So can you just tell us like which of those is a more important force for pricing into Q4?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So let me -- I think, let's start with wholesale, I think, that's simpler. There was clearly abnormal dynamics in the way that vehicle pricing migrated really over the last, probably six months, give or take. And I think that that was -- probably, if you had to look at what was the driving force, it would have been stimulus probably provided an extra demand for cars. I think people spending more time at home and less time on services, it gave them more money to spend on cars. So it was probably a positive boon to demand. I think potentially the shift toward personal ownership was helpful there. But then, I also think that there was less production capacity with the manufacturers, which meant that there was fewer new cars and so that was helpful for new car pricing and then that kind of flows over into used cars and kind of down to cheaper used cars as well. So, I think, we've clearly seen abnormal dynamics in the whole market that we would not expect to persist in the long run. If you look at our wholesale profit per wholesale unit, we showed record numbers by a long, long way in the third quarter. And so, I think, what we called out in terms of our directional expectation there heading into the fourth quarter, as we would expect it to be normal seasonal patterns, but more pronounced than normal. And the reason that they would be normal, directionally, is because normally you do move into a higher depreciation environment going from Q3 to Q4. But this year we expect that delta in depreciation to be significantly higher. And in certain segments there was even vehicle appreciation in the third quarter. And so, from a relative depreciation perspective, we expect it to be materially higher. And so, we think in the long run, the types of property we were able to show for wholesale unit this quarter are likely achievable. That's what we've got at the high end of our long-term model. But we think that, between here and there, we're clearly in a step down and then start to build again, as we've been building for the last several years, because it just wasn't a normal environment. When you're looking at retail, I think, dynamics are different. In theory, they should be related, because as we buy cars from customers, something we've historically said is that the incremental margin that we get on cars bought from customers is similar to the wholesale margin that we get on cars that we buy from customers and sell wholesale. In this quarter, I think, that that relationship wasn't as tight as it's historically been, just because different segments of cars were appreciating and depreciating at different rates. And then also, because we weren't buying cars in the absolute trough that was in kind of late Q2 and Q3, we just weren't -- or sorry, late Q1, early Q2, we were buying cars during that period and that would have been the period where you would have bought cars and seen the most appreciation. And then, there's also some dynamics with just the way that we handle pricing. We generally don't write cars up, even if there is appreciation and we have time-based write downs that are a function not only of time-based depreciation, but also how that car is performing relative to other cars on our site. And so, the way that we handle our retail pricing provides a lot more stability, and kind of less exposure to the way the wholesale market is operating. And so we expect retail to move back like we said, similar to the seasonality we saw in Q4 2018, but not nearly as dramatically as we would expect wholesale to move back which we do think was powered by clearly abnormal forces. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: Good afternoon. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. So one question, I really want to ask just dive deeper into resisting the whole \u2013 the effort to buy more cars from customers. I mean, clearly a big driver here for a while particularly in the quarter. But how significant \u2013 how large could that become for Carvana? And as you continue to drive that effort stronger or higher are there incremental benefits to your company meaning are you going to be able to buy cars even better over time from customers?\nErnest Garcia: Sure. So I think \u2013 at this point, I think the business of buying cars from customers that team has done an absolutely unbelievable job building out that customer experience, the technology that supports it, and the operational capacity to handle it. I really \u2013 I want to talk again about that stat that, I gave my prepared remarks. It's pretty remarkable when you think that from Q2 to Q3, we increased the number of cars bought from customers by 50,000 units in one quarter. That's a pretty incredible number. And I think the team just did an unbelievable job to enable us to do that. So that's really exciting. I think, because of all that growth, and because they were able to grow on top of the infrastructure that we've been building over the last several years to service the retail side of the business, they were able to catch up to retail really fast. We've only been really investing in this business for a couple of years and it's made a ton of progress. But I do think these businesses are in theory at least largely independent. As we discussed earlier, they're connected through trade-in, but the majority of the volume in both cases is independent. And so I think from here our goal is to grow each business as quickly as we possibly can and effectively have those businesses race each other, so everyone's winning I think is effectively, what we're trying to do. And so I think it's \u2013 when we're stating these businesses as a ratio of one other that's going to be a function of how one business is progressing relative to the other, but we're going to be trying to move them both forward as quickly as we possibly can because we're very small compared to both opportunities and so we're excited about that. As it relates to opportunity to get better, there's no doubt. I mean, I think across the entire business, there's opportunity to get better everywhere. And I think every group inside the business on the retail side and on the purchasing side, I think has one million things they want to get done and looks at what we currently have and is mildly embarrassed by, and really excited about what's about to come next. So I think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity. I think to some degree there's debatably even more opportunity in buying cars from customers just because that's a younger business. And so we haven't had as much time to invest in that offering as we've had to invest in retail. But I think we're very early in both. And then both businesses also benefit from volume. As we get more volume, we get smarter at bidding, and we get smarter at pricing, we get smarter at merchandising. So I think we get better at a lot of different things. So I do think volume will make us better.\nBrian Nagel: Very helpful. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nErnest Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nat Schindler with Bank of America.\nNat Schindler: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple ones. I don't mean to belabor the point, and I know you've gone over this. But can you be a little more specific on the GPU guidance? And I know you're saying it's going to be more like 20 -- Q4 2018 than Q4 2019. But I got to be clear is that gross profit per retail unit inclusive of the other revenue i.e. the total gross profit per retail unit which really wasn't all much of a difference in the move sequentially in 2018 versus 2019? 2018 it was down 7% sequentially and 2019 it was down 5%. Are you talking just the retail sales \u2013 just the retail part not including the other funding?\nMark Jenkins: First, so I'll take a crack at that. I think the biggest thing that we expect to see is that wholesale GPU per wholesale unit number to return to more normalized levels, which is a sort of accentuated seasonality relative to what we've seen in previous years, because the wholesale market we do think was in an abnormal depreciation environment through most of Q3, and we expect to see return to sort of normal seasonality. So I think \u2013 with that, I think we expect to see a change in wholesale GPU that's going to be driven by that wholesale gross profit per wholesale unit sold number. In retail, I think the way we're thinking about it is sort of within the range of normal seasonality and by normal seasonality what we mean by that is sort of just looking at sequential changes in retail GPU. And we think the normal seasonality is best reflected by 2018, because 2019 had a number of other factors going on with us scaling up buying cars from customers, for example, that we think led it to not have what sort of a normal seasonality in the retail component of GPU would look like. And so I think those are some of the trends. I think there is some seasonal trends that can happen in financial GPU as well, which Ernie pointed to. So I think like at a very high level we think generally speaking we expect to see normal seasonality. We expect to see sort of extends seasonality or accentuated seasonality in wholesale, gross profit per wholesale units sold. And when thinking about what historical seasonality looks like, we think 2018 is probably a better benchmark than 2019 on the retail side just because of the other dynamics that were impacting Q4 2019. That's hopefully a helpful summary.\nNat Schindler: I'm still actually confused. So what I'm confused about is just simple definitions here. When you're talking about retail units sold, you're not talking about total retail gross profit, which is inclusive of other revenue the financing. You're talking about just the retail sale of the car. And in which case that fell sequentially in 2018 -- Q4 2018 sequentially it fell by 22%, while in 2019 it grew. So -- but there isn't much of a seasonal pattern here to look at because the earlier patterns are much -- are all over the place. But -- so -- but are you just saying just the retail side? That number I guess it was like $1,900. That number goes -- is going to go down similar to what it fell in 4Q 2018 from 3Q 2018.\nMark Jenkins: Yes. We're talking -- with that piece of the commentary, we're talking about the retail component of GPU that's correct. And then we gave some separate commentary related to wholesale GPU, which is another separate line item. And then with respect to finance and other GPU, we gave a little bit of commentary as well.\nErnie Garcia: That piece is related to the retail component GPU.\nMark Jenkins: That's correct.\nNat Schindler: Okay. Got that. Okay. Then just a couple more questions just very quickly. In the last quarterly note, you gave us a July unit growth to just tell us where trends were for the third quarter. I know you're not giving actual much guidance in -- for the whole quarter but is there any -- can you give us anything that happened in October just to give us a baseline? Or I know it's not totally over but\u2026\nErnie Garcia: Yeah. I think we want to stick with the commentary that we've provided so far. We think that the Q4 sales growth is going to largely be a function of our ability to produce more cars and we're working very hard at that.\nNat Schindler: Okay. And then just one final question. This is more of a kind of a long-term how margins might flow out question as you do a whole lot more of this buying from consumers. So obviously, you've talked a lot about the GPU value. If you purchase a car from consumers, you get it for a much lower price than from auctions. It's less efficient market totally makes sense. But how much incremental operating expenses are there? When you purchase a car from auction, it's not a lot of -- it's a lot of cars in a single place. They're often right near your IRCs. So if you -- but if you buy cars from consumers they're all over the place. You then -- and they also -- it takes people to negotiate in that and talk. Is there a lot of extra operating expense in that relative to buying at the auction?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So I think the biggest expense is associated with buying cars from customers is an inventory source is exactly what you laid out. It's basically the labor and delivery/pickup costs of going out to a customer's driveway to pick up the car and then bringing it into our logistics network and then transporting it into one of our IRCs. All of those expenses are actually -- those are reflected in our wholesale gross profit number as well as in our retail gross profit number. And when we say that buying cars from customers is more profitable than buying cars from auctions that's -- what we mean by that is it's more profitable net of those expenses of going to get the car from the customer and bring it into the IRCs. So I think that's the most important point is the most significant expenses. There are some other little expenses in call center and the like. But the most significant expenses are in picking up the car from the customer and transporting it to our IRCs which are all reflected in our GPU numbers and are also reflected when we say that those cars are more profitable than the cars sourced from auction.\nOperator: And our last question today comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler.\nAlex Potter: Thanks very much. I'll just ask one here. Average days to sale and I guess the inventory dwell time they've been also really strong lately. And obviously that was a contributor to your retail GPU. Just wondering, if you could comment on how much of that is sticky? I mean, part of that could just be that consumers are snapping up cars as soon as they show up on the website; the other part maybe is your own ability to process vehicles more quickly through inventories. I guess, if you could just maybe talk through both sides of that equation and let us know which ones are sustainable versus not? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. I think instead of using the language of sticky, I think I would use the language of it's largely a choice. I think our demand is growing. And at any given level of demand paired with any given level of inventory, you're going to have some turn time that will emerge in that. And then as you grow your inventory from there, you're going to increase conversion, but you're unlikely to increase conversion by as much as you grew inventory, so your turn time may get a little bit longer. And so, I think we can use in a normalized environment where we have as much inventory as we would like, we can use inventory as a lever that we can think of similar to marketing to kind of have some incremental expense that flows through retail GPU that helps us to acquire more customers. And so I think that's a lever that in general we have today, we don't have that lever. It's not really an active lever because we're just trying to produce as many cars as we possibly can to catch back up to the demand levels that we're seeing. But moving forward I think that that is largely a choice and then at kind of equilibrium in the long run, once you've got a fulsome selection of cars which takes many more cars than we have today, there's no real need to continue to build out selection of cars when you have again fulsome selection that's located well across the country to minimize delivery times. And so at that point, I think there would be a kind of meaningful and secular decrease in turn times. But between here and there, it's largely a choice and it's one of the many levers that we have to drive customer demand.\nAlex Potter: Okay, very good. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you, everyone for joining the call. We really appreciate it. To everyone out there on Team Carvana, I hope you're proud of the achievements that we had this quarter. It's pretty remarkable for us to have our first EBITDA positive quarter as a company for us to hit $4000 GPU. But please remember that, as incredible as those achievements are, it's all a function of the things that we do every day and have been doing for the last many, many years. And it's all because of how much you choose to care and how you've made this mission your mission. So thank you so much. I hope you take a moment to enjoy the view and gloat a little bit, but then I hope we get back to it because we still have a lot of work to do. Thank you for all that you do.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ernie Garcia",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike and thanks everyone for joining the call. The third quarter was an exceptional quarter for us financially and operationally. Let's start with the financial highlights. The biggest headline is that it was our first EBITDA positive quarter as a company. We also crossed $4,000 GPU for the first time. These are incredible milestones and both carry significant meaning and implications for our long-term financial performance and our strategic flexibility. The numbers themselves are exciting. We think they are even more remarkable when putting them in context. In the last four years, we've improved gross profit margin by almost 12%, SG&A as a percent of revenue by over 12%, and EBITDA margin by about 25%. We've made all of that progress while simultaneously making the investments necessary to grow the business more than 10x. In addition the third quarter also saw incredible operational achievements. The first and most notable of these was that we bought more cars from our customers than we sold them for the first time in our history. This is an amazing accomplishment that was only made possible at the quality of experiences we deliver to our customers the quality brand we've created, the infrastructure we are building, and the Herculean effort put forth by our team. In the third quarter, we bought almost twice as many cars from our customers as we bought at our previous peak in Q1 of this year and over three times as many cars as we bought from our customers in the second quarter. That kind of sequential growth is pretty unbelievable, but we think it's even more impressive at our current scale. In order to achieve it our operations team had to handle a one quarter sequential increase in cars bought from customers of over 50,000 units. In addition the ops team made quick progress toward alleviating our inventory constraints. During the quarter, production caught up for retail sales then grew further, enabling us to substantially increase our inventory by the end of the quarter. While this is impressive progress, we still ended the quarter with just half the inventory that was immediately available for our customers as we had prior to the pandemic. At our current demand levels we prefer to be much higher than we were even then and therefore still have a lot of work to do in this area. The team is doing an unbelievable job and we expect to continue to make rapid progress over the next several months to position us very well for another big growth year in 2021. Now, I'd like to take a step back. While the results of the third quarter are exciting and significant, it's important to maintain our perspective and to focus on what is underneath the numbers. Our progress over the last seven and a half years from a fledgling start-up in a single market that delivered one car to one of our customers once every several days to becoming the fastest-growing automotive retailer in the U.S. with $4,000 gross profit per unit and breakeven EBITDA has come from four powerful and persistent forces. One, our clear mission vision and values. We know where we are going and we know how we're going to get there. Two, our unwavering focus on our customers. We know that what really matters is making our customers' lives a little better. We know their expectations are always rising and we are always working to keep us and to surpass those expectations. Three, our long-term focus. We aren't afraid to lay the foundations today that are necessary to build big things tomorrow even when we don't see immediate results. And four, the strength of our team. Companies are collections of people. Our people choose to care. They believe in what we are doing and find meaning in it. They dream big, they aren't satisfied with what they've done, they don't think it's good enough, and they can't wait to make it better. These four forces are powerful. They're what really matter. They provide the relentless pressure that drives long-term progress. They are what brought us here. So, what does this mean for our future? Customer preferences have accelerated their shift in our direction. Our financial performance and positions are stronger than ever before. Our team is executing at the highest level in our history. We're delivering the best customer experiences available in buying or selling a car. We have a scalable offering to get better as it gets bigger. We've demonstrated the power of our mission, our customer-centricity, our long-term focus, and our incredible team. We couldn't ask to be in a better position.  Our job is to keep marching. To never allow ourselves to be satisfied, to overcome the challenges that will continually arise along the way to always get better. If we do that, we're going to hit our goals of selling two million-plus cars per year and of becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. And we're going to fulfill our mission of changing the way people buy cars. Mark? Sure. I'll try the best I can on that. So I think we wouldn't want to quantify precisely what demand would have been in the third quarter had we had significantly higher inventory levels, but there's no doubt that customers are sensitive to selection. And if you have more cars on the site they're more likely to find what they're looking for and therefore conversion goes up. And so I think there's little doubt that it impacted things in a pretty material way most likely. I think our inventory as we exited the third quarter in terms of cars that were available for a customer to buy that were kind of ready they could click on and start the purchase process with that was roughly half what it was pre-pandemic. Pre-pandemic we had significantly lower sales volumes than we have today. So our ideal inventory would be higher than we were pre-pandemic. And then we believe we have that inventory our sales would be higher still and so our ideal inventory would probably be higher again. So I think right now the goal is to build inventory as quickly as we can. The team has done an incredible job. We've made a ton of progress in the last three months. And I think we've laid the foundation to make even faster progress moving forward. Mark talked in his prepared remarks about everything that we're doing in terms of opening new facilities: we opened our ninth in the quarter; we opened our tenth at quarter end; we plan to open our 11th before year-end. So that's going to bring us to a total capacity of about 600,000 units. And then we're doing our best to staff up and train and get ready to build out as many units we possibly can to serve the demand that we expect to come in the future. So I think we're really optimistic about where we are. Right now we're focused on continuing to build out that capacity as quickly we can and to then fill it out with actual production. But I don't know that we want to yet quantify the precise impacts. Driven by variation in depreciation rates, et cetera. Thank you. Sure. So first with Q4 volume, I think, the kind of outlook that we provided in the shareholder letter was that we expect normal seasonal trends across all the major line items and so that would also relate to retail units. And I think you outlined kind of two big differences that will be going on this year versus years prior. One we don't plan to run the Cyber Monday promotion as we focus more on building our inventory and preparing for a big first half 2021. And then two as we continue to build inventory we do expect that to be a tailwind to conversion. And so kind of that's what sits underneath our expectations for a similar seasonal shape to years past. And then as it relates to inspection centers, I think, we're clearly in investment mode in terms of trying to build out capacity to deliver cars to customers and produce cars that are ready for customers and have been for a while and that's been part of our long-term plan. Building out inspection centers is the most operationally intensive and kind of longest lead time lever in the business. And so in general we're always trying to stay out in front of that as best we can. Now from an investment perspective, as you're thinking about cash we've got a lot of different ways that we can finance that. We've obviously got roughly $1.8 billion of liquidity resource on the balance sheet so we can choose just to financial those with our own cash or we can choose to finance those in the sale-leaseback market if we don't want to use cash for that purpose. So I think we're flexible there. And then in terms of the way that it impacts earnings as we open more inspection centers there can be marginal impacts as that kind of the cost of those centers and the depreciation of the centers flows through fewer units, but that's not a super material driver. So I wouldn't expect that to be a huge part of our story. Thank you. Sure. Thanks for the question. So on the first I think -- we're very, very focused on continuing to build out the business to deliver constantly incredible customer experiences at growing scale and to get that flywheel going where we get better as we get bigger. And I think there's lots of forms that takes. In the letter, we discussed kind of growing inventory, giving customers more selection, having inventory in more locations to the inspection centers, shortening delivery times. So there's a lot of different forms that takes. I think there are also a lot of other theoretic reforms that could take and there are a lot of other things that we could do to build out additional benefits for our customers. We'll continue to invest in those tests and to kind of look at opportunities to make our offering even better for our customers. But at any point in time, we're running several tests that I would say fit into the bucket that you're describing. In general, when we're running those tests. We're going to value those tests through the lens of what do they mean for our customer experience, what do they mean from a scalability perspective, what do they mean from an economics perspective. And when we feel like we've run those tests and got them to a place where we feel really good about the outcome through those three lenses then we'll likely pour resources on them and we'll talk about them a lot more and we'll seek to grow them out in the same way that we've grown buying cars from customers. But I don't think we have any projects that have yet risen to that level of discussion. Going to your second question, I think, there's enormous opportunities there. We're still very, very small compared to the retail market in terms of the number of customers out there buying cars and the fraction of those customers that are buying cars from us. We're also very, very small compared to the market of customers that are disposing of their cars. And so I think those two markets are to some degree independent and then they're connected when a customer chooses to do two transactions simultaneously through a trade-in. What we are going to seek to do is to make sure that we're giving customers the best offering available on both sides of the transaction if they want to buy a car or if they want to sell a car. And then as we get those customer interactions, we have an opportunity to explain to them the other things that we do as well. And I think that can happen simultaneously and would look like a trade-in or I think that it can happen with lag where a seller becomes a buyer six months down the road or a buyer becomes a seller six months down the road. And so again, I think, the thing that matters most there is we want to focus on our customers make sure their experiences are great, make sure our offering is in a really good spot. And then just scale both as quickly as we can because we're very, very small compared to the opportunity. I think the simple answer to that question so far is no. And I'm not sure that should be that surprising because I do think that we're very small compared to this market. In the quarter depending on what I'm using from a market perspective, we are probably around 0.6% of the total transactions in the market. And then probably the list of competitors that you're referencing if we add them all up might add five to -- probably not a lot more than 5% additional market share on top of that. So I think all of the bigger players that I think are starting to get more focused in this direction, even if you sum them are still small compared to the market. So I think the overall opportunity is really, really large. And I think when we think about what's most important for us, you have to kind of decide what you focus on and we would like to think that we're the clear leaders in this space and we think that the important area for our focus to be on is just on our customers because they're telling us where we need to go. And so we're continuing to really focus there. And then we think that the dynamics of the market that we've discussed in the past the fragmentation and the relatively few players that really have the capacity to make large financial investments and building out a true e-commerce platform suggests that that's not necessarily the area where we should be putting most of our focus. We think that we offer the best customer experience that we have the most scalable model and that we've got the capacity now through our balance sheet and also through our financial performance to be able to invest in our offering. And so we're focused on us. We're focused on execution. We're focused on our customers. And I don't think we're yet seeing anything that's impacting us from any competitive moves. Yes. Thank you. So what I would say is, our focus has been and remains on delivering great experiences to customers that are buying used cars. I think our platform is you can think of as kind of being the thing that sits between cars and customers. And I think everything that we do, our strategic lens is we're looking at different ways to acquire cars and make sure that we've got inventory available for our customers and we want to make sure that we have the best and simplest transaction that can connect them -- connect our customers up to those cars. And so I think that's kind of interesting opportunities theoretically in the future. But I also think, it's important for any given company to make sure that you stay focused on the things that are most important at any point in time as you continually drive toward those things. And so for us that thing is making sure that we're delivering great experiences to our customers who want to buy or sell used cars. So I would just start with normal seasonality. Normally there is variation in depreciation rates across the year with the fourth quarter tending to have the fastest depreciation rates. You can think about depreciating -- depreciation happening in time. And kind of depreciation per day tends to be the highest in the fourth quarter. And so if you look back at our historical numbers and kind of massage out cars bought from customers and days to sale, you just kind of see those sorts of trends in there. And so I think that's the major driver that's underneath our expectation and that's something that we've seen over many years since launching in 2013. Sure. So what I would start with there is I think we also gave some directional color for our expectations for finance GPU in the shareholder letter and said we expect it to follow normal seasonal patterns. So there is some pattern there which relates to a number of relatively small factors, but the data to create the seasonal pattern. So I won't dive into all those underlying factors right now. I think in terms of what happened this quarter with finance GPU, I think there were a lot of things that were moving. And so I'll try to give you a quick list and hopefully that would be helpful in figuring out what we believe is sustainable for the long run. So first and I think most importantly I do believe that we made some fundamental improvements to our credit platform. That includes improvements in credit scoring and credit pricing and credit structuring, and just getting more efficient at all those things. So I think there was some fundamental improvement that we would certainly expect to persist. One is going through the pandemic we tightened credit pretty dramatically. We've maintained tighter than normal credit standards and -- that are continuing today. When you tighten credit all else constant you generally would expect to be originating more valuable loans. You also would tend to expect lower sales volumes. But so I think as it relates to finance GPU that would be a tailwind to finance GPU that at some point we would likely unwind as credit markets normalize and kind of the current environment becomes a little bit clearer. And then you'd expect that to be a tailwind to sales. I think the market clearly got better in terms of the execution of just credit markets in general. So I think that that was a tailwind going from Q2 to Q3, but I think it's that would kind of be just moving more to a more normal function market. Interest rates clearly went down. All else constant interest rates reducing and kind of benchmarks and spreads reducing generally would lead to increases in the value of finance receivables, because consumer prices are -- interest rates are generally stickier than the underlying benchmarks. And so I think that that would be a tailwind. That one can play out over a little bit longer period of time, but I would not expect that to be persistent in the long run. And then I think that's offset to some degree by the fact that we didn't monetize in the ABS markets this quarter. We monetized the vast majority of those we originate in our platform through our partnership with Ally, which is the great partnership we've discussed in the past that provides with so many benefits including flexibility and strength and reliability that we saw going through the pandemic. But that channel generally speaking is not as economically efficient as securitization. So I think that was something that went a different direction and kind of worked against us in the quarter. I think in the immediate term there's a lot of things that potentially could move that make it a little bit hard to forecast but operating under the assumption that kind of big macro factors remain in a similar spot to where they are now, we would expect to see somewhat normal seasonal trends going from Q3 to Q4. And then taking a longer lens where we found ourselves from a finance GPU perspective this quarter was basically at the high end of the long-term model that we put out in November of 2018. And I think that we clearly vetted that at the time and thought about it pretty carefully and we believe that those are kind of long-term sustainable numbers, connecting the dots between here and there. I'm sure there's going to be some bumps along the way, but we don't think there's anything that's clearly not sustainable in the long run in finance GPU. Thank you. First order, I think we haven't seen enough yet to make us think that we should materially change our long-term financial targets. I think that we should think about kind of the value of the loans being driven by the spread and capturable value between the consumer interest rate and the underlying benchmarks. And so as benchmarks move down the spread between those and kind of the loss adjusted kind of interest stream that we get it doesn't necessarily move. And so I think that when interest rates are moving that can have a short-term impact, but it probably shouldn't have a sustained long-term impact. So I think that in a vacuum would not be sufficient to change our long-term model. Sure. So on the new IRCs what I would say is we're working hard to make sure that we're laying out that facility capacity as quickly as we can. And then we have our goal is to ramp that up. We're working to make sure that we build the process to enable it to ramp it up as quickly as we can but it also becomes a choice on how quickly we ramp it up once we have those facilities up and running. Now right now it's a little harder to forecast than normal because I do think coronavirus has impacted things from a hiring perspective from a training perspective and in certain cases from an efficiency perspective. And I think that is more true when caseloads get higher, which we've seen recently. We haven't yet seen that impact the inspection centers today, but there's certainly some risk of that in the future. And so I don't know that we want to be forecasting precisely how quickly we'll be ramping inventory. Right now our expectation is that it will continue to ramp as it has over the last several months and potentially a little bit faster but I don't think we want to quantify it more than that. And Mark can I hand it over to you? I think we're obviously extremely happy with, where we are. We're extremely happy with how the company has performed. We hit a bunch of milestones this quarter. I think the underlying cohorts look great. We're extremely happy about that. I also think, it's early to be focusing too much on, kind of raising the long-term model. I think that long-term model we put out there we put a lot of thought into. We believe we've got a very clear path there. And we think that path is becoming, clearer at least to the outside world all the time. We feel like, it's been clear for a while. But I think it's getting clear to the outside all the time. So we're going to keep marching toward that. At the company level, we still obviously have a lot of work to do as we continue to expand and lever that SG&A further. But I think things are looking really good. We're very confident. I'm not sure it would be prudent to raise the long-term financial model, at this point though. Sure. So I think it's probably a number of things that have happened. I think one is clearly is a move toward digital in everything, not just in buying a car, but in everything. I think as people choose to stay home more. And choose to distance more from others. I think just more things in general are happening online. And as more things happen online people get more comfortable doing things online. And I think that generates habit formation. I think generally speaking, the biggest inhibitor to change is pre-existing habits. And when, you go through something like this where habits are forced to change people try new things. They like new things. And new habits are created. And so, I think our expectation there would be that that is likely to be a persistent change. And it's an acceleration of trends that were already clearly underway, given the results that we've shown over the last 6.5 years prior to the last year. But I do think that's likely an acceleration, I think another thing that is happening is there seems to be a shift toward personal car ownership. I think it's hard to say exactly how persistent that will be over time. But that seems to be a trend that is real and seems fairly strong at the moment. It seems like the underlying drivers of that have a high likelihood of being able to persist over time. I think the shift from new to used is, most likely transitory. I think that the biggest driver is just the mechanical driver of there being fewer new cars, and production being impacted with the manufacturers. And then, that's just kind of putting a just cap on how many sales you actually can have. So that's probably the biggest driver. The other driver is generally speaking in periods of economic distress there tends to be substitution into less expensive cars. And so, that is probably also at play to a lesser degree. I think both of those we should think of as transitory. And those probably have implications for all kinds of different things, including the way that car prices will migrate over time. And I think it's hard to forecast. But I think those are the major trends. I think the other trend that was present early in the pandemic was basically a lack of other options. There just weren't other places to buy a car. I think we've moved through that. And so I think that was the most transitory of forces. But I think that that one is behind us at this point. Sure. At a high level going back to the spring that we discussed earlier, I think we view our job as building the best transactions just between, customers and cars. And then, we don't think our offering is specific, in any way shape or form to a specific type of car. We think that we could go way up to more expensive cars. And we think we can go way down to less expensive cars. We think customers when they're looking to buy a car, they want a great selection. They want to find the car they're looking for. They want a fair deal. They want a simple process. They want a process that's fast once they've decided what they're going to do. They want confidence the car is in good shape. They want confidence that if they make a mistake and doesn't fit their life they can return it. And those things really have nothing to do with the specifics of a car. So I think we feel like, we've got an opportunity to serve a very broad swath of customers looking for all types of cars over time. And I think we're just trying to do the best job we can with all of our other priorities just managing which things we're tackling at what point in time. And we have been steadily broadening our car offering. But I think there's a lot of room to go, but especially buying cars from customers has given us access to both, cheaper cars and more expensive cars and more diverse cars. So I think that, that's -- that is happening today. But there's clearly more room for that. And then from a GPU perspective, at a very high level I think the simplest way to think about it is the cars that we're selling don't impact GPU, in a super material way. They would flow through, retail with a kind of moderate impact that would be related to the kind of expense level of the car. More expensive cars do have moderately higher GPUs and cheaper cars can have moderately lower GPUs. But that's not a huge impact and it's -- you can kind of think of it as being a large portion of the margins being fixed and then a relatively small portion of the margin being related to the price of the car. And then from a finance GPU perspective, I think, generally speaking, that one is more proportionate to the price of the car. So I think you can kind of think about that as having the relationships that you'd expect there. Wholesale, I don't think has a very strong relationship to the car, nor does the other. So it's not a huge driver of that. And I think inside of the likely bands that we would move at an aggregate company level, I don't know that you should expect that to be a huge driver of GPU migrations in the long run. But I do think, as we broaden, that's an opportunity to just broaden our offering and positively impact more customers. Sure. So, I think, generally that frame is correct. I would say, the trends we've historically seen is, newer markets tend to grow faster. They benefit from pre-existing awareness and a lot of inventory early in their life. And then older markets tend to grow slower. As they get bigger, they're just working off of a bigger base, so they continue to grow quickly. I think, right now, we're in an especially unique time. When you're looking at different markets, the different markets are impacted in different ways by the different operational constraints that we've got in the business. And so, I think, when we're looking at this internally, what we're always focused on is what's happening to underlying demand. And we can kind of massage out what's happening to underlying demand by looking at what's happening to sales and looking at the drivers of conversion that impacts sales, which include where inventory is how much inventory is close to different markets, what delivery times are in different markets, what our inventory distribution looks like relative to the distribution that is traditionally sold in different markets, what our credit policies are relative to the distribution of credits in different markets. There can be a lot of different drivers there that can impact things between those markets and that's why we generally, outside of annual and aggregating at the cohort level, we haven't provided a ton of detail on individual markets. But when you look at all that together and just say what's happening to demand, generally across the country, whether it's looking at newer cohorts and older cohorts or looking at different geos or anything else, we're seeing very consistent trends in demand growth. Sure. So let me -- I think, let's start with wholesale, I think, that's simpler. There was clearly abnormal dynamics in the way that vehicle pricing migrated really over the last, probably six months, give or take. And I think that that was -- probably, if you had to look at what was the driving force, it would have been stimulus probably provided an extra demand for cars. I think people spending more time at home and less time on services, it gave them more money to spend on cars. So it was probably a positive boon to demand. I think potentially the shift toward personal ownership was helpful there. But then, I also think that there was less production capacity with the manufacturers, which meant that there was fewer new cars and so that was helpful for new car pricing and then that kind of flows over into used cars and kind of down to cheaper used cars as well. So, I think, we've clearly seen abnormal dynamics in the whole market that we would not expect to persist in the long run. If you look at our wholesale profit per wholesale unit, we showed record numbers by a long, long way in the third quarter. And so, I think, what we called out in terms of our directional expectation there heading into the fourth quarter, as we would expect it to be normal seasonal patterns, but more pronounced than normal. And the reason that they would be normal, directionally, is because normally you do move into a higher depreciation environment going from Q3 to Q4. But this year we expect that delta in depreciation to be significantly higher. And in certain segments there was even vehicle appreciation in the third quarter. And so, from a relative depreciation perspective, we expect it to be materially higher. And so, we think in the long run, the types of property we were able to show for wholesale unit this quarter are likely achievable. That's what we've got at the high end of our long-term model. But we think that, between here and there, we're clearly in a step down and then start to build again, as we've been building for the last several years, because it just wasn't a normal environment. When you're looking at retail, I think, dynamics are different. In theory, they should be related, because as we buy cars from customers, something we've historically said is that the incremental margin that we get on cars bought from customers is similar to the wholesale margin that we get on cars that we buy from customers and sell wholesale. In this quarter, I think, that that relationship wasn't as tight as it's historically been, just because different segments of cars were appreciating and depreciating at different rates. And then also, because we weren't buying cars in the absolute trough that was in kind of late Q2 and Q3, we just weren't -- or sorry, late Q1, early Q2, we were buying cars during that period and that would have been the period where you would have bought cars and seen the most appreciation. And then, there's also some dynamics with just the way that we handle pricing. We generally don't write cars up, even if there is appreciation and we have time-based write downs that are a function not only of time-based depreciation, but also how that car is performing relative to other cars on our site. And so, the way that we handle our retail pricing provides a lot more stability, and kind of less exposure to the way the wholesale market is operating. And so we expect retail to move back like we said, similar to the seasonality we saw in Q4 2018, but not nearly as dramatically as we would expect wholesale to move back which we do think was powered by clearly abnormal forces. That piece is related to the retail component GPU. Yeah. I think we want to stick with the commentary that we've provided so far. We think that the Q4 sales growth is going to largely be a function of our ability to produce more cars and we're working very hard at that. Sure. I think instead of using the language of sticky, I think I would use the language of it's largely a choice. I think our demand is growing. And at any given level of demand paired with any given level of inventory, you're going to have some turn time that will emerge in that. And then as you grow your inventory from there, you're going to increase conversion, but you're unlikely to increase conversion by as much as you grew inventory, so your turn time may get a little bit longer. And so, I think we can use in a normalized environment where we have as much inventory as we would like, we can use inventory as a lever that we can think of similar to marketing to kind of have some incremental expense that flows through retail GPU that helps us to acquire more customers. And so I think that's a lever that in general we have today, we don't have that lever. It's not really an active lever because we're just trying to produce as many cars as we possibly can to catch back up to the demand levels that we're seeing. But moving forward I think that that is largely a choice and then at kind of equilibrium in the long run, once you've got a fulsome selection of cars which takes many more cars than we have today, there's no real need to continue to build out selection of cars when you have again fulsome selection that's located well across the country to minimize delivery times. And so at that point, I think there would be a kind of meaningful and secular decrease in turn times. But between here and there, it's largely a choice and it's one of the many levers that we have to drive customer demand. Thank you. Thank you, everyone for joining the call. We really appreciate it. To everyone out there on Team Carvana, I hope you're proud of the achievements that we had this quarter. It's pretty remarkable for us to have our first EBITDA positive quarter as a company for us to hit $4000 GPU. But please remember that, as incredible as those achievements are, it's all a function of the things that we do every day and have been doing for the last many, many years. And it's all because of how much you choose to care and how you've made this mission your mission. So thank you so much. I hope you take a moment to enjoy the view and gloat a little bit, but then I hope we get back to it because we still have a lot of work to do. Thank you for all that you do."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was a record quarter for Carvana. We made significant progress on all key financial metrics and reached several exciting financial milestones. We achieved positive EBITDA for the first time in our company's history, a significant step on our path toward achieving our long-term goals.  Retail units sold in Q3 totaled 64,414 an increase of 39%. Total revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 41%. Retail unit growth accelerated from 25% in Q2, but was nonetheless limited by constraints on production capacity which impacted the selection of vehicles available on our website throughout the quarter.  Total gross profit per unit was $4056 in Q3 the highest level in company history and an increase of $1093 year-over-year. Our record GPU this quarter drove our gross margin to 16.9% near the midpoint of our long-term model.  Retail GPU was $1857 in Q3, an increase of $552. Growth in retail GPU was driven by a significant increase in the share of our vehicles sourced from customers. Vehicles sourced from customers reached 56% of retail units sold in Q3 exceeding the high end of our long-term target laid out in November 2018.  Total vehicles acquired from customers grew by 128% in Q3 leading us to buy 114% as many cars from customers as we sold to customers up from 69% a year ago. We believe the high-quality experience we provide to customers creates a sustainable sourcing advantage, which we expect to continue to benefit GPU over time.  In Q4, we expect retail GPU to have a seasonal change that more closely resembles Q4 2018 than Q4 2019. Wholesale GPU was $266, an increase of $146. This was driven by record gross profit per wholesale unit sold of $1113 and record wholesale volumes. Record gross profit for wholesale units sold was primarily driven by strong industry-wide wholesale pricing.  In Q4, we expect the wholesale market to transition to a more normalized depreciation environment accentuating normal seasonal trends in wholesale GPU. At a higher level, we continue to see improvements in our wholesale channel and expect gains over time toward our long-term goals. Other GPU was $1934 in Q3, an increase of $395. The gain in Other GPU was primarily due to a $337 increase in finance GPU to $1415 from $1078 driven by tightened credit standards and lower benchmark interest rates.  EBITDA margin was positive 1.4% reflecting a nearly 7% improvement from a year ago. The significant milestone of positive EBITDA margin was driven by our progress in both GPU and SG&A. SG&A as a percentage of revenue levered by 1.6% in Q3 primarily reflecting benefits of increased volume and cost efficiencies gained during the pandemic partially offset by renewed investments in growth for 2021.  Looking forward, we expect to make seasonal investments in SG&A expenses in Q4 as we have in past years to prepare the business for 2021 leading to a similar seasonal pattern while also continuing to show leverage versus 2019.  In addition to strong GPU and SG&A leverage, EBITDA was positively impacted by a $10.8 million increase in the carrying values of finance receivable related assets on our balance sheet. This increase partially offsets the decrease in carrying values of these assets that impacted EBITDA in Q1.  During the quarter, we opened our ninth inspection and reconditioning center or IRC near Columbus Ohio. And following quarter end, we opened our tenth IRC near Orlando, Florida. We also expect to open our 11th IRC by year-end increasing our total annual production capacity to approximately 600,000 vehicles at full utilization.  IRCs play a key role in our model by allowing us to expand our selection while also speeding delivery times and increasing logistics network efficiency. We remain focused on our plan of building out our network of IRCs and scaling production capacity to meet demand for our offering.  As we continue to focus on building inventory, we have elected not to run our Cyber Monday promotion this year. As a result, we expect retail unit growth to face a headwind around the time of Cyber Monday and a tailwind as we continue building selection on the website.  Following quarter end, we issued $1.1 billion in new senior notes and redeemed $600 million of existing senior notes due 2023. The new notes reduced our annual interest rate by more than three percentage points and extended maturities to 2025 and 2028.  As part of the refinancing, we incurred a onetime debt extinguishment expense of $33.7 million that we expect to be included in interest expense in Q4.  Following the issuance of our senior notes, we had more than $1.8 billion in total liquidity resources on our balance sheet giving us significant flexibility to drive toward our goal of becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. Sure. Yes. So starting with Q3 retail GPU. I mean, I think we sort of looked at in a number of different ways bridging to previous historical period. So I think if you look back in Q3 2019, the biggest driver since then was our progress in buying more cars from customers. I think we saw a significant step-up to our best-ever 56% consumer sourcing rate this quarter which is a meaningful increase from a year ago. And we also saw strong margins on the cars that we source from customers this quarter. I think if you look to Q2 there's a couple of other dynamics that enter into the bridge. I think one averages sale move down meaningfully on the order of 30 days quarter-over-quarter as we started to resume purchasing and we began selling cars in a much more normalized pace following that peak pandemic period. I think bridging to Q1, if you do that I think in Q1 we were roughly $1,700 in retail GPU prior to our end of quarter COVID-related balance sheet adjustment. And so I think you're bridging from Q1 to Q3 sort of a similar story. I think most of the change, primarily driven by more success buying cars from customers. So I think that's sort of \u2013 I think the major drivers as we're looking from Q3 2020 retail GPU back at some previous periods. I think when \u2013 as we look forward to Q4, I think, the way we're currently thinking about is we're expecting seasonality that's more similar to Q4 2018 than Q4 2019 I think \u2013 in Q4 2019, we're still at the sort of early phases of optimizing our buying cars from customers, bidding and pricing. I think that led to some non-normalized dynamics. So when we're thinking about Q4, we're really thinking about seasonality that's more like Q4 2018 than Q4 2019. Sure. I mean I think we're sort of thinking about it in terms of seasonal changes in retail GPU. Sure. So I think on SG&A if we're during into the fourth quarter, I think we're expecting normal seasonal patterns in total SG&A as we start to ramp up for 2021 first half. And normally Q3 and Q4 are investment periods for us where we start the seasonal investment process to prepare for the next year. And so we'd expect that to be the case this year as well on total SG&A while also showing leverage over 2019. So I think that's sort of the leading pattern that I would suggest for Q4. I think in a bigger picture sense I think we're very excited about the leverage that we're now showing year-over-year now that we've moved a couple of steps away from COVID. We certainly expect to show more leverage looking forward into the future. I think one thing that we're very excited about is the patterns that we're seeing in SG&A in our cohorts where older markets tend to have significantly lower advertising expense per unit than newer markets, significantly lower last mile delivery and logistics expense per unit than newer markets, and then much higher market shares, which means lower overhead per unit. And all of that I think all those patterns that we're seeing in the cohorts I think give us a lot of excitement about where we expect SG&A to head over time. Sure. Yeah. And then on advertising expense in older cohorts, so I think we're feeling pretty good about the patterns that we're seeing there. I think we've always seen cohorts that are older and have had more time to accumulate awareness in word of mouth, have meaningfully lower advertising expense per unit or ad ex as a percent of revenue than newer cohorts where we're just getting ramped up in terms of raising awareness of our offering. I think what that means is our older cohorts are significantly closer to our long-term model than the company average as a whole or certainly newer cohorts that are in that early phase. I think in Q3 our older cohorts are probably on the order of maybe 50 basis points or so outside of our long-term target. And so I think obviously we feel pretty good about that just given all the opportunities for continued improvement and continued growth that we have. And as I was mentioning earlier I think we're very encouraged by the trends that we're seeing in cohort unit economics, which give us a lot of conviction about our path to the long-term model and SG&A. First, so I'll take a crack at that. I think the biggest thing that we expect to see is that wholesale GPU per wholesale unit number to return to more normalized levels, which is a sort of accentuated seasonality relative to what we've seen in previous years, because the wholesale market we do think was in an abnormal depreciation environment through most of Q3, and we expect to see return to sort of normal seasonality. So I think \u2013 with that, I think we expect to see a change in wholesale GPU that's going to be driven by that wholesale gross profit per wholesale unit sold number. In retail, I think the way we're thinking about it is sort of within the range of normal seasonality and by normal seasonality what we mean by that is sort of just looking at sequential changes in retail GPU. And we think the normal seasonality is best reflected by 2018, because 2019 had a number of other factors going on with us scaling up buying cars from customers, for example, that we think led it to not have what sort of a normal seasonality in the retail component of GPU would look like. And so I think those are some of the trends. I think there is some seasonal trends that can happen in financial GPU as well, which Ernie pointed to. So I think like at a very high level we think generally speaking we expect to see normal seasonality. We expect to see sort of extends seasonality or accentuated seasonality in wholesale, gross profit per wholesale units sold. And when thinking about what historical seasonality looks like, we think 2018 is probably a better benchmark than 2019 on the retail side just because of the other dynamics that were impacting Q4 2019. That's hopefully a helpful summary. Yes. We're talking -- with that piece of the commentary, we're talking about the retail component of GPU that's correct. And then we gave some separate commentary related to wholesale GPU, which is another separate line item. And then with respect to finance and other GPU, we gave a little bit of commentary as well. That's correct. Sure. So I think the biggest expense is associated with buying cars from customers is an inventory source is exactly what you laid out. It's basically the labor and delivery/pickup costs of going out to a customer's driveway to pick up the car and then bringing it into our logistics network and then transporting it into one of our IRCs. All of those expenses are actually -- those are reflected in our wholesale gross profit number as well as in our retail gross profit number. And when we say that buying cars from customers is more profitable than buying cars from auctions that's -- what we mean by that is it's more profitable net of those expenses of going to get the car from the customer and bring it into the IRCs. So I think that's the most important point is the most significant expenses. There are some other little expenses in call center and the like. But the most significant expenses are in picking up the car from the customer and transporting it to our IRCs which are all reflected in our GPU numbers and are also reflected when we say that those cars are more profitable than the cars sourced from auction."

The first half of 2020 has been an unprecedented and trying time for so many as the world grapples with COVID-19. It has impacted all of our personal lives, impacted the way we interact, the way we live and the way we work. As we've managed through this dynamic period, we've put people first. Our operations and people ops team have done an unbelievable job taking care of our team and of our customers. Thank you to them for everything you've done and everything you continue to do.  In addition to the changes in the ways people interact, live and work, the pandemic has also led to changes in the way people shop. It's created a disruption that has forced people out of their habits, that has caused people to try new things. And new experiences they're having are resulting in change.  Suddenly, buying cars online is becoming normalized. This is a big deal. We came into 2020 the market leader with a bright future. We are the market leader because from the very beginning, our guiding light has been delivering the best customer experiences available anywhere. To do that, we've recruited the best people to take up our mission alongside us. We built a culture of tireless energy and ambition, and we've invested in technology and infrastructure that are necessary to deliver on the constantly changing preferences and expectations of our customers. And we've done it all with the genuine discipline of a long-term focus.  These things are easy to say and hard to do. They are the things that matter in the long run. They are an enduring differentiator and the reason our future was bright before. And now we have added the tailwinds of rapidly changing customer behaviors. Our future is even brighter now.  In the immediate term, we are working to alleviate the operational constraints that have emerged as a result of our choice to defensively position the business at the onset of the pandemic, as well as the complications of ramping up at record speeds at the same time COVID-19 continues to impact many of our markets. The same production team that delivered over 10x increase in production capacity over the last 4 years is up to the task.  Now I'd like to turn to our results in the second quarter. We grew units by 25% in the quarter, including decreases in sales year-over-year in early April and growth of approximately 40% later in the quarter. This growth was achieved despite managing through the most difficult period of the pandemic and facing severe inventory constraints.  In the second quarter, we also saw a rapid rebound in GPU, which demonstrates the resilience in our model across each of our gross profit contributors, as well as the speed of our reaction at the onset of pandemic. Managing through this unique environment has also led to efficiency on the expense side and demonstrated the long-term strength of our cost model.  We continue to see exciting progress across our key metrics heading into the quarter. The most notable is that we hit our long-term milestone of buying 100% as many cars from our customers as we sold to them in July. This is an unbelievable achievement that has come much more quickly than we had anticipated. Congratulations and thank you to the sales at Carvana team, you're doing a truly amazing job.  Moving forward, there's a lot to get excited about. As we always have, we're focused on building enduring value. We are positioning ourselves for the shifts we are seeing in customer preferences, investing in our offering of buying cars from our customers, focusing on simplifying the automotive value chain, building out significant capacity in our supply chain, investing in initiatives that make us even more efficient and scalable, and most importantly, continually improving our customer experiences through better technology, infrastructure and process.  The customer experiences we deliver on our execution are the forces that matter most over time and they have our complete attention. That focus and our long-term lens are what brought us to this point. They put us on the path to selling 2 million-plus units per year and to becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer.  They've made us the fastest-growing retailer in the country. They've driven incredible customer experiences over many years. They've generated a constant unwillingness to be satisfied with our own product that has pushed ceaseless improvement, and the accumulation of all that has made us the market leader.  We are not content with being a market leader. We're on a mission: To change the way people buy cars. Our ambition and excitement is driven by the opportunity we see in front of us. And today, we are more excited and we are more ambitious than we have ever been before. Mark?\nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Q2 was a strong quarter for Carvana. Retail units sold in Q2 totaled 55,098 units, an increase of 25%. The sales growth started to rebound in April and continued to improve to approximately 40% later in the quarter, despite significant inventory constraints brought on by COVID.  Total revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of 13%. Growth in units was higher than growth in revenue, primarily due to lower retail average selling prices driven by vehicle acquisition mix and lower wholesale volume, driven by our pause in purchasing vehicles from customers earlier in the quarter.  Record demand for our offering, combined with production capacity constraints, has led us to sell the available vehicles on our website faster than at any point in our history. This demonstrates our ability to turn cars extremely quickly, a noticeable positive for the long-term model. But we believe our current inventory is meaningfully limiting sales, making growing inventory our top company priority.  Total gross profit per unit was $2,726 in Q2, a decrease of $406 year-over-year and an increase of $86 sequentially. Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our more detailed commentary on sequential changes.  Retail GPU was $1,190, a decrease of $391 sequentially. Early in the pandemic, we made the decision to reduce risk by pausing purchasing and lowering prices to reduce our inventory size. This led to higher average days of sale in the quarter and lower retail GPU due to the lack of new, higher-margin inventory coming to the website. Within the quarter, we observed a V-shaped pattern of retail GPU, with margins reaching their low point in May and seeing a sharp rebound in June as new vehicles were added to the site. We expect retail GPU to climb further in Q3.  Wholesale GPU was $137, an increase of $114 sequentially. This was driven by record gross profit for wholesale units sold of $1,036 or $695, excluding the impact of our wholesale valuation adjustment in Q1. Gross profit for wholesale units sold was primarily driven by strong, industry-wide wholesale pricing in the latter part of the quarter, combined with strong execution by our team.  Other GPU was $1,399, an increase of $363 sequentially. The sequential gain was primarily due to a $337 increase in finance GPU, driven by improved market conditions since the end of Q1 and credit tightening earlier in the pandemic.  EBITDA margin was negative 6.2% in Q2, an improvement from negative 12.6% in Q1. Following the spread of COVID-19, we paused corporate hiring and adjusted our hours in our operating groups to more closely match expenses with current demand as opposed to bearing additional expenses for future demand as we have historically had.  In total, we sold 2,671 more retail units in Q2 than Q1, while reducing SG&A spend by approximately $36 million sequentially. This led to a 3.7% improvement in SG&A as a percent of revenue compared to Q1 2020 and a significant improvement in EBITDA margin. We expect further improvement in EBITDA margin in Q3.  To meet accelerating demand for our online offering, we are actively taking steps to expand our production capacity. Following quarter end, we opened our ninth IRC near Columbus, Ohio, bringing our annual production capacity to nearly 500,000 units at full utilization. In addition, we are on track to open 2 additional IRCs by year-end, adding more than 100,000 additional units of capacity at full utilization, and we have a pipeline of future facilities beyond those.  During the quarter, we completed two equity offerings, bringing our total liquidity resources to over $1.3 billion at quarter end. There were 171.4 million weighted average shares outstanding in Q2 on a fully exchanged basis, and we expect approximately 174.4 million shares on a fully exchanged basis in Q3.  As we look forward, we are focusing on scaling our operations to meet demand on our way toward our long-term goals. Thank you for your attention. We will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Colin Sebastian of Baird.\nColin Sebastian: Great. And I hope everyone there is healthy and well. My question is since you're not yet at full utilization levels within the existing IRCs, I wonder if there are any process improvements or other changes that you can make to improve throughput near term? And then secondly, related to advertising costs. Despite the inventory constraints, you're still spending a fair bit per unit. And I'm wondering if we'll see more efficiency on advertising as we move into the third quarter.\nErnest Garcia: Sure. So on the throughput front, I would say I do think we're finding actually quite a few efficiencies now. We talked about when we came to the pandemic, we reduced hours. And then we ramped those up as we saw volume coming in, we started to get in front of that and tried to produce cars again. I think any time you go through an exercise like that, you undoubtedly just find process improvements. And then I think the tension that we've recently felt where we're clearly inventory-constrained has also forced us to find efficiencies that we maybe weren't looking at hard for in the past, but there's been efficiencies there.  We've also continued to roll out a number of different technology innovations, including an entirely new system that runs our inspection centers that we expect to help us find additional efficiencies from there. So I think across the board, we've always been finding efficiencies in that process and all others. But I think in this stressed time, we've probably been able to find efficiencies even faster.  Right now, what's holding us back is just managing through these coronavirus waves, which have been impacting, especially the Sun Belt, pretty dramatically recently, and that's where we have a lot of our different inspection centers. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we're choosing to put people first, and we're missing on the conservative side there. We're being very careful in contact tracing and sending anyone home who could have been exposed to anyone who comes in with a case and giving them paid time off. And so we're missing conservative there. I think and we think that's the right way to miss.  And so as that starts to calm down, we think that's going to be very helpful. And then we're also working now to hire people as quickly as we can. The facilities have a certain capacity, as we said, the 9 that we have open now have nearly 500,000 units of facility capacity, but we have to staff those up to get access to that capacity. We'll open 2 more by the end of the year. That will add roughly an additional 100,000 units of facility capacity. But again, we have to staff those up, so this unique environment to be hiring as well. And we're working as quickly as we possibly can.  We're also innovating on the hiring front. So I think we've got a lot of things there that we're excited about. This is -- as a public company, this is the first time that we've managed through in inventory and reconditioning supply constraint. But as a private company, it's not. We dealt with similar situations in '15 and '16. And the team that we've got that grew our reproduction capacity by approximately 10x the last 3.5 or 4 years is definitely up to the challenge. And so we think it's going to take a minute to grow through, but we absolutely have all the confidence in the world that we'll get through it.  On the advertising front, I think you bring up an interesting point, and I think there is tension there as well. We are clearly constrained in inventory, and that means that for any given customer that comes to the site, the odds of them seeing the car they're looking for is lower, and therefore, your conversion rates will be lower. And so it makes a little bit less sense to advertise as much. And especially when you have as much excess demand as we do, there's even a very good chance that significantly less advertising would still lead to very similar levels of sales.  I think we're trying to balance that against kind of the long-term value of building brands. And so I think that's an equation that's not a simple one to optimize. We clearly should be dramatically reducing our marketing expense if we're optimizing the line. And it's much less clear what to do if you're optimizing the long term. In the business of buying cars from customers, we have pulled back more on marketing there. We're facing constraints in that business as well. And the reason we pulled back there is because there we have excess demand, it starts to impact customer experience in a way that is more costly. If a customer comes on site and doesn't see the car that they want, that's not a perfect experience, but it's not a bad experience. Whereas if they would like to sell you their car and it takes longer for you to hold the people and longer to get their title cleared, et cetera, that's not a great experience on the FTC side. And so we have elected to pull back a bit there. And we definitely expect to see leverage over time as we continue to grow into this demand and get the benefits of increased inventory that will increase conversion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer.\nBrian Nagel: First question I want to ask, I mean, we talk a lot about the limitations within the business model right now. Is there a way to estimate to what extent that has actually held sales back as the business is -- as the trends have been rebounding here in the last several weeks or so?\nErnest Garcia: So I think there are lots of ways to estimate that. And I think we probably want to stay away from trying to quantify too directly just because the different ways of estimating, I think, can cause you to arrive at fairly different answers. So what I would say is I would point to the graph that we put in our shareholder letter under Objective 1 that shows inventory efficiency. You can kind of think of the shape of that graph is effectively just beating the odds that any given car is sold at any given day. And that's clearly at levels that are much, much higher than we've ever seen before. That gives a sense of kind of the underlying demand that we are not able to access right now.  I think another stat that is probably very useful is at the end of the quarter, near the end of June, we probably had somewhere between 1/4 and 1/5 as many cars that were available for customers that wanted to buy cars as we had prior to the pandemic. I think a lot of times we can -- from a financial perspective, we can look at balance sheet inventory. But what matters to the customer is what are the cars on the site that are not currently in the purchase process with another customer. And the number of cars that we had at the end of the quarter, as I said, was between 1/4 and 1/5. So that's a dramatic reduction in the amount of selection that customers were able to have. And so we feel like there's probably a lot of excess demand sitting in there, and we're working very hard to try to unlock it.\nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. Then my second -- my follow-up unrelated. Just with regard to SG&A, and you have in your letter on Page 9, the table that shows the components of SG&A by month. You can see the SG&A ex advertising G&A from -- in the month of April was $3,760 and then moved down to about $2,600. That was clearly reflects cutting costs as the COVID crisis was hitting. How much -- how should we think about that going forward? You mentioned in the limited guidance you gave that we expect to see a better margin. But how much of that SGA decline is actually going to stick here?\nErnest Garcia: Sure. So I think there's actually something that's really valuable reveal there. And so I think when we use the terminology cutting cost, what's imagined is a reduction in workforce that is probably not sustainable. And so you wouldn't expect that in the future. And I think that we should probably think about that kind of experiment that was running our data there a little bit differently.  So normally, when we're growing as quickly as we have been over the last several years, and you're looking at growth in SG&A from quarter-to-quarter and then you're trying to look at it on a per unit basis to understand what that means, there's a lot going on there, right? Normally, we -- we're growing our fixed functions, so we're growing corporate. We're adding to our development teams. We're adding to our analytics teams. We can keep our analytics teams, our development team the same size and continue to basically invest at the speed we have in the past. But we continue to believe that there is a lot of opportunity. And so we are accelerating those investments, and we are growing those teams. And so when you look at that in the past, you're seeing growth in fixed operations as well in our growth in SG&A.  The other thing you're seeing there is our actual variable costs, right? We have variable costs associated with selling cars, and that flows through to SG&A, obviously, as well.  And then a third element of what drives our SG&A growth over time is, generally speaking, we're carrying more headcount than we need at any point in time to service the demand that we see, because we're preparing for what we anticipate to be growth. And that's been kind of the stance we've been in for the entirety of our company's life.  I think going into the pandemic, we had to make some choices about how do we want to position ourselves. And I think the only thing that you really know going into a pandemic like this is that you don't know what's going to happen. And so you have to decide what kind of errors you want to make and we decided with the long-term lens that the better error for us to make was to miss conservatively. And if things came back, then we would kind of deal with it. But at least we wouldn't put ourselves in a bad spot if they didn't.  And so what we did is we paused corporate hiring. And so what that means when you're looking at SG&A growth going from March to April to May to June, you're no longer seeing the growth in our fixed operations or in development or in analytics that you would normally see flowing through SG&A.  We also reduced hours to match the demand that we were seeing and to have the capacity, the operational capacity to handle the sales that were actually flowing through the system. And then as we ramped up, we increased those hours. So you started to see something that look a lot more like variable costs, and you didn't necessarily see the same overhead that we're carrying for future sales.  And so I think in that moment, we saw something that looked probably not precisely like variable costs, but it looks a lot more like variable costs. And I think the story there is very good. And I think it strongly budgeted our long-term model.  Now going forward, we're going to go back to a growth stance. We're going to be carrying people for growth that we expect in the future. Because if anything, we now expect to be growing even faster than we were expecting in the past. We're going to continue to make investments because we believe that we've got the best customer experience out there, and we believe that experience can be improved upon a lot. So I think we will, in the future, look to continue to make very significant investments to continue to grow into this incredible opportunity, and we'll expect to continue to lever as we have for the last 7 years. But I don't think it's going to be exactly what you saw over the last several months. Mark, do you have anything to add to that?\nMark Jenkins: No, I think it covers it pretty well. I think we're obviously very excited about the leverage that we showed year-over-year in SG&A in light of, I think, a really significant development in the business, which we called out earlier. But we're now at the point in July where we're buying more than 100% as many cars from customers as we're selling to customers, which is a metric and a milestone that we laid out in our long-term model in late '18, and it's almost unbelievable that we've achieved it this quickly. But to show leverage year-over-year, while also building that really substantial and long-term valuable business, I think it's something that we're feeling pretty good about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.\nSharon Zackfia: I guess to dive into the inventory issue a bit more, I'm not really clear if the issue at this point is the speed at which you're turning the cars or if it's just the outsized demand or a combination of the two. And I was hoping you could maybe quantify what throughput is now versus pre-pandemic and whether or not there's any additional levers you could pull via outsourcing. Or how long do you think at this point, it would get -- it would take to get inventory into a situation where you think you're actually able to meet that demand you were talking about?\nErnest Garcia: Sure. So let me, first of all, just isolate where the constraint is. So the constraint is in our ability to take a car that we purchase and certify it and make it retail-ready for a customer and get it up on the website. So it's kind of purchasing, I would not say that word constraint today, especially with all the gains that we've seen in buying cars from customers. We've got ready access to lots of cars there. The constraint is definitely focused on our ability to produce those cars and get them up on the website.  I would point to, in general, a good estimate of how fast we're producing cars is basically the same speed for some cars. So if you're selling 55,000 cars in a quarter, that means that you're probably doing on the order of 4,600 cars a week, give or take. And if inventory is flat, then you're producing kind of that same amount. So if you look back over time, that's where you kind of see all of the growth that we've seen in retail sales has been accompanied by growth in production capacity.  If we look forward at our facility capacity, we have facility capacity of 500,000 units today. So that's on the order of 10,000 units a week. And then by the end of the year, we're going to add capacity for an additional 100,000, so roughly 2,000 per week. So we have a lot of facility capacity, the speed at which we can kind of get into that as a function of how quickly we can hire and train inside of those facilities. And so we're going to work to do that as quickly as we can, but I don't think we're yet prepared to provide specific time lines or goalpost because we're obviously in a unique environment with coronavirus.\nSharon Zackfia: Can I ask a follow-up? Is this manifesting in any way that the consumer sees other than a lack of inventory? So for example, are they seeing extended delivery times? Are there any ramifications for customer satisfaction?\nErnest Garcia: So I would say we also have some constraints in the business in inside advocates' ability to answer calls when customers call in, and then in outside advocates and last mile delivery and, to a lesser extent, in the logistics network. Those constraints are more of the flavor that we've seen different points in the past, and they're not nearly as pronounced today as the production constraint. So those are out there, and those are driving our decision-making as well. But we're alleviating those much more quickly. And those are the type of constraints that I think are much easier to alleviate and not something that we're really concerned about over more than, say, a month or so period of time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rajat Gupta of JPMorgan.\nRajat Gupta: I just wanted to clarify -- one clarification. The end of quarter 40% number, that was a unit growth number, not a revenue number, right? Just to be clear.\nErnest Garcia: Correct.\nRajat Gupta: And then how -- would you be able to quantify what July looked like? And you said it was -- it sustained into the quarter, but just curious if there's a number you could put in July.\nErnest Garcia: So we haven't quantified that. I think what we said, the strength that we saw in demand continued to push into July. We actually continue to see inventory constraints elevate early in the month. And we're working very hard, as we said, to alleviate those. So I think right now, it's pretty clear demand is significantly higher than the sales that we're seeing flow through the system. And we think that in the immediate term, at least, our ability to produce cars is going to directly drive the number of cars that we're able to sell. And it feels like we've got this amount of room there. So we're focused on production right now. If we can get that figured out, we think that demand will continue to grow pretty rapidly.\nRajat Gupta: Got it. And on the 3Q -- on the third quarter GPU, you mentioned that it would increase sequentially and driven by retail GPU. But on the finance side, I mean, it was pretty strong number here in the second quarter despite some uncertainty earlier in the quarter. And it looks like you monetized a significantly lower amount than what you actually originated. And despite that, you had a strong number.  And you noted in the release that the third quarter increase is likely to be driven by retail GPU only. But it looks like you should be able to sustain at least this level of finance GPU into the third quarter as well. So just curious as to what you're seeing there. And how should we think about the finance GPU through the remainder of the year?\nErnest Garcia: Sure. So I think the biggest sort of finance GPU, the really -- hope you'll take away is we think that demonstrated the resiliency in our program. This was obviously an unbelievable event going through the pandemic that rocked capital markets and dramatically impacted things. And we were very pleased with the number that we had in Q1 in light of everything going on. And then we think the rebound that we saw into Q2 is very exciting as well and speaks to the strength of the program and the diversity of our different ways to monetize our receivables.  I think there were probably 2 drivers of the growth from Q1 to Q2. The first is, I think, the speed with which we acted and the credit tightening that we implemented in Q1. When you tighten credit, all else constant, any given receivable is generally more valuable. And so that was one of the drivers of the increase in the value of our loans. And then the second, I think, was just the general macro environment. Capital markets did improve, and so that was helpful as well.  Going forward on the finance line item, I think you can kind of think of -- I think constant improvement would be how we would look at what's going on in the core business. I think we're constantly getting better at underwriting customers and at structuring credit and assessing credit and attracting great customers. So I think there's kind of constant improvement there. And then I think you kind of overlay that with the capital markets. And I think you should expect that to impact us in whatever direction the capital markets move. So if they continue to improve, that would be a positive for us. If they move in the wrong direction, that would likely be a negative. But we expect to march back to the levels that we were at in 2019 and then to continue from there to the long-term model that we outlined in late 2018.\nRajat Gupta: Got it. Sorry, just one follow-up, if I may. Just on the competitive landscape. I mean clearly, like, for the last few years, you were the only major online player out there. But it looks like the pandemic has accelerated plans for a lot of the brick-and-mortar retailers to enter into this space aggressively. Have you seen any impact on your business because of that yet? Or I mean, do you expect to see anything in the near term, particularly with respect to leveraging your advertising expense, longer term? Just curious as to what your thoughts are there, and that will be all.\nErnest Garcia: Sure, of course. So I mean, I would start with this, and I apologize for constantly beating the same drum here, but I do think this is a unique market. And it's unlike many other retail markets where, on the use side, there's 40 million transactions and depending on what numbers you're looking at, there's on the order of 40,000 dealers. This is a tremendously, tremendously fragmented market. And it's a market that historically has had all of those players and has always been very competitive with offerings that are fairly undifferentiated, at least from a macro view.  I think as a result, I think it's very hard for any given competitor to materially impact anyone else. Until market shares get much more concentrated, I think that would be our expectation, that it would -- that would continue to be the case. I can't think of a time in our history when we've looked inside of a market or across time and determined that we think the major driver of some line item that's moving is competition. And I do think that that would be expected just given the structure of the market.  Now I do think as more and more people move online, what we've historically seen is e-commerce is an expensive business to build, and it requires a lot of time and a lot of effort and a lot of tinkering and significant infrastructure and technology. And that kind of investment, it generally is not investment that can be made by lots and lots of players. And so there does tend to be more market concentration over time. I think that would be the first order effect.  I also think these sorts of business models where there are real economies of scale, where as you get bigger, you have more selection for your customers and you have more of a brand, you -- maybe it feeds back into price, it feeds back into faster delivery time. Those sorts of things also drive more concentration.  And so I think we would look at more concentration as the first order impact. And to the extent that happens, I think we're going to be very happy. And then I think the second order impact could potentially be additional competition on things like marketing dollars. But we would expect that to be a follower not a leader, and we've seen no evidence of the contrary so far.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Montani of Evercore.\nMichael Montani: I just wanted to ask about on the retail GPU side, you all had mentioned that you expected to see improvement, I think, quarter-over-quarter there. Is that basically tied to the increased production capacity as you hire individuals back to increase throughput? Or is there more that goes into that with pricing dynamics and acquisition? And then I have a follow-up.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So there are definitely some exciting trends in retail GPU. I think the most exciting is that, as I mentioned earlier, in July, we bought more than 100% as many cars from customers as we sold to customers. We think that that was basically -- I could probably, call it, 10% to 15% in April when we paused purchasing for customers. And it's just been on a basically straight line upward since then.  I think that's obviously a positive, that drives wholesale GPU, that drives incremental retail GPU, because cars that you acquire from customers are typically more profitable than cars that you acquire at auction. We're actually acquiring fewer cars from auction now currently than at any point since early 2018. So I think that generally points to a pretty strong dynamic in retail GPU.  In addition to that, just technically, we do expect average days of sale to come down in Q3 relative to a high in Q2. And that's just basically a technical dynamic with -- when we stopped purchasing cars, that led average day sales to increase in Q2. And now that we're actively purchasing cars, particularly from customers, but in general, we expect it to come down in Q3, which will also be a tailwind.\nMichael Montani: Okay. Then you had mentioned that the anticipation was meaningful EBITDA margin improvement quarter-over-quarter. So just wondering if you could dive into the SG&A side a little bit further there, because it sounds like there could be advertising opportunity, but then perhaps there's the headcount side going the other direction. So I'm just wondering, is there opportunity in the other line item of SG&A? Or where do you really see the benefits there, if there is SG&A opportunities as well?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes. So I think the way we think about SG&A in the remainder of the year -- so we do expect meaningful year-over-year leverage. I think that comes from some of the process efficiencies that we picked up during the COVID period, some of the technology gains that we've made as our teams have focused in on scalability and efficiency.  I think that we also do plan to invest. So we expect meaningful leverage year-over-year while also investing for growth into 2021, which is -- our lens have started to look toward 2021, and also while investing in our technology pipeline, so we expect meaningful leverage year-over-year in SG&A in the back half and then meaningful improvement sequentially in EBITDA margin versus what we saw in Q2.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius of Morgan Stanley.\nArmintas Sinkevicius: I wanted to touch on the inventory briefly. And Ernie, I know you said that there's a variety of different outcomes here. So that's probably where I'm shaking out. But if I look at the 40% growth that you have going on, if we were to assume that that carries through the rest of the quarter, you're looking at something like 65,000 units for the third quarter.  But then if I look at the chart that you have there with regards to inventory efficiency, it looks like it's about 3.5x for the month of June. It's about 11,000, 12,000 units online right now. So if I were to assume that 11,000 to 12,000 at 3.5x, I guess, mean to the low 40,000 range. And so how should we be thinking about the impact of the inventory constraint to your third quarter?\nErnest Garcia: I think I would just go back to what we said previously. I think we're clearly constrained, and that is clearly driving sales volume right now. You can kind of infer what we were selling per week over the last quarter and how that was ramping up. And so we're producing at roughly that rate as inventory has kind of bottomed and just started to tick back up. And so I think it's going to be driven, I think, more than anything, by just our ability to produce cars. And so we really think that's the driver. And I think given the uncertainty with coronavirus and everything else, I think we're not prepared to precisely predict that for you right now.\nArmintas Sinkevicius: Okay. And then just market expansion, you opened up 100 markets last quarter. How are you thinking about market expansion? I know we're still in a bit of an uncertain environment here. But any markets this year? Or would you sort of look to resume next year depending on how the coronavirus is trending?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So yes, I think the -- our approach to market openings, looking forward, will definitely depend on how things are going with a containment of coronavirus. And to a certain extent, our pacing on scaling up inventory. I think we were able to open 100 markets in Q2 fairly quickly with limited investment, limited travel, even really limited incremental hiring, basically because those markets were supported from our existing logistics and last-mile delivery network. And so that was a great thing for the customers in those markets to be able to bring our offering to additional markets in the COVID period, I think it was really valuable. But looking forward, I think it will largely depend on nationwide dynamics with COVID as well as our own inventory.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities.\nRonald Josey: I've got two, please. So Ernie, understood as you ramp up operations, inventory should improve and the growth in trade is clear, and we talked about 100%. But now that you're acquiring fewer cars from auction, really, at any point, I think you said since 2018, can you just talk about the potential of CarvanaACCESS, which launched in the quarter and how you view that?  And then, Mark, we just talked about improving EBITDA margins and improving retail GPU. I wanted to ask maybe some of the drivers in a different way from a product perspective. And we're seeing more delivery fees on the network than ever before. We're seeing more inventory from dealer partners, even older cars. And so wondering how you can -- if you can talk about how these sort of changes to the consumer experience are contributing to overall profitability. And maybe a better way of asking that is how do you balance, call it, these benefits with the investments needed now that the balance sheet is significantly stronger, benefits of greater margins?\nErnest Garcia: Sure. Let me start with CarvanaACCESS. So let me put CarvanaACCESS maybe in the context of buying cars from customers. So as Mark said, we bought as many cars from customers as we sold in July. That's really, really exciting, and that generates a lot of inventory for us.  Now some of those cars are going to fit our retail standards and some are not. For those that fit our retail standards, that's pretty incredible because that's a very significant collapse of the entire automotive value chain, where we are now buying a car from a customer and then producing it and preparing it for the customer and delivering it right to the next customer. There's a lot of friction that has existed in the historical system that is being cut out of that transaction. And that's really, really exciting.  And the retail side feeds back on the purchasing side and vice versa. Because we have such a broad retail network that we can sell across brands and across geographies, we can bid a little more aggressively on cars that we're buying. And then because we're buying cars from customers directly, and we've got that proprietary source of inventory, we've got higher quality inventory with larger margins on the retail side of the business. So that's really, really exciting.  But there's this kind of fork in the inventory that you buy from customers that doesn't fit on the website. And so -- and that's -- they're great cars, they just don't fit our retail standards. And so at CarvanaACCESS, it's a way for us to take those cars and get them to dealers or other partners that buy wholesale inventory and deliver those cars to them in a way that's also very efficient. And that efficiency feeds back in the same ways as the efficiencies of the retail business. So that's what's going on there. We think that's another exciting development and another step toward our long-term goals in both retail and wholesale margin.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. And then on the EBITDA margin improvements. So I called out earlier, we expect meaningful leverage on a per retail unit sold basis in SG&A comparing year-over-year. We also are expecting a step-up in retail GPU and we talked about some of the dynamics there. Some of the smaller items in terms of merchandising or testing that we're doing on the website, I wouldn't see any of those as being particularly a large contributor to the EBITDA margin improvement that we called out. Again, I think that will be mainly focused on growth in GPU, driven by retail. And then EBITDA leverage on a per retail unit sold basis -- or sorry, SG&A leverage on a per retail unit sold basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Jones of Citi.\nNicholas Jones: Just two questions. First, I guess, you're back to being positioned for growth. COVID-19, we kind of see a second wave over the winter or something like that, do you think you need to take this similar actions you took back in April? Or do you have kind of a different liquidity position where you can kind of be a little bit more aggressive, if that were to happen?  And then the second question is just more on consumer behavior. Are you seeing any shift in consumer behavior? Is there some deurbanization or people opting for cars for safety reasons instead of taking public transit? Are they maybe being a little more patient in finding their cars online versus not -- they're not really going to dealerships and dealing with that experience? Do you kind of have more lead time? And are you able to kind of acquire cars more efficiently now than maybe pre-COVID?\nErnest Garcia: Sure. So on the second wave point, I mean, I think I think we'll have to wait and see there. I think what is certain is exactly what you pointed to, we would enter in a very different position than we entered last time just because we've got well over $1 billion of liquidity. And I think we've been kind of hardened and we know what processes we need to roll out to handle these situations. We've dealt with the various state openings and closings, and we know how to manage through all of that.  So I think we would be positioned significantly better for other situation like this. But obviously, the details would matter a lot there. And so I don't think we can give you more than just that we'd be positioned really well. On the consumer behavior side, I think there's so much going on inside of that question. What I would say is I think people are asking questions about are people going to drive more now because they don't want public transportation, they don't want to do ride share as much? The answer to that is probably. Are people going to drive less because there's going to be more work from home? The answer to that is probably. What are some of those things? I don't really feel like we necessarily know. And there's probably 100 other impacts as well.  I think over the last 7 years, we've grown this company by growing market share because we have a dedicated offering that's appealed to customers in a different way from what the traditional offering has been able to offer customers. And I think the biggest and most pronounced change in customer behavior is that if there was this massive disruption that put people in a position where they had to try different things. When they try different things, they like some of those different things that they try, and that's accelerated e-commerce adoption across the board. And so to us, I think that preference shift is the most powerful customer behavior change that we're seeing.  And then in the immediate term, as we're dealing with these waves in these different markets, there's undoubtedly different behaviors that we observe and different preferences that customers have. But I think we're trying to stay most focused on the enduring forces. And we're trying to build to support those enduring forces because these always bring a long-term term to everything that we do. And so that's what's in our focus today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities.\nSeth Basham: My question first is around pricing. Given the tight inventory dynamics, what is your thought around retail pricing? Do you have the ability to move pricing up with the market at least or above market given these constraints?\nErnest Garcia: Sure. So I think pricing is a very interesting area right now. Just across the board, there's been dramatic swings in wholesale and retail prices across the entire industry. Our position has been to maintain significant discounts for our customers and continue with, kind of, the long-term view that we've always brought.  I do think we're in an environment now that is unlike an environment that we've seen at least in a very long time where retail prices are going up. And so that's fairly unique. So we're trying to take that into account and be thoughtful about it. But in terms of our customer-facing stance, we're trying to continue to deliver to customers the significant value that we've delivered to them in the past.\nSeth Basham: Fair enough. And secondly, as it relates to your financing options, what are your thoughts about revisiting the ABS market?\nErnest Garcia: I think our thoughts are the same as they've always been. I mean I think the view that we had prior to the crisis was the ABS markets, in a good environment, always provide the most efficient monetization of the finance receivables. And so we would likely show the highest finance GPU if we hit the ABS markets in good times. But in not as good times, the ABS markets do tend to be disrupted more and kind of close faster. And there's less ready access and access can be expensive. And so doing both purchases with a great partner like Ally, while it's not quite as efficient in good times, it's very reliable.  And I think that that position that we had, that it was important to have access to both channels, I think that was supported by what we saw going through the pandemic. Ally was an unbelievable partner for us, and they were there when we needed them, and we couldn't be more appreciative of that. And I think we'll seek to be a good partner for them as they've been for us going forward. But we also will still access the ABS markets when the timing is right, and we'll just try to find balance between those different considerations.\nSeth Basham: Got it. One last question, if I may, on financing. Last quarter, you wrote down eventual interest and securitizations on the balance sheet. Did you change the valuation of those with this second quarter report?\nMark Jenkins: Yes. We had an adjustment that increased the valuation of those by about $8 million in the second quarter, that will show up in other income and expense.\nSeth Basham: And did you make any changes to the potential bonus payouts that you changed last quarter as well?\nMark Jenkins: I don't believe we made any material changes to those.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel Powell of Goldman Sachs.\nDaniel Powell: Two, if I may. On the first, I just wanted to get a sense if you could sort of tell us quarter-to-date how the inventory is trending, specifically relative to the comment you'd made about sort of being at 1/4 to 1/5 of sort of available for sale units relative to demand earlier in the quarter versus pre-COVID. And then second question is just around advertising, maybe a similar question just asked kind of a different way. As you sort of look at your production capacity, recovering and getting back to a level that you'd like to see, how aggressive or not might you consider being, just given all of the secular tailwinds you're seeing in your market right now?\nErnest Garcia: Sure. So I think first order, we've -- as we've seen additional demand, it has kind of immediately consumed our gains in production so far. And so our inventory has been flattish. It could be, I think, a good starting point. Maybe you've seen a tiny tick up recently, and we hope to be able to get in front of that and continue to grow it. But I think it's also a good story that when we kind of put additional inventory on the site, it pretty instantly gets grabbed by somebody.  So we're going to try to go out as quickly as we can. And I do think that the speed at which our inventory grows can be a function first of production, second of sales. If sales are instantly consuming all the production, then inventory is not going to grow. But if we're able to grow production even faster than sales, then we'll grow it. So I think we're really focused on hoping that we get as much demand as we possibly can to the site and then hoping that we get as much production as we possibly can at the site. And then I think inventory is kind of the output of that equation more so than the input of that equation.  On the advertising side, yes, I would say, I think, there potentially could be some interesting opportunities that could take many forms. I think we've already moved pretty quickly at the onset of the pandemic, within about, I don't know, a matter of weeks, I think 2 weeks. We put out a pandemic-specific commercial that talked about our touchless delivery and kind of spoke to the moment. And I think we're really proud of our marketing team's ability to get that out that quickly.  More recently, we launched another commercial called the Pioneers of Online, that kind of speaks to the fact that we kind of started this trend and that we've been working with this for 7 years, and we've built a lot of infrastructure that makes it very easy for a customer to go on our website, see a great selection and get an incredible experience. And we're trying to make sure that that message is heard.  And so I think that there's opportunities like that from a messaging perspective. From a distribution perspective or an advertising spend perspective, we've also seen cost per impression have definitely gone down more recently. And kind of conversion rates at the top of the marketing funnel, meaning on to website, have likely gone up. And so I think those are exciting developments. But we're in such a unique environment that I don't know that we are smart to extrapolate that out to the future and expect that to stay forever.  I think some of our kind of bigger, longer-term mental models that we've used in the past, where there's 40 million cars, there's 40,000 dealers, they all have the same economics. The way that they spend from a marketing perspective and the way they price cars, it has to support their cost structures that are effectively shared and their profit goals that are effectively shared. And so there is just a lot of ballast in this market that I think should always make us skeptical of short-term swings and whether or not they'll persist. But so far, the swings that we've seen have, if anything, been positive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Potter of Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Potter: I wanted to touch on hiring. You mentioned this, it's kind of interesting. Obviously, if you're ramping up your IRC capacity, you have to put bodies in those facilities. And this is a unique environment to be hiring in, I think, is how you put it. Presumably, it should be easy to find people, given all the talk of unemployment. But I'd be interested in hearing the extent to which staffing is a potential constraint.\nErnest Garcia: So I think there are a lot of people that are unemployed. I think there are also dynamics going on with unemployment payouts and different things that can be an offset to the ease of which you might be able to hire right now. And then I think, obviously, it's a unique environment with people wondering if they want to go into work at all right now when there are coronavirus waves in different parts of the country.  And so I think it's just -- it's a different environment. And I don't think it's an environment that we should expect to persist. But it's a different environment than we face. The way that you go out and reach out to candidates and find people is different. The way those people are feeling and thinking about what they want from their job is different. And so your messaging needs to be different. And so I think it's just a different time. And I think the team is doing an unbelievable job. I think we've made a ton of progress already. So I don't mean to give you all of that as a set of excuses because it's really not. But I do just think it's a unique environment. It's a unique time. It makes it a little harder than it normally would be to forecast exactly how quickly we'll be able to make the progress that we anticipate making.  We are very optimistic, and we are making progress right now, and we have been making progress over the last 1.5 months as we've been really focused on this. But I think it's a little hard for us to be making precise promises in this moment in time.\nAlexander Potter: Sure. Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess maybe a related question. Of the IRCs that you currently have, is it possible to quantify the number of those or maybe a percentage that are being impacted from a workforce standpoint because of COVID outbreaks in those specific areas, maybe the number of people who you would normally have showing up as a percentage of what you could have showing up? Something like that.\nErnest Garcia: I'll give you something a little more general than you're probably looking for. But I would just say, first order, it's just when there's a COVID outbreak in some cities, we are likely going to be impacted by that if we have operations in that city. And so the Sun Belt has recently been impacted. Most recently, maybe the Midwest. We have inspection centers in the Midwest as well. So I think we can be impacted -- we are impacted when that happens in any given market.  I think the great news is, as I said in my prepared remarks, I do think our ops teams and our people ops teams have done a really, really good job with that. We've had next to no transmission at any Carvana locations. But people in these markets do get coronavirus. And then when they come into the facility and we check their temperature, we do contract -- or contact tracing and have to figure all that out. And that does disrupt things a bit and slow things down.  So I don't want to give you a ton more than that, but I would say if there's a market where there's a significant outbreak of coronavirus happening and we have operations there, we're probably dealing with it.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Brad Erickson of Needham & Company.\nBradley Erickson: First, just when you think about the traffic levels on the site lately, what's your sense on some of the demand that's getting turned away, I would imagine, because of the inventory constraints? Are those customers coming back to the site persistently? Or do you think some of those sales are just being lost? What's your sense there? And then I have a follow-up.\nErnest Garcia: I think probably a little bit of both. I mean this is going to be something of a speculative answer, but -- because I think just tracking customers online is an imperfect science, but certainly a little bit of both. When customers come to the site and they don't see the car they're looking for, they likely will keep shopping, and that means checking other places and checking with us. And if they find the car they're looking for somewhere else, I think the odds that they go somewhere else are probably pretty good. And if they don't, the odds that they come back are also probably pretty good. So I don't know that I can give you something more satisfying than that. I think it's probably the best we can do.\nBradley Erickson: Yes. No, that works. And then just related to the underwriting standards. You talked about ratcheting up early on through the pandemic. Is it safe to say you fully relaxed those now back to, say, pre-pandemic levels? Or are they still somewhat elevated there with more to relax? Just any color on the pace of change around the underwriting standards.\nErnest Garcia: Sure. So I don't think we want to quantify that, but we definitely are continuing to maintain significantly tighter credit than we had heading into the pandemic. It is not as tight as it was at the peak. Tightness kind of in, I suppose, early April and maybe through April. But it remains pretty tight. I think we feel like that's the right err to make right now as well. We already have a lot of excess demand on the site, and I think -- we don't know exactly where the economy is going to go over the next 3, 6, 9, 18 months. And so we're going to be a little bit careful there. So I think that is another potential release valve over time for even more demand.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ernie Garcia for any closing remarks.\nErnest Garcia: Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. We really appreciate it. To the entire Carvana team. Thank you, you're doing an absolutely incredible job. A couple specific call out to the STC team, you're on fire, great work, keep lots of ramping. It's an inside joke that they'll understand. So I hope there's a tiered room somewhere.  And then to the inspection center teams, I know you're listening to this call and you probably heard a lot of discussions that stress you out. We know that you're doing an unbelievable job. You're working incredibly hard. And we're making a ton of progress, and you're in this position because of choices we made. So we could not be more appreciative. We thank you for everything you're doing, and please keep it up. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ernest Garcia",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. The first half of 2020 has been an unprecedented and trying time for so many as the world grapples with COVID-19. It has impacted all of our personal lives, impacted the way we interact, the way we live and the way we work. As we've managed through this dynamic period, we've put people first. Our operations and people ops team have done an unbelievable job taking care of our team and of our customers. Thank you to them for everything you've done and everything you continue to do.  In addition to the changes in the ways people interact, live and work, the pandemic has also led to changes in the way people shop. It's created a disruption that has forced people out of their habits, that has caused people to try new things. And new experiences they're having are resulting in change.  Suddenly, buying cars online is becoming normalized. This is a big deal. We came into 2020 the market leader with a bright future. We are the market leader because from the very beginning, our guiding light has been delivering the best customer experiences available anywhere. To do that, we've recruited the best people to take up our mission alongside us. We built a culture of tireless energy and ambition, and we've invested in technology and infrastructure that are necessary to deliver on the constantly changing preferences and expectations of our customers. And we've done it all with the genuine discipline of a long-term focus.  These things are easy to say and hard to do. They are the things that matter in the long run. They are an enduring differentiator and the reason our future was bright before. And now we have added the tailwinds of rapidly changing customer behaviors. Our future is even brighter now.  In the immediate term, we are working to alleviate the operational constraints that have emerged as a result of our choice to defensively position the business at the onset of the pandemic, as well as the complications of ramping up at record speeds at the same time COVID-19 continues to impact many of our markets. The same production team that delivered over 10x increase in production capacity over the last 4 years is up to the task.  Now I'd like to turn to our results in the second quarter. We grew units by 25% in the quarter, including decreases in sales year-over-year in early April and growth of approximately 40% later in the quarter. This growth was achieved despite managing through the most difficult period of the pandemic and facing severe inventory constraints.  In the second quarter, we also saw a rapid rebound in GPU, which demonstrates the resilience in our model across each of our gross profit contributors, as well as the speed of our reaction at the onset of pandemic. Managing through this unique environment has also led to efficiency on the expense side and demonstrated the long-term strength of our cost model.  We continue to see exciting progress across our key metrics heading into the quarter. The most notable is that we hit our long-term milestone of buying 100% as many cars from our customers as we sold to them in July. This is an unbelievable achievement that has come much more quickly than we had anticipated. Congratulations and thank you to the sales at Carvana team, you're doing a truly amazing job.  Moving forward, there's a lot to get excited about. As we always have, we're focused on building enduring value. We are positioning ourselves for the shifts we are seeing in customer preferences, investing in our offering of buying cars from our customers, focusing on simplifying the automotive value chain, building out significant capacity in our supply chain, investing in initiatives that make us even more efficient and scalable, and most importantly, continually improving our customer experiences through better technology, infrastructure and process.  The customer experiences we deliver on our execution are the forces that matter most over time and they have our complete attention. That focus and our long-term lens are what brought us to this point. They put us on the path to selling 2 million-plus units per year and to becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer.  They've made us the fastest-growing retailer in the country. They've driven incredible customer experiences over many years. They've generated a constant unwillingness to be satisfied with our own product that has pushed ceaseless improvement, and the accumulation of all that has made us the market leader.  We are not content with being a market leader. We're on a mission: To change the way people buy cars. Our ambition and excitement is driven by the opportunity we see in front of us. And today, we are more excited and we are more ambitious than we have ever been before. Mark? Sure. So on the throughput front, I would say I do think we're finding actually quite a few efficiencies now. We talked about when we came to the pandemic, we reduced hours. And then we ramped those up as we saw volume coming in, we started to get in front of that and tried to produce cars again. I think any time you go through an exercise like that, you undoubtedly just find process improvements. And then I think the tension that we've recently felt where we're clearly inventory-constrained has also forced us to find efficiencies that we maybe weren't looking at hard for in the past, but there's been efficiencies there.  We've also continued to roll out a number of different technology innovations, including an entirely new system that runs our inspection centers that we expect to help us find additional efficiencies from there. So I think across the board, we've always been finding efficiencies in that process and all others. But I think in this stressed time, we've probably been able to find efficiencies even faster.  Right now, what's holding us back is just managing through these coronavirus waves, which have been impacting, especially the Sun Belt, pretty dramatically recently, and that's where we have a lot of our different inspection centers. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we're choosing to put people first, and we're missing on the conservative side there. We're being very careful in contact tracing and sending anyone home who could have been exposed to anyone who comes in with a case and giving them paid time off. And so we're missing conservative there. I think and we think that's the right way to miss.  And so as that starts to calm down, we think that's going to be very helpful. And then we're also working now to hire people as quickly as we can. The facilities have a certain capacity, as we said, the 9 that we have open now have nearly 500,000 units of facility capacity, but we have to staff those up to get access to that capacity. We'll open 2 more by the end of the year. That will add roughly an additional 100,000 units of facility capacity. But again, we have to staff those up, so this unique environment to be hiring as well. And we're working as quickly as we possibly can.  We're also innovating on the hiring front. So I think we've got a lot of things there that we're excited about. This is -- as a public company, this is the first time that we've managed through in inventory and reconditioning supply constraint. But as a private company, it's not. We dealt with similar situations in '15 and '16. And the team that we've got that grew our reproduction capacity by approximately 10x the last 3.5 or 4 years is definitely up to the challenge. And so we think it's going to take a minute to grow through, but we absolutely have all the confidence in the world that we'll get through it.  On the advertising front, I think you bring up an interesting point, and I think there is tension there as well. We are clearly constrained in inventory, and that means that for any given customer that comes to the site, the odds of them seeing the car they're looking for is lower, and therefore, your conversion rates will be lower. And so it makes a little bit less sense to advertise as much. And especially when you have as much excess demand as we do, there's even a very good chance that significantly less advertising would still lead to very similar levels of sales.  I think we're trying to balance that against kind of the long-term value of building brands. And so I think that's an equation that's not a simple one to optimize. We clearly should be dramatically reducing our marketing expense if we're optimizing the line. And it's much less clear what to do if you're optimizing the long term. In the business of buying cars from customers, we have pulled back more on marketing there. We're facing constraints in that business as well. And the reason we pulled back there is because there we have excess demand, it starts to impact customer experience in a way that is more costly. If a customer comes on site and doesn't see the car that they want, that's not a perfect experience, but it's not a bad experience. Whereas if they would like to sell you their car and it takes longer for you to hold the people and longer to get their title cleared, et cetera, that's not a great experience on the FTC side. And so we have elected to pull back a bit there. And we definitely expect to see leverage over time as we continue to grow into this demand and get the benefits of increased inventory that will increase conversion. So I think there are lots of ways to estimate that. And I think we probably want to stay away from trying to quantify too directly just because the different ways of estimating, I think, can cause you to arrive at fairly different answers. So what I would say is I would point to the graph that we put in our shareholder letter under Objective 1 that shows inventory efficiency. You can kind of think of the shape of that graph is effectively just beating the odds that any given car is sold at any given day. And that's clearly at levels that are much, much higher than we've ever seen before. That gives a sense of kind of the underlying demand that we are not able to access right now.  I think another stat that is probably very useful is at the end of the quarter, near the end of June, we probably had somewhere between 1/4 and 1/5 as many cars that were available for customers that wanted to buy cars as we had prior to the pandemic. I think a lot of times we can -- from a financial perspective, we can look at balance sheet inventory. But what matters to the customer is what are the cars on the site that are not currently in the purchase process with another customer. And the number of cars that we had at the end of the quarter, as I said, was between 1/4 and 1/5. So that's a dramatic reduction in the amount of selection that customers were able to have. And so we feel like there's probably a lot of excess demand sitting in there, and we're working very hard to try to unlock it. Sure. So I think there's actually something that's really valuable reveal there. And so I think when we use the terminology cutting cost, what's imagined is a reduction in workforce that is probably not sustainable. And so you wouldn't expect that in the future. And I think that we should probably think about that kind of experiment that was running our data there a little bit differently.  So normally, when we're growing as quickly as we have been over the last several years, and you're looking at growth in SG&A from quarter-to-quarter and then you're trying to look at it on a per unit basis to understand what that means, there's a lot going on there, right? Normally, we -- we're growing our fixed functions, so we're growing corporate. We're adding to our development teams. We're adding to our analytics teams. We can keep our analytics teams, our development team the same size and continue to basically invest at the speed we have in the past. But we continue to believe that there is a lot of opportunity. And so we are accelerating those investments, and we are growing those teams. And so when you look at that in the past, you're seeing growth in fixed operations as well in our growth in SG&A.  The other thing you're seeing there is our actual variable costs, right? We have variable costs associated with selling cars, and that flows through to SG&A, obviously, as well.  And then a third element of what drives our SG&A growth over time is, generally speaking, we're carrying more headcount than we need at any point in time to service the demand that we see, because we're preparing for what we anticipate to be growth. And that's been kind of the stance we've been in for the entirety of our company's life.  I think going into the pandemic, we had to make some choices about how do we want to position ourselves. And I think the only thing that you really know going into a pandemic like this is that you don't know what's going to happen. And so you have to decide what kind of errors you want to make and we decided with the long-term lens that the better error for us to make was to miss conservatively. And if things came back, then we would kind of deal with it. But at least we wouldn't put ourselves in a bad spot if they didn't.  And so what we did is we paused corporate hiring. And so what that means when you're looking at SG&A growth going from March to April to May to June, you're no longer seeing the growth in our fixed operations or in development or in analytics that you would normally see flowing through SG&A.  We also reduced hours to match the demand that we were seeing and to have the capacity, the operational capacity to handle the sales that were actually flowing through the system. And then as we ramped up, we increased those hours. So you started to see something that look a lot more like variable costs, and you didn't necessarily see the same overhead that we're carrying for future sales.  And so I think in that moment, we saw something that looked probably not precisely like variable costs, but it looks a lot more like variable costs. And I think the story there is very good. And I think it strongly budgeted our long-term model.  Now going forward, we're going to go back to a growth stance. We're going to be carrying people for growth that we expect in the future. Because if anything, we now expect to be growing even faster than we were expecting in the past. We're going to continue to make investments because we believe that we've got the best customer experience out there, and we believe that experience can be improved upon a lot. So I think we will, in the future, look to continue to make very significant investments to continue to grow into this incredible opportunity, and we'll expect to continue to lever as we have for the last 7 years. But I don't think it's going to be exactly what you saw over the last several months. Mark, do you have anything to add to that? Sure. So let me, first of all, just isolate where the constraint is. So the constraint is in our ability to take a car that we purchase and certify it and make it retail-ready for a customer and get it up on the website. So it's kind of purchasing, I would not say that word constraint today, especially with all the gains that we've seen in buying cars from customers. We've got ready access to lots of cars there. The constraint is definitely focused on our ability to produce those cars and get them up on the website.  I would point to, in general, a good estimate of how fast we're producing cars is basically the same speed for some cars. So if you're selling 55,000 cars in a quarter, that means that you're probably doing on the order of 4,600 cars a week, give or take. And if inventory is flat, then you're producing kind of that same amount. So if you look back over time, that's where you kind of see all of the growth that we've seen in retail sales has been accompanied by growth in production capacity.  If we look forward at our facility capacity, we have facility capacity of 500,000 units today. So that's on the order of 10,000 units a week. And then by the end of the year, we're going to add capacity for an additional 100,000, so roughly 2,000 per week. So we have a lot of facility capacity, the speed at which we can kind of get into that as a function of how quickly we can hire and train inside of those facilities. And so we're going to work to do that as quickly as we can, but I don't think we're yet prepared to provide specific time lines or goalpost because we're obviously in a unique environment with coronavirus. So I would say we also have some constraints in the business in inside advocates' ability to answer calls when customers call in, and then in outside advocates and last mile delivery and, to a lesser extent, in the logistics network. Those constraints are more of the flavor that we've seen different points in the past, and they're not nearly as pronounced today as the production constraint. So those are out there, and those are driving our decision-making as well. But we're alleviating those much more quickly. And those are the type of constraints that I think are much easier to alleviate and not something that we're really concerned about over more than, say, a month or so period of time. Correct. So we haven't quantified that. I think what we said, the strength that we saw in demand continued to push into July. We actually continue to see inventory constraints elevate early in the month. And we're working very hard, as we said, to alleviate those. So I think right now, it's pretty clear demand is significantly higher than the sales that we're seeing flow through the system. And we think that in the immediate term, at least, our ability to produce cars is going to directly drive the number of cars that we're able to sell. And it feels like we've got this amount of room there. So we're focused on production right now. If we can get that figured out, we think that demand will continue to grow pretty rapidly. Sure. So I think the biggest sort of finance GPU, the really -- hope you'll take away is we think that demonstrated the resiliency in our program. This was obviously an unbelievable event going through the pandemic that rocked capital markets and dramatically impacted things. And we were very pleased with the number that we had in Q1 in light of everything going on. And then we think the rebound that we saw into Q2 is very exciting as well and speaks to the strength of the program and the diversity of our different ways to monetize our receivables.  I think there were probably 2 drivers of the growth from Q1 to Q2. The first is, I think, the speed with which we acted and the credit tightening that we implemented in Q1. When you tighten credit, all else constant, any given receivable is generally more valuable. And so that was one of the drivers of the increase in the value of our loans. And then the second, I think, was just the general macro environment. Capital markets did improve, and so that was helpful as well.  Going forward on the finance line item, I think you can kind of think of -- I think constant improvement would be how we would look at what's going on in the core business. I think we're constantly getting better at underwriting customers and at structuring credit and assessing credit and attracting great customers. So I think there's kind of constant improvement there. And then I think you kind of overlay that with the capital markets. And I think you should expect that to impact us in whatever direction the capital markets move. So if they continue to improve, that would be a positive for us. If they move in the wrong direction, that would likely be a negative. But we expect to march back to the levels that we were at in 2019 and then to continue from there to the long-term model that we outlined in late 2018. Sure, of course. So I mean, I would start with this, and I apologize for constantly beating the same drum here, but I do think this is a unique market. And it's unlike many other retail markets where, on the use side, there's 40 million transactions and depending on what numbers you're looking at, there's on the order of 40,000 dealers. This is a tremendously, tremendously fragmented market. And it's a market that historically has had all of those players and has always been very competitive with offerings that are fairly undifferentiated, at least from a macro view.  I think as a result, I think it's very hard for any given competitor to materially impact anyone else. Until market shares get much more concentrated, I think that would be our expectation, that it would -- that would continue to be the case. I can't think of a time in our history when we've looked inside of a market or across time and determined that we think the major driver of some line item that's moving is competition. And I do think that that would be expected just given the structure of the market.  Now I do think as more and more people move online, what we've historically seen is e-commerce is an expensive business to build, and it requires a lot of time and a lot of effort and a lot of tinkering and significant infrastructure and technology. And that kind of investment, it generally is not investment that can be made by lots and lots of players. And so there does tend to be more market concentration over time. I think that would be the first order effect.  I also think these sorts of business models where there are real economies of scale, where as you get bigger, you have more selection for your customers and you have more of a brand, you -- maybe it feeds back into price, it feeds back into faster delivery time. Those sorts of things also drive more concentration.  And so I think we would look at more concentration as the first order impact. And to the extent that happens, I think we're going to be very happy. And then I think the second order impact could potentially be additional competition on things like marketing dollars. But we would expect that to be a follower not a leader, and we've seen no evidence of the contrary so far. I think I would just go back to what we said previously. I think we're clearly constrained, and that is clearly driving sales volume right now. You can kind of infer what we were selling per week over the last quarter and how that was ramping up. And so we're producing at roughly that rate as inventory has kind of bottomed and just started to tick back up. And so I think it's going to be driven, I think, more than anything, by just our ability to produce cars. And so we really think that's the driver. And I think given the uncertainty with coronavirus and everything else, I think we're not prepared to precisely predict that for you right now. Sure. Let me start with CarvanaACCESS. So let me put CarvanaACCESS maybe in the context of buying cars from customers. So as Mark said, we bought as many cars from customers as we sold in July. That's really, really exciting, and that generates a lot of inventory for us.  Now some of those cars are going to fit our retail standards and some are not. For those that fit our retail standards, that's pretty incredible because that's a very significant collapse of the entire automotive value chain, where we are now buying a car from a customer and then producing it and preparing it for the customer and delivering it right to the next customer. There's a lot of friction that has existed in the historical system that is being cut out of that transaction. And that's really, really exciting.  And the retail side feeds back on the purchasing side and vice versa. Because we have such a broad retail network that we can sell across brands and across geographies, we can bid a little more aggressively on cars that we're buying. And then because we're buying cars from customers directly, and we've got that proprietary source of inventory, we've got higher quality inventory with larger margins on the retail side of the business. So that's really, really exciting.  But there's this kind of fork in the inventory that you buy from customers that doesn't fit on the website. And so -- and that's -- they're great cars, they just don't fit our retail standards. And so at CarvanaACCESS, it's a way for us to take those cars and get them to dealers or other partners that buy wholesale inventory and deliver those cars to them in a way that's also very efficient. And that efficiency feeds back in the same ways as the efficiencies of the retail business. So that's what's going on there. We think that's another exciting development and another step toward our long-term goals in both retail and wholesale margin. Sure. So on the second wave point, I mean, I think I think we'll have to wait and see there. I think what is certain is exactly what you pointed to, we would enter in a very different position than we entered last time just because we've got well over $1 billion of liquidity. And I think we've been kind of hardened and we know what processes we need to roll out to handle these situations. We've dealt with the various state openings and closings, and we know how to manage through all of that.  So I think we would be positioned significantly better for other situation like this. But obviously, the details would matter a lot there. And so I don't think we can give you more than just that we'd be positioned really well. On the consumer behavior side, I think there's so much going on inside of that question. What I would say is I think people are asking questions about are people going to drive more now because they don't want public transportation, they don't want to do ride share as much? The answer to that is probably. Are people going to drive less because there's going to be more work from home? The answer to that is probably. What are some of those things? I don't really feel like we necessarily know. And there's probably 100 other impacts as well.  I think over the last 7 years, we've grown this company by growing market share because we have a dedicated offering that's appealed to customers in a different way from what the traditional offering has been able to offer customers. And I think the biggest and most pronounced change in customer behavior is that if there was this massive disruption that put people in a position where they had to try different things. When they try different things, they like some of those different things that they try, and that's accelerated e-commerce adoption across the board. And so to us, I think that preference shift is the most powerful customer behavior change that we're seeing.  And then in the immediate term, as we're dealing with these waves in these different markets, there's undoubtedly different behaviors that we observe and different preferences that customers have. But I think we're trying to stay most focused on the enduring forces. And we're trying to build to support those enduring forces because these always bring a long-term term to everything that we do. And so that's what's in our focus today. Sure. So I think pricing is a very interesting area right now. Just across the board, there's been dramatic swings in wholesale and retail prices across the entire industry. Our position has been to maintain significant discounts for our customers and continue with, kind of, the long-term view that we've always brought.  I do think we're in an environment now that is unlike an environment that we've seen at least in a very long time where retail prices are going up. And so that's fairly unique. So we're trying to take that into account and be thoughtful about it. But in terms of our customer-facing stance, we're trying to continue to deliver to customers the significant value that we've delivered to them in the past. I think our thoughts are the same as they've always been. I mean I think the view that we had prior to the crisis was the ABS markets, in a good environment, always provide the most efficient monetization of the finance receivables. And so we would likely show the highest finance GPU if we hit the ABS markets in good times. But in not as good times, the ABS markets do tend to be disrupted more and kind of close faster. And there's less ready access and access can be expensive. And so doing both purchases with a great partner like Ally, while it's not quite as efficient in good times, it's very reliable.  And I think that that position that we had, that it was important to have access to both channels, I think that was supported by what we saw going through the pandemic. Ally was an unbelievable partner for us, and they were there when we needed them, and we couldn't be more appreciative of that. And I think we'll seek to be a good partner for them as they've been for us going forward. But we also will still access the ABS markets when the timing is right, and we'll just try to find balance between those different considerations. Sure. So I think first order, we've -- as we've seen additional demand, it has kind of immediately consumed our gains in production so far. And so our inventory has been flattish. It could be, I think, a good starting point. Maybe you've seen a tiny tick up recently, and we hope to be able to get in front of that and continue to grow it. But I think it's also a good story that when we kind of put additional inventory on the site, it pretty instantly gets grabbed by somebody.  So we're going to try to go out as quickly as we can. And I do think that the speed at which our inventory grows can be a function first of production, second of sales. If sales are instantly consuming all the production, then inventory is not going to grow. But if we're able to grow production even faster than sales, then we'll grow it. So I think we're really focused on hoping that we get as much demand as we possibly can to the site and then hoping that we get as much production as we possibly can at the site. And then I think inventory is kind of the output of that equation more so than the input of that equation.  On the advertising side, yes, I would say, I think, there potentially could be some interesting opportunities that could take many forms. I think we've already moved pretty quickly at the onset of the pandemic, within about, I don't know, a matter of weeks, I think 2 weeks. We put out a pandemic-specific commercial that talked about our touchless delivery and kind of spoke to the moment. And I think we're really proud of our marketing team's ability to get that out that quickly.  More recently, we launched another commercial called the Pioneers of Online, that kind of speaks to the fact that we kind of started this trend and that we've been working with this for 7 years, and we've built a lot of infrastructure that makes it very easy for a customer to go on our website, see a great selection and get an incredible experience. And we're trying to make sure that that message is heard.  And so I think that there's opportunities like that from a messaging perspective. From a distribution perspective or an advertising spend perspective, we've also seen cost per impression have definitely gone down more recently. And kind of conversion rates at the top of the marketing funnel, meaning on to website, have likely gone up. And so I think those are exciting developments. But we're in such a unique environment that I don't know that we are smart to extrapolate that out to the future and expect that to stay forever.  I think some of our kind of bigger, longer-term mental models that we've used in the past, where there's 40 million cars, there's 40,000 dealers, they all have the same economics. The way that they spend from a marketing perspective and the way they price cars, it has to support their cost structures that are effectively shared and their profit goals that are effectively shared. And so there is just a lot of ballast in this market that I think should always make us skeptical of short-term swings and whether or not they'll persist. But so far, the swings that we've seen have, if anything, been positive. So I think there are a lot of people that are unemployed. I think there are also dynamics going on with unemployment payouts and different things that can be an offset to the ease of which you might be able to hire right now. And then I think, obviously, it's a unique environment with people wondering if they want to go into work at all right now when there are coronavirus waves in different parts of the country.  And so I think it's just -- it's a different environment. And I don't think it's an environment that we should expect to persist. But it's a different environment than we face. The way that you go out and reach out to candidates and find people is different. The way those people are feeling and thinking about what they want from their job is different. And so your messaging needs to be different. And so I think it's just a different time. And I think the team is doing an unbelievable job. I think we've made a ton of progress already. So I don't mean to give you all of that as a set of excuses because it's really not. But I do just think it's a unique environment. It's a unique time. It makes it a little harder than it normally would be to forecast exactly how quickly we'll be able to make the progress that we anticipate making.  We are very optimistic, and we are making progress right now, and we have been making progress over the last 1.5 months as we've been really focused on this. But I think it's a little hard for us to be making precise promises in this moment in time. I'll give you something a little more general than you're probably looking for. But I would just say, first order, it's just when there's a COVID outbreak in some cities, we are likely going to be impacted by that if we have operations in that city. And so the Sun Belt has recently been impacted. Most recently, maybe the Midwest. We have inspection centers in the Midwest as well. So I think we can be impacted -- we are impacted when that happens in any given market.  I think the great news is, as I said in my prepared remarks, I do think our ops teams and our people ops teams have done a really, really good job with that. We've had next to no transmission at any Carvana locations. But people in these markets do get coronavirus. And then when they come into the facility and we check their temperature, we do contract -- or contact tracing and have to figure all that out. And that does disrupt things a bit and slow things down.  So I don't want to give you a ton more than that, but I would say if there's a market where there's a significant outbreak of coronavirus happening and we have operations there, we're probably dealing with it. I think probably a little bit of both. I mean this is going to be something of a speculative answer, but -- because I think just tracking customers online is an imperfect science, but certainly a little bit of both. When customers come to the site and they don't see the car they're looking for, they likely will keep shopping, and that means checking other places and checking with us. And if they find the car they're looking for somewhere else, I think the odds that they go somewhere else are probably pretty good. And if they don't, the odds that they come back are also probably pretty good. So I don't know that I can give you something more satisfying than that. I think it's probably the best we can do. Sure. So I don't think we want to quantify that, but we definitely are continuing to maintain significantly tighter credit than we had heading into the pandemic. It is not as tight as it was at the peak. Tightness kind of in, I suppose, early April and maybe through April. But it remains pretty tight. I think we feel like that's the right err to make right now as well. We already have a lot of excess demand on the site, and I think -- we don't know exactly where the economy is going to go over the next 3, 6, 9, 18 months. And so we're going to be a little bit careful there. So I think that is another potential release valve over time for even more demand. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. We really appreciate it. To the entire Carvana team. Thank you, you're doing an absolutely incredible job. A couple specific call out to the STC team, you're on fire, great work, keep lots of ramping. It's an inside joke that they'll understand. So I hope there's a tiered room somewhere.  And then to the inspection center teams, I know you're listening to this call and you probably heard a lot of discussions that stress you out. We know that you're doing an unbelievable job. You're working incredibly hard. And we're making a ton of progress, and you're in this position because of choices we made. So we could not be more appreciative. We thank you for everything you're doing, and please keep it up. Thanks, everyone."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Q2 was a strong quarter for Carvana. Retail units sold in Q2 totaled 55,098 units, an increase of 25%. The sales growth started to rebound in April and continued to improve to approximately 40% later in the quarter, despite significant inventory constraints brought on by COVID.  Total revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of 13%. Growth in units was higher than growth in revenue, primarily due to lower retail average selling prices driven by vehicle acquisition mix and lower wholesale volume, driven by our pause in purchasing vehicles from customers earlier in the quarter.  Record demand for our offering, combined with production capacity constraints, has led us to sell the available vehicles on our website faster than at any point in our history. This demonstrates our ability to turn cars extremely quickly, a noticeable positive for the long-term model. But we believe our current inventory is meaningfully limiting sales, making growing inventory our top company priority.  Total gross profit per unit was $2,726 in Q2, a decrease of $406 year-over-year and an increase of $86 sequentially. Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our more detailed commentary on sequential changes.  Retail GPU was $1,190, a decrease of $391 sequentially. Early in the pandemic, we made the decision to reduce risk by pausing purchasing and lowering prices to reduce our inventory size. This led to higher average days of sale in the quarter and lower retail GPU due to the lack of new, higher-margin inventory coming to the website. Within the quarter, we observed a V-shaped pattern of retail GPU, with margins reaching their low point in May and seeing a sharp rebound in June as new vehicles were added to the site. We expect retail GPU to climb further in Q3.  Wholesale GPU was $137, an increase of $114 sequentially. This was driven by record gross profit for wholesale units sold of $1,036 or $695, excluding the impact of our wholesale valuation adjustment in Q1. Gross profit for wholesale units sold was primarily driven by strong, industry-wide wholesale pricing in the latter part of the quarter, combined with strong execution by our team.  Other GPU was $1,399, an increase of $363 sequentially. The sequential gain was primarily due to a $337 increase in finance GPU, driven by improved market conditions since the end of Q1 and credit tightening earlier in the pandemic.  EBITDA margin was negative 6.2% in Q2, an improvement from negative 12.6% in Q1. Following the spread of COVID-19, we paused corporate hiring and adjusted our hours in our operating groups to more closely match expenses with current demand as opposed to bearing additional expenses for future demand as we have historically had.  In total, we sold 2,671 more retail units in Q2 than Q1, while reducing SG&A spend by approximately $36 million sequentially. This led to a 3.7% improvement in SG&A as a percent of revenue compared to Q1 2020 and a significant improvement in EBITDA margin. We expect further improvement in EBITDA margin in Q3.  To meet accelerating demand for our online offering, we are actively taking steps to expand our production capacity. Following quarter end, we opened our ninth IRC near Columbus, Ohio, bringing our annual production capacity to nearly 500,000 units at full utilization. In addition, we are on track to open 2 additional IRCs by year-end, adding more than 100,000 additional units of capacity at full utilization, and we have a pipeline of future facilities beyond those.  During the quarter, we completed two equity offerings, bringing our total liquidity resources to over $1.3 billion at quarter end. There were 171.4 million weighted average shares outstanding in Q2 on a fully exchanged basis, and we expect approximately 174.4 million shares on a fully exchanged basis in Q3.  As we look forward, we are focusing on scaling our operations to meet demand on our way toward our long-term goals. Thank you for your attention. We will now take questions. No, I think it covers it pretty well. I think we're obviously very excited about the leverage that we showed year-over-year in SG&A in light of, I think, a really significant development in the business, which we called out earlier. But we're now at the point in July where we're buying more than 100% as many cars from customers as we're selling to customers, which is a metric and a milestone that we laid out in our long-term model in late '18, and it's almost unbelievable that we've achieved it this quickly. But to show leverage year-over-year, while also building that really substantial and long-term valuable business, I think it's something that we're feeling pretty good about. Sure. So there are definitely some exciting trends in retail GPU. I think the most exciting is that, as I mentioned earlier, in July, we bought more than 100% as many cars from customers as we sold to customers. We think that that was basically -- I could probably, call it, 10% to 15% in April when we paused purchasing for customers. And it's just been on a basically straight line upward since then.  I think that's obviously a positive, that drives wholesale GPU, that drives incremental retail GPU, because cars that you acquire from customers are typically more profitable than cars that you acquire at auction. We're actually acquiring fewer cars from auction now currently than at any point since early 2018. So I think that generally points to a pretty strong dynamic in retail GPU.  In addition to that, just technically, we do expect average days of sale to come down in Q3 relative to a high in Q2. And that's just basically a technical dynamic with -- when we stopped purchasing cars, that led average day sales to increase in Q2. And now that we're actively purchasing cars, particularly from customers, but in general, we expect it to come down in Q3, which will also be a tailwind. Sure. Yes. So I think the way we think about SG&A in the remainder of the year -- so we do expect meaningful year-over-year leverage. I think that comes from some of the process efficiencies that we picked up during the COVID period, some of the technology gains that we've made as our teams have focused in on scalability and efficiency.  I think that we also do plan to invest. So we expect meaningful leverage year-over-year while also investing for growth into 2021, which is -- our lens have started to look toward 2021, and also while investing in our technology pipeline, so we expect meaningful leverage year-over-year in SG&A in the back half and then meaningful improvement sequentially in EBITDA margin versus what we saw in Q2. Sure. So yes, I think the -- our approach to market openings, looking forward, will definitely depend on how things are going with a containment of coronavirus. And to a certain extent, our pacing on scaling up inventory. I think we were able to open 100 markets in Q2 fairly quickly with limited investment, limited travel, even really limited incremental hiring, basically because those markets were supported from our existing logistics and last-mile delivery network. And so that was a great thing for the customers in those markets to be able to bring our offering to additional markets in the COVID period, I think it was really valuable. But looking forward, I think it will largely depend on nationwide dynamics with COVID as well as our own inventory. Sure. And then on the EBITDA margin improvements. So I called out earlier, we expect meaningful leverage on a per retail unit sold basis in SG&A comparing year-over-year. We also are expecting a step-up in retail GPU and we talked about some of the dynamics there. Some of the smaller items in terms of merchandising or testing that we're doing on the website, I wouldn't see any of those as being particularly a large contributor to the EBITDA margin improvement that we called out. Again, I think that will be mainly focused on growth in GPU, driven by retail. And then EBITDA leverage on a per retail unit sold basis -- or sorry, SG&A leverage on a per retail unit sold basis. Yes. We had an adjustment that increased the valuation of those by about $8 million in the second quarter, that will show up in other income and expense. I don't believe we made any material changes to those."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Levin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.\nMike Levin: Thank you, Eric. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on Carvana's first quarter earnings conference call. Please note that this call will simultaneously be webcast on the Investor Relations section of the company's corporate website at investors.carvana.com. The first quarter shareholder letter is also posted on the IR website. Joining me on the call today are Ernie Garcia, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Jenkins, Chief Financial Officer. Before we start, I would like to remind you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, Carvana's market opportunities and future financial results that involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed here. A detailed discussion of the material factors that cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements can be found in the Risk Factors section of Carvana's most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements and risks in this conference call are based on current expectations as of today, and Carvana assumes no obligation to update or revise them, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Unless otherwise noted on today's call, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis. Our commentary today will include non-GAAP financial measures. Historically, we\u2019ve used the non-GAAP measure ex-Gift, which excludes the impact of the 100,000 milestone gift to our employees, but beginning this quarter that program has concluded and is no longer material to our results. And so any metrics for this quarter referenced on the call today will be inclusive of the 100,000 milestone gift. You can find the 100,000 milestone gift impacts called out in our reported financials. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our shareholder letter issued today, a copy of which can be found on our Investor Relations website. And now with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thank you, Mike, and thanks everyone for joining the call. This has been a quarter unlike any we face as a company. The onset of the pandemic has led to unprecedented changes in our health and behavior, which in turn has significant and currently unquantifiable impact in the economy. Accordingly, we will spend less time than we normally would discussing the specifics of the quarter. I will briefly hit on where we sit today and then spend more time discussing the ways we've reacted so far and the ways we are thinking about and planning for the future. We began to see significant reductions in demand in the back half of March with a sales trough in early April at approximately 30% reduction in sales year-over-year. From there, we have consistently improved week-after-week with sales in the most recent weeks being up about 20% to 30% year-over-year. It is difficult to get clear visibility into exactly how the industry performed over the last several weeks, but every indication that Carvana has outperformed the industry quite significantly and grown our market share accordingly over this period. You believe part of this outperformance has been driven by transitory factors and that part of it has been driven by customer preference changes due to the pandemic. We don't yet know how precise these customer preference changes will be, but we are optimistic. Due through medium-term lens, we believe customer behavior shifts are likely to accelerate our progress. Now, let's turn to how we've reacted so far. In early March, it became clear that we were dealing with a very significant event. At that time, we determined that we were fighting a battle with two fronts: health and financial health. Our first priority is the health front, keeping our team and our customers safe. Along those lines, we have enacted work from home for corporate and customer care teams, have reconfigured our inspection centers and field locations to support social distancing, adopted CDC guidance and implemented a touchless delivery experience for our customers. The second front is the financial health front. Here we've had three primary goals to align expenses with this new environment, to manage our risks and uncertainties thoughtfully and to ensure we preserve and continue to progress in those areas that are most important to our long-term success. We came into the pandemic expecting our biggest absolute unit growth year yet and with the business positioned to deliver on those goals. Demand shock we started to see in mid-March has obviously necessitated some significant and difficult changes. In order to align expenses with the new environment, we eliminated overtime and travel budgets, reduced hours and pause hiring. Another important component of our strategy for managing through this has been to carefully manage our risks and uncertainties. We view the most important areas of uncertainty during this period to be industry demand levels, the credit and capital market environment and inventory values. In an effort to manage demand uncertainty, we moved quickly on expense management, rolled out new commercials tailored to this environment, implemented a 90 day payment deferment promotion for our customers and designed our expense reduction initiatives to be impactful while also being easily reversible to enable us to adopt or adapt to different demand scenarios. We've also been active in managing our credit and capital markets risk. In late March, we tightened credit significantly on the loans generated on our platform. In addition, we upsized our forward flow purchase agreement with Ally to $2 billion and broaden the set of customers covered under the agreement and we completed a $600 million common stock offering to fortify our balance sheet. We view inventory values as another area that we want to be purposeful about managing. We ceased all purchases except for customer trade-ins in late March, which in combination with our outperformance and sales relative to the industry have reduced our total inventory by about 30% in just five weeks since the quarter ended. This significantly reduces our exposure to inventory purchase prior to the pandemic. As we bring down expenses and manage our risks, we are also continuing to extend our leadership in the areas that are most important to our long-term success. The single most important is the quality of our customer experiences. Our customer experiences have three primary drivers: our culture, our technology and our supply chain. We are continuing to invest in our technology to make buying a car even easier, more fun and safe for our customers. This in turn enables a different more efficient supply chain than it's traditionally existed in automotive retail. We're also continuing to fill our real estate pipeline while holding off on growth CapEx, so we are prepared to return to rapid growth when the time is right. Culture is at the top of the list of drivers of our long-term success is at the top for a reason. Everything we do, all the things that come together to deliver incredible customer experiences are done by our people. People in the relationships and processes to connect them are the great fundamental in any business. An environment like this is a test for any culture. You learn more about people and more about a culture during these moments of intense direct pressure. Before I tell you what we've learned so far, I want to tell you what we hope. In mid-March, we set a goal that we would come out of this stronger that we, our entire team across the country, would look back on this time as a period that we came together. To achieve this, we decided to use our values, most extensively our value we're all in this together as the lens for making tough decisions. We contend into the pandemic poised for tremendous growth. This obviously made aligning expenses with this environment difficult. The only way we could achieve it was to significantly reduce hours for thousands of people across the company. And this was undoubtedly the hardest and most painful decision any members of our management team have ever had to make. It's an unfortunate reality. The right decision for Carvana given all of our goals was to reduce the hours of the operators that work so hard every day to deliver the customer experiences that define us. That reality did not align with our value on this together. So we set up a fund where people across the company could volunteer a portion of their salaries that would go into this fund and offset lost wages for those lost hours. We had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people across the company voluntarily contribute their wages into the fund, including the board of directors and the executive team that all contributed 100% of their salaries during this time. I think there is no clear expression of our culture than this. In fact, many of the contributions came from people who lost hours themselves, but who knew others needed a hand more than they did. Really think about that for a minute. In a time of fear and uncertainty, these people who are dealing themselves with reduced income decided to give more. They did it because they\u2019re incredible people. They did it because they're part of something and they did it because we're all in this together. And the fact that they did it that so many did it is something that I think the entire team at Carvana should be tremendously proud of. This is the strongest and fondest memory I'll take from all this. Difficulty rarely leaves things that they were. It tears groups apart or brings them together. We've been brought together. There are undoubtedly more challenges lie in front of us, but we head into those challenges confidently because the people standing beside us. Mark?\nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Q1 was a strong quarter for Carvana in light of the extreme disruption to our nation, industry and company brought on by COVID-19. Retail units sold in Q1 totaled 52,427, an increase of 43%. Total revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of 45%. Both of these numbers reflect significant gains in market share, which are continuing through April and the first week of May. Total gross profit per unit was $2,640 in Q1, an increase of $232. Our growth in GPU was driven by strong retail GPU, which increased $299 to $1,581, our highest ever driven primarily by buying cars from customers. Wholesale GPU was $23, a reduction of $60, primarily impacted by declines in industry-wide wholesale prices in late Q1. Other GPU was $1,036, a decrease of $8. This included a $97 reduction in finance GPU to $528, offset by an $89 increase in ancillary products to $508. In March, we completed our first non-prime securitization and sold our prime loans that were originally intended to be part of our two shelves securitization program under our existing forward flow agreement. While lower than recent quarters, we believe our Q1 finance GPU demonstrates the resilience of our finance platform during an extremely volatile period. EBITDA margin was negative 12.6% in Q1, a decrease from negative 7.8%. EBITDA margin was significantly impacted by the reduction in demand brought on by COVID-19 during a key selling period in March. In addition, EBITDA margin in Q1 was impacted by 2.4 percentage points or $26 million due to COVID-19 related non-cash adjustments to asset carrying values that we do not expect to recur in future periods. In late Q1, we took several measures to better align our expenses with customer demand. Following the spread of COVID-19, we immediately paused discretionary growth investments including new hiring, travel and new facilities and IT investments. We also made the prudent, but difficult decisions to rebalance staffing and marketing to better match demand. Although we made these decisions early and quickly, lower volume outweighed the expense reductions and led to a 4.6% increase in SG&A as a percent of revenue. In light of the uncertainty generated by COVID-19, our expansion strategy has shifted to one that prioritizes risk reduction while also ensuring that we are prepared for growth when a normalized environment returns. We have paused acquiring new inspection and reconditioning centers and vending machines. However, we are continuing construction on IRCs that were already in process and that have existing sale leaseback agreements in place. Additionally, due to the positive customer response to our touchless delivery offering, we plan to open many smaller markets that could be served by our existing logistics and delivery infrastructure with limited incremental investment. Following quarter-end, we completed a registered direct offering of 13.3 million shares, raising $600 million and bringing our total liquidity resources on April 1st to over $1 billion. These liquidity resources provide us with significant flexibility to operate our business under a wide range of operating and macroeconomics scenarios. In addition, we upsized and extended our existing forward flow agreement with Ally providing additional flexibility to serve our customers. We expect 169 million on a fully exchange basis shares in Q2. As we look forward, we're focused on positioning the business to be lean and flexible as we march toward our long-term goals. Thank you for your attention. We will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Zack Fadem of Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nZack Fadem: Hi. I'm curious if you could talk us through the inventory management in a little more detail and how you went about that $500 per unit inventory charge. And then curious if you could talk us through whether the environment has evolved into Q2. And if you see any reasons to believe the GPU environment can improve from here?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think in general, the way that we assess our inventory and determine its carrying value is, is a function of basically looking at what our pricing is. And then, what that means for what we're likely to receive in proceeds relative to the value that we acquired inventory at. And that's kind of a standard accounting framework for determining that. So that's how we go about assessing our inventory charges reserve level. In terms of how the situation has evolved, I think it's been a very dynamic situation in terms of what's going on with inventory pricing. We saw right when the pandemic hit basically volume kind of dried up in the wholesale markets pretty significantly dropped down to probably 20% of normal levels. It stayed down at those levels for a while. We've seen it more recently climb up to closer to 50% of its probably pre-pandemic expected levels over the last couple of weeks and that's been kind of a linear march up. We've also seen a wholesale pricing kind of move up a little bit over the last couple of weeks as well. We've seen sell-through rates, which is likelihood of any given car that's going through auction is actually sold to a buyer, also go up a little bit. So I think there has been some signs of stability there, but I think we still remain in a highly uncertain environment as it relates to vehicle values. And so, that's something that we're assessing very carefully in watching on the retail side. There's definitely been much more stability in pricing. So probably a number of technical reasons, but we've seen much more stability there. I think what we've attempted to do by stopping our purchases and kind of trying to push our inventory values or excuse me inventory levels down as quickly as we could, just make sure that we minimize our exposure to all that inventory that was purchased in the pre-pandemic world as we view that as a potentially large exposure. I do think we've had incredible progress there, marching that down 30% since the end of March. And so, I think, it's something that we're really excited about, but I do think it\u2019s something we're paying very close attention to.\nZack Fadem: Got it. Thanks, Ernie. And then I wanted to talk about the 90 day no payment offer. I'm curious if you know all customers qualify for that and maybe you could walk through the impact there in terms of top line. And I was also curious how that works in terms of financing those receivables and if there's a delayed impact there on those transactions.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, on the 90 day promo that is something that there are qualifying requirements for that. So for many of the customers that are \u2013 are then being sold through our forward flow purchase agreement most of them are qualifying and then they have an option to elect into that or not in the loans that are not being sold through our forward flow purchase agreement, which is approximately a third of the loans that we\u2019re originating today. A significant minority of the customers are qualifying for that. We do believe that's probably had a positive impact, I think quantifying it precisely is difficult in light of the many, many different things that we've done over the last several weeks to ensure that we're putting our best support in front of our customers. So I think that's been one of many steps that we've taken. The impact to GPU flows through finance GPU and so in the case of being sold to Ally that\u2019s \u2013 that's something that is predetermined. And we worked with them given their experience with these kinds of offerings to customers in the past to size that appropriately. So that\u2019s \u2013 how that's all been working.\nZack Fadem: Got it. I appreciate the time guys.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nColin Sebastian: Great, thanks. And hope everyone there is safe and healthy. I guess one follow up on the April trends. How much have you been able to take advantage of some of the ad pricing deflation? How much has that been a catalyst for your ability to connect with potential buyers? And then looking beyond the current environment, I'm curious on what you think might be liquidity needs incrementally for the balance of the year in different scenarios around the economy. And in general, is the environment changing any of your strategic priorities, whether that's related to market expansions and vending machines, things like that? Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So there has clearly been a reduction in advertising costs. And I think there's also clearly been an increase in impressions. More consumers are consuming more media than they historically have. And so, I think that cost per impressions have fallen pretty dramatically. I think that impact is at least directionally offset by the fact consumers are also purchasing less in this environment across the economy and up until several weeks ago especially in automotive, but we've clearly seen price reductions. Those price reductions have continued over the last month or so. And so, I don't think we know exactly where that's going to go, but it\u2019s \u2013 there's clearly been reductions in the cost to get your message in front of consumers. And that's something that we'll continue to monitor very carefully going forward. Sure. And then on the liquidity question, I would start with the fact that we had about $1 billion, actually a little bit more than $1 billion in total liquidity resources as of April 1st falling close of our $600 million offering. That gives us ample resources to operate in even deep stress scenarios. I think that we think those deep stress scenarios are looking less likely than perhaps they were three or four weeks ago. But we have a lot of flexibility even in deep trust scenarios to operate flexibly. And then of course in upside scenarios have a lot of flexibility there as well. I think some of the drivers of that flexibility have been the operational changes that we have made to respond to the COVID-19 environment. Those include limiting capital expenditures, as I mentioned in my remarks, to focus primarily on inspection and reconditioning centers where we already have sale leaseback agreements in place. And then from an operating expense perspective obviously taking a number of steps to match our operating expenses to the current demand environment. And so, the combination of those things which really started to be put into action in the second half of March. And then, we're sort of playing out those plans through the second half of March and then through April leave us feeling really good about our liquidity position even in deep stress scenarios because of those levers that we have in the business.\nColin Sebastian: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Lee Krowl of B. Riley FBR. Please proceed with your question.\nLee Krowl: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. One kind of wanted to just kind of a high level of demand picture thoughts as we have arguably lower air travel coming over the holiday season of summer, thoughts on implied demand from more vehicles on the road, more miles driven. And then also just the \u2013 kind of thoughts around this shift in the tax date from April to July.\nErnie Garcia: On your first point, I think there's a lot of uncertainty and a lot of questions about what this new world means, both in the immediate term and in the longer term. I think what we\u2019d say there's a lot of different data sources out there. You can read about your expectations that personal ownership actually accelerates as a result of all this and increases because more people don't want to take public transportation or choose not to partake and ridesharing. There are probably other effects like those outlined where people are traveling less in the air and taking road trips instead. I think all of those things are possible. They're very, very hard to size and they're very hard to rely on. I think what we are most excited about is first and foremost the market share that we've kind of always been planning to go after and take over time. We've been growing our business very quickly prior to this as a result of our extremely differentiated offering and all the customer preferences that that serves. And I think that in this new world, we now know the direction of a new customer preference, which is a preference for safety and minimizing unnecessary impact with other people that that customers don't know as well. We know that that's likely to push demand in our direction and aid our goals of increasing our market share. We don't know how strong that impact will be. We don't know how persistent it will be, but it's pretty clear that's a directional impact. And we think that overall when assessing Carvana what matters most is our market share gains. The market around us is extraordinarily large and we're still very, very small compared to that market. And then your second question, would you mind clarifying? I'm not sure I totally understood\u2026\nLee Krowl: Yes.\nErnie Garcia: Okay, perfect. Yes, so we \u2013 the tax date, do you mean tax refunds that showed up a week or so later this year, is that what you're referencing?\nLee Krowl: Correct.\nMark Jenkins: So, perhaps you're referencing the change in the filing deadline from [Technical Difficulty] 15 to July 15th. I think that could have some impact on customer behavior. We did see some tax refund, certainly come through before COVID-19, really came into force in the U.S. in Q1. But I think that any impacts from the shift in the deadline from April to July, I would think would just be very much melded in with the probably much bigger impacts that come from shelter-in-place orders being lifted, consumers starting to get out there and spend again. I think it will be hard to disentangle those impacts. And so I \u2013 and I actually think that COVID impacts well. We\u2019ll win out over any impacts related to the tax deadline shift.\nLee Krowl: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. So the first question I wanted, I guess, it's more geared towards, Mark, just on the financials. Clearly as you talked about a lot, significant disruption here in the first quarter, but as we look at that quarter and some of the areas of costs, are there larger callouts that we should be thinking about as we try to get to what would have been a more normalized earnings trajectory for Carvana, either positives or negatives call out as the \u2013 as the business, had to flex in the second half of the month of March?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes. So the largest expense callout is the adjustment to asset carrying values totaled about $26 million that I alluded to in my prepared remarks. That was really split between two things. The larger portion was related to adjustments in the valuation of finance receivable related assets that we hold on our balance sheet, obviously the end of March, which is when we do that evaluation was a very turbulent time in financial markets. And so we took an adjustment to some finance receivable related assets that we hold on the balance sheet. The second largest category was we did observe toward the end of March, significant changes in the wholesale trading prices of used vehicles. And then we also saw a significant reduction in demand, which changed some of our expectations about the number of days to sale that we expected to experience in our retail business. And so when taking both of those things into consideration, we made some adjustments to our inventory value and that some of those totaled $26 million. So that was a very large impact on the expense side. In terms of SG&A, I think the two biggest places where we saw an impact were really in advertising per car sold and compensation and benefits per car sold. The way to think about both of those is, you know, Q4 and then early Q1 or the first couple months of Q1 is a big investment period for us as we invest in staffing and invest in marketing in preparation for one of the busiest times of the year, which is tax season. And so, this year we made those significant investments, but then demand in March was nothing like what we anticipated for obvious reasons related to COVID-19. And so, we certainly saw elevated levels of compensation and benefits and advertising expense per unit relative to what we otherwise would have expected. We also saw elevated levels on a per unit basis and the other expense line items, but those were the biggest two.\nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. I appreciate it. And then my follow up question, as we look at this \u2013 the rebound in sales you called out here in Q2, so congrats on that. The question I have is, you know, and again, I understand it's fluid right now, but is it \u2013 are you seeing just \u2013 is it just a more of a return to normal your normal customers coming back? Or is there some type of shift within that that the demand is returning? And then the second is, is it ramping? Or is it continuing to ramp here? Or is it basically just reset back a bit?\nErnie Garcia: So I think there are many different data sources that you can look at to try to get a sense of what sales looks like across the industry in April and in the last several weeks. And I think many of those datasets circle around the same answers, but don't precisely agree for used car sales. I think they range from estimates of the entire month of April being down 55%, give or take, to as little as 45%. And in more recent weeks depending on what data set you're looking at maybe down 35% to maybe only down 20% to 25%. So I think those would be the estimates of what's happening in the industry over the last several weeks. In the month of April, as we said, we troughed that approximately down 30% year-over-year early in the month. We then came back very strongly to end of the month barely down year-over-year at all. And in most recent weeks have been up, 20% to 30% have seen pretty healthy, steady, consistent growth over the last several weeks. So, it's clear that we are outperforming the industry based on all the data that we look at. When we look at the demographics of our customers and kind of try to get a sense of where that share may be coming from, our demographics were pretty broad based before. And so, there are maybe some, some very subtle differences that we're able to observe, but I don't think any of those differences are strong enough to where we have certainty that there is real information in them or certainly that they would be worth calling out on this call. So I think in general it feels like it's been a broad-based improvement. There have been surveys out and there's \u2013 a million of these surveys out \u2013 so you can, you can look at many different ones, but one that came out several weeks ago that was put out by CarGurus prior to the pandemic one of the questions they asked customers was something along the lines of would you consider buying a car online? And at that time, something like 32% of customers raised their hand and said I would consider doing that. Several weeks ago, which \u2013 we\u2019re still relatively early in all of this, but several weeks ago that number had jumped up to about 61% of customers said they would consider buying a car online. So, we do think that in this new environment, we have a very, very desirable offering. And so, we think that bodes well for the medium term, but undoubtedly the market \u2013the entire industry took a big surprising, unexpected hit in late March and April. And I think now we're marching back pretty steadily. And I think if you take these lines and extend them out, I think they suggest pretty exciting next couple of quarters in several respects. But we think that there is still a fair amount of risk left. We still won\u2019t have a permanent solution for the virus. We still don't really know the degree of the economic impacts. I think there\u2019s a number of micro impacts in automotive that we're watching very carefully. We called out at our prepared remarks. So I think we are enthusiastic about the response that we've seen and most importantly, honestly, the way that the company has responded to all of this. But I think we're still trying to make sure that we're looking at the future through the lens of different scenarios and making sure the businesses is flexible and able to adapt quickly to different scenarios as we're not sure exactly what you expect out of the next several months.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi, good afternoon. Could you give us any perspective on what retail GPU might have looked like for you in April as you were kind of unwinding the inventory? And then secondarily on the finance business, I mean, obviously the end of March was really rough. How do we think about finance revenue per car kind of going into the second quarter and the rest of the year? Should that normalize back towards levels that look more similar to last year? Or is there something else that we should consider as kind of hampering that?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Let's start with retail GPU. So I think first and foremost, I think we were very pleased with retail GPU. And I think absent coronavirus, it would have been higher still, but we do that as a very healthy number. It was marginally impacted by our choice to stop purchasing inventory in late March. It's something that's kind of always happening in our retail GPU and flowing through our financial statements is that you're constantly buying cars. And if you buy those cars, those cars get reconditioned at the inspection reconditioning centers. They get put on the site and then they have some probability of being sold in any given day. The cars that you put up that are sold quickly tend to have higher margins and the cars that take longer to sell tend to have lower margins. And so when you stop buying cars, you're kind of freezing your inventory and time and that inventory starts to age out. And so, all else constant, the average margin that you observe flowing through the income statement is going to drop because time is moving and cars depreciate with respect to time. And so, I do think that probably had a marginal impact that would likely be a larger impact in the second quarter than it was in the first. If you just kind of run a very simple mental model of saying you don't buy any cars in the quarter then on average your days of sale would go up by approximately 45 days. We're selling those cars through out of 90 day quarter. And so you can kind of do the math on what would happen there. We are starting to now turn purchases back on given both the stability that we're observing in the wholesale markets or at least the relative stability that we're observing in the wholesale markets and the strong demand that we're seeing as well as the fact that we've now brought our inventory down and reduced our exposure there considerably. So that will provide an offset to just that depreciation, but that is an impact in Q1 and is likely to be a larger impact in Q2. As we think about finance revenue per car, I think, I'll start with we're extremely pleased with how our finance platform held up in this environment. We went and did our first non-prime securitization in the quarter. We did that in an extremely turbulent market, but we did get that done before markets shut for a short period of time. And so, we did not get the premium that we were expecting or likely would have gotten in previous periods, but we still got a very solid premium and we're pleased with that. And then, we pivoted as securitization markets closed for a short period of time. And instead of doing a prime securitization, we sold those loans to our forward flow purchase agreement as would be expected in this new environment when kind of yields are moving up and spreads are moving up and loss expectations are moving up. The premium we received was less than we might have otherwise received, but it was again a premium that we were pleased with. So to me, I would view that as actually an excellent test and a sign of resiliency of the finance platform. We certainly wish it would have been as high numbers as it was in Q4 and always do and believe that it will continue to go up even from the Q4 levels. But I also think that that number represents a very strong number compared to what the traditional dealership model gets. And it also represents a relatively small decrease relative to what many finance models that would take charges to credit being held on balance sheet would take. And so, I think, you know, to us that's a very resilient number that we think is a great moment for the finance platform to demonstrate its strength not only in a positive scenario, but also in a downside case.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Armintas Sinkevicius of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nArmintas Sinkevicius:\notherwise (0:36:57):\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Yes. We hit this a little bit on the last call as well. So, I think, there's basically three big buckets that you can think of as being in other. The first is technology. The second is corporate. And then there's also some transactional expenses in there. I think in terms of the way that that's grown over the last year or so, we definitely have been investing in all of those areas. And so, one of the big sources of investment in 2019 was essentially building almost from scratch, this business of buying cars from customers, that definitely impacted all three of those big buckets that I just walked through. That was a major innovation and a major adds to the business in 2019. And so, it was a big, big driver of all the line items, but certainly the other SG&A line item as well. That's also true in Q1. All of those things that I just walked through are certainly be expenses that we'd be bearing in Q1. And other SG&A per car sold actually was up a little bit in Q1 despite a pretty significant drop off in demand in March, but those are the major buckets. That's certainly a bucket that we expect to lever significantly over time as we march forward our long-term model.\nArmintas Sinkevicius: Okay. And just for the first quarter, every single line item in SG&A was higher than the prior quarter. You mentioned some of the costs related to advertising and comp and benefits, but looking ahead to the second quarter, what levers are you pulling here to manage that what you see as an appropriate burn rate for the company? Any of these line items that we should be thinking of trending lower sequentially into the second quarter?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes. So we certainly expect declines on a per car sold basis in those SG&A line items. I think where does that come from? I think a big part of the expected decline on a per unit basis is the response that we've taken to COVID-19. So in Q1, we were in a period where we were significantly investing. March is often one of our best, if not our best month of the year, which is a common in the used car industry. And so, we were investing really significantly in advance of expected busy season. And when that busy season didn't materialize, obviously, that had a significant impact on our expenses per car sold that were ultimately realized in the quarter. Of course, we do expect as I alluded to through the actions that we've taken for per car sold expenses to decline in Q2.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Proceed with your question.\nAndrew Boone: Hi, this is Andrew Boone on for Ron. Thanks for taking our question. With April sales rebounding to that plus 20% to 30% level that you guys talked about and understood things are yet to kind of normalize, but with significant share gains that you guys are seeing, can you talk about kind of what the recapitalized balance sheet, why you guys aren't leaning into advertising more? Is there a change in ROI? Or is there something else there? And then secondly, just kind of a big picture question. So, Ernie, the way that you've built this business is really a fixed cost model. As you go through something like this, does this make you want to push more costs to a variable model? Or do you think about that any differently? Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So what I would say is that I think \u2013 I would start with we're extraordinarily happy with the way the last several weeks have gone from a demand perspective. We're being a 20% to 30% year-over-year \u2013 after being down 30% year-over-year to several weeks before is a pretty dramatic reversal and has us back to pretty significant levels of sales. I think as you look forward, what we're trying to do is we're trying to balance of the uncertainty that remains in the industry and the economy and with the virus, with the upside potential that we clearly see. And I think that has us monitoring many different things very closely. We've talked a little bit about how we're monitoring the inventory prices in markets. We're definitely monitoring the credit markets. We're clearly very closely following demand that we're seeing on our website. We're paying close attention to marketing costs. We're trying to get a good handle on all of those things. We're trying to make sure that we move forward in ways that we believe allow us to take advantage of the situation when it's positive, but also ensure that we cut off the worst downside cases if things do turn a little bit negative. And I think that's an equation that we're trying to balance really carefully because we do feel like while trends are very positive, it is still entirely possible that we're in the somewhat early stage of this. And we want to make sure that we get a good look at it before we make sweeping moves. But we will be monitoring all that and we have been making changes very rapidly. And I would anticipate that we will continue to make changes very rapidly as information becomes available. I think this business is designed to swap variable costs for fixed costs relative to the traditional model. And we think that is absolutely the right move. And in no way, shape or form would we want to change that at all. I think, the degree to which that ends up being the right choice is a function of the size of the business that you believe you can ultimately build. And prior to this, we believe that that we could build a business that would sell 2 million plus cars per year and that that would lead to us being the largest most profitable automotive retailer. And I don't think we have any information that would cause us to question that in any way, shape or form. I think if anything that the information that's changed would potentially make us more optimistic about the speed to getting there or even the possible ultimate upside. So I think we feel very good about the way we've designed the business and think it positions us incredibly well to continue growth. I think we've also demonstrated a lot of flexibility in the model. This point is right that we've built a business that\u2019s setup have higher fixed cost and lower variable costs. That's an incredible setup when you're growing very quickly. And when you're looking at the long-term with these large market shares, that's a really tough setup when you're looking at a discontinuous demand shock, like the one that we just saw over the last five or six weeks. But I think the business also demonstrated its flexibility and our ability to pull levers and kind of size it down and pulling our wings and adjust quickly to a lower demand environment. And then it's shown its ability to spring back up over the last couple of weeks. So we feel great about the business that we designed and think if anything the future is brighter.\nAndrew Boone: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rajat Gupta of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nRajat Gupta: Hey. Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had a couple follow-ups on the finance GPU questions. Could you have a break out? What\u2019s the difference in financial GPU was in 1Q between the forward flow and the non-prime ABS deal? And related to that moving into the second quarter and beyond, is the plan still to monetize a majority of the loans through Ally in the near-term? Or have you seen any change in the environment in the ABS markets that that you might want to tap into \u2013 in the second quarter as well? And then like what kind of impact \u2013 do we expect a similar kind of premium in the second quarter as well overall as you saw in the first quarter? And then I have a follow up. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So at high level, what I would say is, on both pools we \u2013 we received a premium on both pools. It was less than we would have anticipated prior. We historically haven't kind of dove in at greater detail than that. And so, I don't think it's our now, but generally speaking, those pools, we tend to monetize it at somewhat similar levels. Looking forward, first I want to start with Ally. I think Ally has been an absolutely tremendous partner for us and reacted very quickly with us when we saw \u2013 the difficulty that was emerging in the economy generally and as a result of the pandemic and also in credit markets and worked with us to upsize that forward flow purchase agreement to $2 billion agreement of \u2013 as you'd expect in this environment, they're going to do better financially on those loans they originate as they should a) because the environment, b) because they were there for us to make sure that we can massage out that risk, which we're extraordinarily grateful for. So they will do better and that will all else constant impact finance GPU over the coming quarters, a quarter or two. That said, the market also tends to react and interest rates move \u2013 and the interest rates that we're able to charge in the market may offset that. It's hard to know exactly what's going to happen there. Looking into Q2 and trying to figure out exactly what finance GPU is going to be is definitely difficult. I don't think we have perfect clarity there in any way, shape or form. We wouldn't anticipate our best guess with fairly wide uncertainty bars around, it would be for it to be somewhat similar to what it was in Q1. The securitization markets have begun to open up again. There have been several deals done over the last couple of weeks. And there's anticipated to be many more deals done over \u2013 over the next several weeks. And so, I do think those markets are opening up and the ability to monetize receivables seems to be improving. So I think there \u2013 there are reasons to be optimistic there, but I also think that that remains an area where it's wise to kind of expect the unexpected there and plan for a little bit of uncertainty. So I don't think we want to give you precise expectations for what that will look like in Q2.\nRajat Gupta: That's a great color. Thanks for that. And then just more of a housekeeping question. Did the other expense line item that that was up materially, I believe some of that was due to the loss on the beneficial of interest in securitization. Was there anything else that went into that that\u2019s material to call out? And also is that part of the $26 million non-cash that you talked about as well? I just want to clarify that. Thanks.\nMark Jenkins: Yes, that was that \u2013 that $17 million is part of the $26 million. That's the larger portion that I was referencing earlier and then that that $17 million is related to these financial receivable related assets. The biggest part of that is retained beneficial interest in securitizations. And then there's a portion that's another finance receivable asset bonus payment essentially.\nRajat Gupta: Got it, got it. So, basically, the \u2013 so $9 million was the impact on like just the retail and wholesale GPU, but the rest is mainly finance driven?\nErnie Garcia: That's correct.\nRajat Gupta: Okay. Thanks for clarification and good luck.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rick Nelson of Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nRick Nelson: Thanks. Good afternoon. I would like to follow up on this dramatic shift from sales declines early in April to the increases that you are seeing later come up. It seems much more dramatic than what's happening in the overall used car business and I am curious about GPU. Were there \u2013 changes there stimulus checks to that impact the 90 day promotion? How you think that impacted?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think those are among the things that are difficult to disentangle. I think we saw a rapid demand shock that that pushed sales down. And then I think from there, we implemented the 90 day promotion. We've put out different marketing materials that are tailored to this moment to reach out to customers through these less expensive marketing channels. The stimulus checks were received by customers. There seems to be general recovery happening in the market. And so, I believe there are number of forces that are flowing through there, that are difficult to separate. I think, what we're excited about is it does seem clear that that we are outperforming the market generally in terms of the severity of the decrease in sales and in terms of the speed with which sales are climbing back up. And so, I think we're excited by that. And we think that that speaks to these shifts in customer preferences in our direction. But trying to disentangle the other impacts I think is too difficult for us to \u2013 to want to take a swing at that.\nRick Nelson: Okay. Okay, got it. And I'm also curious to reduce kind of retail inventory exclusively through the website? Or do you use that wholesale channel to liquidate auctions or other wholesalers?\nErnie Garcia: Through the website.\nRick Nelson: All through the website, great. Thanks and good luck.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Jones of Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Jones: Hi, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I guess one on the competition that you put into the CarGurus survey and so undoubtedly that's a marketing tool for them to try to get other dealers to start delivering. Have you changed your views on what competition is going to do to kind of the new way to sell cars? It seems like you might have more entrance now after this. Do you have any updated thoughts there? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Here's what I would say, I think across the economy, across different retail verticals and certainly in automotive, I think there seems to be a broadly held expectation that that e-commerce will be a relative outperformer during this time and coming out of this time. And so I don't think that that's a secret. I think the survey that that came from CarGurus is one of many surveys like it as this is clearly a very topical point to at the moment. So I think what we would start with is we think that's really, really good news. I think, the first order impact of consumers wanting to transact in the way that we've specialized for the last seven years is a big positive. And then I do think that to some degree you do need to then think through the second order effect, which is others being more inclined to try to build similar offerings to the offering that we've built. And so, I think, our expectation would be that that will likely happen. But I think that was already happening to some degree [indiscernible] that will likely happen debatably more now. I think, it's important to look at the market generally. This is a market with tens of thousands of dealers where the top a hundred players have on the order of a 7% or 8% market share. So it's an enormously fragmented market. It's a very large market depending on your definition on the order of a trillion dollar market. So, it's really, really large. And so, we think that that also points to the direction of not becoming overly competition focused because there are just so many small competitors as opposed to one or two large competitors as there generally are in many of these other industries. We spent the last seven years investing in the technology that gives customers a great experience online and investing in the supply chain that that great online experience unlocks, that delivers selection to customers and building a brand for doing exactly that. And building e-commerce business is inexpensive undertaking. It takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of money. This is clearly visible across industries. And it's hard. It's a hard thing to do. So I think, would we expect more competitions as a result of all this? I think the answer directionally would be yes. Would we view the underlying driver of that competition that consumers are more excited about buying cars online that that transition has been accelerated as a much bigger positive than the increase in competition is potentially negative? Absolutely. So I think, overall, we're feeling very optimistic about the long-term impacts of this.\nMark Jenkins: Or at least the medium term.\nErnie Garcia: Longer term impacts of this \u2013 yes, from a long-term perspective it's hard to know exactly this will play out.\nNick Jones: Great, thank.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Montani of Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Montani: Great. Thanks for taking the question. The questions I had are along the lines of two different areas. One would be with the Ally deal in place now, just trying to get a handle on the magnitude of profit pressure that we might anticipate on kind of like for like loans. And is that something that would remain in place over the course of the next year? And then there's a follow up.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I don't think we'd want to quantify that right now because I think what happens in an environment like this is several folds. Loss expectations tend to go up, which all else constant would reduce premiums. The yields that risk takers expect to earn tend to go up, which all else constant would reduce premiums and then consumer interest rates tend to go up as well, which all those constant tends to increase premiums. And the balance of those things is a little bit hard to predict. Historically, the value of loans originated through automotive retailers and finance companies, that kind of combined stack has been fairly stable. So our expectation would be for that to convert back to where it was prior to this and then continue its upward journey from there. I think the exact timing of all that is unclear. I think whether the next step is a positive one or negative one is unclear. But we've definitely taken steps to try to make sure that the loans originating are very desirable loans. We've tightened credit pretty significantly, going into this in an effort to make sure that we were positioning ourselves conservatively. We modeled the way that we were tightening credit off of the way that credit was ultimately tightened and performed in the 2008 to 2009 financial crisis. And so we made the assumption that losses will deteriorate a similar degree. That's a more severe assumption the most rating agencies are making the securitizations that are getting done today. We made the assumption that investor yields would go up to where they were, the 2008, 2009 crisis. That seems to be similar to or more severe than the implied yields that seem to be clearing in the securitization market today, although, that is a volatile market.  So I think in terms of what we're originating, we feel very good about it. We feel like we thought carefully about what we wanted to do to credit. We believe that tight credit in those ways has likely reduced our overall volume by something on the order of 25%, which is very, very significant. And I think also speaks to how strong the demand is that we're seeing. Because we \u2013 from all indications it seems that we have likely tightened credit more than the rest of the industry has. And so absent that tightening, we may be performing even better. But we've made those moves to ensure that we're positioned defensively as we continue to monitor what's going on and then we'll figure out what the right move \u2013 what the right next move is from here.\nMike Montani: Okay, great. Thanks. And if I could, just some additional color on the wholesale front, just curious to see what you all are finding in terms of pricing over the past couple of weeks on the wholesale pricing. And then what's the read through for that in terms of two areas. One would be GPUs. So should we anticipate any further kind of mark-to-market adjustments on GPUs in Q2 or if you assume kind of current trends persist, that 1Q mark down was enough. And then the second question would be on the consumer side and the trade-in side, is 70% and 40% ratios kind of good to go again now given that you guys are once again in the market and purchasing cars for consumers or are you trying to be more deliberate and not scale that up as quickly as it was?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. I'll take the question on wholesale GPU. So we don't expect any of the adjustments that we talked about earlier to recur in future periods. However, I do think it's reasonable to assume that wholesale GPU will be lower than a normalized level in Q2. I think there's still an awful lot of uncertainty around how exactly the wholesale market is going to evolve from here. I think we started to see some volume come back but certainly not at normalized levels yet. And so I think, we'll see what happens in the market. But there's certainly a lot of uncertainty right now. And I think a reasonable expectation is that Q2 will be lower than normalized levels.\nErnie Garcia: And then as it relates to the customer source of vehicles, I think neither of the 70%, which was the percentage of cars that we are buying relative to number of cars that we are selling, nor the 40%, which is the percentage of cars that we\u2019re selling to customers that were previously bought from customers. Neither of those numbers were our long-term goals. And both of those numbers were on steep positive trajectories heading into this. We did pause purchasing through all channels except for customer trade-ins, early in this cycle. And so that will clearly push down that 70% number, just directly because we're not buying cars, we are selling cars that just kind of mechanically drops at least in a transitory way. And then the 40% number is a function of, when we turn purchasing back on what ratio of purchasing is coming from customers versus what is coming from other sources. And I think that there is uncertainty in what that ratio will be in the near-term, in the medium-term. And long-term we would expect it to go back to where it was before and to continue to decline because buying cars from customers is the most fundamental, the most economic source of cars that there is. And so that's where you want to be buying cars. Given the dramatic moves in the market, buying cars from customers is effectively happening in a much less liquid market where you have a single seller selling a single car once every many years, whereas the wholesale markets are much more liquid. And so if you have rapid price disruptions, those wholesale markets tend to virtually instantaneously adapt to that new environment; whereas the consumer market tends to be a little stickier both directions. And so we will be monitoring both of those markets. And getting a sense of where the better market is to acquire inventory in the near-term. But in the medium and long-term, our expectations would be to march back to where we were and continue from there.\nOperator: Thank you. Your last question today will come from Brad Erickson of Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Erickson: Hi guys. Thanks. I have a couple of follow-ups. Ernie, you were just kind of talking about a little bit on the auction, the wholesale area, but just wanted to go a little further. What needs to happen really before those physical auctions can function normally again, and just kind of how vital that is for you to have enough inventory to keep driving growth? And then I have a follow-up.\nErnie Garcia: I think the auctions are functions fairly normally, again, in the sense that you can buy and sell cars and the volume is on the order of half of what it would have likely otherwise been if it weren't for all of this. Prior to this, the majority of buyers to many of the larger auction houses were already buying cars online. And so many, many more buyers have moved to buying cars online, but the auctions are functioning. And so I don't think that is a fundamental limiter to moving back to whatever levels we would like to in terms of acquisitions. I think the thing that we want to be careful about is our expectations for what's going to happen to prices. Prices have stabilized and started to recover. But there are still reasons to believe that prices could drop again. There are many sellers that sellers or shadow sellers that are out there that have not moved inventory yet. And so we want to be mindful of watching that carefully and getting a sense of what that's going to do to the market. And so that's something we're keeping a careful eye on. And that's part of why we've made the decision to manage our inventory levels down and reduce our exposure there. Now the opportunity is also extraordinarily large because the wholesale market has dropped pretty significantly in most recent weeks down probably on the order of about 12%. And the retail markets have only dropped a couple percent. So the implied wholesale retail spread is much, much wider on the order of 9% wider than it normally is. And that does generate a lot of opportunity because it suggests that there are much larger margins that are normally available for the taking there. And so we're trying to balance the risks with the upside opportunity and I think all that coming together into our strategy that we've been discussing on the call.\nBrad Erickson: Got it. And then just one last one and I apologize if you touched on this earlier, I jumped on late. But can you just give any sort of, this is a question really for Mark. Can you give any sort of EBITDA loss expectation for the year under some plausible scenario of the business, where to stay, where is at today with the April growth rates? Just any guardrails as to how to think about that or even like on a basis where, what level of the business would have to be at from here to be, say EBITDA breakeven might be another way to get at, any help on that, Mark, would be great. Thanks.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes. So I think I'll start with Q2. And I think maybe a way to summarize some of the directional things that you should be keeping in mind as it relates to that question. And a lot of these we've hit on, on this call so far. So we do expect GPU to drop somewhat meaningfully from Q1 to Q2 as a result of some of the dynamics that we were talking about earlier on this call, particularly in retail GPU. I think we also expect expenses per unit to meaningfully drop going from Q1 to Q2. And there \u2013 I think just to give a rough ballpark of order of magnitude dropping down to sort of second half 2019 levels on a SG&A per car sold. And then we think the combination of those two things will certainly lead to reduced EBITDA dollar losses in Q2. And then we would expect things getting better from there as well.\nBrad Erickson: Got it. That's great.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nErnie Garcia: I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call. We really appreciate it. And then I also want to turn to team Carvana out there in telephone lines. Thank you to all of you for the job you've done over the last six weeks. We have crammed so much into that very short period. Everyone's been working unbelievably hard. The results speak for themselves. We've made tremendous, tremendous strides in the business and that's 100% because of how hard you guys are all working. So I truly can't thank you enough. It's admirable and we really, really appreciate it. Let's keep fighting through the rest of this. We're in a great spot. Thank you everyone.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you very much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and thanks everyone for joining the call. This has been a quarter unlike any we face as a company. The onset of the pandemic has led to unprecedented changes in our health and behavior, which in turn has significant and currently unquantifiable impact in the economy. Accordingly, we will spend less time than we normally would discussing the specifics of the quarter. I will briefly hit on where we sit today and then spend more time discussing the ways we've reacted so far and the ways we are thinking about and planning for the future. We began to see significant reductions in demand in the back half of March with a sales trough in early April at approximately 30% reduction in sales year-over-year. From there, we have consistently improved week-after-week with sales in the most recent weeks being up about 20% to 30% year-over-year. It is difficult to get clear visibility into exactly how the industry performed over the last several weeks, but every indication that Carvana has outperformed the industry quite significantly and grown our market share accordingly over this period. You believe part of this outperformance has been driven by transitory factors and that part of it has been driven by customer preference changes due to the pandemic. We don't yet know how precise these customer preference changes will be, but we are optimistic. Due through medium-term lens, we believe customer behavior shifts are likely to accelerate our progress. Now, let's turn to how we've reacted so far. In early March, it became clear that we were dealing with a very significant event. At that time, we determined that we were fighting a battle with two fronts: health and financial health. Our first priority is the health front, keeping our team and our customers safe. Along those lines, we have enacted work from home for corporate and customer care teams, have reconfigured our inspection centers and field locations to support social distancing, adopted CDC guidance and implemented a touchless delivery experience for our customers. The second front is the financial health front. Here we've had three primary goals to align expenses with this new environment, to manage our risks and uncertainties thoughtfully and to ensure we preserve and continue to progress in those areas that are most important to our long-term success. We came into the pandemic expecting our biggest absolute unit growth year yet and with the business positioned to deliver on those goals. Demand shock we started to see in mid-March has obviously necessitated some significant and difficult changes. In order to align expenses with the new environment, we eliminated overtime and travel budgets, reduced hours and pause hiring. Another important component of our strategy for managing through this has been to carefully manage our risks and uncertainties. We view the most important areas of uncertainty during this period to be industry demand levels, the credit and capital market environment and inventory values. In an effort to manage demand uncertainty, we moved quickly on expense management, rolled out new commercials tailored to this environment, implemented a 90 day payment deferment promotion for our customers and designed our expense reduction initiatives to be impactful while also being easily reversible to enable us to adopt or adapt to different demand scenarios. We've also been active in managing our credit and capital markets risk. In late March, we tightened credit significantly on the loans generated on our platform. In addition, we upsized our forward flow purchase agreement with Ally to $2 billion and broaden the set of customers covered under the agreement and we completed a $600 million common stock offering to fortify our balance sheet. We view inventory values as another area that we want to be purposeful about managing. We ceased all purchases except for customer trade-ins in late March, which in combination with our outperformance and sales relative to the industry have reduced our total inventory by about 30% in just five weeks since the quarter ended. This significantly reduces our exposure to inventory purchase prior to the pandemic. As we bring down expenses and manage our risks, we are also continuing to extend our leadership in the areas that are most important to our long-term success. The single most important is the quality of our customer experiences. Our customer experiences have three primary drivers: our culture, our technology and our supply chain. We are continuing to invest in our technology to make buying a car even easier, more fun and safe for our customers. This in turn enables a different more efficient supply chain than it's traditionally existed in automotive retail. We're also continuing to fill our real estate pipeline while holding off on growth CapEx, so we are prepared to return to rapid growth when the time is right. Culture is at the top of the list of drivers of our long-term success is at the top for a reason. Everything we do, all the things that come together to deliver incredible customer experiences are done by our people. People in the relationships and processes to connect them are the great fundamental in any business. An environment like this is a test for any culture. You learn more about people and more about a culture during these moments of intense direct pressure. Before I tell you what we've learned so far, I want to tell you what we hope. In mid-March, we set a goal that we would come out of this stronger that we, our entire team across the country, would look back on this time as a period that we came together. To achieve this, we decided to use our values, most extensively our value we're all in this together as the lens for making tough decisions. We contend into the pandemic poised for tremendous growth. This obviously made aligning expenses with this environment difficult. The only way we could achieve it was to significantly reduce hours for thousands of people across the company. And this was undoubtedly the hardest and most painful decision any members of our management team have ever had to make. It's an unfortunate reality. The right decision for Carvana given all of our goals was to reduce the hours of the operators that work so hard every day to deliver the customer experiences that define us. That reality did not align with our value on this together. So we set up a fund where people across the company could volunteer a portion of their salaries that would go into this fund and offset lost wages for those lost hours. We had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people across the company voluntarily contribute their wages into the fund, including the board of directors and the executive team that all contributed 100% of their salaries during this time. I think there is no clear expression of our culture than this. In fact, many of the contributions came from people who lost hours themselves, but who knew others needed a hand more than they did. Really think about that for a minute. In a time of fear and uncertainty, these people who are dealing themselves with reduced income decided to give more. They did it because they're incredible people. They did it because they're part of something and they did it because we're all in this together. And the fact that they did it that so many did it is something that I think the entire team at Carvana should be tremendously proud of. This is the strongest and fondest memory I'll take from all this. Difficulty rarely leaves things that they were. It tears groups apart or brings them together. We've been brought together. There are undoubtedly more challenges lie in front of us, but we head into those challenges confidently because the people standing beside us. Mark? Sure. So I think in general, the way that we assess our inventory and determine its carrying value is, is a function of basically looking at what our pricing is. And then, what that means for what we're likely to receive in proceeds relative to the value that we acquired inventory at. And that's kind of a standard accounting framework for determining that. So that's how we go about assessing our inventory charges reserve level. In terms of how the situation has evolved, I think it's been a very dynamic situation in terms of what's going on with inventory pricing. We saw right when the pandemic hit basically volume kind of dried up in the wholesale markets pretty significantly dropped down to probably 20% of normal levels. It stayed down at those levels for a while. We've seen it more recently climb up to closer to 50% of its probably pre-pandemic expected levels over the last couple of weeks and that's been kind of a linear march up. We've also seen a wholesale pricing kind of move up a little bit over the last couple of weeks as well. We've seen sell-through rates, which is likelihood of any given car that's going through auction is actually sold to a buyer, also go up a little bit. So I think there has been some signs of stability there, but I think we still remain in a highly uncertain environment as it relates to vehicle values. And so, that's something that we're assessing very carefully in watching on the retail side. There's definitely been much more stability in pricing. So probably a number of technical reasons, but we've seen much more stability there. I think what we've attempted to do by stopping our purchases and kind of trying to push our inventory values or excuse me inventory levels down as quickly as we could, just make sure that we minimize our exposure to all that inventory that was purchased in the pre-pandemic world as we view that as a potentially large exposure. I do think we've had incredible progress there, marching that down 30% since the end of March. And so, I think, it's something that we're really excited about, but I do think it's something we're paying very close attention to. Sure. So, on the 90 day promo that is something that there are qualifying requirements for that. So for many of the customers that are \u2013 are then being sold through our forward flow purchase agreement most of them are qualifying and then they have an option to elect into that or not in the loans that are not being sold through our forward flow purchase agreement, which is approximately a third of the loans that we're originating today. A significant minority of the customers are qualifying for that. We do believe that's probably had a positive impact, I think quantifying it precisely is difficult in light of the many, many different things that we've done over the last several weeks to ensure that we're putting our best support in front of our customers. So I think that's been one of many steps that we've taken. The impact to GPU flows through finance GPU and so in the case of being sold to Ally that's \u2013 that's something that is predetermined. And we worked with them given their experience with these kinds of offerings to customers in the past to size that appropriately. So that's \u2013 how that's all been working. Thank you. Sure. So there has clearly been a reduction in advertising costs. And I think there's also clearly been an increase in impressions. More consumers are consuming more media than they historically have. And so, I think that cost per impressions have fallen pretty dramatically. I think that impact is at least directionally offset by the fact consumers are also purchasing less in this environment across the economy and up until several weeks ago especially in automotive, but we've clearly seen price reductions. Those price reductions have continued over the last month or so. And so, I don't think we know exactly where that's going to go, but it's \u2013 there's clearly been reductions in the cost to get your message in front of consumers. And that's something that we'll continue to monitor very carefully going forward. Sure. And then on the liquidity question, I would start with the fact that we had about $1 billion, actually a little bit more than $1 billion in total liquidity resources as of April 1st falling close of our $600 million offering. That gives us ample resources to operate in even deep stress scenarios. I think that we think those deep stress scenarios are looking less likely than perhaps they were three or four weeks ago. But we have a lot of flexibility even in deep trust scenarios to operate flexibly. And then of course in upside scenarios have a lot of flexibility there as well. I think some of the drivers of that flexibility have been the operational changes that we have made to respond to the COVID-19 environment. Those include limiting capital expenditures, as I mentioned in my remarks, to focus primarily on inspection and reconditioning centers where we already have sale leaseback agreements in place. And then from an operating expense perspective obviously taking a number of steps to match our operating expenses to the current demand environment. And so, the combination of those things which really started to be put into action in the second half of March. And then, we're sort of playing out those plans through the second half of March and then through April leave us feeling really good about our liquidity position even in deep stress scenarios because of those levers that we have in the business. On your first point, I think there's a lot of uncertainty and a lot of questions about what this new world means, both in the immediate term and in the longer term. I think what we'd say there's a lot of different data sources out there. You can read about your expectations that personal ownership actually accelerates as a result of all this and increases because more people don't want to take public transportation or choose not to partake and ridesharing. There are probably other effects like those outlined where people are traveling less in the air and taking road trips instead. I think all of those things are possible. They're very, very hard to size and they're very hard to rely on. I think what we are most excited about is first and foremost the market share that we've kind of always been planning to go after and take over time. We've been growing our business very quickly prior to this as a result of our extremely differentiated offering and all the customer preferences that that serves. And I think that in this new world, we now know the direction of a new customer preference, which is a preference for safety and minimizing unnecessary impact with other people that that customers don't know as well. We know that that's likely to push demand in our direction and aid our goals of increasing our market share. We don't know how strong that impact will be. We don't know how persistent it will be, but it's pretty clear that's a directional impact. And we think that overall when assessing Carvana what matters most is our market share gains. The market around us is extraordinarily large and we're still very, very small compared to that market. And then your second question, would you mind clarifying? I'm not sure I totally understood... Okay, perfect. Yes, so we \u2013 the tax date, do you mean tax refunds that showed up a week or so later this year, is that what you're referencing? So I think there are many different data sources that you can look at to try to get a sense of what sales looks like across the industry in April and in the last several weeks. And I think many of those datasets circle around the same answers, but don't precisely agree for used car sales. I think they range from estimates of the entire month of April being down 55%, give or take, to as little as 45%. And in more recent weeks depending on what data set you're looking at maybe down 35% to maybe only down 20% to 25%. So I think those would be the estimates of what's happening in the industry over the last several weeks. In the month of April, as we said, we troughed that approximately down 30% year-over-year early in the month. We then came back very strongly to end of the month barely down year-over-year at all. And in most recent weeks have been up, 20% to 30% have seen pretty healthy, steady, consistent growth over the last several weeks. So, it's clear that we are outperforming the industry based on all the data that we look at. When we look at the demographics of our customers and kind of try to get a sense of where that share may be coming from, our demographics were pretty broad based before. And so, there are maybe some, some very subtle differences that we're able to observe, but I don't think any of those differences are strong enough to where we have certainty that there is real information in them or certainly that they would be worth calling out on this call. So I think in general it feels like it's been a broad-based improvement. There have been surveys out and there's \u2013 a million of these surveys out \u2013 so you can, you can look at many different ones, but one that came out several weeks ago that was put out by CarGurus prior to the pandemic one of the questions they asked customers was something along the lines of would you consider buying a car online? And at that time, something like 32% of customers raised their hand and said I would consider doing that. Several weeks ago, which \u2013 we're still relatively early in all of this, but several weeks ago that number had jumped up to about 61% of customers said they would consider buying a car online. So, we do think that in this new environment, we have a very, very desirable offering. And so, we think that bodes well for the medium term, but undoubtedly the market \u2013the entire industry took a big surprising, unexpected hit in late March and April. And I think now we're marching back pretty steadily. And I think if you take these lines and extend them out, I think they suggest pretty exciting next couple of quarters in several respects. But we think that there is still a fair amount of risk left. We still won't have a permanent solution for the virus. We still don't really know the degree of the economic impacts. I think there's a number of micro impacts in automotive that we're watching very carefully. We called out at our prepared remarks. So I think we are enthusiastic about the response that we've seen and most importantly, honestly, the way that the company has responded to all of this. But I think we're still trying to make sure that we're looking at the future through the lens of different scenarios and making sure the businesses is flexible and able to adapt quickly to different scenarios as we're not sure exactly what you expect out of the next several months. Thank you. Sure. Let's start with retail GPU. So I think first and foremost, I think we were very pleased with retail GPU. And I think absent coronavirus, it would have been higher still, but we do that as a very healthy number. It was marginally impacted by our choice to stop purchasing inventory in late March. It's something that's kind of always happening in our retail GPU and flowing through our financial statements is that you're constantly buying cars. And if you buy those cars, those cars get reconditioned at the inspection reconditioning centers. They get put on the site and then they have some probability of being sold in any given day. The cars that you put up that are sold quickly tend to have higher margins and the cars that take longer to sell tend to have lower margins. And so when you stop buying cars, you're kind of freezing your inventory and time and that inventory starts to age out. And so, all else constant, the average margin that you observe flowing through the income statement is going to drop because time is moving and cars depreciate with respect to time. And so, I do think that probably had a marginal impact that would likely be a larger impact in the second quarter than it was in the first. If you just kind of run a very simple mental model of saying you don't buy any cars in the quarter then on average your days of sale would go up by approximately 45 days. We're selling those cars through out of 90 day quarter. And so you can kind of do the math on what would happen there. We are starting to now turn purchases back on given both the stability that we're observing in the wholesale markets or at least the relative stability that we're observing in the wholesale markets and the strong demand that we're seeing as well as the fact that we've now brought our inventory down and reduced our exposure there considerably. So that will provide an offset to just that depreciation, but that is an impact in Q1 and is likely to be a larger impact in Q2. As we think about finance revenue per car, I think, I'll start with we're extremely pleased with how our finance platform held up in this environment. We went and did our first non-prime securitization in the quarter. We did that in an extremely turbulent market, but we did get that done before markets shut for a short period of time. And so, we did not get the premium that we were expecting or likely would have gotten in previous periods, but we still got a very solid premium and we're pleased with that. And then, we pivoted as securitization markets closed for a short period of time. And instead of doing a prime securitization, we sold those loans to our forward flow purchase agreement as would be expected in this new environment when kind of yields are moving up and spreads are moving up and loss expectations are moving up. The premium we received was less than we might have otherwise received, but it was again a premium that we were pleased with. So to me, I would view that as actually an excellent test and a sign of resiliency of the finance platform. We certainly wish it would have been as high numbers as it was in Q4 and always do and believe that it will continue to go up even from the Q4 levels. But I also think that that number represents a very strong number compared to what the traditional dealership model gets. And it also represents a relatively small decrease relative to what many finance models that would take charges to credit being held on balance sheet would take. And so, I think, you know, to us that's a very resilient number that we think is a great moment for the finance platform to demonstrate its strength not only in a positive scenario, but also in a downside case. Sure. Yes. We hit this a little bit on the last call as well. So, I think, there's basically three big buckets that you can think of as being in other. The first is technology. The second is corporate. And then there's also some transactional expenses in there. I think in terms of the way that that's grown over the last year or so, we definitely have been investing in all of those areas. And so, one of the big sources of investment in 2019 was essentially building almost from scratch, this business of buying cars from customers, that definitely impacted all three of those big buckets that I just walked through. That was a major innovation and a major adds to the business in 2019. And so, it was a big, big driver of all the line items, but certainly the other SG&A line item as well. That's also true in Q1. All of those things that I just walked through are certainly be expenses that we'd be bearing in Q1. And other SG&A per car sold actually was up a little bit in Q1 despite a pretty significant drop off in demand in March, but those are the major buckets. That's certainly a bucket that we expect to lever significantly over time as we march forward our long-term model. Sure. So what I would say is that I think \u2013 I would start with we're extraordinarily happy with the way the last several weeks have gone from a demand perspective. We're being a 20% to 30% year-over-year \u2013 after being down 30% year-over-year to several weeks before is a pretty dramatic reversal and has us back to pretty significant levels of sales. I think as you look forward, what we're trying to do is we're trying to balance of the uncertainty that remains in the industry and the economy and with the virus, with the upside potential that we clearly see. And I think that has us monitoring many different things very closely. We've talked a little bit about how we're monitoring the inventory prices in markets. We're definitely monitoring the credit markets. We're clearly very closely following demand that we're seeing on our website. We're paying close attention to marketing costs. We're trying to get a good handle on all of those things. We're trying to make sure that we move forward in ways that we believe allow us to take advantage of the situation when it's positive, but also ensure that we cut off the worst downside cases if things do turn a little bit negative. And I think that's an equation that we're trying to balance really carefully because we do feel like while trends are very positive, it is still entirely possible that we're in the somewhat early stage of this. And we want to make sure that we get a good look at it before we make sweeping moves. But we will be monitoring all that and we have been making changes very rapidly. And I would anticipate that we will continue to make changes very rapidly as information becomes available. I think this business is designed to swap variable costs for fixed costs relative to the traditional model. And we think that is absolutely the right move. And in no way, shape or form would we want to change that at all. I think, the degree to which that ends up being the right choice is a function of the size of the business that you believe you can ultimately build. And prior to this, we believe that that we could build a business that would sell 2 million plus cars per year and that that would lead to us being the largest most profitable automotive retailer. And I don't think we have any information that would cause us to question that in any way, shape or form. I think if anything that the information that's changed would potentially make us more optimistic about the speed to getting there or even the possible ultimate upside. So I think we feel very good about the way we've designed the business and think it positions us incredibly well to continue growth. I think we've also demonstrated a lot of flexibility in the model. This point is right that we've built a business that's setup have higher fixed cost and lower variable costs. That's an incredible setup when you're growing very quickly. And when you're looking at the long-term with these large market shares, that's a really tough setup when you're looking at a discontinuous demand shock, like the one that we just saw over the last five or six weeks. But I think the business also demonstrated its flexibility and our ability to pull levers and kind of size it down and pulling our wings and adjust quickly to a lower demand environment. And then it's shown its ability to spring back up over the last couple of weeks. So we feel great about the business that we designed and think if anything the future is brighter. Sure. So at high level, what I would say is, on both pools we \u2013 we received a premium on both pools. It was less than we would have anticipated prior. We historically haven't kind of dove in at greater detail than that. And so, I don't think it's our now, but generally speaking, those pools, we tend to monetize it at somewhat similar levels. Looking forward, first I want to start with Ally. I think Ally has been an absolutely tremendous partner for us and reacted very quickly with us when we saw \u2013 the difficulty that was emerging in the economy generally and as a result of the pandemic and also in credit markets and worked with us to upsize that forward flow purchase agreement to $2 billion agreement of \u2013 as you'd expect in this environment, they're going to do better financially on those loans they originate as they should a) because the environment, b) because they were there for us to make sure that we can massage out that risk, which we're extraordinarily grateful for. So they will do better and that will all else constant impact finance GPU over the coming quarters, a quarter or two. That said, the market also tends to react and interest rates move \u2013 and the interest rates that we're able to charge in the market may offset that. It's hard to know exactly what's going to happen there. Looking into Q2 and trying to figure out exactly what finance GPU is going to be is definitely difficult. I don't think we have perfect clarity there in any way, shape or form. We wouldn't anticipate our best guess with fairly wide uncertainty bars around, it would be for it to be somewhat similar to what it was in Q1. The securitization markets have begun to open up again. There have been several deals done over the last couple of weeks. And there's anticipated to be many more deals done over \u2013 over the next several weeks. And so, I do think those markets are opening up and the ability to monetize receivables seems to be improving. So I think there \u2013 there are reasons to be optimistic there, but I also think that that remains an area where it's wise to kind of expect the unexpected there and plan for a little bit of uncertainty. So I don't think we want to give you precise expectations for what that will look like in Q2. That's correct. Thank you. Sure. So I think those are among the things that are difficult to disentangle. I think we saw a rapid demand shock that that pushed sales down. And then I think from there, we implemented the 90 day promotion. We've put out different marketing materials that are tailored to this moment to reach out to customers through these less expensive marketing channels. The stimulus checks were received by customers. There seems to be general recovery happening in the market. And so, I believe there are number of forces that are flowing through there, that are difficult to separate. I think, what we're excited about is it does seem clear that that we are outperforming the market generally in terms of the severity of the decrease in sales and in terms of the speed with which sales are climbing back up. And so, I think we're excited by that. And we think that that speaks to these shifts in customer preferences in our direction. But trying to disentangle the other impacts I think is too difficult for us to \u2013 to want to take a swing at that. Through the website. Thank you. Here's what I would say, I think across the economy, across different retail verticals and certainly in automotive, I think there seems to be a broadly held expectation that that e-commerce will be a relative outperformer during this time and coming out of this time. And so I don't think that that's a secret. I think the survey that that came from CarGurus is one of many surveys like it as this is clearly a very topical point to at the moment. So I think what we would start with is we think that's really, really good news. I think, the first order impact of consumers wanting to transact in the way that we've specialized for the last seven years is a big positive. And then I do think that to some degree you do need to then think through the second order effect, which is others being more inclined to try to build similar offerings to the offering that we've built. And so, I think, our expectation would be that that will likely happen. But I think that was already happening to some degree [indiscernible] that will likely happen debatably more now. I think, it's important to look at the market generally. This is a market with tens of thousands of dealers where the top a hundred players have on the order of a 7% or 8% market share. So it's an enormously fragmented market. It's a very large market depending on your definition on the order of a trillion dollar market. So, it's really, really large. And so, we think that that also points to the direction of not becoming overly competition focused because there are just so many small competitors as opposed to one or two large competitors as there generally are in many of these other industries. We spent the last seven years investing in the technology that gives customers a great experience online and investing in the supply chain that that great online experience unlocks, that delivers selection to customers and building a brand for doing exactly that. And building e-commerce business is inexpensive undertaking. It takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of money. This is clearly visible across industries. And it's hard. It's a hard thing to do. So I think, would we expect more competitions as a result of all this? I think the answer directionally would be yes. Would we view the underlying driver of that competition that consumers are more excited about buying cars online that that transition has been accelerated as a much bigger positive than the increase in competition is potentially negative? Absolutely. So I think, overall, we're feeling very optimistic about the long-term impacts of this. Longer term impacts of this \u2013 yes, from a long-term perspective it's hard to know exactly this will play out. Thank you. Sure. So I don't think we'd want to quantify that right now because I think what happens in an environment like this is several folds. Loss expectations tend to go up, which all else constant would reduce premiums. The yields that risk takers expect to earn tend to go up, which all else constant would reduce premiums and then consumer interest rates tend to go up as well, which all those constant tends to increase premiums. And the balance of those things is a little bit hard to predict. Historically, the value of loans originated through automotive retailers and finance companies, that kind of combined stack has been fairly stable. So our expectation would be for that to convert back to where it was prior to this and then continue its upward journey from there. I think the exact timing of all that is unclear. I think whether the next step is a positive one or negative one is unclear. But we've definitely taken steps to try to make sure that the loans originating are very desirable loans. We've tightened credit pretty significantly, going into this in an effort to make sure that we were positioning ourselves conservatively. We modeled the way that we were tightening credit off of the way that credit was ultimately tightened and performed in the 2008 to 2009 financial crisis. And so we made the assumption that losses will deteriorate a similar degree. That's a more severe assumption the most rating agencies are making the securitizations that are getting done today. We made the assumption that investor yields would go up to where they were, the 2008, 2009 crisis. That seems to be similar to or more severe than the implied yields that seem to be clearing in the securitization market today, although, that is a volatile market.  So I think in terms of what we're originating, we feel very good about it. We feel like we thought carefully about what we wanted to do to credit. We believe that tight credit in those ways has likely reduced our overall volume by something on the order of 25%, which is very, very significant. And I think also speaks to how strong the demand is that we're seeing. Because we \u2013 from all indications it seems that we have likely tightened credit more than the rest of the industry has. And so absent that tightening, we may be performing even better. But we've made those moves to ensure that we're positioned defensively as we continue to monitor what's going on and then we'll figure out what the right move \u2013 what the right next move is from here. And then as it relates to the customer source of vehicles, I think neither of the 70%, which was the percentage of cars that we are buying relative to number of cars that we are selling, nor the 40%, which is the percentage of cars that we're selling to customers that were previously bought from customers. Neither of those numbers were our long-term goals. And both of those numbers were on steep positive trajectories heading into this. We did pause purchasing through all channels except for customer trade-ins, early in this cycle. And so that will clearly push down that 70% number, just directly because we're not buying cars, we are selling cars that just kind of mechanically drops at least in a transitory way. And then the 40% number is a function of, when we turn purchasing back on what ratio of purchasing is coming from customers versus what is coming from other sources. And I think that there is uncertainty in what that ratio will be in the near-term, in the medium-term. And long-term we would expect it to go back to where it was before and to continue to decline because buying cars from customers is the most fundamental, the most economic source of cars that there is. And so that's where you want to be buying cars. Given the dramatic moves in the market, buying cars from customers is effectively happening in a much less liquid market where you have a single seller selling a single car once every many years, whereas the wholesale markets are much more liquid. And so if you have rapid price disruptions, those wholesale markets tend to virtually instantaneously adapt to that new environment; whereas the consumer market tends to be a little stickier both directions. And so we will be monitoring both of those markets. And getting a sense of where the better market is to acquire inventory in the near-term. But in the medium and long-term, our expectations would be to march back to where we were and continue from there. I think the auctions are functions fairly normally, again, in the sense that you can buy and sell cars and the volume is on the order of half of what it would have likely otherwise been if it weren't for all of this. Prior to this, the majority of buyers to many of the larger auction houses were already buying cars online. And so many, many more buyers have moved to buying cars online, but the auctions are functioning. And so I don't think that is a fundamental limiter to moving back to whatever levels we would like to in terms of acquisitions. I think the thing that we want to be careful about is our expectations for what's going to happen to prices. Prices have stabilized and started to recover. But there are still reasons to believe that prices could drop again. There are many sellers that sellers or shadow sellers that are out there that have not moved inventory yet. And so we want to be mindful of watching that carefully and getting a sense of what that's going to do to the market. And so that's something we're keeping a careful eye on. And that's part of why we've made the decision to manage our inventory levels down and reduce our exposure there. Now the opportunity is also extraordinarily large because the wholesale market has dropped pretty significantly in most recent weeks down probably on the order of about 12%. And the retail markets have only dropped a couple percent. So the implied wholesale retail spread is much, much wider on the order of 9% wider than it normally is. And that does generate a lot of opportunity because it suggests that there are much larger margins that are normally available for the taking there. And so we're trying to balance the risks with the upside opportunity and I think all that coming together into our strategy that we've been discussing on the call. I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call. We really appreciate it. And then I also want to turn to team Carvana out there in telephone lines. Thank you to all of you for the job you've done over the last six weeks. We have crammed so much into that very short period. Everyone's been working unbelievably hard. The results speak for themselves. We've made tremendous, tremendous strides in the business and that's 100% because of how hard you guys are all working. So I truly can't thank you enough. It's admirable and we really, really appreciate it. Let's keep fighting through the rest of this. We're in a great spot. Thank you everyone."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Q1 was a strong quarter for Carvana in light of the extreme disruption to our nation, industry and company brought on by COVID-19. Retail units sold in Q1 totaled 52,427, an increase of 43%. Total revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of 45%. Both of these numbers reflect significant gains in market share, which are continuing through April and the first week of May. Total gross profit per unit was $2,640 in Q1, an increase of $232. Our growth in GPU was driven by strong retail GPU, which increased $299 to $1,581, our highest ever driven primarily by buying cars from customers. Wholesale GPU was $23, a reduction of $60, primarily impacted by declines in industry-wide wholesale prices in late Q1. Other GPU was $1,036, a decrease of $8. This included a $97 reduction in finance GPU to $528, offset by an $89 increase in ancillary products to $508. In March, we completed our first non-prime securitization and sold our prime loans that were originally intended to be part of our two shelves securitization program under our existing forward flow agreement. While lower than recent quarters, we believe our Q1 finance GPU demonstrates the resilience of our finance platform during an extremely volatile period. EBITDA margin was negative 12.6% in Q1, a decrease from negative 7.8%. EBITDA margin was significantly impacted by the reduction in demand brought on by COVID-19 during a key selling period in March. In addition, EBITDA margin in Q1 was impacted by 2.4 percentage points or $26 million due to COVID-19 related non-cash adjustments to asset carrying values that we do not expect to recur in future periods. In late Q1, we took several measures to better align our expenses with customer demand. Following the spread of COVID-19, we immediately paused discretionary growth investments including new hiring, travel and new facilities and IT investments. We also made the prudent, but difficult decisions to rebalance staffing and marketing to better match demand. Although we made these decisions early and quickly, lower volume outweighed the expense reductions and led to a 4.6% increase in SG&A as a percent of revenue. In light of the uncertainty generated by COVID-19, our expansion strategy has shifted to one that prioritizes risk reduction while also ensuring that we are prepared for growth when a normalized environment returns. We have paused acquiring new inspection and reconditioning centers and vending machines. However, we are continuing construction on IRCs that were already in process and that have existing sale leaseback agreements in place. Additionally, due to the positive customer response to our touchless delivery offering, we plan to open many smaller markets that could be served by our existing logistics and delivery infrastructure with limited incremental investment. Following quarter-end, we completed a registered direct offering of 13.3 million shares, raising $600 million and bringing our total liquidity resources on April 1st to over $1 billion. These liquidity resources provide us with significant flexibility to operate our business under a wide range of operating and macroeconomics scenarios. In addition, we upsized and extended our existing forward flow agreement with Ally providing additional flexibility to serve our customers. We expect 169 million on a fully exchange basis shares in Q2. As we look forward, we're focused on positioning the business to be lean and flexible as we march toward our long-term goals. Thank you for your attention. We will now take questions. So, perhaps you're referencing the change in the filing deadline from [Technical Difficulty] 15 to July 15th. I think that could have some impact on customer behavior. We did see some tax refund, certainly come through before COVID-19, really came into force in the U.S. in Q1. But I think that any impacts from the shift in the deadline from April to July, I would think would just be very much melded in with the probably much bigger impacts that come from shelter-in-place orders being lifted, consumers starting to get out there and spend again. I think it will be hard to disentangle those impacts. And so I \u2013 and I actually think that COVID impacts well. We'll win out over any impacts related to the tax deadline shift. Sure. Yes. So the largest expense callout is the adjustment to asset carrying values totaled about $26 million that I alluded to in my prepared remarks. That was really split between two things. The larger portion was related to adjustments in the valuation of finance receivable related assets that we hold on our balance sheet, obviously the end of March, which is when we do that evaluation was a very turbulent time in financial markets. And so we took an adjustment to some finance receivable related assets that we hold on the balance sheet. The second largest category was we did observe toward the end of March, significant changes in the wholesale trading prices of used vehicles. And then we also saw a significant reduction in demand, which changed some of our expectations about the number of days to sale that we expected to experience in our retail business. And so when taking both of those things into consideration, we made some adjustments to our inventory value and that some of those totaled $26 million. So that was a very large impact on the expense side. In terms of SG&A, I think the two biggest places where we saw an impact were really in advertising per car sold and compensation and benefits per car sold. The way to think about both of those is, you know, Q4 and then early Q1 or the first couple months of Q1 is a big investment period for us as we invest in staffing and invest in marketing in preparation for one of the busiest times of the year, which is tax season. And so, this year we made those significant investments, but then demand in March was nothing like what we anticipated for obvious reasons related to COVID-19. And so, we certainly saw elevated levels of compensation and benefits and advertising expense per unit relative to what we otherwise would have expected. We also saw elevated levels on a per unit basis and the other expense line items, but those were the biggest two. Sure. Yes. So we certainly expect declines on a per car sold basis in those SG&A line items. I think where does that come from? I think a big part of the expected decline on a per unit basis is the response that we've taken to COVID-19. So in Q1, we were in a period where we were significantly investing. March is often one of our best, if not our best month of the year, which is a common in the used car industry. And so, we were investing really significantly in advance of expected busy season. And when that busy season didn't materialize, obviously, that had a significant impact on our expenses per car sold that were ultimately realized in the quarter. Of course, we do expect as I alluded to through the actions that we've taken for per car sold expenses to decline in Q2. Yes, that was that \u2013 that $17 million is part of the $26 million. That's the larger portion that I was referencing earlier and then that that $17 million is related to these financial receivable related assets. The biggest part of that is retained beneficial interest in securitizations. And then there's a portion that's another finance receivable asset bonus payment essentially. Or at least the medium term. Sure. I'll take the question on wholesale GPU. So we don't expect any of the adjustments that we talked about earlier to recur in future periods. However, I do think it's reasonable to assume that wholesale GPU will be lower than a normalized level in Q2. I think there's still an awful lot of uncertainty around how exactly the wholesale market is going to evolve from here. I think we started to see some volume come back but certainly not at normalized levels yet. And so I think, we'll see what happens in the market. But there's certainly a lot of uncertainty right now. And I think a reasonable expectation is that Q2 will be lower than normalized levels. Sure. Yes. So I think I'll start with Q2. And I think maybe a way to summarize some of the directional things that you should be keeping in mind as it relates to that question. And a lot of these we've hit on, on this call so far. So we do expect GPU to drop somewhat meaningfully from Q1 to Q2 as a result of some of the dynamics that we were talking about earlier on this call, particularly in retail GPU. I think we also expect expenses per unit to meaningfully drop going from Q1 to Q2. And there \u2013 I think just to give a rough ballpark of order of magnitude dropping down to sort of second half 2019 levels on a SG&A per car sold. And then we think the combination of those two things will certainly lead to reduced EBITDA dollar losses in Q2. And then we would expect things getting better from there as well."

And now with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. 2021 was an extraordinary year for Carvana, full of landmark accomplishments along our path to achieving -- changing the way people buy and sell cars. We started the year being named to the Fortune 500, tied to the third fastest company ever to do so. We sold our one millionth car through organic growth faster than any other automotive retailer in history. We had our first positive earnings quarter. We had our first positive EBITDA year, excluding onetime items, and we became the fastest growing e-commerce company in US history. While I'm extremely excited and proud of the team for that blockbuster list of accomplishments, I'm even more excited about the fact that we were also named the top 10 of Forbes Best Large Employers to Work For list. We're ranked ahead of any other retail company and ahead of any other technology company. That set of accomplishments can only be achieved with a clear customer focused mission and enormously scaled opportunity and the compounding that results from the efforts of great people who care are directed toward long-term value creation. Thank you to everyone inside Carvana for always choosing to care and for always giving that little extra effort that adds up to make a huge difference. We've always framed our opportunity simply. Customers desire the experience we provide for them, providing it is hard. There are approximately 40 million used cars sold every year in the US. The unit economics of the industry viewed over any reasonable time frame have been stable for a long time. That unit economic stability at the industry level is structurally driven by the fact that there are tens of thousands of dealers out there providing customers with similar customer experiences and who share similar cost structures. That simple frame is clarifying. To achieve our goals, we must continue to deliver great customer experiences, we must continue to differentiate our unit economics, and we must continue to scale. That is our path. In alignment with that path, we are extremely excited to announce the acquisition of ADESA's US operations. ADESA is the nation's second largest auction company with 56 locations, completing about 1 million auction transactions a year. This acquisition has four primary justifications. Number one, it solidifies our path to becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. Number two, it provides us with a nationwide inspection center network that we estimate will increase our production capacity by approximately 2 million units per year when fully built out. Number three, it substantially improves our logistics network. Demonstrating the breadth of these locations, we will move from currently having inspection centers within 200 miles of 56% of the US population to eventually being within 200 miles of 94% of the US population. Demonstrating the quality of these locations, we will move from being within 50 miles of 16% of the US population to being within 50 miles of 58% of the population. This will reduce shipping times to our customers nationwide and lays the foundation for eventually offering same-day delivery to many of our customers. Number four, it significantly increases our auction capabilities and kick starts or deepens our relationships with many large and important players in the automotive industry. We look forward to working with our new customers to creatively finding new and interesting ways to work together and to valuing them in the same way we have always valued all of our customers. We also expect ADESA to accelerate our path to our long-term financial model, given the many powerful benefits that derive from being closer to our customers. For perspective of how powerful proximity can be, sales that are delivered to customers from an inspection center within 200 miles of our customers today have unit economics that are about $750 better than our average transaction as a result of lower inbound costs, lower delivery costs and higher conversion rates leading to lower customer acquisition expense. Now, I'd like to turn briefly to the current environment. Starting in the late fourth quarter, we, like everyone else, were hit pretty hard by the Omicron variant. At different points in time, we had up to 30% of our people in various operational teams simultaneously called out. It is obviously very difficult to deal with in any system. But in systems that relay on changed activity like our inspection centers and our logistics network, it is even more difficult. This led to the most severe logistics network constraints we have seen in our history. While we are largely out of the Omicron wave, it takes time to work out of our backlogs, and this year's severe winter storms have slowed our progress. Today, we remain severely constrained, but we're working hard to work through it as soon as we possibly can. These constraints, paired with the recent rapid appreciation of vehicle prices as well as rapid increase in interest rates, have colluded to make this a challenging time. While this has undoubtedly been complex operationally, as our team has in the past, they are rising to the challenge. We've managed to grow our inventory available to our customers. We've grown our operational capacity to handle more volumes throughout our operating groups in anticipation of alleviating our logistics constraints and in anticipation of tax season and we have made changes to the mix of cars we are purchasing and reconditioning to help our customers find more affordable cars despite the car pricing environment. And our long-term indicators continue to look incredible. In our oldest cohort, we are now up to 3.5% market penetration. This may not sound like much at first, but if we apply that nationwide, it extrapolates to about $1.4 million annual sales. On top of that, our oldest cohort grew by 50% in the last year and, therefore, clearly has a long way to go. Lastly, 95% of our 311 markets are ramping faster than our 2013 cohort was at the same time in its life. Two million-plus car sales per year is no longer the goal, we're aiming higher. We have the team, the business model and the ambition to do it. The march continues. Mark?\nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to report another year of strong growth in both retail unit sales and revenue. Revenue totaled $12.8 billion, an increase of 129%, and retail units sold totaled 425,237, an increase of 74%, making us the fastest used automotive retailer to sell over 400,000 vehicles in one year. For the fourth quarter, retail units sold totaled 113,016, an increase of 57%. Total revenue was $3.8 billion, an increase of 105%. Our exceptional growth in 2021 was driven by rapid growth within our market cohorts. In Q4, our 2013 through 2020 cohorts grew retail units sold by 52%, and our oldest cohort of Atlanta grew by 51% to 3.53% market penetration. As of Q4 2021, 95% of our 311 markets are ramping faster than Atlanta was at the same age, and record numbers of markets are crossing key market penetration thresholds. In 2021, we completed our eighth consecutive year of $400 or more GPU improvement, our eighth consecutive year of EBITDA margin leverage and our first full year of positive EBITDA margin, excluding one-time items. Total gross profit per unit for the year was 4,537. Our growth in GPU in 2021 was broad-based, including increases of $166 in retail, $308 in wholesale and $811 in other. Total GPU in Q4 was 4,566, an increase of 1,187 year-over-year. Year-over-year changes in GPU were driven by gains across all components in Q4 as well. Retail GPU increased by $230 in Q4, primarily driven by an increase in the percentage of retail vehicles sourced from customers, partially offset by higher reconditioning costs and higher wholesale acquisition prices. Wholesale GPU increased by $441, driven by gains in buying vehicles from customers and wholesale market appreciation. Other GPU increased by $516, driven by strong finance execution and higher industry-wide vehicle prices on average loan as an additional impact. In Q4, EBITDA margin was negative 2.5%, including a 0.6% impact from one-time items, an improvement of 1.4%, reflecting gains in both GPU and SG&A leverage. We ended the year with $2.3 billion in total liquidity resources, giving us significant flexibility to execute our plan. Today, we also announced that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire ADESA's U.S. physical auction business. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022 and will be financed with $3.275 billion in committed debt financing to fund the $2.2 billion purchase price and an additional $1 billion in improvements across the 56 sites. Upon development of these 56 sites, we are expected to unlock approximately 2 million units of incremental annual production capacity at full utilization. This year, we made significant progress scaling our vehicle production capacity. In 2021, we added three inspection and reconditioning centers, increasing our total IRC count to 14. Following year-end, we also opened our 15th IRC near Cincinnati, Ohio, bringing our total capacity at full utilization to approximately 880,000 units as of February 24. We remain on track to open six additional IRCs by the end of 2022. We plan to open five of these on schedule, leading to more than 1.2 million units of annual capacity at full utilization at year-end. And with our acquisition of ADESA U.S., we are currently evaluating our preferred time line on opening the sixth. In 2021, we also opened 45 new markets, bringing our year end total to 311. With these new market openings, we now serve 81% of the total US population, up from 74% at the end of 2020. We will continue to expand in 2022 and continue to expect to serve 95% of the US population over time. As we look toward 2022, we expect another strong year on retail units sold, revenue, GPU and EBITDA margin. We expect to grow retail units sold to over 550,000 for the full year. Following the first quarter, in Q2 through Q4 taken in aggregate, we expect total GPU over 4,000 and approximately breakeven EBITDA margin. We expect the first quarter to be impacted by supply chain challenges brought on by the Omicron variant and severe winter storms and the recent rapid increase in short-term interest rates. We expect these effects to have a significant impact on Q1 total GPU and SG&A per retail unit sold, leading to an expected EBITDA margin loss in the mid single-digit range. Since becoming a public company nearly five years ago, we have made tremendous progress toward our long-term goals and achieved many major milestones such as achieving our first profitable quarter this year. We're excited about what comes next Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nZach Fadem: Hi. Good afternoon. So over the second half of 2021, your business had been averaging roughly 8,600 unit sales per week. And this number is obviously constrained by a host of factors that appear to have worsened in January. But now that you've opened up two new facilities and a few more on the way in the upcoming months, can you talk about how this weekly run rate should change as the new capacity comes on and how this dynamic fits into the 2022 unit outlook?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So what I would say, I think the primary driver is going to be how quickly we can alleviate the constraints in logistics network. Yes, as I said in my prepared remarks, Omicron really set us back. The logistics network is a system where many drivers connect in order to deliver a car to a customer. And at kind of the peak of the Omicron wave, we did have very high call-out rates, and that made it hard for those connections to occur and then set us back and got us a bit behind. And then I think we've been working hard. The team has done a great job trying to catch up. We've got a really strong network when it's fully functioning that should enable us to catch up relatively quickly. But we've also been hit by a number of winter storms as recently as this week, we are hit by another one. And those storms definitely set us back again. So I think when you look at the remainder of this year, I think the primary driver right now is our logistics network, which is much more constrained than any other part of the business. And then I think from there, it's about catching up and then it's about figuring out where we are for the remainder of the year. Right now, the logistics network is absolutely constraining sales. We have also seen car price appreciation that was pretty meaningful in the back half of Q4. And then, we've seen interest rates go up quite a bit as well. And so we don't feel like the impact of that has been that severe on us just yet because we've been kind of impacted by the logistics network constraints, and that's really what's holding us back. But we have seen industry-wide sales drop by kind of 15% to 20% relative to 2019 or 2021, depending on where your reference point is. And so we're taking that all into account and trying to put together our outlook of 550,000 units, and that's what underlies that?\nZach Fadem: So Ernie, just to be clear, should we assume that the average weekly units in Q1 is below Q4 and then improves sequentially throughout the year?\nErnie Garcia: So I think we're going to stick with what we've got in the outlook in terms of specificity. I do think Q1 is going to be a tougher quarter. That's just the way it's going to unfold. We've been heavily constrained, and that's going to show up in the volume. It's also \u2013 in the inspection centers that were hit really heavily in Q4 with Omicron, they were still able to produce a lot of cars because we built a lot of inspection centers and built out a very strong capability there. But the efficiency certainly went down, and that will show up and impacts the COGS. So I think those impacts will show up in Q1, and that's why we're trying to guide to Q1 to provide kind of clarity there. And then we expect to emerge from that and look forward to a really strong Q2 through Q4.\nOperator: The next question will come from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi. Good afternoon. I got excited when I heard Zach. I don't know if you got that just \u2013 on the ADESA acquisition, can you talk about the buy versus build kind of analysis you went through there, what you assumed for the attrition potentially of customers of ADESA as they might not want to kind of line your pockets, some of them? And then the $1 billion in improvements, on unlocking the $2 million in incremental capacity, what's kind of a reasonable time line to get there?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, I think, first of all, as you can imagine, we're extremely excited about this acquisition. We're extremely excited to welcome the team. We think it's a pretty incredible fit. I think whenever businesses come together, you always talk about all the synergies and all the things that you hope to occur. But I think what's so great about this one is it's very clear to see how we fit together. They've got an unbelievable footprint of 56 locations around the country, in great locations that are very close to our customers. You add up those locations, it's over 4,000 acres. For perspective, if you add up all of our inspection centers today, it's probably close to around 1,000 acres. So a really meaningful increase and just kind of the physical infrastructure that we will have access to. That obviously means incredible things for what we can do from a reconditioning perspective, both in terms of volume where we expect to get 2 million units, plus incrementally out of there versus our existing capacity once we fully ramp it up, and then also from a location perspective because we can deliver cars to customers where we'll be much closer to them. So I think that's really exciting. And then we also think the business is a great fit. We've often used this mental model of \u2013 the entire used market is basically a big machine with lots of players that helps customer's trade cars with one another. And there's all kinds of players inside that system. There's dealers, there's finance companies, auctions are a really big player inside that system. And when we talk about vertical integration, what we generally mean is we want to be as big a part of that system as we can be so that we can cut out as much expense and difficulty is possible for customers that are trading cars. And we think working together with ADESA is really interesting strategically for that reason as well. When we think about build versus buy, it's actually a fairly straightforward analysis that you can kind of walk through in that same kind of framework. And I think the simplest way to think about it is just with respect to our inspection centers. I think in order for us to get similar production capacity out of inspection centers that we would build, we would expect to need to build on the order of 30 inspection centers. And we would expect that cost to be pretty high. We would especially expect it to be pretty high when you look at the locations that we're picking up through this ADESA acquisition. They've got many locations on the West Coast, they got many locations in the Northeast, in areas of the country that are very expensive in dollars, but also very expensive in time in terms of how long it takes to find those locations and get them zoned and get them build out, and get them operational. So we think that from a build versus buy perspective, with just that simple analysis, you're probably pretty close -- you're probably very close actually. And then we get the instantaneous logistics benefits and access to this great business. So we're really excited about it and just think it lays a very clear path to the future. I talked a bit in my opening about our oldest cohort of Atlanta now being up to 3.5% market share. And we think that's really important in this context because it does just very clearly light the path to 1.4 million units that you can just kind of see as long as we execute. And then beyond that, you know that you have the 50% growth that is continuing to happen inside of Atlanta. We don't know exactly where that growth is going to compound out over the next many years. But I think if you look at other businesses that are growing even at rates materially slower than 50% and look out five or 10 years, you'll generally see businesses that grow by a pretty significant multiple to where they sit at that point in time. And so we think that lights the path to volume. We think if you look at the unit economics, we just had our best GPU year ever, which is extremely exciting. But I think every bit is exciting. We've been marched up year after year after year very consistently. We've been supporting all this growth and all the investments we've been making, and we've been marching up our EBITDA margin to the point we had our first positive earnings quarter and our first positive EBITDA year, excluding one-time adjustments. So when you put all that together and then you lay that on top of this footprint that we're going to get access to, that we think is acquired at a cost that is very reasonable relative to what it would cost to build out and then comes so much faster and with so many other great assets and opportunities, we basically just think that this is even more clearly an execution game from here. And so now the ball is in our hands, and we got to run with it. And we're extremely excited to be in that spot, because this is a really big opportunity and the path has never been clearer.\nOperator: The next question will come from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMichael Montani: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about if you can help to tease out a little bit the impact of the higher used car prices and rates vis-\u00e0-vis some of the impact you saw to being able to process the vehicles in the quarter? And kind of how you see that playing out over the course of the year? And then I just had a follow-up on costs.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So I think if we are digging into the first quarter, I think there are a number of different impacts. And I think I would start with Omicron in particular, which is going to have a meaningful impact on our retail cost of goods sold in Q1. And Ernie touched on some of the reasons for that. It's really about the efficiency of the inspection and reconditioning centers and then, in this case, with Omicron it's really been about the logistics network as well. And so we're expecting to see higher reconditioning costs and higher inbound transport costs that we expect to have a meaningful impact on retail GPU in Q1. I think, as it relates to the rapid rise in short-term interest rates, I think what we\u2019ve seen over the last few months is, a relatively historic rise in terms of the magnitude and the speed, I think you have to go back basically 10 to 15 years to the Global Financial Crisis to see anything like this. And so, because we typically will offer a customer rate and then there's some lag time between when we offer that rate and we monetize our loans, that rapid rise will impact other GPU in Q1. Now, we have raised rates following the benchmark moves, and we're also -- we've scaled up our hedges to lessen the impact of future rate changes, but there will be a transitory impact there on Q1. So I would call out those effects, I think, clearly had severe weather, as Ernie mentioned, as well in Q1, we should be having an impact. So those are a number of things that are impacting Q1. I think when we take a broader view, obviously, we're very excited about the progress in the business, made tremendous progress in 2021. I expect to be over 4,000 GPU for the Q2 through Q4 in total. And so, I think we're feeling really good about our overall progress.\nMichael Montani: Okay. And then if I could, just on the behavior of your consumer as it relates to the credit side, we're seeing some signs of normalization in some of the filings as well as from some competitors. So just wanted to get some added color from you all about the credit behaviors that you are seeing in terms of delinquencies and charge-offs and kind of how to think about that evolution, as we get further beyond stimulus payments.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, I guess, I would start with -- again, like the way that our business model operates is, we generally sell that credit risk off at the time that we complete our securitizations through the sale of the residual asset, kind of, as well as the underlying bonds. And so that doesn't flow directly through our financial statements. We kind of neither benefited from the extremely strong performance over the last couple of years, nor would we necessarily get directly impacted if performance were to get worse in the future, outside of kind of the expectations for future losses that would be kind of priced into any bonds that we sell. So that doesn't kind of directly flow through our financial statements just for clarity. I think what we're generally seeing is, the same thing that the industry is seeing, which is, I think there is some approaching of normalization of consumer credit behavior. It still, on average, is better than historical, if we define historically as kind of normal times pre-2019. But it's not better by as much as it was better in kind of mid-2020 through maybe mid-2021 where performance was unbelievable. So I think there may be some normalization of those trends, but it's been, I would say, very orderly so far. And I don't think there's any reason to expect something different just yet.\nMichael Montani: Thanks for taking the question.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Chris Bottiglieri with Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nChris Bottiglieri: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So first one -- so ADESA already got title processing and fund clearing for dealers. How does the title processing compare for dealer-to-dealer transactions versus dealer to consumer? I'm trying to get at, are there synergies somehow that where this makes you more efficient on processing titles out of your core business? Like, are you able to utilize their people, or is the process completely different? And then, I have a follow-up.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So as a start, I would say, it's a simpler process, generally speaking, doing dealer to dealer transfers. And so I think you can think about those processes as existing pretty independently. Certainly, our teams will share learnings that we found over the years, and there may be some benefits there. But generally speaking, I think the simplest way to think about that is separate. Now because you brought it up, I do think the registration team and title team inside Carvana definitely deserves a shout-out. They've done an unbelievable job over the last probably six months or so, making a lot of progress. We're now kind of approaching similar levels of success in entitlement registration to what we are experiencing pre-pandemic. So I think that, that's really exciting, and that's hard to do in this environment. So there's a lot of great things going on there. They're working very well with our partners in the various DMVs to make sure that we make the customer experience as simple as possible. So I think we're excited about the progress we're making there. And then I think on the ADESA front, we plan to continue operating that business as we have, or as ADESA has, over a very long period of time. So for all the people inside ADESA, it will be business as usual, and they'll continue to handle their title processing in the wholesale business the way that they have.\nChris Bottiglieri: Got you. Okay. follow-up question is, I think you -- I'm not sure I heard this correctly, but I think you said the logistics benefit would be pretty instantaneous. I'm not sure if I heard that correctly. And then two, you're already using auction companies for reconditioning prior to the acquisition. So my question is, on day one, can these facilities handle reconditioning for you and your partners, or do you need to make that -- do you need to deploy some of that $1 billion to recondition any cars?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, I appreciate you clarifying because I want to make sure that we don't generate too high of expectations instantaneously. I think probably that language you're referring to, we instantaneously spin to an incredible network that will enable us to build a very meaningful reconditioning capacity and significantly improved logistic capabilities. That will take time. And I think we're not planning to provide precise time lines on any of that just yet, but we certainly have plans and our teams will be hustling to get as much benefit from that as we possibly can as soon as possible.\nChris Bottiglieri: Got you. And the Manheim...\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So yes, so we do partner with both Manheim and ADESA on third-party reconditioning. I do think that offers some capabilities. But again, I think we'll stay away from giving too precise of guidance there.\nOperator: The next question will come from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good afternoon. So my additional question is on the ADESA acquisition. First off, congratulations. There may be a bit of a follow-up to some of the prior questions. But just want to understand the kind of mechanics here. So the ADESA facilities you're acquiring, when all said and done, will they act just like an IRC that you built organically? Are they going to function the same, or is there some type of relationship where the ADESA facilities will operate differently than the degree for IRCs?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think a good starting point is they will operate largely as kind of 2 businesses on the same land is maybe a good and simple way to think about it. We've got our inspection center capabilities, and we've got our logistics capabilities that we've built out over time. And so I think we can go and we can kind of place those on these 4,000 acres of land around the country and operate them very similarly to the way that we historically have. And then I think the auction can continue to run the way they historically has as well, so it will be business as usual sort of for both sides. The place where we will be working together very quickly is in the retail recon work that ADESA does. We'll be working to kind of merge those teams together. So, that's kind of the single place of integration or at least the most important place of the integration, between us. And then part of why this is such a great fit is there's kind of a secular and cyclical trend going on with auctions where, secularly, many more components of auction transactions are happening digitally even though there's a very large desire by many customers, both buyers and sellers, to go actually transact in person. And that often means that cars can spend less time on the ground at auctions, meaning that their space can be utilized in other ways. And then cyclically, we're at a time where auction volume is very low, historically low, in fact. And so that means there's a lot of excess land at these locations -- the average location is less than 50% utilized today, meaning there's a lot of opportunity for us to work together and for these functions to coexist. So, again, we think the path that this lays for us is very, very clear and now we need to just go execute. And I think that's our job for the next many years to take full advantage of this opportunity.\nOperator: The next question will come from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRajat Gupta: Great. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the deal. Maybe a question on metering. You talked about that on the last earnings call. Where are we with that exercise? Are you still leaning to meter sales? Maybe if you could comment on how you are with respect to labor or logistics bottlenecks today. And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, the specific way that we 'metered' demand last quarter was in suppressing the amount of inventory that was visible to customers. That tool is still being utilized today to a very similar degree, in fact, given the logistics network constraints that we see. So, we are continuing to utilize that tool. That means that the inventory growth that we've seen that, I think, is evidence of the great work our team has done to expand our production capabilities is not really flowing through to customers yet in the form of as much growth in kind of available inventory. So, we are very focused on alleviating the constraints in our logistics network and once we do that, we have the ability to make more of that inventory visible to more customers, which is something we look forward to being able to do.\nRajat Gupta: Understood. And then the comments in the shareholder letter around the second quarter to fourth quarter normalization on some of the metrics, is getting to the 550,000 units for the year assuming that some of these bottlenecks go away? And is it primarily capacity-driven as well? And maybe if you could comment on just the demand aspect. You mentioned that the low-end consumer is seeing a bit of an impact due to the pricing environment. Do you expect a normalization in terms of demand from that consumer segment as well in order to successfully hit the 550,000 number? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, again, I think we want to be careful about giving too much kind of guidance on guidance. But what I'll say is what basically underlies our expectations for the year is that we do resolve the constraints that we see in the logistics network and then the demand environment, for the industry in total, remains somewhat similar to what it looks like today. And so I think that's basically what's underneath our expectations. As I said, I think today, we have -- we're part of the industry. So when there's affordability impacts to the industry, that's going to impact us as well. But given how constrained we are, it's probably not impacting us as much as it might be impacting the rest of the industry. But we have seen sales slow down quite a bit industry-wide as car prices went up and interest rates went up and that impacted affordability. And so depending on what your comparison period is, sales look like they're down in the industry, 15% to 20%, give or take, on the used side. And then we do see some evidence of that in our data as well. While our sales are largely driven today by the logistics network and not by the demand environment, the demand environment still flows through to the sales that you realize. And so if you look through at our customers that are making less than $50,000, for example, they're growing about 30% slower than the company is year-to-date. If you look at customers making $100,000 or more, they're growing about 30% faster than the company is year-to-date. And normally, when you kind of do any reasonable kind of demographic cuts, you tend to see similar growth across all these different consumer segments. And so I think that pretty clearly shows the impact that affordability has had on consumers, on lower FICO consumers and lower income consumers and younger consumers. It's kind of showing up in the data. So we're assuming that, that environment will remain somewhat similar. We would actually hope for a decreasing price environment. There's a lot of potential impacts that would result from that. But most importantly, it would improve affordability for customers and most likely drive more customers to a place where they're ready to buy again. And so we think that, that is probably what we're hoping for, but our outlook assumes kind of a similar macro environment to what we see today.\nOperator: The next question will come from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please go ahead. \nColin Sebastian: All right. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So a couple of follow-ups. I guess, first, curious if you could add some color in terms of unit sales and profit trends here later in February versus what you were seeing earlier in the quarter with Omicron, if that's part of what's giving you the visibility into the material improvement expected beginning in Q2. And then, Ernie, just on what you said right there around pricing and a lower price environment you think would sort of be a favorable trend, in terms of embedding the current macro environment and the outlook, how would a faster declining pricing environment impact the guidance that you gave? Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think a lot of these impacts we can start to see through, right? So the first quarter is going to be tough for a number of reasons. I think we'll start with Omicron and the inspection centers. That just flows through in COGS. In kind of smaller COVID waves earlier on, we saw impacts on the order of $150 to $200 that flowed through COGS. This was a bigger and more severe wave, right? So that then means that the inspection centers are less efficient. And so those costs get spread onto cars. And then when those cars sell, it shows up in lower margins. But as you kind of move through Omicron, the inspection centers are starting to recover, and so you can already get visibility into the direction that COGS is heading there. We still have some work to do, but you can get visibility. I think interest rates, as Mark said earlier, moved really quickly. And when they move that quickly, we tend to do our securitizations toward the end of the quarter. And so the originations that we had earlier in the quarter, where they were originated in a different environment, are expected to have a different spread and then you see that impact as well. And so that can kind of flow through there. And so I think when we look at margins on the cars themselves, we've also recently seen a little bit, for the first time in a while, of car price reduction. So we've seen kind of wholesale prices drop by maybe something like 5% for, say, 2019 model year cars year-to-date. We've seen retail prices drop by maybe 2%. And so we can start to see as well, while car prices started to reduce, that at least little cohort of cars, the margins there look potentially a little bit better despite the fact that car prices are dropping. So I think that, that's helpful in giving us visibility beyond Q1 as well. And then from a units perspective, it's really all about, or at least primarily about, alleviating constraints in our logistics network. And then from there, it's going to be about what does affordability look like. And I think it's hard to know exactly what's going to happen over the next 12 months with car prices or with interest rates. I think your guess is as good as ours there. But car prices going down is, all else constant, helpful for sales; interest rates going down, all else constant, helpful. The reverse is the opposite. And then from a margin active, I think it's actually unclear how that cuts because, generally speaking, margins are driven by kind of the gap between wholesale and retail prices. And so it's all about how those two markets move in relation to one another. So I think we have pretty solid visibility into the next several quarters from where we are because a lot of these impacts, you can already see starting to abate a bit.\nOperator: The next question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, Ernie. So look, in our discussions with clients, including right after the results, people are really concerned about two main things, right, growth and liquidity. Let me take this just one at a time, one question for you, Ernie. On growth, if I do this math, if I take your fourth quarter, or frankly, even your third quarter retail units, and I annualize them, I would get to around 450,000 units. So your guide on retail for this year is about 22% above kind of the annualization of either the third or fourth quarter, give or take. You hit me, Ernie? And I think we agree that the second half of last year was capacity constrained, and you're still experiencing those constraints now, but you anticipate those would get better. So you're only guiding to 22% growth on what should be, over the balance of 2022, less capacity constraints than we've seen, let's say, in the fourth quarter. So adjusted for capacity constraint, your growth is well below 22% in your guide, maybe 10% or 15%. And that's a big change from what people were thinking about, 30% growth not too long ago. So is you're citing logistics and price shock, I just don't know -- it's just people are left with not much visibility on when the logistics get better. You see it in real time what kind of metrics can you watch out for in terms of people or the size of that logistics pipe so we can determine whether this is an industry growth scare or a Carvana-specific thing?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. What I would say is, I mean, from a demand perspective, we're very confident. I think you saw all the kind of market penetration growth, the number of markets that crossed over all these different lines. You saw our average cohort grew by 50% last year. Atlanta grew by 50%. It's our oldest cohort and there's a lot of signals there that are very clear. If you look at website traffic, which -- website traffic is not a perfect top-funnel metric, because in website traffic quality can vary, but it's at least a reasonable top-funnel metric, we continue to see extremely fast growth there. So I think what's driving our forecast is exactly what we said, the first thing we have to do that's Carvana specific is we have to alleviate the constraints in our logistics network. And then that will sort of get us to a baseline where we see where we are. We are subject to the conditions of the industry. And so I think when we look at the industry today, and we see that many retailers are down between 15% and 20%, which we attribute to these affordability issues, we're taking that into account when we think about where things are likely to head for the remainder of the year. And so that's what's built in.\nAdam Jonas: Got it. Ernie, just a follow-up on liquidity. Listen -- and we've seen this with other companies like Tesla from the past two, where kind of you get -- the market can get ahead of itself and your capacity for growth is kind of higher than what you're bringing in. I'm getting questions daily. Is this Peloton, is Carvana going to run out of money. Now, you\u2019ve got $2.3 billion liquidity. You\u2019ve got over three billion of used cars. You obviously got some great financing in place presumably with your financing partners for the acquisition. But just level set here, tell us why you're not running out of money or if you need money to kind of do what you're planning over this year, a, do you need it? And b, if you do, how much and how are you going to get it? Thanks, Ernie.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes, I can take that question. So at the end of the year, we had $2.3 billion in total liquidity resources. I think if you look at the way we used money in 2021, it was primarily investment in inventory and investment in finance platform assets. I think if you exclude inventory and finance platform assets, our cash flow from operating activities was only minus $82 million. That was a $200 million, approximately $200 million, improvement year-over-year. And so, I think the core business got to a point in 2021 where, again, like other than investments in inventory and investments in finance platform assets, it's really not using a lot of cash from operating activities. And so I think that's one important point to make. I think we view the investment in inventory as a very positive thing for the business, obviously. Investment in inventory increase selection for our customers, I think right now, we're actually metering visibility meaningfully. So we're not getting the full benefit of the investments that we've made in inventory so far. I think we're looking forward to the logistics network strengthening over time, coming off of these weather events and the impacts of Omicron, so that we can un-meter some of the limited visibility of the inventory and get even more benefits. But I think we feel really good about that. I think one of the things that's frequently missed about our liquidity and cash needs that, we are an automotive retailer that invests a lot in hard assets. We invest in inventory. We invest in finance platform assets, and we invest in real estate. Those are highly financeable assets using traditional sources of financing that match those assets, which we used extensively in the past and expect to use in the future. And so I think we feel really good about all of those elements of our business, and those are some of the key things to be thinking about.\nErnie Garcia: And then if I could jump in really quick too. I do think we were lucky enough to have a very strong last couple of years. And I think that sometimes we can get roped in as kind of a pandemic growth story because in those 2 years, we are a more visible company than we were prior. But that said, I think if you go back to 2017 when we went public, we were 1/10 the size that we are today. We grew on the order of 4x over the next 2-year period, pre-pandemic. And that growth was driven by the exact same forces that we expect our growth in the future to be driven by, which are these cohort curves and visibility into the future as long as we execute. So I think all these things will work themselves out. It's all going to become visible over time. But we feel like the visibility into demand is very clear. And then hopefully, that was a helpful answer for Mark on the cash front.\nOperator: The Next question will come from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. \nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot and good afternoon. I guess my question is around gross profit for you on the retail side in the first quarter and how we should think about that. What's embedded in your expectations on used car prices? If we see an even sharper drop in wholesale prices, or really retail prices, do you think that will have a more negative impact on your GP outlook?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So I mean I can tell you some of the key factors that are going into it. I think we've called them out previously on this call. I think the key factors are really going to be the COGS impact of Omicron and to a certain extent, weather on reconditioning costs and inbound logistics costs. I think that's going to be the biggest impact on retail GPU in Q1. And then we do think -- moving to wholesale, we are seeing higher depreciation rates in the wholesale market than we have seen in the past few quarters of 2021. And so we do expect that to have an impact on wholesale GPU in Q1. We expect it to be lower as a result of the higher depreciation rates than we've seen in previous quarters.\nSeth Basham: Thank you. And then my follow-up is your decision on build versus buy with ADESA. And you talked about the equivalent capacity of 36 IRCs with this acquisition, which is about $88 million per location, including the additional improvement costs. What does that compare to versus building an IRC? Obviously, you take into consideration the additional profit stream for their auction business. But can you help us frame that a little bit more?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. I think at a very high level, it's probably not very different. And the reason is that's more expensive than our historical average inspection center has been by a pretty decent amount. Our average inspection is, in the past, have probably been more like $40 million to $65 million or $70 million, something like that. But these locations are oftentimes in more expensive cities and also in more expensive parts of town. This footprint has been built over a 30-year period. And so a lot of it is infill location. It's a little bit closer to customers and a little bit closer to employment than many of the locations that we would build out today if we were going out and trying to find farmland, for example, and to build a greenfield. So again, I wouldn't want to be too precise there, but similar, when you're just evaluating it through the inspection center lens, it's probably not way off.\nOperator: The next question will come from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nMike Baker: Okay. Thanks. Yeah, I just wanted to follow up on Seth's question, maybe along the same lines. I mean, I think based on the slide presentation here the acquired company did $100 million in EBITDA. You're paying $2.2 billion, if you exclude the additional CapEx. That's about 22 times. There's got to be some synergies in there. So, I suppose the sort of conspicuous buy options in that you talked about synergies, but you don't quantify it. Any way you can quantify it, or give us some way to get to, if this is accretive, how accretive this is to earnings or when it would be accretive? If you take the $3.3 billion in debt and put a reasonable interest rate on that, you're probably going to get incremental interest at or above the $100 million in EBITDA. So, if you could give us some help with how to build this into our model in terms of accretion that would be great.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think, to be honest, I probably go about the analysis a pretty different way. I think, you can -- the EBITDA is present, but I think that, that's -- and it's important, and it represents the incredible business that's been built by ADESA over a long period of time. And I think that's an incredible asset that we're extremely excited to be getting. But I think, we also can think about it in terms of the value that will be created through our other kind of pillars of rationale for this. And so there is a large portion of the real estate that is owned by ADESA. That's a very valuable asset that can be added to this. And on that land, we can build these inspection centers. To the extent, -- the reason that we thought it was important to put our cohort curves into this presentation was to give visibility into our ability to fill that production capacity. And if you think about what two million units means to incremental EBITDA to the business, if you're able to produce an incremental two million units, because you do have the demand at our long-term financial model, it's on the order of $5 billion annually. And then, if you just look at our logistics benefits, which today, if we look at sales that happen within a 200-mile radius of our customers and compare that to the average sale that we have across the entire country, we're $750 better off in unit economics through lower inbound costs, lower outbound transport and lower customer acquisition costs because of higher conversion due to faster delivery. So that's a big number. And so when you start to apply those sorts of numbers against our sales and when you start to imagine those incremental sales, you can get to really big numbers really fast. And I think the math just kind of isn't even important, right? The math isn't even -- well, what's important is our ability to execute to unlock those extremely gutty possibilities. So that's where I say our job now is to execute, because the path is clear. We can see the demand. We know the unit economics. We now have the facilities to build on top of. And now we have to go do that. And so that's where our work lies.\nMike Baker: Okay. Well, so then just -- I appreciate that. And to follow-up on that, the cost to build, I think you just said to Seth, given the great locations would be similar. So is it more that it just gets you there quicker? I know it's going to take some time to get these things ready for your IRCs. But if the cost to build would be similar and it's not really about the $100 million EBITDA, is it about the time or other sort of synergies or if you could just help us with that a little. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Yeah. So I think all of the above, I think, time, I think location and then I think end point is also potentially different. So I think that, you can think about all those things as being large benefits of this transaction. When I say locations, I mean, quality of locations.\nOperator: The next question will come from Nat Schindler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nNat Schindler: Yeah, hi, guys. Two quick questions. One, on the financing and other revenue, and the GPU you've created from that has been obviously very good this year, how much of that is due to the fact that, at this point, default rates are, kind of, don't matter anymore because you can sell the used car after someone has bought it for more than they paid for it? I mean so there -- how much was gain on sale from this unusual pricing environment, not just the fact that the car price was higher to begin with, but the fact that the risk in the loan had disappeared because of rising prices on cars?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, I mean, I think that -- I think the simple answer to that question is very little benefit at all. And that benefit would have gone to the purchasers of our residuals who then observed better performance on the loans that they purchased than was expected. The economics that we get are a function of the expected losses over the life of the loan at the time that they're purchased. And as you can imagine, despite the fact that losses were great from mid-2020 to -- well, I mean, even now, they still are great generally across the industry. Investors aren't assuming that that will be the case forever when they buy a multiyear asset class. And so the underlying assumptions that have driven the prices that we have received really haven't moved in a material way as a result of the last couple of years. But those who have bought the loans have significantly outperformed probably what they expected as a result of that great performance.\nNat Schindler: But then with a significant normalization in prices, significant, not 2% here and there, but a significant normalization in pricing on used cars, take you back so that there is a significant risk to those credit hedge funds that are buying your loans that they simply can't get back on the loans that they're used to because the car is going to drop in price?\nErnie Garcia: So I'm going to try to answer this concisely because I think we could talk about it for a long time, but I do think that's just all about the interest rate that exist on loans that are originated, which are set by the market. And the market is generally seeking interest rates that would allow a loan buyer in any form, whether whole loan or partial loan or residual or whatever it is, to receive the yield that they would expect given the losses that they would expect. So I think that's just -- that's really a question of how market interest rates evolve, and we will evolve with the market. I think as long as our evolution is happening with the market, we wouldn't expect the impact to conversion to be all that high, and we wouldn't expect the impact to finance profits to be all that large. Where there is an exception to that rule is when you have a very rapid move, like we recently saw, which we expect to flow through in Q1 and impact us negatively. But in general, we would expect the market rate to absorb those sorts of expected changes.\nOperator: The next question will come from Naved Khan with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nNaved Khan: Yeah, hi. Thank you. I have a question on the ADESA acquisition. So if I just read the real estate play that you're focusing on and just look at the core auction business that you're also buying, how should I think about the dealer participation once it's operated by Carvana? And is there a possibility that maybe the business could win a little over time? And how should I think about that? And the $100 million in EBITDA that it generated last year, and is there a risk to that?\nErnie Garcia: So I would say, first of all, our plan there is business as usual as discussed, for all the people inside of ADESA and also for all of the customers of ADESA that we're extremely excited to work with. So that's the plan. There's always risk in any business. So I mean I don't think that we want to say that there's no risk. We also think that there's a lot of opportunity. I think the transaction that we announced last quarter with Hertz maybe provides a bit of a window into the types of opportunities that could exist in the future. And we think there may be other opportunities like that as well. So I think the plan is business as usual. We'll see how that plays out in the immediate term. We're excited to welcome the people of ADESA to the team and the customers of ADESA, and we're excited to find increasingly creative ways to continue to work together to take advantage of the incredible assets that we've both built independently that now get to come together to give our joint customers even better experiences and options. So we'll see how all of that plays out.\nNaved Khan: Okay. And then a follow-up question, maybe just on the consumer sourcing. Can you just, sort of, give us an update on where you are? Approximately what percentage of ADESA vehicles are currently sold direct from consumers versus from dealers?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So we haven't provided precise numbers there in a while, but we have pointed to the fact that we've had extreme growth there across total transactions. This year, we had another year of over 100% growth. That's happened every year in our company's history, except for 2020 in the pandemic year. And we also are excited too, we bought our millionth car from a customer just yesterday. So that was a great milestone that was recently achieved. So we continue to have a lot of success there. We've got an offering that is very high quality that customers love, that is a very natural extension of our business because it just takes our logistics network in reverse. And it's simple and easy, straightforward and fair for our customers, which is the mark that we're always trying to hit. And that's all showing up in the results that we see and the growth that we've seen in that business, which continues to be very strong.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Bellinger with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDavid Bellinger: Hi, Ernie. Thanks for taking the question. So back on the 550,000 unit guidance for 2022 does that include some type of benefit from ADESA? And maybe in terms of a lift in conversion rate, just given you could get first look at some of these more attractive higher demand vehicles at auction, is any of that embedded in your unit guidance?\nErnie Garcia: I don't think we want to break out our guidance, but we're -- as a general rule, not assuming super material benefits to the core business in this first year as a result of the acquisition. We think that more of that will come in the future then will come immediately. We'll obviously be working hard to find those benefits as soon as we possibly can, but that's our operating assumption going in.\nDavid Bellinger: Got it. Okay. And then just can we get a quick update, too, on the marketplace initiative. Any comment on the early progress there and anything in regard to economics behind those sales?\nErnie Garcia: Yes. I think we don't have a ton more to share there. As we announced last quarter, we've got this really exciting partnership with Hertz, which we're excited about and where we're seeing great results early on. It remains early, I think, to do anything great with any partner. Both sides have to really walk arms and put the work into \u2013 to build a great customer offering. And I think so far, both sides have done that, and we're excited by that. But there's certainly work left to do to unlock all the potential there. So potentially more updates there in the future.\nOperator: Your last question will come from John Blackledge with Cowen. Please go ahead. `\nJohn Blackledge: Great. Thank you. Two questions. Will every -- of the 56 locations, will they all have IRC type of capabilities, or is there -- will some of them overlap in near or existing IRC facilities? And how do you envision the $1 billion to be spent across the 56 locations? And then second question, you referenced the $750 cost savings, does that change the kind of the long-term EBITDA margin range? Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So on the first question; I think we're not going to get too specific on our plans there yet. There likely will be some locations that we do not add reconditioning capabilities to. That is taken into account in our approximately $2 million incremental unit estimate and kind of the $1 billion estimate of CapEx is also taken into account in all that. And then as it relates to $750, I would say that that's more of an acceleration to our long-term model than it is an addition to our long-term model. For those of you that remember, at our Analyst Day in 2018, we had simulations that assumed that we would have 40 reconditioning centers around the country and getting those 40 reconditioning centers would drive down our transport distances and, therefore, drive down a lot of the expenses that we expect to be driven down by this acquisition, and that was built into our long-term financial model. So, this is more locations that they are even better than we assumed the 40 locations would be back then. But that difference is very small relative to just the clear pathway to that benefit showing up in our numbers in a meaningful way faster than it otherwise would have.\nJohn Blackledge: Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nErnie Garcia: Thanks. Well, first, I want to address everyone on team Carvana, another incredible year. Thank you for everything you guys do. The last couple of years have been absolutely insane and you've continually risen to the occasion. As I've told you before, I could not be prouder of what we achieved with that Forbes list. I think that, that is such a cool achievement. And it's very hard to do when we're all working as hard as we're working. So I cannot thank you enough for finding meaning in all the hard things that we do together and for having fun doing it and making it more fun for everyone around you. That's incredible, and it's the reason for our success. And as I said, I cannot thank you enough. To the ADESA team, we are extremely excited to welcome you guys as well. We'll be talking more over the next several days. I think we have an incredible opportunity together. I can imagine that this is always a bit destabilizing, change can always be scary. But we want you to know that we're extremely excited. We have a ton of respect for what you guys have built. We really look forward to working together. And we think it's going to be fun, and we think everyone's going to benefit. And to ADESA's customers, I would say the same. We're extremely excited to work with you. We think there's a lot that we can do together. I can imagine the news is shaking you a bit, too. I can't wait to meet you in person and talk about the things we can do together. And again, I want to make sure you hear our commitment that our goal is business as usual and not to shake things up too much too quickly. And so we're excited to welcome you guys as customers. And as I said in my opening remarks, we will value the same way that we've always valued all of our customers, which is centrally. So, thank you to everyone, and we'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ernie Garcia",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. 2021 was an extraordinary year for Carvana, full of landmark accomplishments along our path to achieving -- changing the way people buy and sell cars. We started the year being named to the Fortune 500, tied to the third fastest company ever to do so. We sold our one millionth car through organic growth faster than any other automotive retailer in history. We had our first positive earnings quarter. We had our first positive EBITDA year, excluding onetime items, and we became the fastest growing e-commerce company in US history. While I'm extremely excited and proud of the team for that blockbuster list of accomplishments, I'm even more excited about the fact that we were also named the top 10 of Forbes Best Large Employers to Work For list. We're ranked ahead of any other retail company and ahead of any other technology company. That set of accomplishments can only be achieved with a clear customer focused mission and enormously scaled opportunity and the compounding that results from the efforts of great people who care are directed toward long-term value creation. Thank you to everyone inside Carvana for always choosing to care and for always giving that little extra effort that adds up to make a huge difference. We've always framed our opportunity simply. Customers desire the experience we provide for them, providing it is hard. There are approximately 40 million used cars sold every year in the US. The unit economics of the industry viewed over any reasonable time frame have been stable for a long time. That unit economic stability at the industry level is structurally driven by the fact that there are tens of thousands of dealers out there providing customers with similar customer experiences and who share similar cost structures. That simple frame is clarifying. To achieve our goals, we must continue to deliver great customer experiences, we must continue to differentiate our unit economics, and we must continue to scale. That is our path. In alignment with that path, we are extremely excited to announce the acquisition of ADESA's US operations. ADESA is the nation's second largest auction company with 56 locations, completing about 1 million auction transactions a year. This acquisition has four primary justifications. Number one, it solidifies our path to becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. Number two, it provides us with a nationwide inspection center network that we estimate will increase our production capacity by approximately 2 million units per year when fully built out. Number three, it substantially improves our logistics network. Demonstrating the breadth of these locations, we will move from currently having inspection centers within 200 miles of 56% of the US population to eventually being within 200 miles of 94% of the US population. Demonstrating the quality of these locations, we will move from being within 50 miles of 16% of the US population to being within 50 miles of 58% of the population. This will reduce shipping times to our customers nationwide and lays the foundation for eventually offering same-day delivery to many of our customers. Number four, it significantly increases our auction capabilities and kick starts or deepens our relationships with many large and important players in the automotive industry. We look forward to working with our new customers to creatively finding new and interesting ways to work together and to valuing them in the same way we have always valued all of our customers. We also expect ADESA to accelerate our path to our long-term financial model, given the many powerful benefits that derive from being closer to our customers. For perspective of how powerful proximity can be, sales that are delivered to customers from an inspection center within 200 miles of our customers today have unit economics that are about $750 better than our average transaction as a result of lower inbound costs, lower delivery costs and higher conversion rates leading to lower customer acquisition expense. Now, I'd like to turn briefly to the current environment. Starting in the late fourth quarter, we, like everyone else, were hit pretty hard by the Omicron variant. At different points in time, we had up to 30% of our people in various operational teams simultaneously called out. It is obviously very difficult to deal with in any system. But in systems that relay on changed activity like our inspection centers and our logistics network, it is even more difficult. This led to the most severe logistics network constraints we have seen in our history. While we are largely out of the Omicron wave, it takes time to work out of our backlogs, and this year's severe winter storms have slowed our progress. Today, we remain severely constrained, but we're working hard to work through it as soon as we possibly can. These constraints, paired with the recent rapid appreciation of vehicle prices as well as rapid increase in interest rates, have colluded to make this a challenging time. While this has undoubtedly been complex operationally, as our team has in the past, they are rising to the challenge. We've managed to grow our inventory available to our customers. We've grown our operational capacity to handle more volumes throughout our operating groups in anticipation of alleviating our logistics constraints and in anticipation of tax season and we have made changes to the mix of cars we are purchasing and reconditioning to help our customers find more affordable cars despite the car pricing environment. And our long-term indicators continue to look incredible. In our oldest cohort, we are now up to 3.5% market penetration. This may not sound like much at first, but if we apply that nationwide, it extrapolates to about $1.4 million annual sales. On top of that, our oldest cohort grew by 50% in the last year and, therefore, clearly has a long way to go. Lastly, 95% of our 311 markets are ramping faster than our 2013 cohort was at the same time in its life. Two million-plus car sales per year is no longer the goal, we're aiming higher. We have the team, the business model and the ambition to do it. The march continues. Mark? Sure. So what I would say, I think the primary driver is going to be how quickly we can alleviate the constraints in logistics network. Yes, as I said in my prepared remarks, Omicron really set us back. The logistics network is a system where many drivers connect in order to deliver a car to a customer. And at kind of the peak of the Omicron wave, we did have very high call-out rates, and that made it hard for those connections to occur and then set us back and got us a bit behind. And then I think we've been working hard. The team has done a great job trying to catch up. We've got a really strong network when it's fully functioning that should enable us to catch up relatively quickly. But we've also been hit by a number of winter storms as recently as this week, we are hit by another one. And those storms definitely set us back again. So I think when you look at the remainder of this year, I think the primary driver right now is our logistics network, which is much more constrained than any other part of the business. And then I think from there, it's about catching up and then it's about figuring out where we are for the remainder of the year. Right now, the logistics network is absolutely constraining sales. We have also seen car price appreciation that was pretty meaningful in the back half of Q4. And then, we've seen interest rates go up quite a bit as well. And so we don't feel like the impact of that has been that severe on us just yet because we've been kind of impacted by the logistics network constraints, and that's really what's holding us back. But we have seen industry-wide sales drop by kind of 15% to 20% relative to 2019 or 2021, depending on where your reference point is. And so we're taking that all into account and trying to put together our outlook of 550,000 units, and that's what underlies that? So I think we're going to stick with what we've got in the outlook in terms of specificity. I do think Q1 is going to be a tougher quarter. That's just the way it's going to unfold. We've been heavily constrained, and that's going to show up in the volume. It's also \u2013 in the inspection centers that were hit really heavily in Q4 with Omicron, they were still able to produce a lot of cars because we built a lot of inspection centers and built out a very strong capability there. But the efficiency certainly went down, and that will show up and impacts the COGS. So I think those impacts will show up in Q1, and that's why we're trying to guide to Q1 to provide kind of clarity there. And then we expect to emerge from that and look forward to a really strong Q2 through Q4. Sure. Well, I think, first of all, as you can imagine, we're extremely excited about this acquisition. We're extremely excited to welcome the team. We think it's a pretty incredible fit. I think whenever businesses come together, you always talk about all the synergies and all the things that you hope to occur. But I think what's so great about this one is it's very clear to see how we fit together. They've got an unbelievable footprint of 56 locations around the country, in great locations that are very close to our customers. You add up those locations, it's over 4,000 acres. For perspective, if you add up all of our inspection centers today, it's probably close to around 1,000 acres. So a really meaningful increase and just kind of the physical infrastructure that we will have access to. That obviously means incredible things for what we can do from a reconditioning perspective, both in terms of volume where we expect to get 2 million units, plus incrementally out of there versus our existing capacity once we fully ramp it up, and then also from a location perspective because we can deliver cars to customers where we'll be much closer to them. So I think that's really exciting. And then we also think the business is a great fit. We've often used this mental model of \u2013 the entire used market is basically a big machine with lots of players that helps customer's trade cars with one another. And there's all kinds of players inside that system. There's dealers, there's finance companies, auctions are a really big player inside that system. And when we talk about vertical integration, what we generally mean is we want to be as big a part of that system as we can be so that we can cut out as much expense and difficulty is possible for customers that are trading cars. And we think working together with ADESA is really interesting strategically for that reason as well. When we think about build versus buy, it's actually a fairly straightforward analysis that you can kind of walk through in that same kind of framework. And I think the simplest way to think about it is just with respect to our inspection centers. I think in order for us to get similar production capacity out of inspection centers that we would build, we would expect to need to build on the order of 30 inspection centers. And we would expect that cost to be pretty high. We would especially expect it to be pretty high when you look at the locations that we're picking up through this ADESA acquisition. They've got many locations on the West Coast, they got many locations in the Northeast, in areas of the country that are very expensive in dollars, but also very expensive in time in terms of how long it takes to find those locations and get them zoned and get them build out, and get them operational. So we think that from a build versus buy perspective, with just that simple analysis, you're probably pretty close -- you're probably very close actually. And then we get the instantaneous logistics benefits and access to this great business. So we're really excited about it and just think it lays a very clear path to the future. I talked a bit in my opening about our oldest cohort of Atlanta now being up to 3.5% market share. And we think that's really important in this context because it does just very clearly light the path to 1.4 million units that you can just kind of see as long as we execute. And then beyond that, you know that you have the 50% growth that is continuing to happen inside of Atlanta. We don't know exactly where that growth is going to compound out over the next many years. But I think if you look at other businesses that are growing even at rates materially slower than 50% and look out five or 10 years, you'll generally see businesses that grow by a pretty significant multiple to where they sit at that point in time. And so we think that lights the path to volume. We think if you look at the unit economics, we just had our best GPU year ever, which is extremely exciting. But I think every bit is exciting. We've been marched up year after year after year very consistently. We've been supporting all this growth and all the investments we've been making, and we've been marching up our EBITDA margin to the point we had our first positive earnings quarter and our first positive EBITDA year, excluding one-time adjustments. So when you put all that together and then you lay that on top of this footprint that we're going to get access to, that we think is acquired at a cost that is very reasonable relative to what it would cost to build out and then comes so much faster and with so many other great assets and opportunities, we basically just think that this is even more clearly an execution game from here. And so now the ball is in our hands, and we got to run with it. And we're extremely excited to be in that spot, because this is a really big opportunity and the path has never been clearer. Sure. So, I guess, I would start with -- again, like the way that our business model operates is, we generally sell that credit risk off at the time that we complete our securitizations through the sale of the residual asset, kind of, as well as the underlying bonds. And so that doesn't flow directly through our financial statements. We kind of neither benefited from the extremely strong performance over the last couple of years, nor would we necessarily get directly impacted if performance were to get worse in the future, outside of kind of the expectations for future losses that would be kind of priced into any bonds that we sell. So that doesn't kind of directly flow through our financial statements just for clarity. I think what we're generally seeing is, the same thing that the industry is seeing, which is, I think there is some approaching of normalization of consumer credit behavior. It still, on average, is better than historical, if we define historically as kind of normal times pre-2019. But it's not better by as much as it was better in kind of mid-2020 through maybe mid-2021 where performance was unbelievable. So I think there may be some normalization of those trends, but it's been, I would say, very orderly so far. And I don't think there's any reason to expect something different just yet. Thank you. Sure. So as a start, I would say, it's a simpler process, generally speaking, doing dealer to dealer transfers. And so I think you can think about those processes as existing pretty independently. Certainly, our teams will share learnings that we found over the years, and there may be some benefits there. But generally speaking, I think the simplest way to think about that is separate. Now because you brought it up, I do think the registration team and title team inside Carvana definitely deserves a shout-out. They've done an unbelievable job over the last probably six months or so, making a lot of progress. We're now kind of approaching similar levels of success in entitlement registration to what we are experiencing pre-pandemic. So I think that, that's really exciting, and that's hard to do in this environment. So there's a lot of great things going on there. They're working very well with our partners in the various DMVs to make sure that we make the customer experience as simple as possible. So I think we're excited about the progress we're making there. And then I think on the ADESA front, we plan to continue operating that business as we have, or as ADESA has, over a very long period of time. So for all the people inside ADESA, it will be business as usual, and they'll continue to handle their title processing in the wholesale business the way that they have. Sure. Well, I appreciate you clarifying because I want to make sure that we don't generate too high of expectations instantaneously. I think probably that language you're referring to, we instantaneously spin to an incredible network that will enable us to build a very meaningful reconditioning capacity and significantly improved logistic capabilities. That will take time. And I think we're not planning to provide precise time lines on any of that just yet, but we certainly have plans and our teams will be hustling to get as much benefit from that as we possibly can as soon as possible. Sure. So yes, so we do partner with both Manheim and ADESA on third-party reconditioning. I do think that offers some capabilities. But again, I think we'll stay away from giving too precise of guidance there. Sure. So I think a good starting point is they will operate largely as kind of 2 businesses on the same land is maybe a good and simple way to think about it. We've got our inspection center capabilities, and we've got our logistics capabilities that we've built out over time. And so I think we can go and we can kind of place those on these 4,000 acres of land around the country and operate them very similarly to the way that we historically have. And then I think the auction can continue to run the way they historically has as well, so it will be business as usual sort of for both sides. The place where we will be working together very quickly is in the retail recon work that ADESA does. We'll be working to kind of merge those teams together. So, that's kind of the single place of integration or at least the most important place of the integration, between us. And then part of why this is such a great fit is there's kind of a secular and cyclical trend going on with auctions where, secularly, many more components of auction transactions are happening digitally even though there's a very large desire by many customers, both buyers and sellers, to go actually transact in person. And that often means that cars can spend less time on the ground at auctions, meaning that their space can be utilized in other ways. And then cyclically, we're at a time where auction volume is very low, historically low, in fact. And so that means there's a lot of excess land at these locations -- the average location is less than 50% utilized today, meaning there's a lot of opportunity for us to work together and for these functions to coexist. So, again, we think the path that this lays for us is very, very clear and now we need to just go execute. And I think that's our job for the next many years to take full advantage of this opportunity. Sure. So, the specific way that we 'metered' demand last quarter was in suppressing the amount of inventory that was visible to customers. That tool is still being utilized today to a very similar degree, in fact, given the logistics network constraints that we see. So, we are continuing to utilize that tool. That means that the inventory growth that we've seen that, I think, is evidence of the great work our team has done to expand our production capabilities is not really flowing through to customers yet in the form of as much growth in kind of available inventory. So, we are very focused on alleviating the constraints in our logistics network and once we do that, we have the ability to make more of that inventory visible to more customers, which is something we look forward to being able to do. Sure. So, again, I think we want to be careful about giving too much kind of guidance on guidance. But what I'll say is what basically underlies our expectations for the year is that we do resolve the constraints that we see in the logistics network and then the demand environment, for the industry in total, remains somewhat similar to what it looks like today. And so I think that's basically what's underneath our expectations. As I said, I think today, we have -- we're part of the industry. So when there's affordability impacts to the industry, that's going to impact us as well. But given how constrained we are, it's probably not impacting us as much as it might be impacting the rest of the industry. But we have seen sales slow down quite a bit industry-wide as car prices went up and interest rates went up and that impacted affordability. And so depending on what your comparison period is, sales look like they're down in the industry, 15% to 20%, give or take, on the used side. And then we do see some evidence of that in our data as well. While our sales are largely driven today by the logistics network and not by the demand environment, the demand environment still flows through to the sales that you realize. And so if you look through at our customers that are making less than $50,000, for example, they're growing about 30% slower than the company is year-to-date. If you look at customers making $100,000 or more, they're growing about 30% faster than the company is year-to-date. And normally, when you kind of do any reasonable kind of demographic cuts, you tend to see similar growth across all these different consumer segments. And so I think that pretty clearly shows the impact that affordability has had on consumers, on lower FICO consumers and lower income consumers and younger consumers. It's kind of showing up in the data. So we're assuming that, that environment will remain somewhat similar. We would actually hope for a decreasing price environment. There's a lot of potential impacts that would result from that. But most importantly, it would improve affordability for customers and most likely drive more customers to a place where they're ready to buy again. And so we think that, that is probably what we're hoping for, but our outlook assumes kind of a similar macro environment to what we see today. Sure. So I think a lot of these impacts we can start to see through, right? So the first quarter is going to be tough for a number of reasons. I think we'll start with Omicron and the inspection centers. That just flows through in COGS. In kind of smaller COVID waves earlier on, we saw impacts on the order of $150 to $200 that flowed through COGS. This was a bigger and more severe wave, right? So that then means that the inspection centers are less efficient. And so those costs get spread onto cars. And then when those cars sell, it shows up in lower margins. But as you kind of move through Omicron, the inspection centers are starting to recover, and so you can already get visibility into the direction that COGS is heading there. We still have some work to do, but you can get visibility. I think interest rates, as Mark said earlier, moved really quickly. And when they move that quickly, we tend to do our securitizations toward the end of the quarter. And so the originations that we had earlier in the quarter, where they were originated in a different environment, are expected to have a different spread and then you see that impact as well. And so that can kind of flow through there. And so I think when we look at margins on the cars themselves, we've also recently seen a little bit, for the first time in a while, of car price reduction. So we've seen kind of wholesale prices drop by maybe something like 5% for, say, 2019 model year cars year-to-date. We've seen retail prices drop by maybe 2%. And so we can start to see as well, while car prices started to reduce, that at least little cohort of cars, the margins there look potentially a little bit better despite the fact that car prices are dropping. So I think that, that's helpful in giving us visibility beyond Q1 as well. And then from a units perspective, it's really all about, or at least primarily about, alleviating constraints in our logistics network. And then from there, it's going to be about what does affordability look like. And I think it's hard to know exactly what's going to happen over the next 12 months with car prices or with interest rates. I think your guess is as good as ours there. But car prices going down is, all else constant, helpful for sales; interest rates going down, all else constant, helpful. The reverse is the opposite. And then from a margin active, I think it's actually unclear how that cuts because, generally speaking, margins are driven by kind of the gap between wholesale and retail prices. And so it's all about how those two markets move in relation to one another. So I think we have pretty solid visibility into the next several quarters from where we are because a lot of these impacts, you can already see starting to abate a bit. Sure. What I would say is, I mean, from a demand perspective, we're very confident. I think you saw all the kind of market penetration growth, the number of markets that crossed over all these different lines. You saw our average cohort grew by 50% last year. Atlanta grew by 50%. It's our oldest cohort and there's a lot of signals there that are very clear. If you look at website traffic, which -- website traffic is not a perfect top-funnel metric, because in website traffic quality can vary, but it's at least a reasonable top-funnel metric, we continue to see extremely fast growth there. So I think what's driving our forecast is exactly what we said, the first thing we have to do that's Carvana specific is we have to alleviate the constraints in our logistics network. And then that will sort of get us to a baseline where we see where we are. We are subject to the conditions of the industry. And so I think when we look at the industry today, and we see that many retailers are down between 15% and 20%, which we attribute to these affordability issues, we're taking that into account when we think about where things are likely to head for the remainder of the year. And so that's what's built in. And then if I could jump in really quick too. I do think we were lucky enough to have a very strong last couple of years. And I think that sometimes we can get roped in as kind of a pandemic growth story because in those 2 years, we are a more visible company than we were prior. But that said, I think if you go back to 2017 when we went public, we were 1/10 the size that we are today. We grew on the order of 4x over the next 2-year period, pre-pandemic. And that growth was driven by the exact same forces that we expect our growth in the future to be driven by, which are these cohort curves and visibility into the future as long as we execute. So I think all these things will work themselves out. It's all going to become visible over time. But we feel like the visibility into demand is very clear. And then hopefully, that was a helpful answer for Mark on the cash front. Sure. I think at a very high level, it's probably not very different. And the reason is that's more expensive than our historical average inspection center has been by a pretty decent amount. Our average inspection is, in the past, have probably been more like $40 million to $65 million or $70 million, something like that. But these locations are oftentimes in more expensive cities and also in more expensive parts of town. This footprint has been built over a 30-year period. And so a lot of it is infill location. It's a little bit closer to customers and a little bit closer to employment than many of the locations that we would build out today if we were going out and trying to find farmland, for example, and to build a greenfield. So again, I wouldn't want to be too precise there, but similar, when you're just evaluating it through the inspection center lens, it's probably not way off. Sure. So I think, to be honest, I probably go about the analysis a pretty different way. I think, you can -- the EBITDA is present, but I think that, that's -- and it's important, and it represents the incredible business that's been built by ADESA over a long period of time. And I think that's an incredible asset that we're extremely excited to be getting. But I think, we also can think about it in terms of the value that will be created through our other kind of pillars of rationale for this. And so there is a large portion of the real estate that is owned by ADESA. That's a very valuable asset that can be added to this. And on that land, we can build these inspection centers. To the extent, -- the reason that we thought it was important to put our cohort curves into this presentation was to give visibility into our ability to fill that production capacity. And if you think about what two million units means to incremental EBITDA to the business, if you're able to produce an incremental two million units, because you do have the demand at our long-term financial model, it's on the order of $5 billion annually. And then, if you just look at our logistics benefits, which today, if we look at sales that happen within a 200-mile radius of our customers and compare that to the average sale that we have across the entire country, we're $750 better off in unit economics through lower inbound costs, lower outbound transport and lower customer acquisition costs because of higher conversion due to faster delivery. So that's a big number. And so when you start to apply those sorts of numbers against our sales and when you start to imagine those incremental sales, you can get to really big numbers really fast. And I think the math just kind of isn't even important, right? The math isn't even -- well, what's important is our ability to execute to unlock those extremely gutty possibilities. So that's where I say our job now is to execute, because the path is clear. We can see the demand. We know the unit economics. We now have the facilities to build on top of. And now we have to go do that. And so that's where our work lies. Yeah. So I think all of the above, I think, time, I think location and then I think end point is also potentially different. So I think that, you can think about all those things as being large benefits of this transaction. When I say locations, I mean, quality of locations. Sure. So, I mean, I think that -- I think the simple answer to that question is very little benefit at all. And that benefit would have gone to the purchasers of our residuals who then observed better performance on the loans that they purchased than was expected. The economics that we get are a function of the expected losses over the life of the loan at the time that they're purchased. And as you can imagine, despite the fact that losses were great from mid-2020 to -- well, I mean, even now, they still are great generally across the industry. Investors aren't assuming that that will be the case forever when they buy a multiyear asset class. And so the underlying assumptions that have driven the prices that we have received really haven't moved in a material way as a result of the last couple of years. But those who have bought the loans have significantly outperformed probably what they expected as a result of that great performance. So I'm going to try to answer this concisely because I think we could talk about it for a long time, but I do think that's just all about the interest rate that exist on loans that are originated, which are set by the market. And the market is generally seeking interest rates that would allow a loan buyer in any form, whether whole loan or partial loan or residual or whatever it is, to receive the yield that they would expect given the losses that they would expect. So I think that's just -- that's really a question of how market interest rates evolve, and we will evolve with the market. I think as long as our evolution is happening with the market, we wouldn't expect the impact to conversion to be all that high, and we wouldn't expect the impact to finance profits to be all that large. Where there is an exception to that rule is when you have a very rapid move, like we recently saw, which we expect to flow through in Q1 and impact us negatively. But in general, we would expect the market rate to absorb those sorts of expected changes. So I would say, first of all, our plan there is business as usual as discussed, for all the people inside of ADESA and also for all of the customers of ADESA that we're extremely excited to work with. So that's the plan. There's always risk in any business. So I mean I don't think that we want to say that there's no risk. We also think that there's a lot of opportunity. I think the transaction that we announced last quarter with Hertz maybe provides a bit of a window into the types of opportunities that could exist in the future. And we think there may be other opportunities like that as well. So I think the plan is business as usual. We'll see how that plays out in the immediate term. We're excited to welcome the people of ADESA to the team and the customers of ADESA, and we're excited to find increasingly creative ways to continue to work together to take advantage of the incredible assets that we've both built independently that now get to come together to give our joint customers even better experiences and options. So we'll see how all of that plays out. Sure. So we haven't provided precise numbers there in a while, but we have pointed to the fact that we've had extreme growth there across total transactions. This year, we had another year of over 100% growth. That's happened every year in our company's history, except for 2020 in the pandemic year. And we also are excited too, we bought our millionth car from a customer just yesterday. So that was a great milestone that was recently achieved. So we continue to have a lot of success there. We've got an offering that is very high quality that customers love, that is a very natural extension of our business because it just takes our logistics network in reverse. And it's simple and easy, straightforward and fair for our customers, which is the mark that we're always trying to hit. And that's all showing up in the results that we see and the growth that we've seen in that business, which continues to be very strong. I don't think we want to break out our guidance, but we're -- as a general rule, not assuming super material benefits to the core business in this first year as a result of the acquisition. We think that more of that will come in the future then will come immediately. We'll obviously be working hard to find those benefits as soon as we possibly can, but that's our operating assumption going in. Yes. I think we don't have a ton more to share there. As we announced last quarter, we've got this really exciting partnership with Hertz, which we're excited about and where we're seeing great results early on. It remains early, I think, to do anything great with any partner. Both sides have to really walk arms and put the work into \u2013 to build a great customer offering. And I think so far, both sides have done that, and we're excited by that. But there's certainly work left to do to unlock all the potential there. So potentially more updates there in the future. Sure. So on the first question; I think we're not going to get too specific on our plans there yet. There likely will be some locations that we do not add reconditioning capabilities to. That is taken into account in our approximately $2 million incremental unit estimate and kind of the $1 billion estimate of CapEx is also taken into account in all that. And then as it relates to $750, I would say that that's more of an acceleration to our long-term model than it is an addition to our long-term model. For those of you that remember, at our Analyst Day in 2018, we had simulations that assumed that we would have 40 reconditioning centers around the country and getting those 40 reconditioning centers would drive down our transport distances and, therefore, drive down a lot of the expenses that we expect to be driven down by this acquisition, and that was built into our long-term financial model. So, this is more locations that they are even better than we assumed the 40 locations would be back then. But that difference is very small relative to just the clear pathway to that benefit showing up in our numbers in a meaningful way faster than it otherwise would have. Thank you. Thanks. Well, first, I want to address everyone on team Carvana, another incredible year. Thank you for everything you guys do. The last couple of years have been absolutely insane and you've continually risen to the occasion. As I've told you before, I could not be prouder of what we achieved with that Forbes list. I think that, that is such a cool achievement. And it's very hard to do when we're all working as hard as we're working. So I cannot thank you enough for finding meaning in all the hard things that we do together and for having fun doing it and making it more fun for everyone around you. That's incredible, and it's the reason for our success. And as I said, I cannot thank you enough. To the ADESA team, we are extremely excited to welcome you guys as well. We'll be talking more over the next several days. I think we have an incredible opportunity together. I can imagine that this is always a bit destabilizing, change can always be scary. But we want you to know that we're extremely excited. We have a ton of respect for what you guys have built. We really look forward to working together. And we think it's going to be fun, and we think everyone's going to benefit. And to ADESA's customers, I would say the same. We're extremely excited to work with you. We think there's a lot that we can do together. I can imagine the news is shaking you a bit, too. I can't wait to meet you in person and talk about the things we can do together. And again, I want to make sure you hear our commitment that our goal is business as usual and not to shake things up too much too quickly. And so we're excited to welcome you guys as customers. And as I said in my opening remarks, we will value the same way that we've always valued all of our customers, which is centrally. So, thank you to everyone, and we'll talk to you next quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to report another year of strong growth in both retail unit sales and revenue. Revenue totaled $12.8 billion, an increase of 129%, and retail units sold totaled 425,237, an increase of 74%, making us the fastest used automotive retailer to sell over 400,000 vehicles in one year. For the fourth quarter, retail units sold totaled 113,016, an increase of 57%. Total revenue was $3.8 billion, an increase of 105%. Our exceptional growth in 2021 was driven by rapid growth within our market cohorts. In Q4, our 2013 through 2020 cohorts grew retail units sold by 52%, and our oldest cohort of Atlanta grew by 51% to 3.53% market penetration. As of Q4 2021, 95% of our 311 markets are ramping faster than Atlanta was at the same age, and record numbers of markets are crossing key market penetration thresholds. In 2021, we completed our eighth consecutive year of $400 or more GPU improvement, our eighth consecutive year of EBITDA margin leverage and our first full year of positive EBITDA margin, excluding one-time items. Total gross profit per unit for the year was 4,537. Our growth in GPU in 2021 was broad-based, including increases of $166 in retail, $308 in wholesale and $811 in other. Total GPU in Q4 was 4,566, an increase of 1,187 year-over-year. Year-over-year changes in GPU were driven by gains across all components in Q4 as well. Retail GPU increased by $230 in Q4, primarily driven by an increase in the percentage of retail vehicles sourced from customers, partially offset by higher reconditioning costs and higher wholesale acquisition prices. Wholesale GPU increased by $441, driven by gains in buying vehicles from customers and wholesale market appreciation. Other GPU increased by $516, driven by strong finance execution and higher industry-wide vehicle prices on average loan as an additional impact. In Q4, EBITDA margin was negative 2.5%, including a 0.6% impact from one-time items, an improvement of 1.4%, reflecting gains in both GPU and SG&A leverage. We ended the year with $2.3 billion in total liquidity resources, giving us significant flexibility to execute our plan. Today, we also announced that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire ADESA's U.S. physical auction business. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022 and will be financed with $3.275 billion in committed debt financing to fund the $2.2 billion purchase price and an additional $1 billion in improvements across the 56 sites. Upon development of these 56 sites, we are expected to unlock approximately 2 million units of incremental annual production capacity at full utilization. This year, we made significant progress scaling our vehicle production capacity. In 2021, we added three inspection and reconditioning centers, increasing our total IRC count to 14. Following year-end, we also opened our 15th IRC near Cincinnati, Ohio, bringing our total capacity at full utilization to approximately 880,000 units as of February 24. We remain on track to open six additional IRCs by the end of 2022. We plan to open five of these on schedule, leading to more than 1.2 million units of annual capacity at full utilization at year-end. And with our acquisition of ADESA U.S., we are currently evaluating our preferred time line on opening the sixth. In 2021, we also opened 45 new markets, bringing our year end total to 311. With these new market openings, we now serve 81% of the total US population, up from 74% at the end of 2020. We will continue to expand in 2022 and continue to expect to serve 95% of the US population over time. As we look toward 2022, we expect another strong year on retail units sold, revenue, GPU and EBITDA margin. We expect to grow retail units sold to over 550,000 for the full year. Following the first quarter, in Q2 through Q4 taken in aggregate, we expect total GPU over 4,000 and approximately breakeven EBITDA margin. We expect the first quarter to be impacted by supply chain challenges brought on by the Omicron variant and severe winter storms and the recent rapid increase in short-term interest rates. We expect these effects to have a significant impact on Q1 total GPU and SG&A per retail unit sold, leading to an expected EBITDA margin loss in the mid single-digit range. Since becoming a public company nearly five years ago, we have made tremendous progress toward our long-term goals and achieved many major milestones such as achieving our first profitable quarter this year. We're excited about what comes next Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. Sure. So I think if we are digging into the first quarter, I think there are a number of different impacts. And I think I would start with Omicron in particular, which is going to have a meaningful impact on our retail cost of goods sold in Q1. And Ernie touched on some of the reasons for that. It's really about the efficiency of the inspection and reconditioning centers and then, in this case, with Omicron it's really been about the logistics network as well. And so we're expecting to see higher reconditioning costs and higher inbound transport costs that we expect to have a meaningful impact on retail GPU in Q1. I think, as it relates to the rapid rise in short-term interest rates, I think what we've seen over the last few months is, a relatively historic rise in terms of the magnitude and the speed, I think you have to go back basically 10 to 15 years to the Global Financial Crisis to see anything like this. And so, because we typically will offer a customer rate and then there's some lag time between when we offer that rate and we monetize our loans, that rapid rise will impact other GPU in Q1. Now, we have raised rates following the benchmark moves, and we're also -- we've scaled up our hedges to lessen the impact of future rate changes, but there will be a transitory impact there on Q1. So I would call out those effects, I think, clearly had severe weather, as Ernie mentioned, as well in Q1, we should be having an impact. So those are a number of things that are impacting Q1. I think when we take a broader view, obviously, we're very excited about the progress in the business, made tremendous progress in 2021. I expect to be over 4,000 GPU for the Q2 through Q4 in total. And so, I think we're feeling really good about our overall progress. Sure. Yes, I can take that question. So at the end of the year, we had $2.3 billion in total liquidity resources. I think if you look at the way we used money in 2021, it was primarily investment in inventory and investment in finance platform assets. I think if you exclude inventory and finance platform assets, our cash flow from operating activities was only minus $82 million. That was a $200 million, approximately $200 million, improvement year-over-year. And so, I think the core business got to a point in 2021 where, again, like other than investments in inventory and investments in finance platform assets, it's really not using a lot of cash from operating activities. And so I think that's one important point to make. I think we view the investment in inventory as a very positive thing for the business, obviously. Investment in inventory increase selection for our customers, I think right now, we're actually metering visibility meaningfully. So we're not getting the full benefit of the investments that we've made in inventory so far. I think we're looking forward to the logistics network strengthening over time, coming off of these weather events and the impacts of Omicron, so that we can un-meter some of the limited visibility of the inventory and get even more benefits. But I think we feel really good about that. I think one of the things that's frequently missed about our liquidity and cash needs that, we are an automotive retailer that invests a lot in hard assets. We invest in inventory. We invest in finance platform assets, and we invest in real estate. Those are highly financeable assets using traditional sources of financing that match those assets, which we used extensively in the past and expect to use in the future. And so I think we feel really good about all of those elements of our business, and those are some of the key things to be thinking about. Sure. So I mean I can tell you some of the key factors that are going into it. I think we've called them out previously on this call. I think the key factors are really going to be the COGS impact of Omicron and to a certain extent, weather on reconditioning costs and inbound logistics costs. I think that's going to be the biggest impact on retail GPU in Q1. And then we do think -- moving to wholesale, we are seeing higher depreciation rates in the wholesale market than we have seen in the past few quarters of 2021. And so we do expect that to have an impact on wholesale GPU in Q1. We expect it to be lower as a result of the higher depreciation rates than we've seen in previous quarters."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Levin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Levin: Thank you, Matt. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on Carvana's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Please note this call will be simultaneously webcast on the Investor Relations section of the company's corporate website at investors.carvana.com. The third quarter shareholder letter is also posted on the IR website. Joining me on the call today are Ernie Garcia, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Jenkins, Chief Financial Officer. Before we start, I would like to remind you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, Carvana's market opportunities and future financial results that involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed here. A detailed discussion of the material factors that cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements can be found in the Risk Factors section of Carvana's most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements and risks in this conference call are based on current expectations as of today, and Carvana assumes no obligation to update or revise them, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise.

Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our shareholder letter issued today, a copy of which can be found on our Investor Relations' website. And now with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thanks Mike and thanks everyone for joining the call. The third quarter was another great quarter for Carvana as we continue to march toward becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. We sold over 110,000 cars to customers; recorded nearly $3.5 billion of revenue; grew total gross profit by 100%; and had our second consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA. Our team delivered these strong numbers despite entering the quarter with significant operational constraints, facing the Delta COVID wave that peaked late in the quarter, and despite making the choice to meet both retail and purchasing volume, which we implemented mid-quarter to ease pressure on the system, while we operationally catch up to demand we're seeing. Since the onset of the pandemic, we found ourselves constrained in various parts of our operational chain. While those constraints hold us back relative to where we might have otherwise been, our team has done an exceptional job and has made tremendous progress throughout. In fact, in the third quarter, we bought and sold over three times as many cars as we did in the third quarter of 2019 prior to the pandemic, and roughly, eight times as many as we did in the third quarter of 2018. This is all been possible because we've continued to focus on the long-term, we continue to invest in the people, technology, and infrastructure that are necessary to buy and sell millions of cars per year, while delivering the exceptional customer experiences we become known for. Given our opportunity, we believe this is clearly the right choice. To everyone across Carvana has worked so hard to make our continual progress possible, thank you. We've also recently entered into two exciting partnerships with Rooting with Hertz that we discussed in more detail on our Shareholder Letter. While the potential of these opportunities is significant, they're both at their very early stages, so we plan to share additional details on our products, financial, and scale ambitions with respect to these partnerships over time and we'll not be providing meaningful additional color at this time. These partnerships are each very exciting, each has excellent underlying fundamentals and therefore, excellent potential. But they're also exciting because of what they represent. As we continue building the Carvana platform to deliver exceptional customer experiences and to handle the constantly increasing scale, our horizontal and vertical opportunities continue to increase. As has been the case since our inception, to maximize our opportunity, we must thoughtfully assess and continually increase the capacity of the business to effectively manage our growth and to simultaneously explore these opportunities. And then we must appropriately balance our ambition for both scale and scope with the focus necessary to make constant forward progress. So far, we'd like to think our team has done a good job at building more capacity in the business to tackle these opportunities and at managing these trade-offs given the capacity we have. To build Carvana into what it can be, we'll need to continue to spend energy getting this right in the future and we plan to. Looking forward, we remain extremely excited. We've reached a scale of over 100,000 cars and $3.5 billion of revenue per quarter, yet we're still only approximately 1% of the overall market. Our focus today is the exact same as it was the very beginning. It remains on our customers, on the experiences we give them, on maximizing the value we provide to them, on leveraging technology to minimize our costs, on building for scale, and on doing all of that with along long-term perspective so we can maximize our opportunity. The march continues. Mark?\nMark Jenkins: Thanks a lot, Ernie and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was another strong quarter for Carvana. Retail units sold totaled 111,949, an increase of 74%. Total revenue was $3.48 billion, an increase of 125%. Total gross profit per unit was $4,672, an increase of $616 and the second highest quarter in our history. Retail GPU was $1,769, a decrease of $88. The change in retail GPU was primarily driven by higher reconditioning costs, in part resulting from the impact of the Delta variant on production throughput, and higher wholesale acquisition prices, partially offset by higher customer source ratio. Wholesale GPU was $420, an increase of $154. This was driven by gross profit per wholesale unit of $936 and record wholesale unit volume, which grew 227% year-over-year due to buying more cars from customers. Other GPU was $2,483, an increase of $550. The increase in other GPU is primarily driven by strong finance, execution and a positive impact of higher industry wide vehicle prices on average loan size. EBITDA margin was positive 0.2% in Q3. This marked our second consecutive quarter of both positive quarterly and trailing 12-month EBITDA, despite significant investments for growth in 2022 and beyond. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion total liquidity resources, giving us significant flexibility to execute our plan. We are executing well and remain focused on building our network and increasing our production capacity to meet demand. We grew immediately available inventory to an average of 16,400 units in Q3, an increase from 12,800 units in Q2 despite the impact of the Delta variant on production volume. We remain on track to launch eight new IRCs by the end of 2022 and continue to focus on growing our IRC teams in preparation for future growth. The explosive growth in buying cars and customers we experienced in the past two quarters also placed significant constraints throughout our system in Q3. To ease the pressure on our system, we began metering both retail units and cars bought from customers mid-quarter to allow our operational capacity to catch up to demand. Most notably, to manage retail sales volume, we reduced the number of vehicles shown to customers in search results, which limited the benefits of higher immediately available inventory on retail units sold. We expect to increase our operational capacity in Q4 with an eye toward 2022. Looking forward, we expect to complete a record year on retail units, revenue, total GPU, and EBITDA margin in 2021. In Q4, we expect retail unit growth to continue to be governed primarily by our operational capacity. We expect revenue growth to be more closely aligned with retail unit growth in Q4 than it was in Q3. We expect total GPU in the low to mid-4,000s for the full year, marking our eighth consecutive year of substantial gains. We expect a seasonal pattern in total GPU in Q4, with Q4 lower than Q3. Finally, we plan to continue to invest in the business both to catch up with current demand and to prepare for growth in 2022 and beyond, leading to a seasonal pattern and SG&A for retail unit in Q4 and close to breakeven EBITDA margin for the full year. We are extremely proud of the progress we've made in company in 2021, navigating the unique macro environment, while delivering rapid growth and managing through operational constraints. Our results relative to the industry continue to leave us more excited than ever about our long-term model and the path toward our goal of delivering more than 2 million retail units per year and becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nSharon Zackfia: Hey, good afternoon, I guess, can you provide some more color on the metering that you're talking about where you kind of took down the level of cars you were buying from customers? And then the concurrent shift in the search results that consumers saw, I mean, how much of an impact was that to the quarter, can you dimensionalize that? And then I guess it sounds like you're hoping that'll be kind of all back to normal and early 2022. I just want to make sure I understood that commentary correctly.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, let me start with the constraints that we've been facing and then we can kind of go from there. I think the primary driver of constraints was definitely the very significant growth we saw in the entire business, but most notably, buying cars from customers in Q2, which then has continued and put additional strain on the business. I think it was accentuated by COVID, especially in the inspection centers, and then we found ourselves a little bit behind, it was probably a little bit harder to catch up than it might have otherwise been given the unique hiring environment. And so I think that's kind of, what's been going on from a constraints. To make that a bit clearer to there can be increases in the total amount of work that are necessary inside the business that are actually greater than the increases in transactions that we see. And what I mean by that is, if we get behind, and it takes us a little bit longer to resolve, some customer question, we have to call them back, we'll see more customer calls. If we have a delivery that gets delayed, because the logistics network is kind of really full on certain legs, we have to kind of reschedule that delivery and can put additional strain on logistics network. And so you can actually see kind of, total work and necessary [ph] and the business grow more than just transactions. And so we saw that starting in Q2 and then spilling over into Q3. Now, because of the nature of constraints, I think we faced throughout our life and maybe notably, over the last 18 months, and most specifically, over the last three or four. In general, demand sort of starts to top the funnel, a customer shows up and is interested in buying a car and the likelihood that customer chooses to buy a car from us is a function of many things. It includes whether or not they find the car they're looking for from us, it includes if they have a question, they want to call in and talk to someone, how long does it take us to answer the phone and answer their question? If they're looking for getting a car delivered, they want a look at the delivery date, how quickly can we deliver that car? And so when we say that we're constrained, what we generally mean is that kind of the amount of demand that we're seeing is causing those service levels to be below where we historically have had them and therefore, fewer customers would elect to go through the process with us, and therefore, sales to some degree. And I think that's been active, as I said, throughout our life to varying degrees, and certainly over the last 18 months. The difference this quarter was normally that system can kind of balance itself out, and you'll see service levels kind of move out a little bit, and then that reduces the number of sales that you'll see conditional on demand. And then we catch up, and then it kind of gets back into balance or restarts approach balance. I think just with the speed that we saw, total transactions grow, that moved more than we would have liked for it to move. So, we were in a position where we kind of chose to just take those same drivers, effectively reduction of conversion, which there were several, but the most notable of which was choosing to be really surgical with what inventory was displayed and what places and we just reduce the amount of inventory that customers can see in certain places. That ends up being a very powerful tool, because we can reduce amount of inventory that people see in certain markets, it's the logistics legs to that market are very constrained. We can reduce certain classifications of vehicles and maybe have more work associated with them on average, if we have certain groups that we need to alleviate pressure on. And so that was a very effective tool for us to use and the effects from a customer perspective to just the average customer saw fewer cars than they would have otherwise seen and therefore they're likely to find the car they were looking for was lower. In terms of quantifying it, wouldn't want to precisely quantified that it wasn't a factor -- it wasn't an overwhelming effect. I think the bigger effect is just kind of the degree to which we've been behind in general over a longer period of time. But that certainly wasn't affecting the quarter and then that's the way that we implemented that tool set to put ourselves in a better position allow ourselves to catch up so that we can get back out in front of all the demand that we're seeing.\nSharon Zackfia: That's super helpful. I guess, when you think about all this complexity of buying the cars from consumers and the weird environment that you're operating in just in general, is this mainly a human issue at this point? Are you just behind where you want to be on staff in or is it is it a tech issue?\nErnie Garcia: First order a person issue. And I think it extends to inside of Carvana across all of our different operational groups and then also outside of Carvana. Many different groups that we get -- when we buy cars from customers, for example, we're generally reaching out to a bank and we're dealing with a payoff and then we're asking for the title in return. Many banks are understaffed in this environment relative where they like to be. Those processes can take longer. So, I think it's first order of person issue inside of Carvana and outside of Carvana. And then I think that across time, as we kind of outlined our priorities in the past, if your customer experience first volume, GPU, and then expenses and expenses generally means building more technology to automate more of the process. So, that's also part of it. Many of these processes, we can continue to further automate across time. But that's generally longer lead-time than the more immediate, kind of, fast-acting solution of getting more people.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good afternoon. So, I just want to follow-up a bit on the last couple questions. Just with all the metering and Delta variant and labor constraints in the quarter, do you think the gap between your demand and actual unit sales widened or compressed in the quarter? And then with your new IRC openings, is there anything you can share on timing or cadence of those IRCs as we move through 2022?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, on the first ,I would say we believe a widened in the quarter and I think the kind of first way that we would articulate that is just in this quarter, we took additional steps to meet our demand that we're proactive and we're just kind of natural system balancing. So, I do think it widens. Now, like I also want to make sure, when we're sitting here talking about constraints, I think I want to make sure and point out the success that we've had alleviating those constraints over time and the quality of work our team has done to do that. So, as I said, this is my prepared remarks, but I got to repeat it, we've been constrained over the last 18 months and yet over the previous two years, in terms of total transactions correspond to all the customers we've grown by three times over the last three years, it's eight times. So, while we've been constrained relative to the demand that we're seeing, we've also been scaling very quickly. And I think the teams have done an exceptional job. They've been under a lot of pressure, with the demand that we've been seeing, and I think they've just continually fought very hard to catch up. And so we're extremely grateful to them and I do believe they've done a great job. As relates to the cadence of the inspections that are rollout, we've only kind of to provide the information that we expect to open eight by the end of 2022. And so we're going to stick with that for now for the kind of, guidance that we're giving.\nZach Fadem: Got it. And then I can't let you off without asking about the Hertz partnership, as well as the Root partnership. But so many elements to unpack and I just wanted to drill in on the sourcing side as this appears to be a way of mixing in a higher source of new vehicles on your platform without having to go to auction. So, just curious, do you think this partnership and partnerships like it expands your addressable market? And then on the unit economics side, to what extent do you believe your marketplace offering could be additive to the long-term 15% to 19% gross margin?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, let me start with this, I think in anything that we do kind of independent of this partnership, or if it's something that we're building ourselves generally that the framework that we use to evaluate it is, we want to make sure that we can give a high quality differentiated customer experience. We want to make sure that we believe in the long-term economics of whatever we're doing and then we want to make sure that we build it for scale, because if those first two things are true, then you're going to be able to scale it over time. And I think that that's the way that we generally think about all these opportunities. I think you'll -- from there, you're going to have this question of do you partner, do you build something yourself? And I think there's a lot of considerations there I think when you can partner -- partner's all kinds of assets that we might not have access to. You can go faster. There's sometimes questions about alignment that you have to try to resolve, you have to come up with terms that are good for both sides. So, there's all kinds of questions around whether or not a partnership makes sense. I'll start with Hertz, I think, as it relates to Hertz, they've got an incredible asset, which is a high quality flow of vehicles coming directly from manufacturer that are then utilized in their rental fleets and then you ultimately, make their way into the hands of another consumer. So, they've got a really high quality asset there. And then I think that would be very hard for us to replicate on our own and then we would like to think at least that what we built which is a really high quality, highly scalable platform to sell cars to customers would be very hard for them to build and so we're natural partners in that way. And so we're excited about the partnership. I think from a scalability perspective, I think, directionally, the way to think about these kinds of partnerships is it means that there's a little bit less work per transaction. And I think that probably that's the most important part of what scalable means. I think, for something to be scalable, there has to be a lot of demand for it. And then the next question is, how much kind of can you grow the amount of work that a company can do and then, to get to units, it's a function of how much work is there per transaction. So, I think that partnership reduces the total amount of work that we have to do to get a car to a customer and so and that way, it's exciting. Now, it's extremely early and we've been testing this for a number of months and then we signed a broader deal with them in the last couple of weeks. So, this will take time for us to figure out and nail but I think there's a lot of interesting potential there. To try to touch on Root, I think, we consider Root in the same way. The insurance business is a very complicated business. It's a business that has a lot more complication under the covers when you really kind of dig in, that you might imagine, from a distance. And I think that they've done a great job building a high quality product over time. So, we think that they're a really natural partner. We share a vision for what a solution is supposed to look like, we share a view that it takes a ton of work to build anything great. And I think that's really important, because that means we can both pour work into it. And so I think that's also an exciting opportunity for us, but it's also very early. And so as it relates to both those partnerships, we're very excited about their potential. But it's early and there's a lot of work to do to get those where we would like them to be. So, we'll be working hard to try to get those to the place that we want.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Nagle with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first question I have I know, we discussed this a bit already, but just with regard to the operational constraints. Just to understand better, I mean, are you starting to see some easing at all in the various aspects of that? And recognizing that the environment's very fluid at this point, but if you look at it now, at what point do you think that -- would you believe that these constraints could light up and let the business flow much more naturally?\nErnie Garcia: So, that's hard, right? I mean I would say constraints show up when we don't -- when we either don't accurately forecast the amounts of work that needs to be done in the future, or if we don't execute as well as we would like. That's what -- that's when they show up. And I think that when we look at where we -- I think that we've executed -- I would like to think at least that we've executed very well through all of this. I think when we look at areas where we maybe didn't accurately forecast what's going to happen. I think this -- several -- especially, the first several COVID waves, we didn't foresee and that led to a decrease in efficiency and therefore, constraints. I think heading into the early part of this year, in Q2, I think we did not foresee all of the growth that we would see, as I said, most specifically, in buying cars from customers and so we weren't prepared for it. I think as long as we're prepared for it, we, again, would like to think that we've demonstrated the ability to execute to very high levels of, kind of, growth. And so I think that constraints really are about our ability to foresee what's going to happen and then our ability to plan for that and execute to that. And so our continual hope is that you this will be the last meaningful COVID wave. We'll find out if that's true or not, we don't quite know. The general, kind of, market across the board is in a bit of a unique spot right now. I'm not sure that was totally foreseen. And then, as I said, buying cars from customers came fast when than we would have otherwise thought. So, what I would say is we're clearly investing right now across the business as aggressively as we feel like we responsibly can to try to catch up, because we do think there's a lot of excess demand there. And so it's hard to predict exactly how all this will unfold, but we're going to be working hard to grow the capacity of the business as quickly as we responsibly can.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. My follow-up question with regard to the efforts to buy cars directly from consumers. So, you've been very successful. There's a number of other players now, both online and offline, also pushing aggressively in this aspect of the business, so to say. So, are you seeing greater competition and does this - the fact that more players are now pushing this, does it ultimately have an impact of where the consumer reacts?\nErnie Garcia: So, I think that that's the smarter place to err and I think it's the right thing to assume. I think empirically, we're buying more cars from customers than ever and we've seen a massive influx of demand in the last several quarters from an already very high level. So, I think that that speaks to the quality of the offering, but I also think that it's never smart to get comfortable and to stop building. And while we believe we've got the highest quality customer offering today, we also believe we can make it a lot better and a lot of really important ways. And we've got a great team that\u2019s focused on that product that has all kinds of interesting plans to continually make it better. So, I think undoubtedly, it's an area that's gotten more attention over the last several years, it probably will continue to get a lot more attention over the next several years. And we'll be continually building to make sure that we keep a spread between the quality of our offering and what else is out there.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rick Nelson with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nRick Nelson: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. I'd like to ask you about ASPs. They've been on a rapid rise trajectory. Do you have any concerns Ernie about physical affordability and any potential pullback in demand given where pricing is today?\nMark Jenkins: So, I can take that one. So, I do think higher used vehicle prices has an impact on demand through an affordability effect. Clearly, there are some customers that are targeting specific monthly payment that meets their budget. And as used vehicle prices rise that -- there's certain customers that are less likely to be able to meet that budget. And so I do think if you look industry-wide, I mean, we're obviously growing incredibly quickly with 74% year-over-year growth despite the constraints that Ernie talked about. But if you looked industry-wide, various data sources have total industry sales down, call it, on the order of 10% to 15% in Q3. And so I do think there's an effect there. We're growing really, really quickly despite that industry-wide effect, which I think is a testament to all the demand that we are seeing.\nRick Nelson: Thanks for that. And a follow-up, carriers about the unit growth that you were seeing during the quarter before you pulled things in or [indiscernible] things. And I guess what was their final straw that caused you to pull back mid-quarter?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, I don't think we want to jump into the details of intra-quarter growth. What I would say the -- what drove the decision was just that we weren't catching up. And I think that historically, we've been able to catch up faster and we just saw that big influx of demand show up. And then we -- once you see that happen and once you're behind, and then all sudden you face a situation where the amount of work per transaction can start to go up, you run the risk of allowing yourself to get further behind, even if demand stays flat, because the further behind you get, the more work per transaction there is and that can cycle on itself. And so we decided to take the proactive measures to give ourselves a little bit of breathing room just so we could catch back up and so that's what drove it. And again, I think we feel really good about the progress that we're making there. We've given the stats we've made over the last several years, but we've -- even in the last several weeks, we continue to see improvement across all those major groups, whether we're looking at customer care, who's answering customer questions, and handling a lot of the transaction, we've seen our service levels get better there. In logistics, we've seen that get better over the last several weeks. If we're looking at the inspection centers, I think they really have done an amazing job. I mean, the inspection centers -- that's hard when you get behind inspection centers, that's a big industrial undertaking, it takes time to catch back up. And they've caught up, they built inventory in the quarter despite the fact that we faced another COVID wave, which is really tough in general, but it's extremely tough. We have an assembly line structure. So, they've done a great job. Market offices, which handles last-mile delivery has done a great job and we've seen service levels improve there. So, I do think we're seeing improvement which is good, but we remain behind and working hard to catch up.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRajat Gupta: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just had a couple questions on just the GPU component. On retail GPU, I guess, just the quarter-over-quarter bridge, how should we think about the moving pieces? Just the intra-quarter price benefit was likely lower than the second quarter? But was there any impact of higher recon labor costs or inefficiencies that impacted that number sequentially? And just given that pricing has continued to remain so strong in the fourth quarter, you talked about like a seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. So just curious as to why that would be the case? And then just lastly, as you continue to face a big ramp of IRC next year and the labor environment remains challenging, I mean should we anticipate any impact to the GPU bridge next year? And maybe just on wage inflation or just overhead expenses for the IRC. And I have a follow-up on F&I.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So let me take a stab at all of the questions in there. So first one talking about Q3 retail GPU, so we had a strong quarter on retail GPU in Q3. It came in at $1,769. I think if we think back prior to COVID, we'd normally expect to see some seasonal decline in retail GPU. I think we saw that for a couple of years prior to COVID. This year, we saw a slightly similar effect even though the -- we're in obviously a very unique environment where we did see early in the quarter, depreciation rates pick up a little bit relative to Q2. And so that definitely had an effect on the sequential change in GPU going from Q2 to Q3. The other thing, I'd call out is we did see higher reconditioning costs on a per unit basis in the quarter. That was driven in part by Delta which definitely impacted production efficiency, which then increases your per unit cost. And so those impacts we saw sort of a similar dynamic late in 2020. The impacts were smaller at this time, but they were there and part of that sequential change. Now as we look forward, you asked a couple of questions about retail GPU on a go-forward basis. So our assumptions for retail GPU in Q4 are embedded in our guidance for the full year. We typically don't break down individual components of that guidance, but we gave you some guidance on total GPU. And then looking out a bit further toward 2022, you asked about the possible labor market effects on the reconditioning costs. And there I would say it's too early to say. I think we can wait and see how that goes looking out in 2022. But in any event any sort of labor cost adjustments are likely to be relatively small compared to the overall magnitude of retail GPU and overall reconditioning costs. So an area that would be my thought on your third question.\nRajat Gupta: Got it. Great. Sorry, coming in one. But just on finance in the third quarter or like the other GPU. The third quarter decline slight decline quarter-over-quarter, any color on that was more finance-driven or service contracts in? Just curious broader picture like how are customer's delinquent assumptions looking for that business? Have they started to move back towards normal albeit it could take many quarters? And if we ask, how should we think about the trajectory going forward and the impact to just the other GPU?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yeah. So other GPU came in again at I believe we said $2,483. It was down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. I think the sequential movement in other GPU is well within the normal range that we would expect from quarter-to-quarter. So it's sort of well within sort of normal range of variability. In this particular case, I would say the biggest driver of the sequential change was just in finance, some rate optimizations that led to slightly lower interest rates that came on sort of late Q2, early Q3 would be the largest driver of a relatively small change.\nErnest Garcia: And then, Rajat, if I could also maybe provide a little bit of a perspective as well. I do think a useful exercise and kind of the way that we often think about the business and the way that we prioritize what we're doing internally, because I think it can be very -- it can be very hard to predict exactly what's going to happen by line item by quarter. So we sometimes try to take a bigger view. And so an exercise that I would suggest because I think if you look at all the different public retailers and you go back in time 20 years and you plot on the graph, their EBITDA margin, I think what you'll find is an extreme amount of stability. There is very, very high level of stability across all the different retailers. And very clear stories start to emerge. You can see some retailers performing a little bit better than other retailers over relatively long periods of time, which suggests a relatively better execution. You can see what happens to the financial crisis. You can see what's happening right now. We're -- right now is a moment of interest in that 20 year graph, where you will see that many of the franchise dealers are performing very well relative to history. And then you'll see that some of those that are completely write on auction are performing very poorly compared to history. And those that have access to buying cars from customers are generally performing somewhat similarly compared to history, which is somewhat interesting. But the reason I bring that up is, because I do think that even going back to the reason that we started to report on total GPU, when we first went public in 2017, the general idea there was just that there is a lot of ballots in this industry. There is tens of thousands of other dealers that are providing a fairly similar experience to customers that have very similar cost structures to one another. And as a result, the industry is sort of structured in a way where some of the profits across those different components of the transaction tend to add up to cover their expenses and their cost of capital. And once you get to that place where you kind of realize these lines have been very, very stable over a 20-year period, there is little squiggles kind of that you'll see in that chart from quarter-to-quarter, but they're probably not the most important thing. The most important thing is just what is the quality of the customer experience that you're offering compared to everyone else? What's the quality of your variable economics, both on the revenue and the cost side? And then if those things look good, how scalable are you? And so when we think about our prioritization, that's the frame that we use, and that's how we try to make sure that we're putting our time and energy into the things that are most important. And I think through that frame, if you look at the last year or so, we would like to think at least that our performance looks very good. If you compare the way that we performed to the industry in any important way, we think that it looks very good, and we think that, that's the most important thing, because even when you're looking at kind of the bottom-line, it tends to be -- there's a pretty stable return in general in buying cars from customers. And then there's some variation based on the way the business model is structured. And then it's about how you perform compared to everyone else. And we think, in the long run, that's what really matters the most.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Bottiglieri with PNB Paribas Exane. Please go ahead.\nChris Bottiglieri: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I actually had a question. So it seems like you rebranded your third party reconditioning units as marketplace units. At the same time, you are moving forward with Hertz as a large third party seller. So if you think about your decision and the recognition units. Is there an opportunity to use these partners in conjunction with third party sellers like Hertz? Or do you foresee them reconditioning their own units? Maybe talk about that more, please?\nErnest Garcia: Chris, I apologize. I don't think we've really answered one of your questions in like four or five quarters. So we definitely will reach an answer at some point. But I do think it's early in the Hertz partnership. It's early in marketplace in general. I think there's a lot of room for those choices to continue to evolve. And so I think we're not going to provide additional color at this time and I apologize.\nChris Bottiglieri: At least you're keeping count of it, I appreciate that. Let's move on to SG&A then. Is there a way to bifurcate -- further bifurcate SG&A cost between retail and wholesale? So I'm trying to understand like, how much incremental SG&A you incur to wholesale trade-in versus retailing it? Like further, if you buy a car from a customer but you don't sell one to a customer, how different is the SG&A profile of that transaction versus buying and selling to the customer? Just trying to understand how trade-ins is impacting your SG&A per unit and personnel costs?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yeah. So I mean, I think if you start at a high level, buying cars from customers does incur additional operational requirements and then it does incur additional costs. Some of those costs show up in cost of goods sold that would be things like going out to the customers door to pick up the car and bringing it back into our network either to be -- get reconditioned to go up on the site or what have you. So that's one cost. There is another set of cost that does impact SG&A. I think the -- just one example of that might be customers calling in to talk about a transaction where they're selling their car to Carvana rather than buying a car from Carvana. So that's an example of a direct effect of buying cars from customers that does show up in SG&A. There's also -- and Ernie sort of touched on these concepts, but there are also some indirect costs of the very rapid growth that we experienced in buying cars from customers in the last couple of quarters. And that just takes the form of everything, just being a bit less efficient. And so I think there's both of those direct costs and indirect costs that are driven by buying cars from customers.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Blackledge with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Max on for John. Just wondering if you could talk us through the constraints on building in the pace of rollout for IRC build, you've already given the guidance for the end of the year, but just looking forward, what are the puts and takes on being able to rollout additional IRCs? And what's the balance there? And then just wondering if you could talk us through a little bit just inventory, like, is there a targeted inventory level that you'd like to get through, typically 4Q would be a build, but 1Q might be not building in a typical environment, is that still through for next year, how should we think about that? Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I mean, I think we feel really good about our IRC trajectory. We expect to open eight more new IRCs by the end of 2022. And then with -- when it comes to stopping those IRCs, we are making continual progress. I think many of the initiatives that we have kicked off and have implemented are paying dividends. And we're -- I think, we're seeing nice progress there in terms of the second phase of scaling production capacity, which is building out the team. And so I think we feel good about all of that, I think the -- on the inventory level, I think the simplest way to say it is, we do want to build the selection of cars that are available to customers on our website. We made some progress there in Q3 climbing it to just over 16,000 immediately available units, up from just under 13,000 in Q2. But as we talked about that, that effect was metered somewhat by the steps that we took to manage sales. And so I think we want to keep building that immediately available inventory. We do think selection is a driver of conversion, and a driver of sales. And feel really good about continuing to march up that selection that we're making available to our customers, particularly as we make progress on relieving the other operational constraints throughout the system.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Baker with Davidson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Baker: Hey, thanks. Two questions. I'll ask at the same time, I guess, both related to GPU. One, does reducing the inventory that's available for customers to see that metering process? Does that boost the GPU in any way in that, you can show cars that have better margins, because they don't need as much work or whatever the case may be, it does give a lift to GPU. And then because of that, should we expect GPU to naturally decline? And then I guess, related to the GPU question, I think, inherent in the idea that retail units will equal revenues, is that ASPs flatten out? I think you've said that before and of course, that didn't happen this quarter. Is there any specific reason why we should expect ASPs to flatten out in the fourth quarter? Or is that just sort of the way you plan the business and it may or may not happen, or is there anything that you specifically seeing? Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Yes, on the first question, the answer is no. The cars that get metered sort of the algorithm that goes into deciding which cars to return in search results, in which cars not to is not related to the particular GPUs on the car. So, the answer to that first question is straightforward, no. On the second question, in terms of ASPs, so I think if we think about revenue growth relative to retail unit growth, there's a couple of things that go into that. One is retail ASPs. And I do think that's a component. And I think when we give guidance on revenue growth relative to retail unit growth, that's one of the considerations that goes into it. Second consideration that goes into it is wholesale revenue will impact the ratio of total revenue to retail units. And that's another consideration as well. We did mention in Q3, we metered both retail sales volume and buying cars from customers. And then you might naturally expect metering buying cars from customers have an impact on wholesale volume and revenue.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nick Jones with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Jones: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I think there's a kind of large franchise competitor that's getting into other adjacencies, like trying to, I guess, handle from the logistics for power sports. And there's some other large heavy equipment type logistics, I guess, kind of what are your thoughts on kind of the competitive reaction? I mean, do you think kind of Carvana success has caused some of the larger, maybe more profitable incumbents to react and maybe get ahead of some of the direction Carvana maybe going in the future? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Okay. I didn\u2019t hear the first part of question, but I think I got it now. So what I would say is, I mean, I think, listen, there's -- anytime you're lucky enough to be successful, other people are going to see that. And so I think the kind of this default assumption, anytime you're building a business and you're lucky enough to be on the right path should be to assume that others are going to notice and move in your direction. And then I think that our job as a business is to keep getting better. And I don't know, really how much more color I can give you than that, I think maybe one of the things that's notable and worthwhile would just be, this is hard, right. And I do think that it can -- I don't mean to imply that you're making this mistake. But I think from a distance, it can be easy to make the mistake that any given problem is easier than it actually is. And so this is a very fundamentally difficult problem. I'll start with talking about on the U side, but you'll be able to quickly kind of adjust that for new products as well. But when you're buying a car that is -- that varies in quality, when you're running it through remanufacturing process, where you're putting $1,000 of parts and labor into that car, when you're shipping that car around the country in order to give customers a really broad selection. When you're handling trade-ins, when you're handling warranty, when you're providing customer with financing, and you're verifying the information that they send over in financing, when you're registering cars across 50 states and all the different counties that vary in their registration requirements. There's just so much work that goes into that. And I think that it can be easy at first to start with kind of visibility from a distance of maybe the buttons that get clicked on a website and then to believe that that's something that's relatively straightforward to replicate. And I think our view would be that, we've worked really, really hard, running as fast as we possibly can with a bunch of incredible people that have been extremely motivated over a long period of time. And we still have a lot of running left to do. So we think that our job is to keep getting better. We think that we should expect people to notice the success that we're having. And we also think that the stuff that we built in the past that now sits behind us, is a pretty big moat and then there's a lot of stuff left that we're going to build in the future that once we climb that hill, that'll turn into a moat as well. So I think we'd have to keep running our plays, I think.\nNick Jones : Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Naved Khan with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. This is Robert on from Naved. Thanks for taking the question. I have one for Mark and one for Ernie. So Mark, I think in your prepared remarks, you said, you guys expect operational constraints to improve in the fourth quarter. Is there any color given how we should think about unit growth on a sequential basis? And then actually, Ernie can answer this question. But Mark, you did just touch on it on the wholesale side, was going to ask if you're seeing increased three throughput vehicles into the wholesale channel due to some of the operational constraints but also, are you guys seeing higher demand in the wholesale channel because there's demand to stockpile vehicles and mid inventory supply constrained in the market right now.\nErnie Garcia: Sure, so yeah, I mean, on the first point, yeah, we expect to increase our operational capacity in Q4 with an eye toward 2022. So it's always a goal. And Q4 is always a very significant investment period for us as we work to ramp operational capacity in preparation for the first half of the following year and that's exactly our plan this year. On the second question, I think the -- so the -- our wholesale volume has been very strong. And our wholesale GPUs have been strong as well, I do think that's partly due to -- particularly the GPUs are partly due to a strong wholesale market. There's been a lot of commentary out there, which I'm sure you're aware of as well about that we've seen a lot of appreciation in the wholesale market this year. And so that some of the dynamics that you outlined are certainly playing out. I think we've also made really great fundamental improvements in the way that we are able to buy cars from customers, both from an awareness perspective, as well as from a process and technology perspective, so that's certainly driving some of our volume as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot, and good afternoon. My question is around the metering again, have you eased on the metering in the fourth quarter yet?\nErnie Garcia: We have not materially eased on the metering. There's a couple steps that we took that we probably have pulled back on a bit, but not materially. And again, I want to restate, I do think the moves that we made to meter sales were real, and they weren't impact. But the bigger impact is just the constraints that already existed in the system before. So hopefully, that's at least directionally helpful.\nSeth Basham: Okay, that's helpful. And we found a lot of the metering, at least as a relates to the number of units shown to customers on the West Coast market to be more severe than other areas of the country. What is the reason for that? That's because of a lack of proximity to IRC or something else?\nErnie Garcia: So, I'm going to try to answer that question more generally, what I would just say is, I do think, as it relates to the particular move of impacting the number of cars that show up in a search result, we do have the ability to kind of provide more relief to different groups based on the cars that we choose to suppress. And so, if we have really busy logistics legs, then maybe cars that would need to traverse those logistics legs to get to a certain market, they may not be displayed in that market, when we're trying to handle a situation like this, if we have certain classifications of cars that require more work from certain operational groups inside of customer care, then we may be more inclined to suppress that inventory in more locations, so that less of that type of work needs to be done if that particular customer care group is behind. And so we really can operate that, as you know, I don't say perfectly surgically, but fairly surgically. And so it's been, it's a high quality tool for us to use in a situation like this. And I didn't get the degree to which we use it does vary by location and by classification of inventory type.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Colantuoni with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Colantuoni: Thanks for the questions. I've two. Just wanted to start with consumer purchases, maybe you could talk about how much of the increase in consumer purchases is just out of necessity, because of the tight wholesale market you felt versus your view that it's just simply a more profitable, inefficient channel for inventory. And related to that once new car manufacturing gets back on track, do you envision pulling back on customer purchases, perhaps to a point where it's back towards the levels that you're targeting at your Investor Day as a percentage of total sales? And I have a follow up.\nErnie Garcia: Sure, well, you're not adhering to the one puff of follow-up roll band, but we'll do our best to answer. So I think, first of all, isn't buying cars from customers. I think that's the thing would not be the way that I would describe it. I think the way I would describe it is it's better. It's -- it allows us to provide a high-quality experience to a customer that we're buying a car from, and then it gets us access to higher quality food inventory that is on average more profitable and so we want to do as much of that as we possibly can. We want to build the business capacity you'll to handle as much of that as we possibly can. Now, I do think that we're in a very unique market today, where acquisition channel is very, very important. And normally, across time, if we go back to this kind of 20 year we talked about before, if you look at different acquisition channels, you tend to see margins that are available that are fairly stable, there can be kind of idiosyncratic differences between the channels, but generally speaking, they're fairly stable. I think today, the best source is probably customer lease returns. There's a Cox Automotive keeps an index on the amount of equity that lease returns have. And recently that numbers eclipsed $8,000, which an enormous number, right, that number is normally closer to zero, that means the customer is returning a car and kind of dropping off the keys and walking away from a lease that car has $8,000 of positive equity in it. So that's an enormously advantaged channel in this environment. On the other side, you have auction, which has been heavily constrained in this environment, there are many dealers that are constrained in inventory. And as a result, many of the off-lease cars for the reason that I suggested before, and for the reason of dealers being constraints aren't making it all the way to auction. There's been a few repos because there's been really high-quality customer credit performance. So there's less of that showing up in the market. The rental fleets have struggled to get cars to haven't been depleting. So it's been less of that in the market. And so, that market has been very tight. And as a result the margins that are available in the auction market are very small. And so that means that kind of the channel buying parts and customers is even better today than normal. Our expectation, again, just given the kind of very strong persistent forces that have existed over a very long period of time in this market would be that, as all these idiosyncratic, strange things that are going on in the world today start to normalize, we'll probably see these markets move in more normal ways relative to one another kind of to have they have in the past. I don't know that that changes a ton for us, because I think today, we're in the lucky position to be able to buy many cars from customers and also have access to auctions. So I'm not sure it changes a ton for us. But I think that as that happens, you I could imagine that the best answer is for shifting to some degree and we'll react as intelligently as we can in those moments.\nJohn Colantuoni: Thank you. And one quick one, it looks like compensation expense per unit sold was up 30% year-on-year. Just talked about if that's a reflection of higher employee cost from the capabilities, you're building around customer acquisitions and how we should think about the trajectory of compensation expenses. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So the largest component of the compensation expense per retail unit that we saw in Q3 relative to last year, it really is just building the team, both in advance of 2022. And just making sure that we're prepared for the first half of 2022. And also for the long-term, I think we see so many opportunities throughout the business, and so many places where we believe we can invest in the team that can help us scale the business and help us take advantage of some of these opportunities. So, those were definitely components. I think buying more cars from customers was a component as well, as I mentioned, there's some compensation expenses there that show up in SG&A. And then the last thing that I would point to is, we were operationally constrained. And so when you're investing for next year, and you're investing for the long-term, but you're operationally constrained and meter sales as a result, that can also lead to per unit impact. So those are some of the primary points that I would call out.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nEdward Yruma: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking all the questions. You guys have been really clear about some of the backlogs and reconditioning. I wanted to ask a little bit though there's been some negative pressure around customer service issues. How do you feel about the strength of the organization today as it relates to customer satisfaction? And do you think that that's something you have to look at metering as well? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think you'll first and foremost delivering great customer experiences is why we're here and it's the most important thing that we do. So it's something that's always at the absolute top of our mind in everything we do. I think through out these constrained periods, we've continued to deliver customer experiences that get rated much higher than anything else in automotive retail and you're at levels on par with some of the best customer experiences out there. That said, across time, across the years, and certainly recently as well, when we are constrained and as to use the language I use earlier, our service levels get impacted, that does lead to the directional impact that you would expect in customer experiences. And so, we have seen that and that also absolutely went into the rationale for choosing to proactively meter sales, while we kind of reduce pressure and caught up. And we've seen that have the effect that we would like to see. We've seen a pretty strong move back toward the levels that we more traditionally have been at. We still got a little bit of room to go there, but we've seen a strong move. So I think throughout the customer experience in general have been great. But they definitely are impacted by constraints when we have them. And so it's our job to alleviate those constraints and to build the business in a way that puts no impact whatsoever on customers. But we have had some impacts. And of course, we can continue to get better.\nEdward Yruma: Thanks so much.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nErnie Garcia: Perfect. Well, thanks everyone for joining the call. And thanks everyone on the Carvana team. I always say the same thing here. And I apologize for not being more creative. But this was another great quarter, we faced a number of challenges that we didn't foresee. And once again, you rose the challenge and put us in a great spot. And that's why we continue to be in the place that we're in. That's why we keep marching toward the goals that we mutually share. So thank you so much for everything that you're doing. We wouldn't be here without you. Talking about next quarter. Thanks.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded.

            "content": "Thanks Mike and thanks everyone for joining the call. The third quarter was another great quarter for Carvana as we continue to march toward becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. We sold over 110,000 cars to customers; recorded nearly $3.5 billion of revenue; grew total gross profit by 100%; and had our second consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA. Our team delivered these strong numbers despite entering the quarter with significant operational constraints, facing the Delta COVID wave that peaked late in the quarter, and despite making the choice to meet both retail and purchasing volume, which we implemented mid-quarter to ease pressure on the system, while we operationally catch up to demand we're seeing. Since the onset of the pandemic, we found ourselves constrained in various parts of our operational chain. While those constraints hold us back relative to where we might have otherwise been, our team has done an exceptional job and has made tremendous progress throughout. In fact, in the third quarter, we bought and sold over three times as many cars as we did in the third quarter of 2019 prior to the pandemic, and roughly, eight times as many as we did in the third quarter of 2018. This is all been possible because we've continued to focus on the long-term, we continue to invest in the people, technology, and infrastructure that are necessary to buy and sell millions of cars per year, while delivering the exceptional customer experiences we become known for. Given our opportunity, we believe this is clearly the right choice. To everyone across Carvana has worked so hard to make our continual progress possible, thank you. We've also recently entered into two exciting partnerships with Rooting with Hertz that we discussed in more detail on our Shareholder Letter. While the potential of these opportunities is significant, they're both at their very early stages, so we plan to share additional details on our products, financial, and scale ambitions with respect to these partnerships over time and we'll not be providing meaningful additional color at this time. These partnerships are each very exciting, each has excellent underlying fundamentals and therefore, excellent potential. But they're also exciting because of what they represent. As we continue building the Carvana platform to deliver exceptional customer experiences and to handle the constantly increasing scale, our horizontal and vertical opportunities continue to increase. As has been the case since our inception, to maximize our opportunity, we must thoughtfully assess and continually increase the capacity of the business to effectively manage our growth and to simultaneously explore these opportunities. And then we must appropriately balance our ambition for both scale and scope with the focus necessary to make constant forward progress. So far, we'd like to think our team has done a good job at building more capacity in the business to tackle these opportunities and at managing these trade-offs given the capacity we have. To build Carvana into what it can be, we'll need to continue to spend energy getting this right in the future and we plan to. Looking forward, we remain extremely excited. We've reached a scale of over 100,000 cars and $3.5 billion of revenue per quarter, yet we're still only approximately 1% of the overall market. Our focus today is the exact same as it was the very beginning. It remains on our customers, on the experiences we give them, on maximizing the value we provide to them, on leveraging technology to minimize our costs, on building for scale, and on doing all of that with along long-term perspective so we can maximize our opportunity. The march continues. Mark? Sure. So, let me start with the constraints that we've been facing and then we can kind of go from there. I think the primary driver of constraints was definitely the very significant growth we saw in the entire business, but most notably, buying cars from customers in Q2, which then has continued and put additional strain on the business. I think it was accentuated by COVID, especially in the inspection centers, and then we found ourselves a little bit behind, it was probably a little bit harder to catch up than it might have otherwise been given the unique hiring environment. And so I think that's kind of, what's been going on from a constraints. To make that a bit clearer to there can be increases in the total amount of work that are necessary inside the business that are actually greater than the increases in transactions that we see. And what I mean by that is, if we get behind, and it takes us a little bit longer to resolve, some customer question, we have to call them back, we'll see more customer calls. If we have a delivery that gets delayed, because the logistics network is kind of really full on certain legs, we have to kind of reschedule that delivery and can put additional strain on logistics network. And so you can actually see kind of, total work and necessary [ph] and the business grow more than just transactions. And so we saw that starting in Q2 and then spilling over into Q3. Now, because of the nature of constraints, I think we faced throughout our life and maybe notably, over the last 18 months, and most specifically, over the last three or four. In general, demand sort of starts to top the funnel, a customer shows up and is interested in buying a car and the likelihood that customer chooses to buy a car from us is a function of many things. It includes whether or not they find the car they're looking for from us, it includes if they have a question, they want to call in and talk to someone, how long does it take us to answer the phone and answer their question? If they're looking for getting a car delivered, they want a look at the delivery date, how quickly can we deliver that car? And so when we say that we're constrained, what we generally mean is that kind of the amount of demand that we're seeing is causing those service levels to be below where we historically have had them and therefore, fewer customers would elect to go through the process with us, and therefore, sales to some degree. And I think that's been active, as I said, throughout our life to varying degrees, and certainly over the last 18 months. The difference this quarter was normally that system can kind of balance itself out, and you'll see service levels kind of move out a little bit, and then that reduces the number of sales that you'll see conditional on demand. And then we catch up, and then it kind of gets back into balance or restarts approach balance. I think just with the speed that we saw, total transactions grow, that moved more than we would have liked for it to move. So, we were in a position where we kind of chose to just take those same drivers, effectively reduction of conversion, which there were several, but the most notable of which was choosing to be really surgical with what inventory was displayed and what places and we just reduce the amount of inventory that customers can see in certain places. That ends up being a very powerful tool, because we can reduce amount of inventory that people see in certain markets, it's the logistics legs to that market are very constrained. We can reduce certain classifications of vehicles and maybe have more work associated with them on average, if we have certain groups that we need to alleviate pressure on. And so that was a very effective tool for us to use and the effects from a customer perspective to just the average customer saw fewer cars than they would have otherwise seen and therefore they're likely to find the car they were looking for was lower. In terms of quantifying it, wouldn't want to precisely quantified that it wasn't a factor -- it wasn't an overwhelming effect. I think the bigger effect is just kind of the degree to which we've been behind in general over a longer period of time. But that certainly wasn't affecting the quarter and then that's the way that we implemented that tool set to put ourselves in a better position allow ourselves to catch up so that we can get back out in front of all the demand that we're seeing. First order a person issue. And I think it extends to inside of Carvana across all of our different operational groups and then also outside of Carvana. Many different groups that we get -- when we buy cars from customers, for example, we're generally reaching out to a bank and we're dealing with a payoff and then we're asking for the title in return. Many banks are understaffed in this environment relative where they like to be. Those processes can take longer. So, I think it's first order of person issue inside of Carvana and outside of Carvana. And then I think that across time, as we kind of outlined our priorities in the past, if your customer experience first volume, GPU, and then expenses and expenses generally means building more technology to automate more of the process. So, that's also part of it. Many of these processes, we can continue to further automate across time. But that's generally longer lead-time than the more immediate, kind of, fast-acting solution of getting more people. Sure. So, on the first ,I would say we believe a widened in the quarter and I think the kind of first way that we would articulate that is just in this quarter, we took additional steps to meet our demand that we're proactive and we're just kind of natural system balancing. So, I do think it widens. Now, like I also want to make sure, when we're sitting here talking about constraints, I think I want to make sure and point out the success that we've had alleviating those constraints over time and the quality of work our team has done to do that. So, as I said, this is my prepared remarks, but I got to repeat it, we've been constrained over the last 18 months and yet over the previous two years, in terms of total transactions correspond to all the customers we've grown by three times over the last three years, it's eight times. So, while we've been constrained relative to the demand that we're seeing, we've also been scaling very quickly. And I think the teams have done an exceptional job. They've been under a lot of pressure, with the demand that we've been seeing, and I think they've just continually fought very hard to catch up. And so we're extremely grateful to them and I do believe they've done a great job. As relates to the cadence of the inspections that are rollout, we've only kind of to provide the information that we expect to open eight by the end of 2022. And so we're going to stick with that for now for the kind of, guidance that we're giving. Sure. So, let me start with this, I think in anything that we do kind of independent of this partnership, or if it's something that we're building ourselves generally that the framework that we use to evaluate it is, we want to make sure that we can give a high quality differentiated customer experience. We want to make sure that we believe in the long-term economics of whatever we're doing and then we want to make sure that we build it for scale, because if those first two things are true, then you're going to be able to scale it over time. And I think that that's the way that we generally think about all these opportunities. I think you'll -- from there, you're going to have this question of do you partner, do you build something yourself? And I think there's a lot of considerations there I think when you can partner -- partner's all kinds of assets that we might not have access to. You can go faster. There's sometimes questions about alignment that you have to try to resolve, you have to come up with terms that are good for both sides. So, there's all kinds of questions around whether or not a partnership makes sense. I'll start with Hertz, I think, as it relates to Hertz, they've got an incredible asset, which is a high quality flow of vehicles coming directly from manufacturer that are then utilized in their rental fleets and then you ultimately, make their way into the hands of another consumer. So, they've got a really high quality asset there. And then I think that would be very hard for us to replicate on our own and then we would like to think at least that what we built which is a really high quality, highly scalable platform to sell cars to customers would be very hard for them to build and so we're natural partners in that way. And so we're excited about the partnership. I think from a scalability perspective, I think, directionally, the way to think about these kinds of partnerships is it means that there's a little bit less work per transaction. And I think that probably that's the most important part of what scalable means. I think, for something to be scalable, there has to be a lot of demand for it. And then the next question is, how much kind of can you grow the amount of work that a company can do and then, to get to units, it's a function of how much work is there per transaction. So, I think that partnership reduces the total amount of work that we have to do to get a car to a customer and so and that way, it's exciting. Now, it's extremely early and we've been testing this for a number of months and then we signed a broader deal with them in the last couple of weeks. So, this will take time for us to figure out and nail but I think there's a lot of interesting potential there. To try to touch on Root, I think, we consider Root in the same way. The insurance business is a very complicated business. It's a business that has a lot more complication under the covers when you really kind of dig in, that you might imagine, from a distance. And I think that they've done a great job building a high quality product over time. So, we think that they're a really natural partner. We share a vision for what a solution is supposed to look like, we share a view that it takes a ton of work to build anything great. And I think that's really important, because that means we can both pour work into it. And so I think that's also an exciting opportunity for us, but it's also very early. And so as it relates to both those partnerships, we're very excited about their potential. But it's early and there's a lot of work to do to get those where we would like them to be. So, we'll be working hard to try to get those to the place that we want. So, that's hard, right? I mean I would say constraints show up when we don't -- when we either don't accurately forecast the amounts of work that needs to be done in the future, or if we don't execute as well as we would like. That's what -- that's when they show up. And I think that when we look at where we -- I think that we've executed -- I would like to think at least that we've executed very well through all of this. I think when we look at areas where we maybe didn't accurately forecast what's going to happen. I think this -- several -- especially, the first several COVID waves, we didn't foresee and that led to a decrease in efficiency and therefore, constraints. I think heading into the early part of this year, in Q2, I think we did not foresee all of the growth that we would see, as I said, most specifically, in buying cars from customers and so we weren't prepared for it. I think as long as we're prepared for it, we, again, would like to think that we've demonstrated the ability to execute to very high levels of, kind of, growth. And so I think that constraints really are about our ability to foresee what's going to happen and then our ability to plan for that and execute to that. And so our continual hope is that you this will be the last meaningful COVID wave. We'll find out if that's true or not, we don't quite know. The general, kind of, market across the board is in a bit of a unique spot right now. I'm not sure that was totally foreseen. And then, as I said, buying cars from customers came fast when than we would have otherwise thought. So, what I would say is we're clearly investing right now across the business as aggressively as we feel like we responsibly can to try to catch up, because we do think there's a lot of excess demand there. And so it's hard to predict exactly how all this will unfold, but we're going to be working hard to grow the capacity of the business as quickly as we responsibly can. So, I think that that's the smarter place to err and I think it's the right thing to assume. I think empirically, we're buying more cars from customers than ever and we've seen a massive influx of demand in the last several quarters from an already very high level. So, I think that that speaks to the quality of the offering, but I also think that it's never smart to get comfortable and to stop building. And while we believe we've got the highest quality customer offering today, we also believe we can make it a lot better and a lot of really important ways. And we've got a great team that's focused on that product that has all kinds of interesting plans to continually make it better. So, I think undoubtedly, it's an area that's gotten more attention over the last several years, it probably will continue to get a lot more attention over the next several years. And we'll be continually building to make sure that we keep a spread between the quality of our offering and what else is out there. Sure. So, I don't think we want to jump into the details of intra-quarter growth. What I would say the -- what drove the decision was just that we weren't catching up. And I think that historically, we've been able to catch up faster and we just saw that big influx of demand show up. And then we -- once you see that happen and once you're behind, and then all sudden you face a situation where the amount of work per transaction can start to go up, you run the risk of allowing yourself to get further behind, even if demand stays flat, because the further behind you get, the more work per transaction there is and that can cycle on itself. And so we decided to take the proactive measures to give ourselves a little bit of breathing room just so we could catch back up and so that's what drove it. And again, I think we feel really good about the progress that we're making there. We've given the stats we've made over the last several years, but we've -- even in the last several weeks, we continue to see improvement across all those major groups, whether we're looking at customer care, who's answering customer questions, and handling a lot of the transaction, we've seen our service levels get better there. In logistics, we've seen that get better over the last several weeks. If we're looking at the inspection centers, I think they really have done an amazing job. I mean, the inspection centers -- that's hard when you get behind inspection centers, that's a big industrial undertaking, it takes time to catch back up. And they've caught up, they built inventory in the quarter despite the fact that we faced another COVID wave, which is really tough in general, but it's extremely tough. We have an assembly line structure. So, they've done a great job. Market offices, which handles last-mile delivery has done a great job and we've seen service levels improve there. So, I do think we're seeing improvement which is good, but we remain behind and working hard to catch up. Sure. So I mean, I think we feel really good about our IRC trajectory. We expect to open eight more new IRCs by the end of 2022. And then with -- when it comes to stopping those IRCs, we are making continual progress. I think many of the initiatives that we have kicked off and have implemented are paying dividends. And we're -- I think, we're seeing nice progress there in terms of the second phase of scaling production capacity, which is building out the team. And so I think we feel good about all of that, I think the -- on the inventory level, I think the simplest way to say it is, we do want to build the selection of cars that are available to customers on our website. We made some progress there in Q3 climbing it to just over 16,000 immediately available units, up from just under 13,000 in Q2. But as we talked about that, that effect was metered somewhat by the steps that we took to manage sales. And so I think we want to keep building that immediately available inventory. We do think selection is a driver of conversion, and a driver of sales. And feel really good about continuing to march up that selection that we're making available to our customers, particularly as we make progress on relieving the other operational constraints throughout the system. Sure. Yes, on the first question, the answer is no. The cars that get metered sort of the algorithm that goes into deciding which cars to return in search results, in which cars not to is not related to the particular GPUs on the car. So, the answer to that first question is straightforward, no. On the second question, in terms of ASPs, so I think if we think about revenue growth relative to retail unit growth, there's a couple of things that go into that. One is retail ASPs. And I do think that's a component. And I think when we give guidance on revenue growth relative to retail unit growth, that's one of the considerations that goes into it. Second consideration that goes into it is wholesale revenue will impact the ratio of total revenue to retail units. And that's another consideration as well. We did mention in Q3, we metered both retail sales volume and buying cars from customers. And then you might naturally expect metering buying cars from customers have an impact on wholesale volume and revenue. Sure. Okay. I didn't hear the first part of question, but I think I got it now. So what I would say is, I mean, I think, listen, there's -- anytime you're lucky enough to be successful, other people are going to see that. And so I think the kind of this default assumption, anytime you're building a business and you're lucky enough to be on the right path should be to assume that others are going to notice and move in your direction. And then I think that our job as a business is to keep getting better. And I don't know, really how much more color I can give you than that, I think maybe one of the things that's notable and worthwhile would just be, this is hard, right. And I do think that it can -- I don't mean to imply that you're making this mistake. But I think from a distance, it can be easy to make the mistake that any given problem is easier than it actually is. And so this is a very fundamentally difficult problem. I'll start with talking about on the U side, but you'll be able to quickly kind of adjust that for new products as well. But when you're buying a car that is -- that varies in quality, when you're running it through remanufacturing process, where you're putting $1,000 of parts and labor into that car, when you're shipping that car around the country in order to give customers a really broad selection. When you're handling trade-ins, when you're handling warranty, when you're providing customer with financing, and you're verifying the information that they send over in financing, when you're registering cars across 50 states and all the different counties that vary in their registration requirements. There's just so much work that goes into that. And I think that it can be easy at first to start with kind of visibility from a distance of maybe the buttons that get clicked on a website and then to believe that that's something that's relatively straightforward to replicate. And I think our view would be that, we've worked really, really hard, running as fast as we possibly can with a bunch of incredible people that have been extremely motivated over a long period of time. And we still have a lot of running left to do. So we think that our job is to keep getting better. We think that we should expect people to notice the success that we're having. And we also think that the stuff that we built in the past that now sits behind us, is a pretty big moat and then there's a lot of stuff left that we're going to build in the future that once we climb that hill, that'll turn into a moat as well. So I think we'd have to keep running our plays, I think. Sure, so yeah, I mean, on the first point, yeah, we expect to increase our operational capacity in Q4 with an eye toward 2022. So it's always a goal. And Q4 is always a very significant investment period for us as we work to ramp operational capacity in preparation for the first half of the following year and that's exactly our plan this year. On the second question, I think the -- so the -- our wholesale volume has been very strong. And our wholesale GPUs have been strong as well, I do think that's partly due to -- particularly the GPUs are partly due to a strong wholesale market. There's been a lot of commentary out there, which I'm sure you're aware of as well about that we've seen a lot of appreciation in the wholesale market this year. And so that some of the dynamics that you outlined are certainly playing out. I think we've also made really great fundamental improvements in the way that we are able to buy cars from customers, both from an awareness perspective, as well as from a process and technology perspective, so that's certainly driving some of our volume as well. We have not materially eased on the metering. There's a couple steps that we took that we probably have pulled back on a bit, but not materially. And again, I want to restate, I do think the moves that we made to meter sales were real, and they weren't impact. But the bigger impact is just the constraints that already existed in the system before. So hopefully, that's at least directionally helpful. So, I'm going to try to answer that question more generally, what I would just say is, I do think, as it relates to the particular move of impacting the number of cars that show up in a search result, we do have the ability to kind of provide more relief to different groups based on the cars that we choose to suppress. And so, if we have really busy logistics legs, then maybe cars that would need to traverse those logistics legs to get to a certain market, they may not be displayed in that market, when we're trying to handle a situation like this, if we have certain classifications of cars that require more work from certain operational groups inside of customer care, then we may be more inclined to suppress that inventory in more locations, so that less of that type of work needs to be done if that particular customer care group is behind. And so we really can operate that, as you know, I don't say perfectly surgically, but fairly surgically. And so it's been, it's a high quality tool for us to use in a situation like this. And I didn't get the degree to which we use it does vary by location and by classification of inventory type. Sure, well, you're not adhering to the one puff of follow-up roll band, but we'll do our best to answer. So I think, first of all, isn't buying cars from customers. I think that's the thing would not be the way that I would describe it. I think the way I would describe it is it's better. It's -- it allows us to provide a high-quality experience to a customer that we're buying a car from, and then it gets us access to higher quality food inventory that is on average more profitable and so we want to do as much of that as we possibly can. We want to build the business capacity you'll to handle as much of that as we possibly can. Now, I do think that we're in a very unique market today, where acquisition channel is very, very important. And normally, across time, if we go back to this kind of 20 year we talked about before, if you look at different acquisition channels, you tend to see margins that are available that are fairly stable, there can be kind of idiosyncratic differences between the channels, but generally speaking, they're fairly stable. I think today, the best source is probably customer lease returns. There's a Cox Automotive keeps an index on the amount of equity that lease returns have. And recently that numbers eclipsed $8,000, which an enormous number, right, that number is normally closer to zero, that means the customer is returning a car and kind of dropping off the keys and walking away from a lease that car has $8,000 of positive equity in it. So that's an enormously advantaged channel in this environment. On the other side, you have auction, which has been heavily constrained in this environment, there are many dealers that are constrained in inventory. And as a result, many of the off-lease cars for the reason that I suggested before, and for the reason of dealers being constraints aren't making it all the way to auction. There's been a few repos because there's been really high-quality customer credit performance. So there's less of that showing up in the market. The rental fleets have struggled to get cars to haven't been depleting. So it's been less of that in the market. And so, that market has been very tight. And as a result the margins that are available in the auction market are very small. And so that means that kind of the channel buying parts and customers is even better today than normal. Our expectation, again, just given the kind of very strong persistent forces that have existed over a very long period of time in this market would be that, as all these idiosyncratic, strange things that are going on in the world today start to normalize, we'll probably see these markets move in more normal ways relative to one another kind of to have they have in the past. I don't know that that changes a ton for us, because I think today, we're in the lucky position to be able to buy many cars from customers and also have access to auctions. So I'm not sure it changes a ton for us. But I think that as that happens, you I could imagine that the best answer is for shifting to some degree and we'll react as intelligently as we can in those moments. Sure. So the largest component of the compensation expense per retail unit that we saw in Q3 relative to last year, it really is just building the team, both in advance of 2022. And just making sure that we're prepared for the first half of 2022. And also for the long-term, I think we see so many opportunities throughout the business, and so many places where we believe we can invest in the team that can help us scale the business and help us take advantage of some of these opportunities. So, those were definitely components. I think buying more cars from customers was a component as well, as I mentioned, there's some compensation expenses there that show up in SG&A. And then the last thing that I would point to is, we were operationally constrained. And so when you're investing for next year, and you're investing for the long-term, but you're operationally constrained and meter sales as a result, that can also lead to per unit impact. So those are some of the primary points that I would call out. Sure. So I think you'll first and foremost delivering great customer experiences is why we're here and it's the most important thing that we do. So it's something that's always at the absolute top of our mind in everything we do. I think through out these constrained periods, we've continued to deliver customer experiences that get rated much higher than anything else in automotive retail and you're at levels on par with some of the best customer experiences out there. That said, across time, across the years, and certainly recently as well, when we are constrained and as to use the language I use earlier, our service levels get impacted, that does lead to the directional impact that you would expect in customer experiences. And so, we have seen that and that also absolutely went into the rationale for choosing to proactively meter sales, while we kind of reduce pressure and caught up. And we've seen that have the effect that we would like to see. We've seen a pretty strong move back toward the levels that we more traditionally have been at. We still got a little bit of room to go there, but we've seen a strong move. So I think throughout the customer experience in general have been great. But they definitely are impacted by constraints when we have them. And so it's our job to alleviate those constraints and to build the business in a way that puts no impact whatsoever on customers. But we have had some impacts. And of course, we can continue to get better. Thank you. Perfect. Well, thanks everyone for joining the call. And thanks everyone on the Carvana team. I always say the same thing here. And I apologize for not being more creative. But this was another great quarter, we faced a number of challenges that we didn't foresee. And once again, you rose the challenge and put us in a great spot. And that's why we continue to be in the place that we're in. That's why we keep marching toward the goals that we mutually share. So thank you so much for everything that you're doing. We wouldn't be here without you. Talking about next quarter. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks a lot, Ernie and thank you all for joining us today. Q3 was another strong quarter for Carvana. Retail units sold totaled 111,949, an increase of 74%. Total revenue was $3.48 billion, an increase of 125%. Total gross profit per unit was $4,672, an increase of $616 and the second highest quarter in our history. Retail GPU was $1,769, a decrease of $88. The change in retail GPU was primarily driven by higher reconditioning costs, in part resulting from the impact of the Delta variant on production throughput, and higher wholesale acquisition prices, partially offset by higher customer source ratio. Wholesale GPU was $420, an increase of $154. This was driven by gross profit per wholesale unit of $936 and record wholesale unit volume, which grew 227% year-over-year due to buying more cars from customers. Other GPU was $2,483, an increase of $550. The increase in other GPU is primarily driven by strong finance, execution and a positive impact of higher industry wide vehicle prices on average loan size. EBITDA margin was positive 0.2% in Q3. This marked our second consecutive quarter of both positive quarterly and trailing 12-month EBITDA, despite significant investments for growth in 2022 and beyond. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion total liquidity resources, giving us significant flexibility to execute our plan. We are executing well and remain focused on building our network and increasing our production capacity to meet demand. We grew immediately available inventory to an average of 16,400 units in Q3, an increase from 12,800 units in Q2 despite the impact of the Delta variant on production volume. We remain on track to launch eight new IRCs by the end of 2022 and continue to focus on growing our IRC teams in preparation for future growth. The explosive growth in buying cars and customers we experienced in the past two quarters also placed significant constraints throughout our system in Q3. To ease the pressure on our system, we began metering both retail units and cars bought from customers mid-quarter to allow our operational capacity to catch up to demand. Most notably, to manage retail sales volume, we reduced the number of vehicles shown to customers in search results, which limited the benefits of higher immediately available inventory on retail units sold. We expect to increase our operational capacity in Q4 with an eye toward 2022. Looking forward, we expect to complete a record year on retail units, revenue, total GPU, and EBITDA margin in 2021. In Q4, we expect retail unit growth to continue to be governed primarily by our operational capacity. We expect revenue growth to be more closely aligned with retail unit growth in Q4 than it was in Q3. We expect total GPU in the low to mid-4,000s for the full year, marking our eighth consecutive year of substantial gains. We expect a seasonal pattern in total GPU in Q4, with Q4 lower than Q3. Finally, we plan to continue to invest in the business both to catch up with current demand and to prepare for growth in 2022 and beyond, leading to a seasonal pattern and SG&A for retail unit in Q4 and close to breakeven EBITDA margin for the full year. We are extremely proud of the progress we've made in company in 2021, navigating the unique macro environment, while delivering rapid growth and managing through operational constraints. Our results relative to the industry continue to leave us more excited than ever about our long-term model and the path toward our goal of delivering more than 2 million retail units per year and becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. So, I can take that one. So, I do think higher used vehicle prices has an impact on demand through an affordability effect. Clearly, there are some customers that are targeting specific monthly payment that meets their budget. And as used vehicle prices rise that -- there's certain customers that are less likely to be able to meet that budget. And so I do think if you look industry-wide, I mean, we're obviously growing incredibly quickly with 74% year-over-year growth despite the constraints that Ernie talked about. But if you looked industry-wide, various data sources have total industry sales down, call it, on the order of 10% to 15% in Q3. And so I do think there's an effect there. We're growing really, really quickly despite that industry-wide effect, which I think is a testament to all the demand that we are seeing. Sure. So let me take a stab at all of the questions in there. So first one talking about Q3 retail GPU, so we had a strong quarter on retail GPU in Q3. It came in at $1,769. I think if we think back prior to COVID, we'd normally expect to see some seasonal decline in retail GPU. I think we saw that for a couple of years prior to COVID. This year, we saw a slightly similar effect even though the -- we're in obviously a very unique environment where we did see early in the quarter, depreciation rates pick up a little bit relative to Q2. And so that definitely had an effect on the sequential change in GPU going from Q2 to Q3. The other thing, I'd call out is we did see higher reconditioning costs on a per unit basis in the quarter. That was driven in part by Delta which definitely impacted production efficiency, which then increases your per unit cost. And so those impacts we saw sort of a similar dynamic late in 2020. The impacts were smaller at this time, but they were there and part of that sequential change. Now as we look forward, you asked a couple of questions about retail GPU on a go-forward basis. So our assumptions for retail GPU in Q4 are embedded in our guidance for the full year. We typically don't break down individual components of that guidance, but we gave you some guidance on total GPU. And then looking out a bit further toward 2022, you asked about the possible labor market effects on the reconditioning costs. And there I would say it's too early to say. I think we can wait and see how that goes looking out in 2022. But in any event any sort of labor cost adjustments are likely to be relatively small compared to the overall magnitude of retail GPU and overall reconditioning costs. So an area that would be my thought on your third question. Sure. Yeah. So other GPU came in again at I believe we said $2,483. It was down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. I think the sequential movement in other GPU is well within the normal range that we would expect from quarter-to-quarter. So it's sort of well within sort of normal range of variability. In this particular case, I would say the biggest driver of the sequential change was just in finance, some rate optimizations that led to slightly lower interest rates that came on sort of late Q2, early Q3 would be the largest driver of a relatively small change. Sure. Yeah. So I mean, I think if you start at a high level, buying cars from customers does incur additional operational requirements and then it does incur additional costs. Some of those costs show up in cost of goods sold that would be things like going out to the customers door to pick up the car and bringing it back into our network either to be -- get reconditioned to go up on the site or what have you. So that's one cost. There is another set of cost that does impact SG&A. I think the -- just one example of that might be customers calling in to talk about a transaction where they're selling their car to Carvana rather than buying a car from Carvana. So that's an example of a direct effect of buying cars from customers that does show up in SG&A. There's also -- and Ernie sort of touched on these concepts, but there are also some indirect costs of the very rapid growth that we experienced in buying cars from customers in the last couple of quarters. And that just takes the form of everything, just being a bit less efficient. And so I think there's both of those direct costs and indirect costs that are driven by buying cars from customers."

And now with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thanks Mike. And thanks everyone for joining the call.  The second quarter was a landmark quarter for Carvana and one that will always play a central role in our story. It was the first quarter we delivered, delivered over a 100,000 cars to our customers. It was our first quarter of over $3 billion in revenue. It was the first quarter we achieved $5,000 total GPU. It was the first quarter we hit a $100 million EBITDA and it was our first quarter of positive net earnings. It was also the first quarter we made the Fortune 500 list. And to top it all off, we're now one of the four fastest companies to ever make the list organically along with Amazon, Google and Facebook. Those were some pretty great headlines. On that demand we take a step back for a minute to put it on context. Five years ago, the year before we went public, we sold 18,000 cars in the full year. We just sold over five times that many in a single quarter, five years ago, our total GPU was $1,000. This quarter it was $5,000. Five years ago, we lost $0.25 for every $1 of revenue we made. This quarter we made money for the first time. That's a lot of progress in a short amount of time. When we evaluate that progress, sometimes we all have a tendency to zoom in too far and this is what really makes it all possible. So I want to try to tell the simplest version of our story that I can. When we started 8.5 years ago, we were a bunch of ambitious kids with a shocking amount to learn. With the benefit of hindsight is now clear we had no idea what we were getting into, but we did know a couple of things. We knew customer preferences were changing. We knew technology was evolving. We knew the traditional way of buying a car had changed less than it should have. We believe we could do better for our customers. We knew that we were working for them and we had a plan. We also knew we had a great team. We knew how to get the best out of each other. We knew how to spot people that could make us better. We knew how to have fun. We believe in what we were doing. We knew we could figure out the rest along the way, and we didn't know how to quit. Those were important things to know. That simple knowledge got us to today. And today's a pretty good day. Along the way we've learned a lot. One of the important lessons is that everything worth doing is hard. So doing worthwhile things means they're often more hard days and easy ones. From here, I hope we don't get complacent. I hope we keep fighting. I hope we take on the hard days and keep doing things worth doing. I hope we keep learning. And I hope that we never let the new lessons crowd out the things that we knew at the beginning. It seems like that might be the classic mistake that people make over time. I hope we avoid it. And I believe that we will. If we do our future is bright. The things that were true at the beginning are all still true today. Customer preferences will always change and technology will always evolve. As a result there will always be opportunity. We're nowhere near realizing the opportunity, the potential that we saw from the beginning and additional potential reveals itself all the time. We'll keep chasing it. And as long as we keep our eyes open wide enough, we'll never catch it. The march continues. Mark?\nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie. And thank you everyone for joining us today. Q1 was a record quarter for Carvana. We said company records across many key financial metrics and made significant progress toward our long-term goals. Retail units sold in Q2 totaled 107,815, our first quarter over 100,000 units and an increase of 96%. Total revenue was $3.3 billion, an increase of 198%. This strong growth came despite operational constraints we faced during the quarter. Total gross profit per unit was 5,120 in Q2, the highest level in company history. It increased $2,394 year-over-year and $1,464 sequentially. Since Q2 2020 was impacted by COVID-19. I will focus my remaining commentary on sequential changes. Retail GPU was $2022, an increase of $811. Our growth in retail GPU was primarily driven by four factors. One, increased buying cars from customers. Two, an appreciating retail and market pricing environment, which was partially offset by higher wholesale acquisition prices. Three, optimizing our vehicle mix and pricing to match our production capacity and available inventory goals. And four, moving beyond the majority of the COVID-19 related transitory costs we experienced in Q4 and Q1. Wholesale GPU was $547, an increase of $320. This was driven by record gross profit per wholesale unit sold of $1,254 and record wholesale unit volume. Record gross profit per wholesale unit sold was primarily driven by strong industry-wide wholesale pricing and increased wholesale unit volume came from growth in buying cars from customers. Other GPU was 2,551, an increase of $333. This sequential increase was driven by a positive impact of higher industry-wide vehicle prices on average loan size and another strong quarter of execution by our finance team. EBITDA margin was positive 3.4% and improvement from negative 6.2% in the prior period. We achieved our second quarter of positive EBITDA and our first ever quarter of positive net income. On July 1, we up-sized our inventory floor plan facility by $500 million to $1.75 billion bringing total liquidity resources to nearly $2 billion, giving us significant flexibility to execute our plan. We are executing well and remain focused on building our network and increasing our production capacity to meet demand. This quarter, we demonstrated significant progress on these fronts, but our rapid growth in both retail units and buying cars from customers led to strains throughout our operational chain, that we are also focused on alleviating. In Q2, we grew average weekly vehicle production by 20% sequentially. This increase was driven by additional staffing efforts and the opening of our 13th IRC near Cleveland, Ohio. Across these 13 IRCs, our total annual production capacity is approximately 750,000 units at full utilization. We remain on track to open eight additional IRCs by the end of 2022, bringing our total capacity at full utilization to over 1.25 million units. Looking at forward, we expect to complete a record year on retail units, revenue, total GPU and EBITDA margin in 2021. We expect retail unit growth to continue to be governed primarily by our operational capacity. In the second half, we expect revenue growth to be more closely aligned with retail unit growth. As we move beyond prior year comparison periods that were most by COVID 19. Expect total GPU over 4,000 for the full year significantly exceeding our mid 3,000 outlook at the beginning of the year and marking our eighth consecutive year of substantial gains. Finally, given the demand we are seeing, we plan to continue to invest in the business, both to catch up with current demand and to prepare for growth in 2022 and beyond. Leading to a typical seasonal pattern in SG&A per retail unit sold in the second half and close to break even EBITDA margin for the full year. We are extremely proud of the progress we've made as a company over the last several quarters, navigating the COVID-19 pandemic and the unique environment all while delivering rapid growth and managing through operational constraints. Zooming out our results relative to the industry, leave us more optimistic than ever about our long-term model and path toward our goal of delivering more than 2 million retail units per year and becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer. Thank you for your attention. We will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Zach Fadem of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nZach Fadem: Hey, guys, good afternoon and congrats on the progress. So it's been two and a half years now since you gave your 4,000 plus long-term GPU target and 8% to 12% EBITDA margin. And if you think about all the impressive progress you've made, particularly with 5,000 plus GPU today, and then you think about all the ways to take profitability structurally higher, added scale, ancillary services, maybe a marketplace offering, curious how you would frame today, the long-term guideposts for the business. And to what extent, it's now fair to assume that they could be higher than you initially thought in 2018.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, so let me start with, yes, I think that model that we put out in late 2018 was built on kind of deep structural forces inside automotive retail. We did a lot of work trying to understand, what normalized margins are across all the different products and what different groups were able to achieve. And I think that it's pretty deep and foundational. And so we feel really good about that model. And so let me start there. I think we've undoubtedly made a ton of progress. I think if you look at your 2016, the year before we went public. We had a $1,000 GPU. We just had 5,000 for the full year. We're expecting 4,000 plus. I mean, that's obviously lot of progress and it's happened across every single one of the line items. We've also made a lot of progress in some of the expense line items, as well as we've continued to make progress there while we're simultaneously growing. So I do think that, things look really good there, we feel like it's a bit early to update the long-term model, given that this is the first quarter that we've been inside the long-term gross margin target. So I think we want to stick with that model, but we're obviously extremely with the progress that we've made so far.\nZach Fadem: Got it. And then on the pricing environment, obviously a big tailwind today for both the top line and gross profit per unit. But as we look to the second half of the year and anticipate some softening in the wholesale and likely retail market, curious, first of all, if you could talk about where you think pricing is headed, and then can you talk us through just what to expect in terms of usually sales and growth profit outlook if the top line, or if the pricing environment were to soften? We would appreciate the color there.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, let me start by trying to characterize the environment. I do think what characterize this environment is you have very rapid vehicle price appreciation both the wholesale market and the retail market. And it's unlike anything that I've at least ever seen in my career. So I think we've seen very dramatic price appreciation. Now in a normalized environment that doesn't have huge implications for margin. Generally speaking, the gap between wholesale and retail markets are fairly stable. And as price levels move up or down, kind of both markets move in tandem and you don't see super dramatic differences. I think what's unique now is the change had happened so quickly. And I also think many different acquisition sources for vehicles perform differently. So if you look at, many franchise dealers, for example, that are buying many cars off lease, or buying many cars off trade in, have seen pretty dramatic increases in margin. If you look at some independents that are heavily reliant on just the auction market, you're generally seeing a deterioration in margin despite the increasing price environment, because wholesale price have moved up faster than retail prices moved up. So I think what's unique in this environment is the speed of which things have moved. And then the way that has played out differently across different vehicle acquisition channels. For us we've built this channel buying cars from customers that has performed very well for us over a long period of time. We've made continual high-quality progress in both the number of cars we're buying \u2013 the cars we're buying relative to retail sales and the profits that we're making on cars we bought from customers. But I think that channel was especially valuable in this environment where kind of auction spreads collapsed so much. So I do think that there was something of a tailwind that we experienced there, aside now precisely is difficult, associating that precisely with kind of the ASP movements is also difficult because I do just think that these are abnormal moves that we're seeing right now. But I think that it also led to another kind of interesting impact that has implications for the remainder of the year and kind of our overall financial performance. And so what that was because vehicle prices were appreciating so quickly, there were more customers that were willing to sell their car interested in selling their car in this environment than in many other environments. And that led to record increases in the number of cars that we were buying from customers, on feet at any way and in absolute terms or relative to cars that we were selling to customers. So we saw a lot of volume there that did drive some expense. That expense was more than offset by the margins that we were able to realize on those cars. And then that also led to constraints across the business which showed up in a little bit higher SG&A than we probably would have otherwise experienced. As we've tried to catch up to the demand that we're seeing, because a lot of times those kind of incremental levers that you pull are a little more expensive than the levers that you pull it, if you are able to kind of move in a more orderly fashion. So I think those are all the things that we feel like are unique in this environment are moving. I think it is difficult to precisely call the way that we'll all unwind unfold the back half of the year, but our best estimates are taken into account in the outlook we provided.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi, good morning. And good morning, it's been a long day. Good afternoon. And congratulations on profitability. I guess a question on how consumers are dealing with the pricing environment. I mean, are you seeing any increased bulk at prices? Are you having to adjust your inventory mix at all? And is there any kind of change in the average credit that you're seeing?\nErnie Garcia: So I think in general, the adjustments that we've made have been relatively subtle, and they've been more focused on trying to alleviate constraints and trying to be able to grow inventory faster than they've been driven by differences that we're seeing in different demand pockets. I think in general, we feel like we've got more demand than we've been able to satisfy across all demand pockets. So we've made some subtle changes in the mix of cars that we're buying to try to get them through the reconditioning centers faster, so that we can kind of scale inventory more quickly. But other than that nothing, nothing too dramatic. On the credit front, I think across the industry, there's been high quality credit performance. The loans that we originate, we've seen the same, but we do sell those loans off. And so the direct impact of that after the moment of sale is not something that flows through our financial statements.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question and great quarter, guys. Ernie, I just wanted to ask, I think we're quarter into launching the Pacific Northwest just as you launched newer markets and Carvana is now what 75%, 80% of the population in terms of reach, just talk about the benefits of awareness that comes with these newer markets. In other words, is it easier? It's easier now to launch new markets. You're seeing that every single new market that you launch. But when you open up a whole new corridor, like the Pacific Northwest, talk to us more about how the brand has reacted there, that'd be helpful. Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. What I mean, I think, we're continually building the brand out. I think if you look even at our website traffic, for example, improved 25% quarter-over-quarter and very significantly a year-over-year, more than a 100% up year-over-year. So I think that's at least a reasonable measure of the brand that we're building. And I think that we still probably remain in relatively early innings of kind of building that brand. I think, as we've discussed in the past, the way that we like to think about that is you step one of building a brand is generating awareness. Step two is generating understanding of what you do. And step three is generating trust. And I think, we're making positive headway all the time in all those different dimensions, but we're still just an eight and a half year old company that's growing very fast. And even in this last quarter, we sold over a 100,000 cars. When you look at that relative to size of market that was still roughly 1% national market share. So I think it's still very early days. But undoubtedly, the progress that we're seeing in building brands does help us. We've seen these trends across time where our newer cohorts ran faster than older cohorts. We continue to see that. All the other trends we've seen across cohorts, we continue to see. We're obviously seeing very rapid market share increases across all of our cohorts that are supporting the growth that we're seeing. So I think, what's most important now is just continuing to grow and then getting the positive feedback that shows up across the model through that growth by being able to have more inventory available for our customers faster delivery times for average customers. And I think adding the Pacific Northwest was kind of the last big chunk of the U.S. that we weren't connected to and connecting that up as a big deal. And now we've just got filling to do from here and then we've got to keep scaling.\nRon Josey: Great. Thank you, Ernie.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good afternoon. Great quarter. Congratulations.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nBrian Nagel: So the question I have you talk again, I mean, despite the \u2013 just the other strength in the quarter that noted the degree to which sales were still held back by some spikes, right. So I guess the question I have there is how did that progress through the quarter? So as you're exited the quarter, how well are you running it against you\u2019re your supplier running against the demand?\nErnie Garcia: So I think we probably, through the quarter, for the most part progressively more constrained. And I think the driver of that is what we discussed kind of earlier in the call, which is we saw so much growth in offering of buying cars from customers. We grew retail units by 17% quarter-over quarter, but we grew very dramatically in the number of cars that we bought from our customers. And that is really what led to increasing constraints that was hard to foresee and we weren't prepared for that degree of growth that quickly. So I think that's what led to increase in constraints and those constraints can kind of show up across the business. Just because they're driven by buying Carson customers doesn't mean that's the only impact they have when customers are selling their car to us. They're calling in and they're talking to advocates there's a market ops going up and picking out those cars, we've got the logistics network gets involved with that. So as we see growth in any part of the business, it generates constraints across the rest of the business. So I do think we saw those constraints show up. I also think that this is a relatively difficult environment to alleviate constraints, but we've made a ton of headway that we're extremely excited about. So for perspective in July, we increased our average weekly hiring class by about 20% versus what we saw in the average of Q2. We're extremely proud of that. The speed of that move is really strong. The team's done a tremendous job, just kind of leaping to action and, and trying to get back in front of this. And I think it's been a tough environment to do it. I think that's a testament to the quality of opportunity that we offer to applicants that are looking to come to Carvana. I think it's a testament to the career path and that we've built over time and a testament to the team that that's been ramping up very quickly. So I think we're making a lot of progress. We're extremely focused there for the last year, we've been talking about the constraints of inventory and we've been working hard to alleviate that. This last quarter, we grew inventory, which was exciting, we would like to grow it a lot more from here. But then kind of the benefits of kind of alleviating that constraint to a degree, as well as the massive growth that we saw in buying Carson customers led to constraints in other places. And now we got to get to work at alleviating those. And I think we're well on our way.\nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. I appreciate it. My second question [indiscernible] on the Carvana models and capturing, show them the space for some time now. The query is if the economy starts or pulls out of COVID, obviously not an extraordinary fluid situation that, are you seeing with remodeled, increased market share opportunities, maybe as a result of some less efficient retailers having struggled further to the crisis?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think, there may be some like very high level macro trends that result from the crisis and persistent that have some impacts on the opportunity. But I think that's very secondary to just what we can do as a company. I think, a useful way to kind of think about how things are moving is, so far the first half of the year, roughly speaking of sales volumes across the industry have been roughly flat to 2019. So that just gives you a sense of kind of where we are, obviously they dropped in 2020 and they've come back and they're kind of leveled to 2019 right now give or take a little bit. In that time, we've increased our population coverage by about 21%. But we've increased sales by more than 2.5x. So we're clearly taking very significant market share. I spoke earlier a bit about the cohorts. If we look at our individual markets or cohorts, those continue to ramp up very nicely. The trends that we've seen are in place there. We now have a handful of markets that are over 3% market penetration, including some of our oldest and most mature markets. So I think that's all really exciting and that's all happening in the context of us being heavily constrained right now. So I think the opportunity is really, really large. We feel like as long as we keep delivering great customer experiences and executing and growing that's going to be the primary driver of our growth. And some of the macro factors you pointed to may also kind of push our direction a bit, but we think it's mostly about the customer experiences we deliver in our own execution.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rajat Gupta of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRajat Gupta: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the strong quarter. Just the $2,000 retail GPU number, is there any way to unpack that a little bit in terms of how much of that is temporary versus structural improvements that you might have seen in the business that might sustain not just like in the second half, but into next year and beyond. And then, a follow-up on the SG&A leverage, you talked about like some of the incremental transaction that would cause you to more sourcing. But in terms of, just looking at the fixed cost leverage, if I just look at like the comp and benefits and the other SG&A buckets, one of those buckets seem to grow more than the number of units you have grown over 2019. [ph] This is the questions there is like, are you \u2013 do you feel like you're having to do a lot more handholding of the customer during the transaction that you may have liked. I'm just curious how that's going and how that's progress over the last couple of years. And really like when can we see that fixed cost leverage start coming through in the model? Thanks. Sorry for the long question.\nMark Jenkins: Yes. Great. Let me start by taking the Retail GPU question, then we'll move on to the SG&A question. So on retail GPU, we had our first quarter over 2000 retail GPU. We've come close a couple times before. I think we've done 1850 before and 1700 not including adjustments also in 2020, but the 2000 is a record for us. I think if we think through the drivers I think maybe it's helpful to think through it, sequentially from Q1, the biggest driver there was certainly the performance buying cars from customers. Ernie talked a little bit about that, but we had a great quarter for buying cars from customers, record volume both in an absolute sense and as ratios to retail units. And so that was a big, that was a big driver. There were several other factors that drove retail GPU, as we compare to Q1, those include when you think there was a net tailwind from the appreciating retail environment. But that was certainly partially offset by rapidly rising wholesale prices. And so as we \u2013 as Ernie alluded to, I think, we haven't seen when we look out across the industry dealers who rely heavily on auction or have a higher auction share of inventory, do quite as well as those that are really buying a lot of cars off lease and off trade in. But we do think there was some impact there. In addition, we made some vehicle mix and pricing optimizations doing things like trying to buy cars that we think could get through the reconditioning centers more quickly. For example and then finally, we did \u2013 finally move beyond the transitory costs, the majority of the transitory costs that we experienced in Q4 and Q1. And so I think when and those costs being related to COVID-19 particularly the later waves in Q4. So I think when you put all that together, I think we feel really great about our retail GPU progress. Buying cars from customers continues to be a strong driver of the improvement within the business. It's something we're going to look to continue to do going forward. And obviously excited about our progress. So I'll stop there on retail GPU. Moving to your question on SG&A. So, I think there's several drivers of our investment in SG&A. So is we take a narrow view into Q2. There's a few things I'd point to. The first is that we bought significantly more cars from customers in Q2 that we did in the prior quarter. And there are expenses associated with that. So that obviously there's big selection and GPU benefits associated with it as well. There's also expenses associated with that. And so, looking at SG&A per retail unit basis doesn't necessarily capture the investment that we're making to drive the business of buying cars from customers as well. So that's point one. Point two is we are absolutely investing for the future. That investment takes a couple of different forms. First, we're already preparing for 2022, a large business that's growing at extremely fast rates. And what that means is you have to plan ahead to ensure that have put the necessary infrastructure into place to be able to satisfy very large amounts of demand at large scale. And so we're already investing for 2022 and that's a component of it. And then finally, I would say we're also investing for the long term. So as Ernie alluded to, in some of his prepared remarks, we see opportunities everywhere in the business, I think opportunities to improve the customer offering, opportunities to drive additional revenue and GPU by making the business more efficient. I think, there are many, many places where over a multi-year horizon, we see very significant opportunities and we're going to invest in those opportunities. We think it's the right thing to do for the business and for our long-term shareholders. And so those would be the three points that I would make on SG&A.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMichael Montani: Hey, good evening. And thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to ask about on the GPU front, maybe one way to come at, it would be $1,500 step up sequentially sort of a 40% improvement versus 1Q. And then if you do the same kind of math versus 2019, 2Q stepped up 750, which was like a 30% increase. So does the incremental 10% relate basically to the price appreciation in the market? Is that kind of a fair way to think about it?\nErnie Garcia: First of all, I think probably when you're thinking about margin, thinking about it in dollars instead of percentage terms is probably a better way to think about it. I think generally speaking margins kind of move more in dollars than they do in percentage terms across the industry. So I would start there. I think there's a lot that that is different, this year then just 2019. But I think the thing that we would point to is that is the biggest by a long, long way is just buying cars and customers. We just saw a massive, massive increase in the number of cars we're buying from customers and in the profitability of buying cars from customers. And I think that flowed through, and I think I want to be careful not to be too repetitive with the GPU answer that that Mark has provided, but I think everything that he outlined is also correct. And I think you can kind of look back on how some of those line items have moved historically, and kind of what some of our different high watermarks have been and get a sense of what the size of some of those impacts might have been. But I think, that's probably the best I can do to try to be helpful there.\nMichael Montani: And then maybe the follow-up on that, I guess, in terms of the second half outlook for the GPU, it seems to be implied like 3,500 to 3,700 in the back half. And so I guess I just wanted to understand is that kind of how much of that is sort of normal seasonality, what'd you say versus maybe some other factors we just need to be mindful of?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think, at a high level we're trying to provide you a sense of how things moved in the quarter and what we think are some of the unique drivers in the quarter. And then I think, from here, we basically expect some normalization of some of those factors paired with normal seasonality, and then that's taken into account in our outlook, which we raise from mid-3000s to over $4,000 for total GPU for the year which is obviously a huge move for us to be making is something that we're extremely excited about.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nick Jones of Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Jones: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two, one, how are you thinking about inventory levels normalizing, is this kind of over the next couple of quarters is going to go into next year, I guess, how are you thinking about inventory availability normalizing kind of from here and then as it does normalize other kind of spurts of kind of choke points in the logistics network. Do you feel like you'll be well positioned when things are normalize and you can really kind of meet the demand particularly in your new markets? Because in the past there has been times where there has been some logistical choke points, just any thoughts on that would be great. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So maybe let me try to break that into piece. I think what's going on at the industry level is probably most specifically kind of driven by OEM new car manufacturing issues. And I think that that is likely kind of the key driver that has led to a vehicle price appreciation in both new and used. I think trying to figure out when that will normalize is a very difficult question. I think everybody has tried to do that over the last years, has at least so far been wrong. And I think maybe simplified model to use for thinking about that is just that those OEMs have complicated global supply chains, which obviously includes the microchips that I was paying close attention to, but include many other parts as well.  And as we've seen different waves of COVID kind of move through different parts of the world, we've generally seen supply constraints show up in their supply chains and that's kind of driven vehicle price appreciation. That seems like that's probably the number one driver of kind of the unique behavior that we're seeing in the market right now. And we wouldn't want to make a specific estimate of when that's likely to normalize and how that would work through their supply chains. But we think that that's probably the underlying cause. As it relates to our inventory, I think, we're in a pretty simple place right now where what we want is more. We feel like we've got significantly more demand than we're able to handle. And we think that we have a good understanding of the relationships between inventory size and conversion. And so we would love to have significantly more inventory. We're working incredibly hard through the addition of additional inspection centers to adding lines at inspection centers. We've got a plan to have 1.25 million production capacity by the end of next year. So we're working really hard to build up more capacity and also to ramp up our production as quickly as we possibly can. I think we've seen great progress there. We grew retail units by 17% last quarter, but we were able to grow production capacity by more than that, which allowed us to build inventory. So we're just going to keep moving as fast as we can there and trying to build inventory as quickly as we can. And then as it relates to the other constraints that emerged across the business, I think, inventory is definitely the stickiest and hardest to resolve of the constraints that we can face because once you kind of get behind them production relative to sales, you've got work to do to catch back up to sales. And while you're doing that work to catch up, you're shrinking your inventory. And then once you're there, you're still just kind of holding flat and now you've got to get in front of it to build inventory. That's a long process. And then it's also obviously a very complicated operational undertaking. So we've been hard at work on that one for the last year plus. And I think we've made tremendous progress, especially in light of the several COVID waves that we've seen. We'll keep working on that one. On the other constraints, historically, at least we've generally been able to resolve those much faster. Those are generally not as complicated, they don't necessarily have physical facilities related to them. They don't necessarily have zoning and construction timelines associated with them. So generally, we can move faster than the other operational groups. As I said earlier, we've made a lot of progress heading into early Q3. We did get pretty behind in Q2 is we saw so much growth in both retail and buying cars from customers. But I think we're making a lot of progress right now. So on that one, I think our goal is also just to move as quickly as you possibly can. And we think that when we look at the back half of this year we think that sales volume is likely to be driven by the speed at which we can alleviate those constraints. So, it has our full attention.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Bottiglieri of Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nChris Bottiglieri: Hey guys, actually, I got a question. So yes, I was hoping you could talk more about your third-party listing business that seems to have really grown a lot recently. Like, what are your early learnings from this business? Are you seeing your third-party partners change the behavior, like in terms of their business model anyway, to kind of adapt to this third party model? But I have a follow-up question.\nErnie Garcia: Well, I apologize in advance, but I think we're going to probably disappoint you a little bit with our answer there. So I think we've continued to make progress there. We're testing different things. We're interested by the results that we're seeing and that's why we continue to test it. But we don't have anything additional to add at this time. So I apologize there and hopefully we can do better on your follow-up.\nChris Bottiglieri: Got you. Okay. I was going to follow-up to that, so I'll pivot and do a different angle here. So let's go to the financing. This is instead then. So, it seems like just looking at your latest deals, like the risk spreads versus the swap rates have gotten lower, the rating sees lower than loss expectations on your kind of cumulative losses. It seems like you are paying lower returns to the residual buyers. I just want to get sense, like how much of this is a product of the environment, just lower losses, just like we're in this weird credit bubble versus how much of these like recent improvements I'm speaking to how much of that data is structural and kind of sticks beyond kind of COVID that if there's a way you can kind of answer that or frame that?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. I think we've made continual progress in our other GPU line item. Over a long period of time I do think that that's driven by many things. I think the finance team has done a great job, both kind of the operational finance team, that optimizes our credit scoring, and pricing and structuring, then the kind of finance, finance team for lack of a better description that executes our deals. I think both those teams have done an unbelievable job and driven a ton of progress. I also think the market is obviously a pretty solid financial market. So I think that all this constant that's helpful. And then I think as a result of the environment, we've seen some increases in ASP and then that does lead to increases in average loan sizes. And generally speaking, the premiums that we earn on those loans are kind of percentage premiums is probably the easier way to think about it. And so there's probably some scaling that goes with increasing prices. I think if we take a step further back from there, this line item along with all the other GPU line items is a multi-year constant progression toward our long-term financial model. And I think that there's a lot of really positive long-term drivers there. I think in the immediate term, trying to forecast exactly how that will evolve over the next two quarters, I think, is not simple to do in light of all the different drivers that are causing it to move around. But again, that's taken into account in the outlook that we provided in the shareholder letter.\nOperator: Our next question is from Edward Yruma of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nEdward Yruma: Hey, thanks for taking the question before I ask the question, I actually sold a car to you guys the other week, and it was the most painless experience I've ever had with anything, with car related. So my hats off to you.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nEdward Yruma: I guess just thinking back a little bit, I know you guys are in the processing of, I think, eight more IRCs before the end of 2022. From a staffing perspective I understand there's a lot of technical know-how and expertise required. How difficult is it to staff those and maybe more importantly staff existing centers to get productivity higher. Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think you opened up this call with everything worth doing is, is hard. So I think, you know, nothing's easy. Don't want to make it sound easy at all, but I think that we've built up a really strong team that helps us do this over time. We've built a really strong recruiting functions, really strong training functions. And I think we've also taken advantage of the structure of our business model to be able to offer really interesting opportunities to people out there that are looking for a new job. And so what I mean by that is our inspection centers are our really big kind of assembly line facilities. And what's nice about that is it lends itself to building a career path inside the facility. In the rest of automotive retail generally speaking, at least you have very skilled technicians, they kind of take any car with any problem and put it on a single lift and they kind of do all the work associated with that car. And that requires that they have a lot of deep knowledge across everything that they would need to know about that car. And you have the car that might show up. What's really nice when you've got scale at these large inspection centers is we can kind of break down those tasks into many little pieces, whether it's inspecting the car or photographing the car, different parts of the reconditioning process, figuring out what options and features around the car so that we can merchandise it. We've got all these different steps in the process. So we can really build a career path that is exciting for people. So we can bring people in early in their career and then they can build a career with us. And we put a lot of effort into that, not just in kind of building the facilities in that way, but in being able to market ourselves in that way to possible applicants. And then building check in, and development milestones and compensation milestones to support that as well. So I think, we've really worked hard at that. And that same story is true in customer care with the inside advocates, it's true in market ops with the outside advocates, it\u2019s true in logistics, we've redoubled our efforts in all those areas to kind of really push for what we're calling, careers and not jobs inside of Carvana. So we're putting a ton of effort into that. I think that it's enabled us to build a foundation that is scaling very quickly. And it's enabled us to build a foundation that is scaling in an environment where a lot of companies are having a tough time right now, finding talent. I think that we're doing a good job, least so far to find talent. So that's something that works generally proud of. And then on your comment of selling your car to us, I really appreciate that. Thanks for giving us a shot. Glad it went well. And you are partially responsible for the constraints that we are facing.\nEdward Yruma: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Baker of D.A. Davidson, please go ahead.\nMike Baker: Okay. Hi thanks. Two questions, one it looks like if my numbers are right here, the ratio of like inventory that's immediately available for sale versus the inventory that's on your website, it's about 30%. It's been actually pretty consistent in that range. Although at the beginning of 1Q 2020 was closer to like 75%. I understand this because you're having trouble with the constraints, because you are sourcing the inventory so quickly. But I guess the question is what's the right ratio? What should that look like? And what gets it more imbalanced? Is it that you obviously can produce things quicker or this piece come down, is it risk that fewer people are going to want to sell their car to you? Because right now, everyone knows you can sell your car for tons of money to you guys and your competitors.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think the most important metric is driving inventory up. That's the most important. And inventory in the eyes of the consumer is immediately available inventory. So just getting the absolute number of immediately available cars up is the most important measure. I think the ratio that you are referencing, you want to head as close to one as you can head, and you'll never get there, right.  And the more constrained you are, the lower you'll be, because that means that you've got your larger percentage of your cars that are kind of in the process of customers checking them out and locking them. And they might be in the purchase process. And that's because you have a very high level of demand relative to the cars you have in your website. If you're constrained in logistics, then your delivery times might be a little longer, than you would like. And so that'll show up in kind of longer lock times and a lower proportion of inventory immediately available as well. So I think, as we alleviate constraints, that proportion should go up. But I think the number that is kind of most precisely important is just the absolute number of cars that are available to customers is that's what a customer sees and that's what represents the probability that a customer with any given set of desires finds the car they're looking for when they look through our site.\nMike Baker: Okay. That makes sense. A follow-up and a little bit different perhaps as you guys get more mainstream and you advertise a lot and everyone is sort of, I think, is learning about Carvana. Are you seeing a different customer and is it less of an early adopter, the sort of online earlier adopters maybe were earlier in the process. And so now it's a different kind of customer. And this follows up on a previous question, how does that impact how you need to staff or how you need to think about operations, people were maybe less online savvy or sort of newer to the whole online thing start to learn about Carvana.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, so let me start with this. Our goal is to build an experience for customers that\u2019s better in ways that, I think, are independent of demographics or psychographics. So, we want to deliver to customers the best value, the best selection, the best experience. And so we're working very hard to build an offering that is appealing to absolutely everyone. I think from the earliest days, we saw a mix demographically and psychographically that was pretty similar to the mix of the average used car buyer in the U.S. And generally speaking, that's been pretty true across time as well. I do think there's more evidence as we get a little bit bigger that we're seeing some of the skews emerge that we probably expect it from the beginning. We're seeing a little bit of a younger buyer, all those constant, not by a lot, but I think a little bit younger than any other competitor out there. We're seeing a more perspire, again, not by a huge amount, but more diverse than anyone else out there, at least according to our surveys. What we're generally seeing a more affluent buyer directionally. So I think that we do have some directional skews. Again, they're not super strong. And so that would be what we're seeing from a demographic perspective. From a psychographic perspective, we've got our values and one of those values, our next customer could be your mom. Something that we think is really important is that we build an offering that works great for you all use it personally, in this case, my mom. And I think this worked great for my mom. We can't be building something it's just for early adopters. And I think our scale and kind of our continued growth suggests that we're continually making progress there and that psychographically, we are broadening our appeal. And I think that's, what's driving the growth that we're seeing. So, I think, we're working hard to just continue to improve in all those dimensions that we think matter the most, which is best price, best experience, best selection. And if we do that, we think that we've got an offering that's going appeal to a lot of people over time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Naved Khan of Truist Securities of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nNaved Khan : Yes, thanks a lot. I might've missed it, but did you guys talk about maybe share any trends from July, how other growth looks like so far into the quarter? And then I have a follow-up.\nErnie Garcia: So, we did not provide any color on July. We obviously provided Q2 numbers in our outlook for the remainder of the year. And so that's taken into account in the outlook.\nNaved Khan : Okay. In terms of just us trying to model it out, obviously they are not moving cars, but is it fair to assume that at least the capacity increases that you already put in place, that's how you are thinking about growing the business for the balance of the year kind of fulfilling that driving your transition higher?\nErnie Garcia: We're certainly positioning to try to alleviate operational constraints as quickly as we can. I do think that we've got work to do to catch up to where we are. As I said, the growth that we saw across the business, but most specifically in buying cars and customers was very dramatic in the quarter. So we got behind and now we're working very hard to alleviate that. And I think we're making a lot of progress and feel good about it.\nOperator: Next question is from Seth Basham of Wedbush. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot. And good afternoon. My question is also on inventory, because if I'm on the site today, I can see as many as 50,000 units listed for sale. What is the available for sale inventory today? And a follow-up to that is what percentage of the 50,000 units are marketplace? And when do you define that as being material?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, first let's start with just units that are available for sale. So in the shareholder letter, we provided data for the average of Q2, which was 12,800, that was increasing throughout the quarter. The average Q1 for perspective was 9,300 cars that were immediately available for sale. So we're on an upward trend there and we expect to continue that upward trend. So, hopefully that's at least directionally helpful there. We don't break out different inventory types. And I think generally speaking, thought on that would just be when we expect some feature that we built to start to . When we expect that it could materially impact our results, we'll probably spend more time discussing it, but until that time, we'll just stick with the higher level metrics.\nSeth Basham: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. \nErnie Garcia: And then also may be \u2013 hopefully help as well. So, our inventory peak in terms of total available inventory for perspective was approximately 25,000 kind of immediately prior to, and immediately after the onset of COVID in March of last year. So, even with the inventory growth that we have seen in Q2, we were still approximately half of the peak that we were prior to the onset of COVID. So, we're obviously much, much lower levels than we'd like to be at. I apologize I interrupted, please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Okay. Yes that\u2019s a pretty dramatic difference that 12,500 quarterly average in the second quarter versus there were 50,000 listed for sale right now. I can't imagine that over, 35,000 units are not available for sale right now, either by yourselves or by a third party. Am I missing something there? Okay.\nErnie Garcia: So, I think I would stick with the kind of the numbers that we've given you on immediately available units. And then there are obviously a number of units as well. The customers are checking out at any point in time considering purchasing, or maybe in transit to those customers in different locations. So hopefully that's at least directionally helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Colantuoni of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Colantuoni: Thanks for my question. Just wanted to make sure I understand the interplay between production capacity and unit sales. So the directional outlook says second half unit sales will be governed primarily by production capacity, and then separately, it looks like you've ramped your operational team hiring rate by 20% in July and set a record for weekly additions in the most recent week. I know there's a lot of moving parts to ramping production aside from hiring. But should we interpret the comments about hiring to infer the unit sales could see a sizeable increase sequentially in the third quarter relative to the second quarter? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure, yes. So, I think you should interpret the increase in hiring to suggest that we're booking up across some of our operational groups and across our corporate and technology groups as well. But obviously the vast majority of people are across the operational groups. So that includes inspection centers that'll show up first in kind of increased production capacity, which will allow us to kind of work through the cars that we've already purchased, but we have not yet produced. And then that will cause those cars to show up in available inventory. And then it will also show up in alleviating the other constraints that we have across our other operational groups. We're behind today, but working hard to catch up.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from [indiscernible] of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. This is on behalf of Adam Jonas. Just one question Ernie, from the feedback you are getting from customers, what are the one or two areas of the consumer experience where you can make the biggest improvement? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: I think I'm going \u2013 there's probably a millionaires across the experience where we can make it continually better across time. But if I had to pick one thing that is most important today, it's alleviating our constraints. I think our constraints can show up. Despite our constraints, we continue to deliver experiences that are meaningfully above anything else available anywhere in automotive retail. And we're continuing to see NPS scores that are meaningfully above anything else and automotive retail. But those constraints can lead to friction versus what we would otherwise be able to deliver if we didn't have constraints. So the constraints can show up in longer delivery times slightly higher odds of missing a delivery time and having to reschedule it that could show up in registration delays. They can show up in all kinds of different ways. So I think, the most important thing that we can do right now is catch up to the demand that we're seeing. Because the machine that we have delivers extremely high quality customer experiences, and it's also built in a way that it absorbs errors that we make in any given customer experience. You always make mistakes here and there. And we're built in a way to be able to absorb that as well, when we're properly staffed for the volume that we're seeing. And today we're behind. I think that would be the number one area to focus. I think taking a longer-term lens we've spoken before about how we have 70 plus product groups across Carvana. I think every single one of those product groups has a multi-year roadmap that is extremely exciting with myriad improvements all over the place. So, I think there's a lot of things that we're investing in today to try to continually make this experience even better for customers. And I wouldn't want to single any of those out, but I think there's a lot of opportunity. \nUnidentified Analyst: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to management for closing comments.\nErnie Garcia: Well, thanks everyone for dialing into the call and thanks for your questions to the Carvana team. We only had our first profitable quarter one time, and I think I always find myself thanking you on these calls. And I can always hear that it doesn't come across as completely, sincerely, as I wish because it's an odd venue. And so I hope that you hear our absolute gratitude. This is an unbelievable milestone. For those who have been here for a long time, there was times, six, seven, eight years ago when today was extremely hard to see, and we fought a million battles together, and we figured a lot of things out, and we've continually improved, and the whole time we've stayed together, we fought through COVID together, we've just done so much and I'm so proud of it. And so thank you all for your contributions. And please always remember that this just does not happen without you [indiscernible] and we together make up the parts of Carvana. So thank you so much. We have a ton to be proud of. I hope you put your feet up and kind of take a moment to be proud. And then I hope you take them down and kind of, don't let it go to your head and kind of get your head in the right space because we still got a lot of building to do. But we've done a lot so far. We really appreciate it. Thank you all.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's call. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks Mike. And thanks everyone for joining the call.  The second quarter was a landmark quarter for Carvana and one that will always play a central role in our story. It was the first quarter we delivered, delivered over a 100,000 cars to our customers. It was our first quarter of over $3 billion in revenue. It was the first quarter we achieved $5,000 total GPU. It was the first quarter we hit a $100 million EBITDA and it was our first quarter of positive net earnings. It was also the first quarter we made the Fortune 500 list. And to top it all off, we're now one of the four fastest companies to ever make the list organically along with Amazon, Google and Facebook. Those were some pretty great headlines. On that demand we take a step back for a minute to put it on context. Five years ago, the year before we went public, we sold 18,000 cars in the full year. We just sold over five times that many in a single quarter, five years ago, our total GPU was $1,000. This quarter it was $5,000. Five years ago, we lost $0.25 for every $1 of revenue we made. This quarter we made money for the first time. That's a lot of progress in a short amount of time. When we evaluate that progress, sometimes we all have a tendency to zoom in too far and this is what really makes it all possible. So I want to try to tell the simplest version of our story that I can. When we started 8.5 years ago, we were a bunch of ambitious kids with a shocking amount to learn. With the benefit of hindsight is now clear we had no idea what we were getting into, but we did know a couple of things. We knew customer preferences were changing. We knew technology was evolving. We knew the traditional way of buying a car had changed less than it should have. We believe we could do better for our customers. We knew that we were working for them and we had a plan. We also knew we had a great team. We knew how to get the best out of each other. We knew how to spot people that could make us better. We knew how to have fun. We believe in what we were doing. We knew we could figure out the rest along the way, and we didn't know how to quit. Those were important things to know. That simple knowledge got us to today. And today's a pretty good day. Along the way we've learned a lot. One of the important lessons is that everything worth doing is hard. So doing worthwhile things means they're often more hard days and easy ones. From here, I hope we don't get complacent. I hope we keep fighting. I hope we take on the hard days and keep doing things worth doing. I hope we keep learning. And I hope that we never let the new lessons crowd out the things that we knew at the beginning. It seems like that might be the classic mistake that people make over time. I hope we avoid it. And I believe that we will. If we do our future is bright. The things that were true at the beginning are all still true today. Customer preferences will always change and technology will always evolve. As a result there will always be opportunity. We're nowhere near realizing the opportunity, the potential that we saw from the beginning and additional potential reveals itself all the time. We'll keep chasing it. And as long as we keep our eyes open wide enough, we'll never catch it. The march continues. Mark? Sure. Well, so let me start with, yes, I think that model that we put out in late 2018 was built on kind of deep structural forces inside automotive retail. We did a lot of work trying to understand, what normalized margins are across all the different products and what different groups were able to achieve. And I think that it's pretty deep and foundational. And so we feel really good about that model. And so let me start there. I think we've undoubtedly made a ton of progress. I think if you look at your 2016, the year before we went public. We had a $1,000 GPU. We just had 5,000 for the full year. We're expecting 4,000 plus. I mean, that's obviously lot of progress and it's happened across every single one of the line items. We've also made a lot of progress in some of the expense line items, as well as we've continued to make progress there while we're simultaneously growing. So I do think that, things look really good there, we feel like it's a bit early to update the long-term model, given that this is the first quarter that we've been inside the long-term gross margin target. So I think we want to stick with that model, but we're obviously extremely with the progress that we've made so far. Sure. So, let me start by trying to characterize the environment. I do think what characterize this environment is you have very rapid vehicle price appreciation both the wholesale market and the retail market. And it's unlike anything that I've at least ever seen in my career. So I think we've seen very dramatic price appreciation. Now in a normalized environment that doesn't have huge implications for margin. Generally speaking, the gap between wholesale and retail markets are fairly stable. And as price levels move up or down, kind of both markets move in tandem and you don't see super dramatic differences. I think what's unique now is the change had happened so quickly. And I also think many different acquisition sources for vehicles perform differently. So if you look at, many franchise dealers, for example, that are buying many cars off lease, or buying many cars off trade in, have seen pretty dramatic increases in margin. If you look at some independents that are heavily reliant on just the auction market, you're generally seeing a deterioration in margin despite the increasing price environment, because wholesale price have moved up faster than retail prices moved up. So I think what's unique in this environment is the speed of which things have moved. And then the way that has played out differently across different vehicle acquisition channels. For us we've built this channel buying cars from customers that has performed very well for us over a long period of time. We've made continual high-quality progress in both the number of cars we're buying \u2013 the cars we're buying relative to retail sales and the profits that we're making on cars we bought from customers. But I think that channel was especially valuable in this environment where kind of auction spreads collapsed so much. So I do think that there was something of a tailwind that we experienced there, aside now precisely is difficult, associating that precisely with kind of the ASP movements is also difficult because I do just think that these are abnormal moves that we're seeing right now. But I think that it also led to another kind of interesting impact that has implications for the remainder of the year and kind of our overall financial performance. And so what that was because vehicle prices were appreciating so quickly, there were more customers that were willing to sell their car interested in selling their car in this environment than in many other environments. And that led to record increases in the number of cars that we were buying from customers, on feet at any way and in absolute terms or relative to cars that we were selling to customers. So we saw a lot of volume there that did drive some expense. That expense was more than offset by the margins that we were able to realize on those cars. And then that also led to constraints across the business which showed up in a little bit higher SG&A than we probably would have otherwise experienced. As we've tried to catch up to the demand that we're seeing, because a lot of times those kind of incremental levers that you pull are a little more expensive than the levers that you pull it, if you are able to kind of move in a more orderly fashion. So I think those are all the things that we feel like are unique in this environment are moving. I think it is difficult to precisely call the way that we'll all unwind unfold the back half of the year, but our best estimates are taken into account in the outlook we provided. So I think in general, the adjustments that we've made have been relatively subtle, and they've been more focused on trying to alleviate constraints and trying to be able to grow inventory faster than they've been driven by differences that we're seeing in different demand pockets. I think in general, we feel like we've got more demand than we've been able to satisfy across all demand pockets. So we've made some subtle changes in the mix of cars that we're buying to try to get them through the reconditioning centers faster, so that we can kind of scale inventory more quickly. But other than that nothing, nothing too dramatic. On the credit front, I think across the industry, there's been high quality credit performance. The loans that we originate, we've seen the same, but we do sell those loans off. And so the direct impact of that after the moment of sale is not something that flows through our financial statements. Sure. What I mean, I think, we're continually building the brand out. I think if you look even at our website traffic, for example, improved 25% quarter-over-quarter and very significantly a year-over-year, more than a 100% up year-over-year. So I think that's at least a reasonable measure of the brand that we're building. And I think that we still probably remain in relatively early innings of kind of building that brand. I think, as we've discussed in the past, the way that we like to think about that is you step one of building a brand is generating awareness. Step two is generating understanding of what you do. And step three is generating trust. And I think, we're making positive headway all the time in all those different dimensions, but we're still just an eight and a half year old company that's growing very fast. And even in this last quarter, we sold over a 100,000 cars. When you look at that relative to size of market that was still roughly 1% national market share. So I think it's still very early days. But undoubtedly, the progress that we're seeing in building brands does help us. We've seen these trends across time where our newer cohorts ran faster than older cohorts. We continue to see that. All the other trends we've seen across cohorts, we continue to see. We're obviously seeing very rapid market share increases across all of our cohorts that are supporting the growth that we're seeing. So I think, what's most important now is just continuing to grow and then getting the positive feedback that shows up across the model through that growth by being able to have more inventory available for our customers faster delivery times for average customers. And I think adding the Pacific Northwest was kind of the last big chunk of the U.S. that we weren't connected to and connecting that up as a big deal. And now we've just got filling to do from here and then we've got to keep scaling. Thank you. Thank you. So I think we probably, through the quarter, for the most part progressively more constrained. And I think the driver of that is what we discussed kind of earlier in the call, which is we saw so much growth in offering of buying cars from customers. We grew retail units by 17% quarter-over quarter, but we grew very dramatically in the number of cars that we bought from our customers. And that is really what led to increasing constraints that was hard to foresee and we weren't prepared for that degree of growth that quickly. So I think that's what led to increase in constraints and those constraints can kind of show up across the business. Just because they're driven by buying Carson customers doesn't mean that's the only impact they have when customers are selling their car to us. They're calling in and they're talking to advocates there's a market ops going up and picking out those cars, we've got the logistics network gets involved with that. So as we see growth in any part of the business, it generates constraints across the rest of the business. So I do think we saw those constraints show up. I also think that this is a relatively difficult environment to alleviate constraints, but we've made a ton of headway that we're extremely excited about. So for perspective in July, we increased our average weekly hiring class by about 20% versus what we saw in the average of Q2. We're extremely proud of that. The speed of that move is really strong. The team's done a tremendous job, just kind of leaping to action and, and trying to get back in front of this. And I think it's been a tough environment to do it. I think that's a testament to the quality of opportunity that we offer to applicants that are looking to come to Carvana. I think it's a testament to the career path and that we've built over time and a testament to the team that that's been ramping up very quickly. So I think we're making a lot of progress. We're extremely focused there for the last year, we've been talking about the constraints of inventory and we've been working hard to alleviate that. This last quarter, we grew inventory, which was exciting, we would like to grow it a lot more from here. But then kind of the benefits of kind of alleviating that constraint to a degree, as well as the massive growth that we saw in buying Carson customers led to constraints in other places. And now we got to get to work at alleviating those. And I think we're well on our way. Sure. So I think, there may be some like very high level macro trends that result from the crisis and persistent that have some impacts on the opportunity. But I think that's very secondary to just what we can do as a company. I think, a useful way to kind of think about how things are moving is, so far the first half of the year, roughly speaking of sales volumes across the industry have been roughly flat to 2019. So that just gives you a sense of kind of where we are, obviously they dropped in 2020 and they've come back and they're kind of leveled to 2019 right now give or take a little bit. In that time, we've increased our population coverage by about 21%. But we've increased sales by more than 2.5x. So we're clearly taking very significant market share. I spoke earlier a bit about the cohorts. If we look at our individual markets or cohorts, those continue to ramp up very nicely. The trends that we've seen are in place there. We now have a handful of markets that are over 3% market penetration, including some of our oldest and most mature markets. So I think that's all really exciting and that's all happening in the context of us being heavily constrained right now. So I think the opportunity is really, really large. We feel like as long as we keep delivering great customer experiences and executing and growing that's going to be the primary driver of our growth. And some of the macro factors you pointed to may also kind of push our direction a bit, but we think it's mostly about the customer experiences we deliver in our own execution. First of all, I think probably when you're thinking about margin, thinking about it in dollars instead of percentage terms is probably a better way to think about it. I think generally speaking margins kind of move more in dollars than they do in percentage terms across the industry. So I would start there. I think there's a lot that that is different, this year then just 2019. But I think the thing that we would point to is that is the biggest by a long, long way is just buying cars and customers. We just saw a massive, massive increase in the number of cars we're buying from customers and in the profitability of buying cars from customers. And I think that flowed through, and I think I want to be careful not to be too repetitive with the GPU answer that that Mark has provided, but I think everything that he outlined is also correct. And I think you can kind of look back on how some of those line items have moved historically, and kind of what some of our different high watermarks have been and get a sense of what the size of some of those impacts might have been. But I think, that's probably the best I can do to try to be helpful there. Sure. So I think, at a high level we're trying to provide you a sense of how things moved in the quarter and what we think are some of the unique drivers in the quarter. And then I think, from here, we basically expect some normalization of some of those factors paired with normal seasonality, and then that's taken into account in our outlook, which we raise from mid-3000s to over $4,000 for total GPU for the year which is obviously a huge move for us to be making is something that we're extremely excited about. Sure. So maybe let me try to break that into piece. I think what's going on at the industry level is probably most specifically kind of driven by OEM new car manufacturing issues. And I think that that is likely kind of the key driver that has led to a vehicle price appreciation in both new and used. I think trying to figure out when that will normalize is a very difficult question. I think everybody has tried to do that over the last years, has at least so far been wrong. And I think maybe simplified model to use for thinking about that is just that those OEMs have complicated global supply chains, which obviously includes the microchips that I was paying close attention to, but include many other parts as well.  And as we've seen different waves of COVID kind of move through different parts of the world, we've generally seen supply constraints show up in their supply chains and that's kind of driven vehicle price appreciation. That seems like that's probably the number one driver of kind of the unique behavior that we're seeing in the market right now. And we wouldn't want to make a specific estimate of when that's likely to normalize and how that would work through their supply chains. But we think that that's probably the underlying cause. As it relates to our inventory, I think, we're in a pretty simple place right now where what we want is more. We feel like we've got significantly more demand than we're able to handle. And we think that we have a good understanding of the relationships between inventory size and conversion. And so we would love to have significantly more inventory. We're working incredibly hard through the addition of additional inspection centers to adding lines at inspection centers. We've got a plan to have 1.25 million production capacity by the end of next year. So we're working really hard to build up more capacity and also to ramp up our production as quickly as we possibly can. I think we've seen great progress there. We grew retail units by 17% last quarter, but we were able to grow production capacity by more than that, which allowed us to build inventory. So we're just going to keep moving as fast as we can there and trying to build inventory as quickly as we can. And then as it relates to the other constraints that emerged across the business, I think, inventory is definitely the stickiest and hardest to resolve of the constraints that we can face because once you kind of get behind them production relative to sales, you've got work to do to catch back up to sales. And while you're doing that work to catch up, you're shrinking your inventory. And then once you're there, you're still just kind of holding flat and now you've got to get in front of it to build inventory. That's a long process. And then it's also obviously a very complicated operational undertaking. So we've been hard at work on that one for the last year plus. And I think we've made tremendous progress, especially in light of the several COVID waves that we've seen. We'll keep working on that one. On the other constraints, historically, at least we've generally been able to resolve those much faster. Those are generally not as complicated, they don't necessarily have physical facilities related to them. They don't necessarily have zoning and construction timelines associated with them. So generally, we can move faster than the other operational groups. As I said earlier, we've made a lot of progress heading into early Q3. We did get pretty behind in Q2 is we saw so much growth in both retail and buying cars from customers. But I think we're making a lot of progress right now. So on that one, I think our goal is also just to move as quickly as you possibly can. And we think that when we look at the back half of this year we think that sales volume is likely to be driven by the speed at which we can alleviate those constraints. So, it has our full attention. Well, I apologize in advance, but I think we're going to probably disappoint you a little bit with our answer there. So I think we've continued to make progress there. We're testing different things. We're interested by the results that we're seeing and that's why we continue to test it. But we don't have anything additional to add at this time. So I apologize there and hopefully we can do better on your follow-up. Sure. I think we've made continual progress in our other GPU line item. Over a long period of time I do think that that's driven by many things. I think the finance team has done a great job, both kind of the operational finance team, that optimizes our credit scoring, and pricing and structuring, then the kind of finance, finance team for lack of a better description that executes our deals. I think both those teams have done an unbelievable job and driven a ton of progress. I also think the market is obviously a pretty solid financial market. So I think that all this constant that's helpful. And then I think as a result of the environment, we've seen some increases in ASP and then that does lead to increases in average loan sizes. And generally speaking, the premiums that we earn on those loans are kind of percentage premiums is probably the easier way to think about it. And so there's probably some scaling that goes with increasing prices. I think if we take a step further back from there, this line item along with all the other GPU line items is a multi-year constant progression toward our long-term financial model. And I think that there's a lot of really positive long-term drivers there. I think in the immediate term, trying to forecast exactly how that will evolve over the next two quarters, I think, is not simple to do in light of all the different drivers that are causing it to move around. But again, that's taken into account in the outlook that we provided in the shareholder letter. Thank you. Sure. So I think you opened up this call with everything worth doing is, is hard. So I think, you know, nothing's easy. Don't want to make it sound easy at all, but I think that we've built up a really strong team that helps us do this over time. We've built a really strong recruiting functions, really strong training functions. And I think we've also taken advantage of the structure of our business model to be able to offer really interesting opportunities to people out there that are looking for a new job. And so what I mean by that is our inspection centers are our really big kind of assembly line facilities. And what's nice about that is it lends itself to building a career path inside the facility. In the rest of automotive retail generally speaking, at least you have very skilled technicians, they kind of take any car with any problem and put it on a single lift and they kind of do all the work associated with that car. And that requires that they have a lot of deep knowledge across everything that they would need to know about that car. And you have the car that might show up. What's really nice when you've got scale at these large inspection centers is we can kind of break down those tasks into many little pieces, whether it's inspecting the car or photographing the car, different parts of the reconditioning process, figuring out what options and features around the car so that we can merchandise it. We've got all these different steps in the process. So we can really build a career path that is exciting for people. So we can bring people in early in their career and then they can build a career with us. And we put a lot of effort into that, not just in kind of building the facilities in that way, but in being able to market ourselves in that way to possible applicants. And then building check in, and development milestones and compensation milestones to support that as well. So I think, we've really worked hard at that. And that same story is true in customer care with the inside advocates, it's true in market ops with the outside advocates, it's true in logistics, we've redoubled our efforts in all those areas to kind of really push for what we're calling, careers and not jobs inside of Carvana. So we're putting a ton of effort into that. I think that it's enabled us to build a foundation that is scaling very quickly. And it's enabled us to build a foundation that is scaling in an environment where a lot of companies are having a tough time right now, finding talent. I think that we're doing a good job, least so far to find talent. So that's something that works generally proud of. And then on your comment of selling your car to us, I really appreciate that. Thanks for giving us a shot. Glad it went well. And you are partially responsible for the constraints that we are facing. Sure. So I think the most important metric is driving inventory up. That's the most important. And inventory in the eyes of the consumer is immediately available inventory. So just getting the absolute number of immediately available cars up is the most important measure. I think the ratio that you are referencing, you want to head as close to one as you can head, and you'll never get there, right.  And the more constrained you are, the lower you'll be, because that means that you've got your larger percentage of your cars that are kind of in the process of customers checking them out and locking them. And they might be in the purchase process. And that's because you have a very high level of demand relative to the cars you have in your website. If you're constrained in logistics, then your delivery times might be a little longer, than you would like. And so that'll show up in kind of longer lock times and a lower proportion of inventory immediately available as well. So I think, as we alleviate constraints, that proportion should go up. But I think the number that is kind of most precisely important is just the absolute number of cars that are available to customers is that's what a customer sees and that's what represents the probability that a customer with any given set of desires finds the car they're looking for when they look through our site. Sure. Well, so let me start with this. Our goal is to build an experience for customers that's better in ways that, I think, are independent of demographics or psychographics. So, we want to deliver to customers the best value, the best selection, the best experience. And so we're working very hard to build an offering that is appealing to absolutely everyone. I think from the earliest days, we saw a mix demographically and psychographically that was pretty similar to the mix of the average used car buyer in the U.S. And generally speaking, that's been pretty true across time as well. I do think there's more evidence as we get a little bit bigger that we're seeing some of the skews emerge that we probably expect it from the beginning. We're seeing a little bit of a younger buyer, all those constant, not by a lot, but I think a little bit younger than any other competitor out there. We're seeing a more perspire, again, not by a huge amount, but more diverse than anyone else out there, at least according to our surveys. What we're generally seeing a more affluent buyer directionally. So I think that we do have some directional skews. Again, they're not super strong. And so that would be what we're seeing from a demographic perspective. From a psychographic perspective, we've got our values and one of those values, our next customer could be your mom. Something that we think is really important is that we build an offering that works great for you all use it personally, in this case, my mom. And I think this worked great for my mom. We can't be building something it's just for early adopters. And I think our scale and kind of our continued growth suggests that we're continually making progress there and that psychographically, we are broadening our appeal. And I think that's, what's driving the growth that we're seeing. So, I think, we're working hard to just continue to improve in all those dimensions that we think matter the most, which is best price, best experience, best selection. And if we do that, we think that we've got an offering that's going appeal to a lot of people over time. So, we did not provide any color on July. We obviously provided Q2 numbers in our outlook for the remainder of the year. And so that's taken into account in the outlook. We're certainly positioning to try to alleviate operational constraints as quickly as we can. I do think that we've got work to do to catch up to where we are. As I said, the growth that we saw across the business, but most specifically in buying cars and customers was very dramatic in the quarter. So we got behind and now we're working very hard to alleviate that. And I think we're making a lot of progress and feel good about it. Sure. So, first let's start with just units that are available for sale. So in the shareholder letter, we provided data for the average of Q2, which was 12,800, that was increasing throughout the quarter. The average Q1 for perspective was 9,300 cars that were immediately available for sale. So we're on an upward trend there and we expect to continue that upward trend. So, hopefully that's at least directionally helpful there. We don't break out different inventory types. And I think generally speaking, thought on that would just be when we expect some feature that we built to start to . When we expect that it could materially impact our results, we'll probably spend more time discussing it, but until that time, we'll just stick with the higher level metrics. And then also may be \u2013 hopefully help as well. So, our inventory peak in terms of total available inventory for perspective was approximately 25,000 kind of immediately prior to, and immediately after the onset of COVID in March of last year. So, even with the inventory growth that we have seen in Q2, we were still approximately half of the peak that we were prior to the onset of COVID. So, we're obviously much, much lower levels than we'd like to be at. I apologize I interrupted, please go ahead. So, I think I would stick with the kind of the numbers that we've given you on immediately available units. And then there are obviously a number of units as well. The customers are checking out at any point in time considering purchasing, or maybe in transit to those customers in different locations. So hopefully that's at least directionally helpful. Sure, yes. So, I think you should interpret the increase in hiring to suggest that we're booking up across some of our operational groups and across our corporate and technology groups as well. But obviously the vast majority of people are across the operational groups. So that includes inspection centers that'll show up first in kind of increased production capacity, which will allow us to kind of work through the cars that we've already purchased, but we have not yet produced. And then that will cause those cars to show up in available inventory. And then it will also show up in alleviating the other constraints that we have across our other operational groups. We're behind today, but working hard to catch up. I think I'm going \u2013 there's probably a millionaires across the experience where we can make it continually better across time. But if I had to pick one thing that is most important today, it's alleviating our constraints. I think our constraints can show up. Despite our constraints, we continue to deliver experiences that are meaningfully above anything else available anywhere in automotive retail. And we're continuing to see NPS scores that are meaningfully above anything else and automotive retail. But those constraints can lead to friction versus what we would otherwise be able to deliver if we didn't have constraints. So the constraints can show up in longer delivery times slightly higher odds of missing a delivery time and having to reschedule it that could show up in registration delays. They can show up in all kinds of different ways. So I think, the most important thing that we can do right now is catch up to the demand that we're seeing. Because the machine that we have delivers extremely high quality customer experiences, and it's also built in a way that it absorbs errors that we make in any given customer experience. You always make mistakes here and there. And we're built in a way to be able to absorb that as well, when we're properly staffed for the volume that we're seeing. And today we're behind. I think that would be the number one area to focus. I think taking a longer-term lens we've spoken before about how we have 70 plus product groups across Carvana. I think every single one of those product groups has a multi-year roadmap that is extremely exciting with myriad improvements all over the place. So, I think there's a lot of things that we're investing in today to try to continually make this experience even better for customers. And I wouldn't want to single any of those out, but I think there's a lot of opportunity. Well, thanks everyone for dialing into the call and thanks for your questions to the Carvana team. We only had our first profitable quarter one time, and I think I always find myself thanking you on these calls. And I can always hear that it doesn't come across as completely, sincerely, as I wish because it's an odd venue. And so I hope that you hear our absolute gratitude. This is an unbelievable milestone. For those who have been here for a long time, there was times, six, seven, eight years ago when today was extremely hard to see, and we fought a million battles together, and we figured a lot of things out, and we've continually improved, and the whole time we've stayed together, we fought through COVID together, we've just done so much and I'm so proud of it. And so thank you all for your contributions. And please always remember that this just does not happen without you [indiscernible] and we together make up the parts of Carvana. So thank you so much. We have a ton to be proud of. I hope you put your feet up and kind of take a moment to be proud. And then I hope you take them down and kind of, don't let it go to your head and kind of get your head in the right space because we still got a lot of building to do. But we've done a lot so far. We really appreciate it. Thank you all."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie. And thank you everyone for joining us today. Q1 was a record quarter for Carvana. We said company records across many key financial metrics and made significant progress toward our long-term goals. Retail units sold in Q2 totaled 107,815, our first quarter over 100,000 units and an increase of 96%. Total revenue was $3.3 billion, an increase of 198%. This strong growth came despite operational constraints we faced during the quarter. Total gross profit per unit was 5,120 in Q2, the highest level in company history. It increased $2,394 year-over-year and $1,464 sequentially. Since Q2 2020 was impacted by COVID-19. I will focus my remaining commentary on sequential changes. Retail GPU was $2022, an increase of $811. Our growth in retail GPU was primarily driven by four factors. One, increased buying cars from customers. Two, an appreciating retail and market pricing environment, which was partially offset by higher wholesale acquisition prices. Three, optimizing our vehicle mix and pricing to match our production capacity and available inventory goals. And four, moving beyond the majority of the COVID-19 related transitory costs we experienced in Q4 and Q1. Wholesale GPU was $547, an increase of $320. This was driven by record gross profit per wholesale unit sold of $1,254 and record wholesale unit volume. Record gross profit per wholesale unit sold was primarily driven by strong industry-wide wholesale pricing and increased wholesale unit volume came from growth in buying cars from customers. Other GPU was 2,551, an increase of $333. This sequential increase was driven by a positive impact of higher industry-wide vehicle prices on average loan size and another strong quarter of execution by our finance team. EBITDA margin was positive 3.4% and improvement from negative 6.2% in the prior period. We achieved our second quarter of positive EBITDA and our first ever quarter of positive net income. On July 1, we up-sized our inventory floor plan facility by $500 million to $1.75 billion bringing total liquidity resources to nearly $2 billion, giving us significant flexibility to execute our plan. We are executing well and remain focused on building our network and increasing our production capacity to meet demand. This quarter, we demonstrated significant progress on these fronts, but our rapid growth in both retail units and buying cars from customers led to strains throughout our operational chain, that we are also focused on alleviating. In Q2, we grew average weekly vehicle production by 20% sequentially. This increase was driven by additional staffing efforts and the opening of our 13th IRC near Cleveland, Ohio. Across these 13 IRCs, our total annual production capacity is approximately 750,000 units at full utilization. We remain on track to open eight additional IRCs by the end of 2022, bringing our total capacity at full utilization to over 1.25 million units. Looking at forward, we expect to complete a record year on retail units, revenue, total GPU and EBITDA margin in 2021. We expect retail unit growth to continue to be governed primarily by our operational capacity. In the second half, we expect revenue growth to be more closely aligned with retail unit growth. As we move beyond prior year comparison periods that were most by COVID 19. Expect total GPU over 4,000 for the full year significantly exceeding our mid 3,000 outlook at the beginning of the year and marking our eighth consecutive year of substantial gains. Finally, given the demand we are seeing, we plan to continue to invest in the business, both to catch up with current demand and to prepare for growth in 2022 and beyond. Leading to a typical seasonal pattern in SG&A per retail unit sold in the second half and close to break even EBITDA margin for the full year. We are extremely proud of the progress we've made as a company over the last several quarters, navigating the COVID-19 pandemic and the unique environment all while delivering rapid growth and managing through operational constraints. Zooming out our results relative to the industry, leave us more optimistic than ever about our long-term model and path toward our goal of delivering more than 2 million retail units per year and becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer. Thank you for your attention. We will now take questions. Yes. Great. Let me start by taking the Retail GPU question, then we'll move on to the SG&A question. So on retail GPU, we had our first quarter over 2000 retail GPU. We've come close a couple times before. I think we've done 1850 before and 1700 not including adjustments also in 2020, but the 2000 is a record for us. I think if we think through the drivers I think maybe it's helpful to think through it, sequentially from Q1, the biggest driver there was certainly the performance buying cars from customers. Ernie talked a little bit about that, but we had a great quarter for buying cars from customers, record volume both in an absolute sense and as ratios to retail units. And so that was a big, that was a big driver. There were several other factors that drove retail GPU, as we compare to Q1, those include when you think there was a net tailwind from the appreciating retail environment. But that was certainly partially offset by rapidly rising wholesale prices. And so as we \u2013 as Ernie alluded to, I think, we haven't seen when we look out across the industry dealers who rely heavily on auction or have a higher auction share of inventory, do quite as well as those that are really buying a lot of cars off lease and off trade in. But we do think there was some impact there. In addition, we made some vehicle mix and pricing optimizations doing things like trying to buy cars that we think could get through the reconditioning centers more quickly. For example and then finally, we did \u2013 finally move beyond the transitory costs, the majority of the transitory costs that we experienced in Q4 and Q1. And so I think when and those costs being related to COVID-19 particularly the later waves in Q4. So I think when you put all that together, I think we feel really great about our retail GPU progress. Buying cars from customers continues to be a strong driver of the improvement within the business. It's something we're going to look to continue to do going forward. And obviously excited about our progress. So I'll stop there on retail GPU. Moving to your question on SG&A. So, I think there's several drivers of our investment in SG&A. So is we take a narrow view into Q2. There's a few things I'd point to. The first is that we bought significantly more cars from customers in Q2 that we did in the prior quarter. And there are expenses associated with that. So that obviously there's big selection and GPU benefits associated with it as well. There's also expenses associated with that. And so, looking at SG&A per retail unit basis doesn't necessarily capture the investment that we're making to drive the business of buying cars from customers as well. So that's point one. Point two is we are absolutely investing for the future. That investment takes a couple of different forms. First, we're already preparing for 2022, a large business that's growing at extremely fast rates. And what that means is you have to plan ahead to ensure that have put the necessary infrastructure into place to be able to satisfy very large amounts of demand at large scale. And so we're already investing for 2022 and that's a component of it. And then finally, I would say we're also investing for the long term. So as Ernie alluded to, in some of his prepared remarks, we see opportunities everywhere in the business, I think opportunities to improve the customer offering, opportunities to drive additional revenue and GPU by making the business more efficient. I think, there are many, many places where over a multi-year horizon, we see very significant opportunities and we're going to invest in those opportunities. We think it's the right thing to do for the business and for our long-term shareholders. And so those would be the three points that I would make on SG&A."

And now, with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thanks Mike. And thanks all for joining the call. The first quarter was another great quarter across the board, in our shareholder letter; we always lay out our financial priorities of rapidly scaling the business of growing GPU and demonstrating operating leverage. In the first quarter, we made tremendous progress across each of these priorities. We grew units and revenue by 76% and 104%, respectively. We grew GPU by over $1,000 year-over-year and almost $300 quarter-over-quarter, and we leverage EBITDA margin by over 10% year-over-year and 2.5% quarter-over-quarter. Even more impressively, these results were achieved despite meaningful operational constraints across the business and the significant investments we've been making to alleviate them. In the first quarter, our average weekly production was up 26% versus the fourth quarter. As a result of the relatively low inventory levels we were carrying throughout the quarter unit volumes closely tracked production of 28% sequentially. Importantly, the investments we've made in ramping up our ops capacity in general and our inspection center capacity in particular are starting to pay off. As a result of ongoing focus, weekly production levels have been up closer to 50% above the fourth quarter more recently, which positions us well to begin growing inventory and increasing selection for our customers again for the first time since the pandemic struck over a year ago. Getting this point is the result of a lot of careful planning and hard work across our real estate inspection center, logistics, market opportunities and advocate teams who have all put in tremendous efforts to catch up to demand and to fight off the pandemic driven ops constrained through the last year. Great job and thank you, to those teams. These efforts and the ongoing execution of our plan, positions us well for a great 2021 and 2022. And the foundation is continuing to be laid to enable us to continue scaling rapidly in the years beyond. Eight years ago, we had a dream to change the way people buy cars and we've made a lot of progress. When we look back and look out of fear is just the list of simple ideas, they're easy to say and very hard to actually put into action. It all started by imagining a new way to buy a car that was better for our customers in every important way. The excitement of that dream enabled us to attract incredible people who made our dream their own. From there, it has just been ambition, hard work, perseverance and constant learning. And with a critical mass of enthusiastic customer focused ambitious people, we built a self-reinforcing culture. Those simple ideas have taken us a long way. In 2013 our first year we had $4 million of revenue. Today we're over 1000 times larger. Looking forward, we're just as excited as we were that. We're delivering to customers the best experiences available when buying or selling a car. The quality of the unit economics that emerged from the investments we've made over time are showing up in our results. The scalability of our model is apparent and our business gets better as it gets bigger, and we're still dreaming. The ambition that underlies our dreams burns is brightly today as it did at the beginning. And with every step we take, we can see further down the field. While we're extremely proud of what we build in the team that got us here, we're nowhere near where we ultimately want to be in either scale or scope. We're still at the beginning. To get to where we are to where we want to be, we'll maintain our customer focus, we'll keep surrounding ourselves with exceptional people. We will remain ambitious. We will stay disciplined in prioritizing our efforts. We'll keep working a little harder than those around us and we'll have fun along the way. In short, will traverse the path in front of us the same way we've traversed the path behind us? We know what to do; we just have to keep doing it. Mark?\nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie. And thank you all for joining us today. Q1 was a strong quarter for Carvana across all key financial metrics, and our financial results demonstrate significant progress toward our long-term goals. Retail unit sold in Q1 totaled 92,457, an increase of 76%. Total Revenue was $2.245 billion and increase of 104%. Revenue Growth outpaced retail unit growth due to higher retail average selling prices, and wholesale and other revenue. We expect revenue growth to outpace retail unit growth again in Q2, and then we expect revenue growth to be similar to retail unit growth in the back half of the year. Total GPU was $3,656 in Q1, an increase of $1,016 year-over-year, and $277 sequentially. Since Q1 2020 was impacted by the onset of COVID-19. In March, I will focus my commentary on sequential changes. Retail GPU declined slightly to $1,211 from $1,265 in Q4, reflecting a continuation of approximately $200 per unit of transitory costs, primarily driven by rapidly ramping or reconditioning capacity in the midst of COVID-19. We do not expect the majority of these transitory costs to impact Q2. Wholesale GPU increase to $227 from $108 in Q4, primarily driven by strong industry wide wholesale prices in the latter part of Q1. Other GPU increased to $2,218 from $2,006 in Q4, primarily driven by completing two public securitizations for the first time in Q1, paired with an increase in ancillary product attach rates that offset a one-time benefit in Q4. EBITDA margin was negative 1.3% in Q1, a 2.6 percentage point improvement from negative 3.9% in Q4, driven by both GPU gains and SG&A leverage. We ended the quarter with more than $2 billion in total liquidity resources, giving us significant flexibility to execute our plan. We had another strong quarter of buying cars from customers in Q1, buying approximately as many cars from customers as we sold to them and achieving a customer source ratio over 60%. Our success over the last two years has made the strength of our offering of buying cars from customers clear, and we no longer expect to provide detailed statistics on buying cars and customers each quarter. So far in Q2, we are seeing outstanding performance and in April, we set a new company record for cars bought from customers, both on an absolute basis and relative to retail unit sold. We are as excited as ever about the opportunities ahead. We continue to focus on scaling our production capacity to meet demand. In Q1, we opened our 12th IRC near Birmingham, Alabama, bringing our total annual production capacity to approximately 680,000 units at full utilization. We remain on track to open one additional IRC in Q2 and eight in 2022, bringing our total capacity at full utilization to over 1.2 5 million units by the end of 2022. So far in Q1, we've opened 22 new markets, bringing our total to 288 and increasing our population coverage to more than 77% of the U.S. population. In May, we also launched our first five markets in the Pacific Northwest, adding the last major region to our nationwide footprint. After Q2, we expect our path to 95% population coverage to primarily consist of opening smaller fill-in markets. In our Q4 2020 shareholder letter, we outlined our expectations for the year 2021 including accelerated retail unit sold growth, revenue growth in line with retail unit growth, total GPU in the mid-3000s and a small EBITDA margin loss, while investing for growth and continuing our progress on demonstrating leverage. We remain on track to meet or exceed these expectations and we continue to be excited about 2021 as a significant step toward our long-term goals. Thanks for your attention. We will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sharon Zackfia, with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi, good afternoon, I did not expect to be first. I guess congratulations on a great first quarter. And I'm trying to kind of think about your improvements that you've been making and productivity and how we should think about that for the rest of the year. And I think Ernie, you mentioned that soon you'll have available inventory ahead of the year ago period. I guess I'm wondering, when will you be back to kind of pre pandemic levels? What's your line of sight on that? And then I know you mentioned the $200 and transitory costs on GPU, obviously, the year-over-year contraction was a little bit more than that on the car itself. What else was pressuring that, are you finding that it's more competitive to get inventory? You're having to pay a little bit more, and that would be ideal to city? Any thoughts there would be great.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So let's start with production of I think as you know, basically, since the second quarter of last year, we've been pretty constrained in production, given the pullback that we made, then, and then all the demand that we've seen and just trying to catch up. So I think in the first quarter, we kept pace; basically, our sales grew sequentially, at effectively the same rate, as our production grew. So, I think that kind of suggests that those constraints were still in place. But then post the end of the first quarter, we've made a lot of progress and we've continued to see our production growing. So we now expect to be able to grow inventory. Basically what we're saying there's we've kind of gotten to a place where we expect production to be a little bit more than sales. And we don't want to kind of specify exactly the rates which we expect inventory to grow. But that's a middle mile marker to kind of now be in a place we expect to grow inventory. And we're pretty excited about that. Obviously, growing inventory helps with conversion across the site. And so that's an important milestone that we've hit. But we're not going to quantify it from there. We'll keep working hard and trying to grow that as quickly as we can as we grow into the production capacity, we expect to be around $1.25 million by the end of 2022. And Mark, you want to hit number two.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Then I'll hit the question on retail GPUs. So Q1 retail GPU was largely aligned with our expectations when taking into account the transitory costs that we talked about in Q4. I think when you look on a year-over-year basis, in addition to those transitory costs, last year; we talked some about the impact of some of the early phases of iteration on buying cars from customers that positively impacted GPU last Q1. I think there are some base effects from those early phases of iteration that's impacting the year-over-year comparison. I think when we look at where we're headed from here, we did call out that we expect the majority of those transitory costs impacted Q4 and Q1, this year to be gone by Q2. And so that's a tailwind to the retail GPU as we move toward to 2Q, other things being equal. Obviously, overall, we feel really good about our progress there, had a solid quarter in light of those transitory costs and expect to step up in Q2.\nOperator: Our next question is from Zach Fadem, with Wells Fargo, please go ahead.\nZachary Fadem: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Now that you've entered the Pacific Northwest, and now have reconditioning centers all over the country, can you talk about the opportunity to start listing your inventory regionally versus nationwide? And to what extent this could unlock a higher level of GPU or operating efficiencies across the business?\nErnie Garcia: Sure, so obviously, we're excited about launching Pacific Northwest that was kind of the last region our footprint that we weren't yet in. So I think opening that up is exciting. That basically means from here to roughly our 95% population coverage goal, in the long run, we basically have market fill in. So that's very exciting. Also, as we grow demand in general in the existing markets and in new markets that just puts us in a position where we can economically carry a larger, larger inventory. And so that's great news for conversion across the country. As inventory gets larger and larger, you certainly have some duplication of inventory that is optimal, where you want to take some duplicated inventory and put it in different places around the country that are closer to customers to minimize delivery times which is also an input into conversion. So there is some of what you're talking about the kind of automatically happens with scale, we're shipping distances should drop and conversion rates should go up. We have all kinds of tests all the time we're getting a good handle on, how inventory size impacts conversion, how delivery times impact conversion and kind of what the right thing is to do internally. But I don't think that we're going to give more concrete guidance on the precise expectations that we have around those different numbers.\nZachary Fadem: Got it. And then on production, you've got one more IRC to go this year. But could you talk about the glide path for adding more production lines in your existing facilities? And how should we think about the full-on lock of the 680,000 in capacity as we move through the year?\nErnie Garcia: Sure, so I think our way to look at that, is to look at our past. We provided in our shareholder letter in Q4 2020, you can kind of see our production capacity, our facility production capacity in each of our previous years. And then you can get a sense of how long it took for us to unlock that facility capacity with actual production, by just looking at kind of sales rates in the future periods. So that'll give you a sense of how quickly we can unlock that. Is something we've been working on internally is being able to unlock that production capacity more quickly. We've spoken before about the other many different operational parts of the business. And all those different parts of the business have different lag times associated with how quickly you can alleviate constraints if you find yourself constrained. And definitely production is the area with the longest lead times, it's hardest to kind of grow capacity very quickly there, we've seen that of last year. So we definitely put a lot of focus on catching up and on making ourselves even more flexible. And so you can see the results of that progress in kind of our sales growth for the last several quarters, and then the fact that we're now expecting to grow inventory. So that's been a huge focal point. It's something that we think we are continuing to get better at.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nick Jones, with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Jones: Great. Thanks for the question. I guess, what are the puts and takes in investing in a production capacity if maybe the chip shortage lasts longer than expected? And can you be in a situation where you have too much capacity. I guess how fluid is that situation? And then the second question I have is, some of your legacy competitors, or brick mortar competitors are hanging out pretty large targets now. Ernie, how do you feel the competition has changed, really, if at all due to COVID or people noticing what Carvana has been doing all these years? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think first, the use market is fairly different than the new market. It's not totally independent; it's impacted in many ways. But the use market all those cars are already on the road today, there's around 270 million cars on the road. And basically use transaction is just customers trading with one another. So it's not fundamentally impacted by underlying production levels in the way that the new market is. The new market is impacting the use market to degree today, because the kind of decrease available supply and new then kind of flows over an excess demand to late model use that kind of flows down through all the other use kind of year levels as well. So there are some impacts there. But wouldn't expect them to be super pronounced, I don't think that's like a first order driver of what's going to happen to the use market over the next six months or a year. Even more importantly than that, I think production capacities and investment in kind of our long-term future, when we open these facilities, and we unlocked that capacity by hiring and training the people in those inspection centers, that then means that we have a capacity to kind of build those cars over and over again, that powers our growth to 2 million cars and beyond and to becoming the largest most profitable automotive retailer. So those are big investments in our future that are kind of being made with a much longer lens than the current chip shortages that we're seeing today. And then as it relates to competitors, I think there was probably no reasonable expectation of our path from kind of where we started to where we wanted to be, that there wouldn't be competition along the way, I think we've been fortunate enough to have a fair amount of success. And with success, there's always competition. So, we expected competition, I think we should continue to expect competition, we should probably expect competition to continue to show up as we continue to have more success in the future. With that said, I do think if you kind of step back and evaluate the competitive environment, this market, that the used car market does have a lot of really nice properties. First of all, it's a 40 million unit market. And so the largest player has on the order of a 2% market share. We're now the second largest player in just eight years, but it's highly fragmented. And so even some of these big goals that are being put out by others in the industry, they still are very, very small compared to the market itself. And then, by some measures, the market may be considered fairly competitive in the sense that there's 10s of 1000s of players in it. But those 10s of 1000s of players are the harder providing customers with a very similar experience to one another. And when you start to look at kind of differentiated experiences, there are very, very few players that really have the capacity to make the investments in time, energy and money that are necessary to build an e-commerce platform. And we're way ahead there. So we're really excited about our position, we think that the market that we operate in has really nice competitive dynamics, almost constant. And then we also think that the most important thing that we can do is stay focused on our customers on ourselves. It gets really easy for two competitors to look at each other and kind of chase each other in circles. And we instead want to make sure that we're focusing on our customers that we're building up the solutions that they really need. And then that we're focusing on ourselves. The last year has taught us that, when you see a lot of demand, you're trying to grow really rapidly, that comes accompanied with a bunch of operational challenges that aren't trivial to solve. And so we need to stay really focused on ourselves in our execution. And we think if we do that, we're going to achieve our goals.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Bottiglieri, with Exane BNP Paribas, please go ahead.\nChris Bottiglieri: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to focus on our retail GPU. Some of the movements in use car pricing I thought might have been a tailwind in Q1 versus a headwind in Q4. It was not the case did not see that. And then, be if it wasn't if use car pricing was more favorable this quarter. Were there any other headwinds that we should be thinking about as we model retail GPU that you incurred this quarter?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think there are always many dynamics that are going into retail GPU. I think this quarter we certainly started seeing appreciation, rapid appreciation in the wholesale market. That's appearing to some degree in the retail market that really came on more toward the end of the quarter. So, I think I'm not sure that was particularly large effects on our Q1 number. So I think the main effects on Q1, were the ones I called out, namely, these transitory costs on the order of $200, roughly the same as what we experienced in Q4. That was probably the biggest, unusual impact on retail GPU in Q1. And as I mentioned, we expect the majority of those transitory costs to have disappeared by Q2. And so as we think that the removal of those transitory impacts will be a tailwind. Other things equal as we move toward Q2.\nChris Bottiglieri: Got it. Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Rajat Gupta, with JP Morgan, please go ahead.\nRajat Gupta: Good afternoon. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had a question on like use to follow-up to one of the previous question you guys view. You open up more IRC, as you know, as the production capacity is increasing, and like that's the main piece election increases? How does like the advertising leverage start to look, once that happens? Did you start to see a meaningful pickup in delivery, just how we should think about that as that capacity ramp up. And I had a follow-up.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think there's probably a lot of ways to think about that. So certainly, as we grow inventory almost constant, we would expect conversion rates to go up. As we kind of decrease delivery time, we would expect conversion rates to go up. The relationship from conversion rates to customer acquisition cost is very clear, as conversion rates go up, you would expect to see leverage and customer acquisition costs. So I think that those relationships would be as expected. I also think, if you take a look at kind of the cohort data that we've provided over the last several Q4, you can kind of take a look at what our customer acquisition cost looks like in some of our older cohorts. I think our oldest cohort, last Q4 was approaching on the order of $500, give or take, versus a company level of around $1100, I think in Q1. So, I think we've kind of demonstrated what we can do with customer acquisition costs in those older markets. Obviously, in the older markets, we expect it to continue to go down over time as we grow inventory and decrease delivery times and further build the brand. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of where we think that can go. And then between here and there, I think it's just a function of how many markets we opened, what we decide to do with our marketing budget, how quickly we can grow our inventory, how quickly we can decrease our delivery times how well we execute. And in general, we still feel like we're very early in brand building, we measure that in lots of different ways. But virtually any measure of customer awareness is still at low levels relative to where we want to be. And so we're not being shy about continue to invest in our brand and we'll do that as long as we think that that's a smart thing to do.\nRajat Gupta: Got it. That's helpful. And I guess on the finance GPU. I know it wasn't broken out separately this quarter. But like just based on like, my math, points or somewhere around like 1700 bucks or so. Fortunately, like is that close or accurate? And then just looking at versus the targets at the Analysts day about like two and a half years back, obviously rates are much lower. But what are the factors have driven this uptick? Is this kind of like a sustainable level that you would expect, in the near general, medium and higher? Just curious as to how to think about that, and like, what are more normalized finance GPU number should look like, going forward? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure, so first of all, we didn't try that breakout, so we don't tend to provide at here. I think it's easy to understand our rationale there. Going back in time to our analysts data, you reference, at that time, we were selling on the order of a core as many cars as we're selling today, our GPU was on the order of half, maybe even less than what it is today. And I think our EBITDA five 10, or 15 points worse. And so at that time, we were trying to provide pretty detailed walks for our investors, they could understand how those buildups would occur over time. I think, as we've matured, and as we've seen a lot of progress in many of those different line items. And I think, the market in general has a much better understanding of how the things progress, we're just kind of simplifying our reporting and kind of aligning more closely with industry standard. And so we don't tend to kind of break it out at that level of detail going forward. That said, I think it's not hard to infer the general areas that it's in, as you pointed to, and that general area is very exciting. And it's very strong compared to what we initially outlined at that analyst day, in 2018. So I think there's a couple reasons for that, some of them are fundamental and sustainable, I think we've really done a pretty good job with that business so we've made a lot of fundamental progress in terms of the way that we're able to assess credit risk and price, credit risk, and the way that we're able to monetize our finance platform. So there are a lot of things that we've done there that we're proud of. And we think that there's probably some additional fundamental value that we can unlock. I think we're also in something of a unique environment, you know, early in the pandemic, we tightened credit pretty dramatically, we've held credit tighter than probably would be the norm of almost constant. We've generally over kind of the last several quarters been in a very low interest rate environment. So that's helpful. So there are a couple things that aren't necessarily persistent across time. But we still think that there's progress to be made there. And then in the rest of other we think that there's progress to be made in our other existing items, we think there's progress to be made by adding additional items as well over time. So we think that that's, you'll want to have several success stories relative to our long-term model that we that we put out in 2018. And we think that gives us a lot of flexibility going forward.\nOperator: The next question is from Collin Sebastian with Baird, please go ahead.\nCollin Sebastian: Thanks. Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions. I guess, first off, I was hoping you could update us on the attach rates of other products and services, and how much room there might be to grow those. And then secondly, there been some questions around Google's testing of auto listing ads, and curious if that's something that you might find attractive to participate in? Or if you think that might change the competitive landscape at all. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure, so I apologize. I think I'm not able to give you kind of boring answers to those questions. So we don't plan to kind of break out our tax rates for other products and services, we definitely do believe that there is room to continue to improve there. We've made a lot of improvement over the last several years, but we think there's clearly room to go from here. And so we'll work to do that. As far as, Google testing is a different ad product. We obviously use Google as one of our many customer acquisition channels. We use them in search marketing, and then we use them in several other ways as well. So I think we'll do that as a marketing channel. We'll evaluate it like we evaluate all of our other marketing channels. And to the extent it gives us a high quality return, and we would expect to utilize that as well.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Montani, with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMichael Montani: Thank you for taking the question. So first one I had was just around when you're able to self-source a unit, is there a sense that you can provide of the kind of tailwind that that gives, to GPU versus when you have to go to auction? I guess I was thinking potentially 10% benefit over $1,000 but just wondering if you could give any clarity there and then I had a follow-up.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Go ahead, Mark.\nMark Jenkins: Yes, sure, I can take that one. So I think it varies quarter-to-quarter. But a reasonable way to think about the benefit of sourcing it from our customers is to look at it in the context of our wholesale GPU. So basically, the wholesale GPU captures is the difference between, our acquisition cost of a car from customer and the wholesale market trading price of that car. And so that's a good way to think about the cost benefit of customer sourcing. And so that just gives you a sense to give you a sense of that, it varies quarter-to-quarter, this quarter, we were around $800 or so on wholesale GPU. And so I think that's, it does vary quarter-to-quarter. But that's, that's a reasonable way to just sort of keep track of the relative cost benefit of customer sourcing.\nMichael Montani: Okay that makes sense. And then just a follow-up question I had was any incremental color you can share this year, and then next year with the eight IRCs, on how to think about the CapEx outlook, what's kind of a normal number and then specifically, how does this year and next year look?\nMark Jenkins: Yes, sure. So, rough way to think about the capital investment related to one of these 67,000 unit IRCs is on the order of $50 million per IRC, maybe a little bit more than that, but on that order of magnitude. And then of course, the way we think about that, from a financing perspective is we've historically sale leaseback our IRC's, we think that there's lots of very efficient ways and a great market for financing those IRC investments, so that they're not actually net outlays for the business but they're financed outlays. And so that's to give you a rough order magnitude of how much they cost. And I think we feel really good about the desirability of those assets from a financing perspective.\nOperator: The next question is from Nat Schindler with Bank of America, please go ahead.\nNat Schindler: Yes, great. Thank you, guys. And I think the GPU questions made under desk. So I thought I'd try something a little different. Could you walk through maybe what you saw, probably more on a weekly or daily basis prior to stimulus tax and then after them going up and in how much impact that had on the quarter? Secondly, on a related note, with the tax filing date pushed out to May 15. Does that have any impact on the seasonality that is usually more Q1 weighted as people get their tax returns? Finally, well, let's just stop it, I can add more.\nErnie Garcia: So nice multi car questionnaire, let's try to break it down. So I think, let me try to combine basically, the first two concepts, I think both tax refunds and stimulus basically take the form of government depositing relatively large checks in the bank account of many, many people at once. And so I think that didn't look materially different than it looked in years past, generally what happens is people start to get notifications, through email or wherever else that they have money to hit their account. And you'll see, kind of the evening before, you'll you know, we'll see a lot of traffic activity happen on the site, and then the next day, you'll start to see man show up. I think that that was undoubtedly material this year. As it relates to us, I think a key statistic to keep in mind is, we did grow sales sequentially 28%, and we also grew production sequentially 26%. We undoubtedly saw increased demand kind of on the day after stimulus was dropped, but then the form that that takes that just further compressed your inventory, therefore reducing conversion rates for everyone afterwards. And so I think if we had to try to imagine kind of what would have happened to our sales absent stimulus, I think, first of all, that's very hard to do. But just directionally, we clearly would have been less kind of on the days and weeks immediately after stimulus. And our expectations would have been more in the weeks, kind of couple weeks after the stimulus drop. So I don't know how big the impact was, but I think it was smaller for us this year than it would have been in previous years, because in previous years, we're carrying enough inventory heading into that kind of an event to be able to handle that big onslaught of demand and then still have sufficient inventory for our customers afterwards. So I do think it was a little bit different. And then the tax returns being pushed out a little bit. I do think that had an impact, but I think that impact is largely behind us. The vast majority of that impact is behind us. I don't think that's too meaningful for the future.\nNat Schindler: So you don't expect the normal Q1 tax refund call it seasonality is going to be drawn out into Q2, it was pretty much still well taken up into Q1, despite being pushed out a week, a month.\nErnie Garcia: So the tax filing date was pushed out a month from what I believe is April 15, to May 15. But the date at which most customers get money in their accounts has historically been sometime in February. If you go back, maybe 10 years, it was even kind of late January. But it's been slowly kind of moving out and more recently has been the end of February. That this year might have been a week later than normal and then probably had kind of a normal spread from there in terms of when you see the demand impact. But that didn't move as much, just the filing date itself moved. And the filing date itself is far less powerful than the day that the tax refunds are kind of released to the masses.\nOperator: The next question is from Naved Khan, with Truist Securities, please go ahead.\nNaved Khan: Yes, thanks a lot. Maybe on a related note. So since the noise from the stimulus and the tax seems to be behind us. Can you maybe give us some sense of how the April trends are looking like for you? And how should we think about the shape of the quarter? And then I have a follow-up?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, we want to stay away, I think from giving too much detailed kind of intro period, color, but we provided an outlook in the shareholder letter and I think that captures our expectations. Demand has been very strong for really the last year for our offering. And we've continually been, carrying a lower inventory than we wish that we were carrying. We're excited now to kind of be at a place where we believe that we'll be able to start growing inventory, which we think is helpful, almost constant. So I would say things continue to look great from our perspective. There's nothing notable to call out that would go in any other direction. And kind of those expectations are what we have in our outlook.\nNaved Khan: Okay, thanks. And then maybe you guys mentioned that the opportunity for more ancillary products. Is there a near term potential for to introduce a new product on the platform or that's it still days away?\nErnie Garcia: I think across the entire business, there's many, many different things that we can focus on, obviously we have a very complicated business for vehicle acquisition. Transporting it to the inspection centers running the inspection centers, merchandising it for customers, pricing for customers, building the finance business, running our warranty product, there's so much that we can work on. So we have across the business, we have on the order of 70 different product teams that are working on all these various roadmaps at different points in time. And we do our best to prioritize all the different projects as intelligently as we can. Generally speaking, we won't kind of comment on what that underlying prioritization looks like. But there's no doubt that there's opportunity in the future to add additional products, and that could be potentially exciting.\nOperator: The next question is from Ron Josey, with JMP Securities, please go ahead.\nRon Josey: Great, thanks. I wanted to ask two questions, please. I think just a follow-up on an earlier question on the expansion of Pacific Northwest. Can you just help Ernie talk about the distribution in the time deliver and how you can flex your just your supply chain into those five new markets in that overall region, which is new? And then the second question is just on brand awareness, with 95% population coverage now insight, and I think still pretty low brand awareness, as we've talked about 100 million marketing spend the quarter is pretty interesting. Just wanted to get your sense on how we should think about marketing spend going forward, how you all are putting those dollars to work around brand awareness, educational spend, and performance. Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: So Pacific Northwest is obviously something that we've been looking at for a long time. But it's a relatively isolated population center the way up in the Northwest. And so it took us a long time to get to a place where we thought it was sensible to kind of add that to our logistics network. Over the last month or two, we've added that and we also added the Salt Lake City area in Utah, which kind of gives us a midpoint that allows us to connect up there with we also connect through California. So we thought it was an absolute time, obviously our long-term aspirations are to get to approximately 95% population coverage and to be a national brand. And so that was something that we need to do at some point. We've been holding off as we've been so constrained in inventory. But given your expectation, we're going to grow inventory and our visibility into head over the next couple years as well as our knowledge of our historical lag times and ramping up volumes in new markets. We thought now's a good time. So we went ahead and pull the trigger on that. And we're excited to kind of fill out the rest of our regional footprint. On brand awareness, I do think that we remain very low in brand awareness, our dollar spend is starting to approach pretty sizable numbers that are meaningful compared to the marketing budgets of lots of companies. But we have to also keep in mind, that kind of our accumulated dollar spend is still very low compared to a lot of more mature companies that have been around for a long time. And so we do think that it's still early, we're spending a lot in brand, we definitely spend a lot and kind of education, I think for a customer to buy a car from Carvana, they have to first that you exist, they have to next, understand what you do and kind of how it's different from buying a car in a traditional way. So we have a lot of different value props that we have to educate them about. And then they have to trust that you're real and your return policy is real, and that they can kind of trust the quality car that comes their way. And it all those things just take time to build up in consumer mind. So we're testing a lot, we're learning a lot as we go, I think we're very excited about the position that we're in with customer acquisition costs, given the knowledge that we've accumulated over time by just looking at how we've levered our older cohorts. So we're confident that we know how to lever customer acquisition pretty significantly. But we also believe that we're very early in brand building. And so as long as we find different channels that we think are hitting a different audience and educating them in a different way, like I said before, we're not going to be shy about spending that money and building our brand so you can get a good investment in the long-term.\nOperator: The next question is from Alex Potter, with Piper Sandler, please go ahead.\nAlex Potter: Great, thanks, a lot. I had a question about certified pre-owned; I was just wondering if you have a strategy for trying to break in there? Or is that a segment that you consider more or less off limits, anything you'd be willing to share on that front would be interesting?\nErnie Garcia: So I think there's maybe a couple ways to approach that problem. So first of all, every car that we sell is certified, its Carvana certified and our certification process was patterned off of some of the luxury manufacturers certification processes. And so the cars that we deliver to customers are of that kind of that quality. The specific brand certified pre owned, is generally reserved for the combination of kind of franchise dealers, and oftentimes, kind of the branded OEM warranty that gets associated with that sale, although, that's not always necessarily a condition of the brand of certified per owned. So, I think that we do believe that we're breaking into that market by building a brand of delivery, very high quality cars, and by building a logistics network and infrastructure of reconditioning centers that are able to certify cars to that same quality. So that's our goal. But the particular brand is generally protected by our four franchise dealers.\nAlex Potter: Okay, understood. And then last question, customer source ratio, still really strong, I can appreciate that you won't be disclosing that going forward. I guess, maybe just qualitatively, you're still running well, ahead of what you thought you could do several years ago, which has been great. I'm sure it's a tailwind for GPU. Are you starting to get convinced now that you can actually keep running indefinitely at these higher customer sourcing rates? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure, well, so at a very high level of the market for selling cars are around 40 million possible units. Generally speaking, a customer is getting a car is also getting rid of another car. And so the market for us buying cars is kind of theoretically at least very similar in size. And if you look at Q1 sales of 92,000, and number of cars bought from customers, in a similar ballpark, you're basically looking at something like 1% of the market. So I think that we're very, very small compared to both of those markets. I think they are connected in certain ways through brand, particularly our brand and the speed at which we can build our brand and generate awareness across all customers that we both buy and sell cars. But they're also fairly disconnected in the sense that only a subset of those transactions happens simultaneously when a customer is simultaneously buying a car and trading another car. A lot of them are kind of separated in time, where customer will buy a car and then maybe sell a car later, sell a car and buy a car later. So, I think they can grow independently. We've undoubtedly seen tremendous, tremendous amount of progress in that business over the last couple of years and we're extremely excited about it and I think you're now basically the retail business and the business of buying cars and customers are going to race each other to the useable finish line somewhere out in the great blue yonder.\nOperator: The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot and good afternoon. My question is back on the topic of finance GPU. Seems like we had a high watermark there with this quarter's results, and I'm trying to understand if you think that is the high watermark for 2021, where do you think that can go longer term?\nErnie Garcia: I think for other GPU in general, we've definitely hit kind of our highest level ever. As described earlier, I do think that there are fundamental gains that we can continue to make in every line item of other GPU. And there are other opportunities for certain products that we can add over time. So I think that that's exciting. I also do think that it's hard to size, the kind of beneficial impacts that exists in this environment where, one, we're doing something that we have control over, but is likely leading to slightly higher, other GPU, which is running with tighter credit. And then two, we've benefited from very low interest rates. So those are likely to unwind. I think the balance of those things, is hard to precisely predict. But we're clearly in great shape versus the long-term model that we outlined a couple years ago. And I think it's too early, and we're in too unique of an environment to update that model. So we think in general, that's probably roughly the right way to continue to think about it. And obviously, we've done very well against that model in the last several quarters.\nSeth Basham: Got it, alright, helpful. And my follow-up question just around reconditioning. Have you been using third-party reconditioning for things other than specialized services? And do you plan to do that in the future?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think in the past, we talked about we have various tests, to try to see what are the various ways that we can ramp up our production capacity across the business that has included utilizing some third-party recon, we are continuing to utilize some third-party recon today, it remains a significant minority of the cars we produce overall and that's our expectation for the future as well. But it is something that we are utilizing and continuing to test today.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Colantuoni with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Colantuoni: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about the tight inventory environment in the wholesale market and some of the measures Carvana have implemented to unlock new channels for inventory acquisition? And if you're expecting those measures to have any notable impacts on the near-term vehicle GPU outside of what's going on with wholesale prices? Thanks.\nMark Jenkins: I can take that one. So I mean, I think, our number one channel for sourcing inventory, has now become sourcing cards directly from customers, which has several advantages that we've talked about historically, I think we're certainly going to continue to focus on that. That's a business that we want to build, and continue to grow over the long-term. And so I think that's our number one area of focus. And certainly the first answer to that question. I think in terms of the wholesale market dynamics, we're still certainly buying cars on the wholesale market, I think we're buying cars, we're making money on those cars, and we retail them. I think we feel very comfortable in the current environment. And from a sourcing perspective, our main area of focus is going to be continued to grow the business of buying cars from customers.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great, thanks so much.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Edward Yruma with KeyBank. Please go ahead.\nEdward Yruma: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick ones for me, I guess, first on interest rates. We've seen any significant movement in the industry to offer your consumers there has been an impact. And then a broader question. When your competitors, I guess, as they've scaled, has had kind of customer service and close difficulties. Obviously, your numbers have been phenomenal, but how would you score kind of your customer service levels, particularly as you continue to ramp your business? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think on interest rates, they come down obviously, since pre pandemic pretty dramatically, and then they've kind of bounced around a little bit from there that there's been some upward movement over the last quarter or so but nothing material. And so I don't think that there's that the story there is that they're low. I don't think that recent movements are super material. In terms of customer service levels our focus from day one has been to build a business from the ground up that delivers great customer experiences and to build all the things that are required to really enable those great experiences to be differentiated in a fundamental way. And that's always been our focus. And I think when we look at kind of all of our scores for what customer experience looks like; there are a lot of different things that drive that. I think first and foremost is the way that we've designed the business the way that we've designed the customer experience. And then I think, from there, you've got your technology and your processes and the quality of those and kind of how good experiences are capable of delivering. I think very importantly, the next layer is your cultural layer. How much do all the people that talk to your customers that depicts your customers, cars that deliver the car to the customers. How much do they care about the customers and care about what we're doing together and emphasize with the exciting moments of customers having when they are getting a car, which is the second largest purchase they make in their life. And I think that we would like to think that we've done a pretty good job building a culture there that really cares about delivering great customer experiences. And I think the last layer is do you have sufficient capacity across your operations groups, to deliver to customers great experiences. And I think over time, we've been constrained many, many times in our life, obviously, throughout the pandemic, you've heard of various constraints, if we go back to 2019, we have logistics and market ops constraints. Prior to that, we had constraints in the call center in the different places. So we have had constraints across the business at various points in time. Those constraints generally do lead almost constant to our measures of customer experience going down a little bit. Now, when they go down, they've personally gone down by relatively small amounts, and they remain at levels that are far above industry standard. And then importantly, when we continue to kind of step up and get our feet underneath us and alleviate those constraints, we see them go right back to where they were, which means that we're in a great place in the kind of foundational elements that matter the most, which is business design, technology, processes and culture. And so we were really happy about the way that we've been able to manage customer experience, which is our primary goal through all of this growth that has driven us to be 1000 times larger company today than we were in the first year that launched in 2013. But undoubtedly, their impacts from very high levels of growth and those impacts are in the directions that you would expect, but I think we've done a good job managing them historically.\nEdward Yruma: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session, I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nErnie Garcia: Thanks, everyone for joining the call. And to the entire Carvana team, thank you. Great quarter great job, to all the operations teams. This has been a long slog; you've done an incredible job coming in every day and delivering great customer experiences. And we really appreciate it I hope that you hear the sincerity of that appreciation doesn't just sound like something that we say every call. To the inspection center team in particular, this has been an absolute battle. Great job to all of you. I know that you've taken the last couple calls and pinned those up on your locker for inspiration. Clearly it did inspire, you had done a great job. We really appreciate it. Please keep going. We still got a lot of ground to cover, but thanks to all. Have a good one.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Mike. And thanks all for joining the call. The first quarter was another great quarter across the board, in our shareholder letter; we always lay out our financial priorities of rapidly scaling the business of growing GPU and demonstrating operating leverage. In the first quarter, we made tremendous progress across each of these priorities. We grew units and revenue by 76% and 104%, respectively. We grew GPU by over $1,000 year-over-year and almost $300 quarter-over-quarter, and we leverage EBITDA margin by over 10% year-over-year and 2.5% quarter-over-quarter. Even more impressively, these results were achieved despite meaningful operational constraints across the business and the significant investments we've been making to alleviate them. In the first quarter, our average weekly production was up 26% versus the fourth quarter. As a result of the relatively low inventory levels we were carrying throughout the quarter unit volumes closely tracked production of 28% sequentially. Importantly, the investments we've made in ramping up our ops capacity in general and our inspection center capacity in particular are starting to pay off. As a result of ongoing focus, weekly production levels have been up closer to 50% above the fourth quarter more recently, which positions us well to begin growing inventory and increasing selection for our customers again for the first time since the pandemic struck over a year ago. Getting this point is the result of a lot of careful planning and hard work across our real estate inspection center, logistics, market opportunities and advocate teams who have all put in tremendous efforts to catch up to demand and to fight off the pandemic driven ops constrained through the last year. Great job and thank you, to those teams. These efforts and the ongoing execution of our plan, positions us well for a great 2021 and 2022. And the foundation is continuing to be laid to enable us to continue scaling rapidly in the years beyond. Eight years ago, we had a dream to change the way people buy cars and we've made a lot of progress. When we look back and look out of fear is just the list of simple ideas, they're easy to say and very hard to actually put into action. It all started by imagining a new way to buy a car that was better for our customers in every important way. The excitement of that dream enabled us to attract incredible people who made our dream their own. From there, it has just been ambition, hard work, perseverance and constant learning. And with a critical mass of enthusiastic customer focused ambitious people, we built a self-reinforcing culture. Those simple ideas have taken us a long way. In 2013 our first year we had $4 million of revenue. Today we're over 1000 times larger. Looking forward, we're just as excited as we were that. We're delivering to customers the best experiences available when buying or selling a car. The quality of the unit economics that emerged from the investments we've made over time are showing up in our results. The scalability of our model is apparent and our business gets better as it gets bigger, and we're still dreaming. The ambition that underlies our dreams burns is brightly today as it did at the beginning. And with every step we take, we can see further down the field. While we're extremely proud of what we build in the team that got us here, we're nowhere near where we ultimately want to be in either scale or scope. We're still at the beginning. To get to where we are to where we want to be, we'll maintain our customer focus, we'll keep surrounding ourselves with exceptional people. We will remain ambitious. We will stay disciplined in prioritizing our efforts. We'll keep working a little harder than those around us and we'll have fun along the way. In short, will traverse the path in front of us the same way we've traversed the path behind us? We know what to do; we just have to keep doing it. Mark? Sure. So let's start with production of I think as you know, basically, since the second quarter of last year, we've been pretty constrained in production, given the pullback that we made, then, and then all the demand that we've seen and just trying to catch up. So I think in the first quarter, we kept pace; basically, our sales grew sequentially, at effectively the same rate, as our production grew. So, I think that kind of suggests that those constraints were still in place. But then post the end of the first quarter, we've made a lot of progress and we've continued to see our production growing. So we now expect to be able to grow inventory. Basically what we're saying there's we've kind of gotten to a place where we expect production to be a little bit more than sales. And we don't want to kind of specify exactly the rates which we expect inventory to grow. But that's a middle mile marker to kind of now be in a place we expect to grow inventory. And we're pretty excited about that. Obviously, growing inventory helps with conversion across the site. And so that's an important milestone that we've hit. But we're not going to quantify it from there. We'll keep working hard and trying to grow that as quickly as we can as we grow into the production capacity, we expect to be around $1.25 million by the end of 2022. And Mark, you want to hit number two. Sure, so obviously, we're excited about launching Pacific Northwest that was kind of the last region our footprint that we weren't yet in. So I think opening that up is exciting. That basically means from here to roughly our 95% population coverage goal, in the long run, we basically have market fill in. So that's very exciting. Also, as we grow demand in general in the existing markets and in new markets that just puts us in a position where we can economically carry a larger, larger inventory. And so that's great news for conversion across the country. As inventory gets larger and larger, you certainly have some duplication of inventory that is optimal, where you want to take some duplicated inventory and put it in different places around the country that are closer to customers to minimize delivery times which is also an input into conversion. So there is some of what you're talking about the kind of automatically happens with scale, we're shipping distances should drop and conversion rates should go up. We have all kinds of tests all the time we're getting a good handle on, how inventory size impacts conversion, how delivery times impact conversion and kind of what the right thing is to do internally. But I don't think that we're going to give more concrete guidance on the precise expectations that we have around those different numbers. Sure, so I think our way to look at that, is to look at our past. We provided in our shareholder letter in Q4 2020, you can kind of see our production capacity, our facility production capacity in each of our previous years. And then you can get a sense of how long it took for us to unlock that facility capacity with actual production, by just looking at kind of sales rates in the future periods. So that'll give you a sense of how quickly we can unlock that. Is something we've been working on internally is being able to unlock that production capacity more quickly. We've spoken before about the other many different operational parts of the business. And all those different parts of the business have different lag times associated with how quickly you can alleviate constraints if you find yourself constrained. And definitely production is the area with the longest lead times, it's hardest to kind of grow capacity very quickly there, we've seen that of last year. So we definitely put a lot of focus on catching up and on making ourselves even more flexible. And so you can see the results of that progress in kind of our sales growth for the last several quarters, and then the fact that we're now expecting to grow inventory. So that's been a huge focal point. It's something that we think we are continuing to get better at. Sure. So I think first, the use market is fairly different than the new market. It's not totally independent; it's impacted in many ways. But the use market all those cars are already on the road today, there's around 270 million cars on the road. And basically use transaction is just customers trading with one another. So it's not fundamentally impacted by underlying production levels in the way that the new market is. The new market is impacting the use market to degree today, because the kind of decrease available supply and new then kind of flows over an excess demand to late model use that kind of flows down through all the other use kind of year levels as well. So there are some impacts there. But wouldn't expect them to be super pronounced, I don't think that's like a first order driver of what's going to happen to the use market over the next six months or a year. Even more importantly than that, I think production capacities and investment in kind of our long-term future, when we open these facilities, and we unlocked that capacity by hiring and training the people in those inspection centers, that then means that we have a capacity to kind of build those cars over and over again, that powers our growth to 2 million cars and beyond and to becoming the largest most profitable automotive retailer. So those are big investments in our future that are kind of being made with a much longer lens than the current chip shortages that we're seeing today. And then as it relates to competitors, I think there was probably no reasonable expectation of our path from kind of where we started to where we wanted to be, that there wouldn't be competition along the way, I think we've been fortunate enough to have a fair amount of success. And with success, there's always competition. So, we expected competition, I think we should continue to expect competition, we should probably expect competition to continue to show up as we continue to have more success in the future. With that said, I do think if you kind of step back and evaluate the competitive environment, this market, that the used car market does have a lot of really nice properties. First of all, it's a 40 million unit market. And so the largest player has on the order of a 2% market share. We're now the second largest player in just eight years, but it's highly fragmented. And so even some of these big goals that are being put out by others in the industry, they still are very, very small compared to the market itself. And then, by some measures, the market may be considered fairly competitive in the sense that there's 10s of 1000s of players in it. But those 10s of 1000s of players are the harder providing customers with a very similar experience to one another. And when you start to look at kind of differentiated experiences, there are very, very few players that really have the capacity to make the investments in time, energy and money that are necessary to build an e-commerce platform. And we're way ahead there. So we're really excited about our position, we think that the market that we operate in has really nice competitive dynamics, almost constant. And then we also think that the most important thing that we can do is stay focused on our customers on ourselves. It gets really easy for two competitors to look at each other and kind of chase each other in circles. And we instead want to make sure that we're focusing on our customers that we're building up the solutions that they really need. And then that we're focusing on ourselves. The last year has taught us that, when you see a lot of demand, you're trying to grow really rapidly, that comes accompanied with a bunch of operational challenges that aren't trivial to solve. And so we need to stay really focused on ourselves in our execution. And we think if we do that, we're going to achieve our goals. Sure. So I think there are always many dynamics that are going into retail GPU. I think this quarter we certainly started seeing appreciation, rapid appreciation in the wholesale market. That's appearing to some degree in the retail market that really came on more toward the end of the quarter. So, I think I'm not sure that was particularly large effects on our Q1 number. So I think the main effects on Q1, were the ones I called out, namely, these transitory costs on the order of $200, roughly the same as what we experienced in Q4. That was probably the biggest, unusual impact on retail GPU in Q1. And as I mentioned, we expect the majority of those transitory costs to have disappeared by Q2. And so as we think that the removal of those transitory impacts will be a tailwind. Other things equal as we move toward Q2. Thanks. Sure. So I think there's probably a lot of ways to think about that. So certainly, as we grow inventory almost constant, we would expect conversion rates to go up. As we kind of decrease delivery time, we would expect conversion rates to go up. The relationship from conversion rates to customer acquisition cost is very clear, as conversion rates go up, you would expect to see leverage and customer acquisition costs. So I think that those relationships would be as expected. I also think, if you take a look at kind of the cohort data that we've provided over the last several Q4, you can kind of take a look at what our customer acquisition cost looks like in some of our older cohorts. I think our oldest cohort, last Q4 was approaching on the order of $500, give or take, versus a company level of around $1100, I think in Q1. So, I think we've kind of demonstrated what we can do with customer acquisition costs in those older markets. Obviously, in the older markets, we expect it to continue to go down over time as we grow inventory and decrease delivery times and further build the brand. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of where we think that can go. And then between here and there, I think it's just a function of how many markets we opened, what we decide to do with our marketing budget, how quickly we can grow our inventory, how quickly we can decrease our delivery times how well we execute. And in general, we still feel like we're very early in brand building, we measure that in lots of different ways. But virtually any measure of customer awareness is still at low levels relative to where we want to be. And so we're not being shy about continue to invest in our brand and we'll do that as long as we think that that's a smart thing to do. Sure, so first of all, we didn't try that breakout, so we don't tend to provide at here. I think it's easy to understand our rationale there. Going back in time to our analysts data, you reference, at that time, we were selling on the order of a core as many cars as we're selling today, our GPU was on the order of half, maybe even less than what it is today. And I think our EBITDA five 10, or 15 points worse. And so at that time, we were trying to provide pretty detailed walks for our investors, they could understand how those buildups would occur over time. I think, as we've matured, and as we've seen a lot of progress in many of those different line items. And I think, the market in general has a much better understanding of how the things progress, we're just kind of simplifying our reporting and kind of aligning more closely with industry standard. And so we don't tend to kind of break it out at that level of detail going forward. That said, I think it's not hard to infer the general areas that it's in, as you pointed to, and that general area is very exciting. And it's very strong compared to what we initially outlined at that analyst day, in 2018. So I think there's a couple reasons for that, some of them are fundamental and sustainable, I think we've really done a pretty good job with that business so we've made a lot of fundamental progress in terms of the way that we're able to assess credit risk and price, credit risk, and the way that we're able to monetize our finance platform. So there are a lot of things that we've done there that we're proud of. And we think that there's probably some additional fundamental value that we can unlock. I think we're also in something of a unique environment, you know, early in the pandemic, we tightened credit pretty dramatically, we've held credit tighter than probably would be the norm of almost constant. We've generally over kind of the last several quarters been in a very low interest rate environment. So that's helpful. So there are a couple things that aren't necessarily persistent across time. But we still think that there's progress to be made there. And then in the rest of other we think that there's progress to be made in our other existing items, we think there's progress to be made by adding additional items as well over time. So we think that that's, you'll want to have several success stories relative to our long-term model that we that we put out in 2018. And we think that gives us a lot of flexibility going forward. Sure, so I apologize. I think I'm not able to give you kind of boring answers to those questions. So we don't plan to kind of break out our tax rates for other products and services, we definitely do believe that there is room to continue to improve there. We've made a lot of improvement over the last several years, but we think there's clearly room to go from here. And so we'll work to do that. As far as, Google testing is a different ad product. We obviously use Google as one of our many customer acquisition channels. We use them in search marketing, and then we use them in several other ways as well. So I think we'll do that as a marketing channel. We'll evaluate it like we evaluate all of our other marketing channels. And to the extent it gives us a high quality return, and we would expect to utilize that as well. Sure. Go ahead, Mark. So nice multi car questionnaire, let's try to break it down. So I think, let me try to combine basically, the first two concepts, I think both tax refunds and stimulus basically take the form of government depositing relatively large checks in the bank account of many, many people at once. And so I think that didn't look materially different than it looked in years past, generally what happens is people start to get notifications, through email or wherever else that they have money to hit their account. And you'll see, kind of the evening before, you'll you know, we'll see a lot of traffic activity happen on the site, and then the next day, you'll start to see man show up. I think that that was undoubtedly material this year. As it relates to us, I think a key statistic to keep in mind is, we did grow sales sequentially 28%, and we also grew production sequentially 26%. We undoubtedly saw increased demand kind of on the day after stimulus was dropped, but then the form that that takes that just further compressed your inventory, therefore reducing conversion rates for everyone afterwards. And so I think if we had to try to imagine kind of what would have happened to our sales absent stimulus, I think, first of all, that's very hard to do. But just directionally, we clearly would have been less kind of on the days and weeks immediately after stimulus. And our expectations would have been more in the weeks, kind of couple weeks after the stimulus drop. So I don't know how big the impact was, but I think it was smaller for us this year than it would have been in previous years, because in previous years, we're carrying enough inventory heading into that kind of an event to be able to handle that big onslaught of demand and then still have sufficient inventory for our customers afterwards. So I do think it was a little bit different. And then the tax returns being pushed out a little bit. I do think that had an impact, but I think that impact is largely behind us. The vast majority of that impact is behind us. I don't think that's too meaningful for the future. So the tax filing date was pushed out a month from what I believe is April 15, to May 15. But the date at which most customers get money in their accounts has historically been sometime in February. If you go back, maybe 10 years, it was even kind of late January. But it's been slowly kind of moving out and more recently has been the end of February. That this year might have been a week later than normal and then probably had kind of a normal spread from there in terms of when you see the demand impact. But that didn't move as much, just the filing date itself moved. And the filing date itself is far less powerful than the day that the tax refunds are kind of released to the masses. Sure. So, we want to stay away, I think from giving too much detailed kind of intro period, color, but we provided an outlook in the shareholder letter and I think that captures our expectations. Demand has been very strong for really the last year for our offering. And we've continually been, carrying a lower inventory than we wish that we were carrying. We're excited now to kind of be at a place where we believe that we'll be able to start growing inventory, which we think is helpful, almost constant. So I would say things continue to look great from our perspective. There's nothing notable to call out that would go in any other direction. And kind of those expectations are what we have in our outlook. I think across the entire business, there's many, many different things that we can focus on, obviously we have a very complicated business for vehicle acquisition. Transporting it to the inspection centers running the inspection centers, merchandising it for customers, pricing for customers, building the finance business, running our warranty product, there's so much that we can work on. So we have across the business, we have on the order of 70 different product teams that are working on all these various roadmaps at different points in time. And we do our best to prioritize all the different projects as intelligently as we can. Generally speaking, we won't kind of comment on what that underlying prioritization looks like. But there's no doubt that there's opportunity in the future to add additional products, and that could be potentially exciting. So Pacific Northwest is obviously something that we've been looking at for a long time. But it's a relatively isolated population center the way up in the Northwest. And so it took us a long time to get to a place where we thought it was sensible to kind of add that to our logistics network. Over the last month or two, we've added that and we also added the Salt Lake City area in Utah, which kind of gives us a midpoint that allows us to connect up there with we also connect through California. So we thought it was an absolute time, obviously our long-term aspirations are to get to approximately 95% population coverage and to be a national brand. And so that was something that we need to do at some point. We've been holding off as we've been so constrained in inventory. But given your expectation, we're going to grow inventory and our visibility into head over the next couple years as well as our knowledge of our historical lag times and ramping up volumes in new markets. We thought now's a good time. So we went ahead and pull the trigger on that. And we're excited to kind of fill out the rest of our regional footprint. On brand awareness, I do think that we remain very low in brand awareness, our dollar spend is starting to approach pretty sizable numbers that are meaningful compared to the marketing budgets of lots of companies. But we have to also keep in mind, that kind of our accumulated dollar spend is still very low compared to a lot of more mature companies that have been around for a long time. And so we do think that it's still early, we're spending a lot in brand, we definitely spend a lot and kind of education, I think for a customer to buy a car from Carvana, they have to first that you exist, they have to next, understand what you do and kind of how it's different from buying a car in a traditional way. So we have a lot of different value props that we have to educate them about. And then they have to trust that you're real and your return policy is real, and that they can kind of trust the quality car that comes their way. And it all those things just take time to build up in consumer mind. So we're testing a lot, we're learning a lot as we go, I think we're very excited about the position that we're in with customer acquisition costs, given the knowledge that we've accumulated over time by just looking at how we've levered our older cohorts. So we're confident that we know how to lever customer acquisition pretty significantly. But we also believe that we're very early in brand building. And so as long as we find different channels that we think are hitting a different audience and educating them in a different way, like I said before, we're not going to be shy about spending that money and building our brand so you can get a good investment in the long-term. So I think there's maybe a couple ways to approach that problem. So first of all, every car that we sell is certified, its Carvana certified and our certification process was patterned off of some of the luxury manufacturers certification processes. And so the cars that we deliver to customers are of that kind of that quality. The specific brand certified pre owned, is generally reserved for the combination of kind of franchise dealers, and oftentimes, kind of the branded OEM warranty that gets associated with that sale, although, that's not always necessarily a condition of the brand of certified per owned. So, I think that we do believe that we're breaking into that market by building a brand of delivery, very high quality cars, and by building a logistics network and infrastructure of reconditioning centers that are able to certify cars to that same quality. So that's our goal. But the particular brand is generally protected by our four franchise dealers. Sure, well, so at a very high level of the market for selling cars are around 40 million possible units. Generally speaking, a customer is getting a car is also getting rid of another car. And so the market for us buying cars is kind of theoretically at least very similar in size. And if you look at Q1 sales of 92,000, and number of cars bought from customers, in a similar ballpark, you're basically looking at something like 1% of the market. So I think that we're very, very small compared to both of those markets. I think they are connected in certain ways through brand, particularly our brand and the speed at which we can build our brand and generate awareness across all customers that we both buy and sell cars. But they're also fairly disconnected in the sense that only a subset of those transactions happens simultaneously when a customer is simultaneously buying a car and trading another car. A lot of them are kind of separated in time, where customer will buy a car and then maybe sell a car later, sell a car and buy a car later. So, I think they can grow independently. We've undoubtedly seen tremendous, tremendous amount of progress in that business over the last couple of years and we're extremely excited about it and I think you're now basically the retail business and the business of buying cars and customers are going to race each other to the useable finish line somewhere out in the great blue yonder. I think for other GPU in general, we've definitely hit kind of our highest level ever. As described earlier, I do think that there are fundamental gains that we can continue to make in every line item of other GPU. And there are other opportunities for certain products that we can add over time. So I think that that's exciting. I also do think that it's hard to size, the kind of beneficial impacts that exists in this environment where, one, we're doing something that we have control over, but is likely leading to slightly higher, other GPU, which is running with tighter credit. And then two, we've benefited from very low interest rates. So those are likely to unwind. I think the balance of those things, is hard to precisely predict. But we're clearly in great shape versus the long-term model that we outlined a couple years ago. And I think it's too early, and we're in too unique of an environment to update that model. So we think in general, that's probably roughly the right way to continue to think about it. And obviously, we've done very well against that model in the last several quarters. Sure. So I think in the past, we talked about we have various tests, to try to see what are the various ways that we can ramp up our production capacity across the business that has included utilizing some third-party recon, we are continuing to utilize some third-party recon today, it remains a significant minority of the cars we produce overall and that's our expectation for the future as well. But it is something that we are utilizing and continuing to test today. Thank you. Sure. So I think on interest rates, they come down obviously, since pre pandemic pretty dramatically, and then they've kind of bounced around a little bit from there that there's been some upward movement over the last quarter or so but nothing material. And so I don't think that there's that the story there is that they're low. I don't think that recent movements are super material. In terms of customer service levels our focus from day one has been to build a business from the ground up that delivers great customer experiences and to build all the things that are required to really enable those great experiences to be differentiated in a fundamental way. And that's always been our focus. And I think when we look at kind of all of our scores for what customer experience looks like; there are a lot of different things that drive that. I think first and foremost is the way that we've designed the business the way that we've designed the customer experience. And then I think, from there, you've got your technology and your processes and the quality of those and kind of how good experiences are capable of delivering. I think very importantly, the next layer is your cultural layer. How much do all the people that talk to your customers that depicts your customers, cars that deliver the car to the customers. How much do they care about the customers and care about what we're doing together and emphasize with the exciting moments of customers having when they are getting a car, which is the second largest purchase they make in their life. And I think that we would like to think that we've done a pretty good job building a culture there that really cares about delivering great customer experiences. And I think the last layer is do you have sufficient capacity across your operations groups, to deliver to customers great experiences. And I think over time, we've been constrained many, many times in our life, obviously, throughout the pandemic, you've heard of various constraints, if we go back to 2019, we have logistics and market ops constraints. Prior to that, we had constraints in the call center in the different places. So we have had constraints across the business at various points in time. Those constraints generally do lead almost constant to our measures of customer experience going down a little bit. Now, when they go down, they've personally gone down by relatively small amounts, and they remain at levels that are far above industry standard. And then importantly, when we continue to kind of step up and get our feet underneath us and alleviate those constraints, we see them go right back to where they were, which means that we're in a great place in the kind of foundational elements that matter the most, which is business design, technology, processes and culture. And so we were really happy about the way that we've been able to manage customer experience, which is our primary goal through all of this growth that has driven us to be 1000 times larger company today than we were in the first year that launched in 2013. But undoubtedly, their impacts from very high levels of growth and those impacts are in the directions that you would expect, but I think we've done a good job managing them historically. Thanks, everyone for joining the call. And to the entire Carvana team, thank you. Great quarter great job, to all the operations teams. This has been a long slog; you've done an incredible job coming in every day and delivering great customer experiences. And we really appreciate it I hope that you hear the sincerity of that appreciation doesn't just sound like something that we say every call. To the inspection center team in particular, this has been an absolute battle. Great job to all of you. I know that you've taken the last couple calls and pinned those up on your locker for inspiration. Clearly it did inspire, you had done a great job. We really appreciate it. Please keep going. We still got a lot of ground to cover, but thanks to all. Have a good one."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie. And thank you all for joining us today. Q1 was a strong quarter for Carvana across all key financial metrics, and our financial results demonstrate significant progress toward our long-term goals. Retail unit sold in Q1 totaled 92,457, an increase of 76%. Total Revenue was $2.245 billion and increase of 104%. Revenue Growth outpaced retail unit growth due to higher retail average selling prices, and wholesale and other revenue. We expect revenue growth to outpace retail unit growth again in Q2, and then we expect revenue growth to be similar to retail unit growth in the back half of the year. Total GPU was $3,656 in Q1, an increase of $1,016 year-over-year, and $277 sequentially. Since Q1 2020 was impacted by the onset of COVID-19. In March, I will focus my commentary on sequential changes. Retail GPU declined slightly to $1,211 from $1,265 in Q4, reflecting a continuation of approximately $200 per unit of transitory costs, primarily driven by rapidly ramping or reconditioning capacity in the midst of COVID-19. We do not expect the majority of these transitory costs to impact Q2. Wholesale GPU increase to $227 from $108 in Q4, primarily driven by strong industry wide wholesale prices in the latter part of Q1. Other GPU increased to $2,218 from $2,006 in Q4, primarily driven by completing two public securitizations for the first time in Q1, paired with an increase in ancillary product attach rates that offset a one-time benefit in Q4. EBITDA margin was negative 1.3% in Q1, a 2.6 percentage point improvement from negative 3.9% in Q4, driven by both GPU gains and SG&A leverage. We ended the quarter with more than $2 billion in total liquidity resources, giving us significant flexibility to execute our plan. We had another strong quarter of buying cars from customers in Q1, buying approximately as many cars from customers as we sold to them and achieving a customer source ratio over 60%. Our success over the last two years has made the strength of our offering of buying cars from customers clear, and we no longer expect to provide detailed statistics on buying cars and customers each quarter. So far in Q2, we are seeing outstanding performance and in April, we set a new company record for cars bought from customers, both on an absolute basis and relative to retail unit sold. We are as excited as ever about the opportunities ahead. We continue to focus on scaling our production capacity to meet demand. In Q1, we opened our 12th IRC near Birmingham, Alabama, bringing our total annual production capacity to approximately 680,000 units at full utilization. We remain on track to open one additional IRC in Q2 and eight in 2022, bringing our total capacity at full utilization to over 1.2 5 million units by the end of 2022. So far in Q1, we've opened 22 new markets, bringing our total to 288 and increasing our population coverage to more than 77% of the U.S. population. In May, we also launched our first five markets in the Pacific Northwest, adding the last major region to our nationwide footprint. After Q2, we expect our path to 95% population coverage to primarily consist of opening smaller fill-in markets. In our Q4 2020 shareholder letter, we outlined our expectations for the year 2021 including accelerated retail unit sold growth, revenue growth in line with retail unit growth, total GPU in the mid-3000s and a small EBITDA margin loss, while investing for growth and continuing our progress on demonstrating leverage. We remain on track to meet or exceed these expectations and we continue to be excited about 2021 as a significant step toward our long-term goals. Thanks for your attention. We will now take questions. Sure. Then I'll hit the question on retail GPUs. So Q1 retail GPU was largely aligned with our expectations when taking into account the transitory costs that we talked about in Q4. I think when you look on a year-over-year basis, in addition to those transitory costs, last year; we talked some about the impact of some of the early phases of iteration on buying cars from customers that positively impacted GPU last Q1. I think there are some base effects from those early phases of iteration that's impacting the year-over-year comparison. I think when we look at where we're headed from here, we did call out that we expect the majority of those transitory costs impacted Q4 and Q1, this year to be gone by Q2. And so that's a tailwind to the retail GPU as we move toward to 2Q, other things being equal. Obviously, overall, we feel really good about our progress there, had a solid quarter in light of those transitory costs and expect to step up in Q2. Yes, sure, I can take that one. So I think it varies quarter-to-quarter. But a reasonable way to think about the benefit of sourcing it from our customers is to look at it in the context of our wholesale GPU. So basically, the wholesale GPU captures is the difference between, our acquisition cost of a car from customer and the wholesale market trading price of that car. And so that's a good way to think about the cost benefit of customer sourcing. And so that just gives you a sense to give you a sense of that, it varies quarter-to-quarter, this quarter, we were around $800 or so on wholesale GPU. And so I think that's, it does vary quarter-to-quarter. But that's, that's a reasonable way to just sort of keep track of the relative cost benefit of customer sourcing. Yes, sure. So, rough way to think about the capital investment related to one of these 67,000 unit IRCs is on the order of $50 million per IRC, maybe a little bit more than that, but on that order of magnitude. And then of course, the way we think about that, from a financing perspective is we've historically sale leaseback our IRC's, we think that there's lots of very efficient ways and a great market for financing those IRC investments, so that they're not actually net outlays for the business but they're financed outlays. And so that's to give you a rough order magnitude of how much they cost. And I think we feel really good about the desirability of those assets from a financing perspective. I can take that one. So I mean, I think, our number one channel for sourcing inventory, has now become sourcing cards directly from customers, which has several advantages that we've talked about historically, I think we're certainly going to continue to focus on that. That's a business that we want to build, and continue to grow over the long-term. And so I think that's our number one area of focus. And certainly the first answer to that question. I think in terms of the wholesale market dynamics, we're still certainly buying cars on the wholesale market, I think we're buying cars, we're making money on those cars, and we retail them. I think we feel very comfortable in the current environment. And from a sourcing perspective, our main area of focus is going to be continued to grow the business of buying cars from customers."

And now with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thanks, Meg. And thanks, everyone, for joining the call. 10 years ago, in January 2013, we launched Carvana in Atlanta, Georgia. We were a passionate group of people who believe we could build something new in the world that we would be proud of. What we need to do was simple: to change the way people buy and sell cars. There were a million little reasons to bet against us and most people who cared enough to even be aware of what we were trying to do would have. But there were two big reasons why we believe we could do it. One, there was room for new offering that customers would love. Two, we were a scrappy group who cared and were ready to fight for our dream. We stand here 10 years later in a place it was hard to imagine from where we started. We built an offering customers do love. We have brought that offering to over 300 markets across the country. We have bought and sold cars in a whole new way to millions of people, and we've laid the foundations to buy and sell many millions more. The big things overpowered the little things. This story skips a lot of time and as a result, it skips a lot of detail and gives too simple an impression. It feels linear. But the truth is there were a lot of ups and downs along the way. There were high highs and there were low lows. There were fun days and there were hard days. I think the truth of building something new in the world that there are usually more hard days than there are easy days, even though it doesn't sound that way in the stories. This is still true. Progress is rarely linear, and 2022 reminded us of that again. So what happened in 2022? The story is straightforward. One, we came into the year positioned for growth, similar to what we had experienced in the prior nine years. Two, after the pandemic snarled the automotive supply chains and historically rapidly rising interest rates combined to dramatically impact the affordability of used cars. Three, rising interest rates and market sentiment drove a significant shift in our priorities away from growth and toward profitability. Four, this combined to lead to markedly lower volumes than we had positioned for, and as a result, we've been carrying excess costs. 2022 had a lot of hard days. But we're a scrappy group, and hard days aren't always the worst thing in the world for scrappy people. Scrappy people find a way, and we're finding a way. The hard days are making us better, and we're doing our best work right now. As part of this work, we have three major milestones that we are marching forward. The first step is to drive the business to breakeven adjusted EBITDA. This is our current goal, and we will discuss the key drivers of this goal more in these remarks. The second step is to drive the business to significant positive unit economics. Breakeven adjusted EBITDA is a milestone, but it is not our goal. Our goal is positive free cash flow. The third step is to return to growth. Since launching in 2013, we have made capital investments of more than $4 billion, building the nation's largest used vehicle inspection and reconditioning infrastructure, first-party automotive logistics network and last mile automotive delivery network. We believe the investments we've already made laid the groundwork for not only significant growth in the future, but significantly more efficient growth that is significantly profitable. Today, we're focused on the first step, and we are well on our way with high visibility on the progress we expect to make. First, we expect to continue our SG&A expense reduction plan by reducing quarterly SG&A expenses by approximately $100 million in aggregate over the next two quarters. This will complete over $1 billion annualized SG&A cost reduction since the first quarter of 2022. We expect these expense reductions to be broad-based across all large SG&A expense components. But importantly, we do not expect the future reduction for us to be part of this plan. Second, we expect our weekly retail unit sales volume to stabilize relative to the declines we saw in the second half of 2022 as the seasonal headwinds we faced at that time transitioned to seasonal tailwinds. Stabilizing weekly retail unit sales volume will allow our SG&A expense savings to catch up to retail unit volumes, allowing us to demonstrate SG&A leverage that was elusive during periods of retail unit declines. Third, we expect a substantial reduction in our inventory size, which we accelerated in Q4 to lead to significant gains in retail GPU. While we don't expect to see meaningful gains on retail GPU in Q1, we expect to see the benefits of reducing inventory size become apparent in the following quarters. The progress we are making shows up first in operational metrics and then flows in the financial metrics later as those operational efficiencies get rolled out and utilized across the business. Across all operating groups, the operational progress we have already made and are continuing to make is significant. In logistics, our average delivery business is down 25% since early 2022. In market operations, we have built scheduling systems that currently allow us to pair over 1 out of 3 retail deliveries with a vehicle pickup, up from 1 out of 14 retail sales just one year ago. In customer care, our advocates are spending 40% less time in the phone per sale than they were in early 2022. And our vending machine pickup rates have more than doubled since the start of last year, with 40% of our customers nationwide now picking up their car at a vending machine even though we only have vending machines in a subset of our markets. Importantly, we have done all this while improving quality of our customer experiences over the last six months. As is often the case when working through these transitions and when the operational progress is beginning to convert into financial progress, there are some onetime items and extrapolations that need to be made to really see the quality of the progress we are currently making. These are outlined in the shareholder letter, and Mark will provide some color on them as well, but the progress is really beginning to show up. This will continue to get clear and to require less explanation over time as we expect the combination of these three factors to lead to significantly improved adjusted EBITDA profitability over the next two quarters. 2022 was a hard year, and we still have a lot of hard work in front of us to get to where we want to be. But we have a clear plan, and we are executing. This is still a 40 million unit a year market on average. We still have just 1% market share. We are still a passionate scrappy group who cares and who's ready to fight for our dream. Our customers do love our offering. We have built the capabilities and laid the foundations to buy and sell cars with millions and millions of customers, and there are still a million little reasons to bet against us. We expect the big things to overpower the little things just as they have in the past. We are firmly on the path to building the nation's largest and most profitable automotive retailer and to achieving our mission of changing the way people buy cars. The march continues. Mark?\nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our results in 2022 were driven by numerous external factors as well as our internal decisions made to shift priorities toward profitability. We came into 2022 significantly overbuilt for the volume we ultimately realized. Through the year, we have been executing our plan to drive profitability by steadily reducing expenses, normalizing inventory size and executing profitability initiatives that make us more efficient, more resilient and more flexible. For the full year 2022, retail units sold totaled 412,296, a decrease of 3% year-over-year. While this was the first year that our retail units sold declined year-over-year, 2022 marked our ninth consecutive year of market share gains against the backdrop of double-digit industry declines. Revenue totaled $13.604 billion in 2022, an increase of 6% year-over-year, marking our ninth consecutive year of revenue growth. We finished the year as the second largest seller of used vehicles in the country for the third consecutive year. The scale that we have already achieved and the time line on which we have achieved it demonstrates the long-standing strength of our customer offering. Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our remaining remarks on fourth quarter results with a particular focus on sequential changes and the unique items impacting the quarter as well as our near-term outlook. Our long-term financial goal is to generate significant net income and free cash flow. In service of this goal, in the near term, our management team is focused on driving progress on a set of non-GAAP financial metrics that are inputs into this long-term goal. In order to provide clear visibility into our progress, beginning in Q4, we are reporting two new non-GAAP metrics, non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP SG&A expense, that adjust for certain noncash and nonrecurring revenues and expenses. We are also updating our adjusted EBITDA definition to exclude revenue from Root warrants as well as share-based compensation and restructuring expenses. We provide more detail on these metrics in the supplemental financial tables available on the Events and Presentations page of our IR website and in our Form 10-K. In the fourth quarter, retail units sold totaled 86,977, a decrease of 23% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Our sequential decline in retail units sold was only slightly larger than the industry's sequential decline of 12%, despite several actions we are taking to increase near-term profitability, including: one, normalizing inventory size; two, reducing advertising; three, proactively adjusting to increases in benchmark interest rates; and four, continuing to focus on executing our profitability initiatives. Total revenue was $2.8 billion in Q4, a decrease of 24% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, approximately in line with retail units sold. Non-GAAP total GPU was $2,667 in Q4 versus $3,870 in Q3. Total GPU in Q4 was driven by several unique items across the retail, wholesale and other components. Non-GAAP retail GPU was $632 in Q4 versus $1,267 in Q3. Retail GPU was impacted by a $52 million or $598 per unit adjustment to our retail inventory allowance, which was primarily driven by elevated industry-wide retail depreciation rates and higher than normalized inventory size relative to sales volumes. Other sequential changes in retail GPU were primarily driven by higher retail depreciation rates, partially offset by wider spreads between retail prices and acquisition prices and lower cost of sales. In addition to the allowance adjustment, retail GPU was also impacted by carrying a higher than normalized inventory size relative to sales, which resulted in longer turn times. Longer turn times lead to higher vehicle depreciation, which has a negative impact on retail GPU, other things being equal. One way to quantify the impact of extended turn times is to isolate retail GPU for vehicles sold within 90 days of the acquisition date. These vehicles realized approximately $600 per unit higher retail GPU in Q4 compared to retail units in aggregate. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $552 in Q4 versus $682 in Q3. Wholesale GPU included a combined $103 per unit impact due to a $5 million adjustment to our wholesale inventory allowance and a $4 million loss on certain retail vehicles we sold in the wholesale market in the quarter. Sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by these impacts and lower seasonal wholesale marketplace volume. Non-GAAP other GPU was $1,483 in Q4 and versus $1,921 in Q3. Other GPU was primarily impacted by a shift in the timing of a sale of a pool of loans to Ally from December to January to align with the upsize and extension of our forward flow purchase agreement. We estimate this shift in timing reduced other gross profit by $42 million or $483 per retail unit sold based on the actual sales price of the loans we realized in January, less incremental interest income we earned on the loans in December. In Q4, we made significant progress reducing SG&A expenses for the second consecutive quarter, reducing non-GAAP SG&A expense by $60 million sequentially, following a greater than $60 million sequential reduction in Q3. These expense reductions were broad-based, including advertising, compensation and benefits, logistics and other. While we significantly reduced SG&A expense over the past two quarters, we have not yet meaningfully levered SG&A expense per retail unit sold because retail units sold have declined at a pace similar to SG&A expense reductions. As Ernie discussed, we expect our weekly retail unit sales volume to stabilize relative to the declines we saw in the second half of 2022 as seasonal headwinds transition to seasonal tailwinds. We expect stabilizing retail unit sales to allow our SG&A expense savings to catch up to retail unit volumes leading to SG&A leverage. Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 was a loss of $291 million or 10.1% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by a total of $103 million due to the unique retail, wholesale and other GPU items described above. Finally, as a result of the decline in trading prices of our securities by the end of the fourth quarter, we recorded a goodwill impairment expense of $847 million. The goodwill impairment was not related to changes in our long-term expectations for our business or the operations of any prior acquisitions. As we've discussed previously, our goal is to manage the business to achieve over 4,000 total GPU and significant adjusted EBITDA profitability at current, higher or lower volume levels. Focusing in on Q1 2023, we currently expect the following. On retail units, we currently expect the sequential reduction in retail units sold in Q1 compared to Q4 as we continue to normalize our inventory size, optimize marketing spend and make progress on our profitability initiatives. On GPU, we currently expect a sequential increase in total GPU in Q1 compared to Q4. We expect retail GPU to increase in Q1 due to multiple offsetting effects. First, we are quickly reducing our inventory size by purchasing fewer retail vehicles. Purchasing fewer retail vehicles means fewer low age units are added to the website, which other things being equal, increases the average age of our inventory and of retail units sold and reduces retail GPU. At the same time, we expect our lower inventory size to lead to a retail inventory allowance adjustment benefit in Q1, leading total Q1 retail GPU to be higher than Q4. We also expect a sequential increase in other GPU in Q1, following the shift in the timing of loan sales from December to January previously discussed. On SG&A, we are currently targeting an aggregate of approximately $1 million reduction in quarterly non-GAAP SG&A expense by Q2 2023 compared to Q4 2022 as we continue to execute our plan across all areas of the business. On December 31st, we had approximately $3.9 billion in total liquidity resources, including $1.9 billion in cash and revolving availability and $2 billion in unpledged real estate and other assets, including more than $1.1 billion of real estate acquired with ADESA. We also ended the quarter with approximately 1.3 million annual units of inspection and reconditioning center capacity at full utilization, including ADESA locations. Over the last several years, we've made significant investments into building out one of the auto industry's largest and most expansive inspection and reconditioning network. While we remain focused on more efficiently leveraging our existing footprint in the near term, we believe having access to this massive infrastructure positions us very well for growth with limited incremental investment in the future. Our liquidity position, production runway and our clear and focused operating plan position us well to achieve our goal of driving positive cash flow and becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer in the future. Thank you for your attention. We will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nSharon Zackfia: Ernie, you were talking really fast. But I think you said 40% of vehicles were picked up at vending machines. I think it was in the fourth quarter. I didn't catch what that compared to maybe relative to a year ago? And I guess were you incentivizing to get to that number? It also begs the question, kind of how high could that go? What is the kind of trade-off in terms of GPU when you get a customer to come to vending machine for pickup? And I noticed in the shareholder letter, you also mentioned starting to offer a pickup at non-vending machine locations. So, I guess, this is a long question to just ask, are we seeing some sort of evolution in the model, which would be kind of more what I would think of as an omnichannel model versus a pure e-com?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So first, apologies for the fast talking. That is my habit. And so, in the prepared remarks, I didn't compare it to anything. It is 40% nationwide at vending machines, even though we only have vending machines in a subset of markets, and that is roughly double since early 2022. We are testing other pickup options as well, and we are incentivizing customers to do that. And what I would say there is, I think across the entire business, we're testing all kinds of opportunities to decrease our operational costs and then see what the impact is to both customer speed of getting them a car and also customer experience. And I think this is one of many areas where we're seeing really strong results there.\nSharon Zackfia: Can I just ask a follow-up? So when you do customer research, I mean how important is delivery and what the customers want? I mean, it would seem transparency, quality of car, the car they're getting, all of that is very important, but is delivery really high on the list?\nErnie Garcia: I think it depends on the customer, and I think that's why we've kind of structured the system to give them their option. So, I think all of those things are important. And I think the easiest thing that we can measure is, in aggregate, how customers are responding to the sum total of their experience. And we are talking now about the vending machine, but there's many other examples there that I'll repeat that I kind of spoke about in my prepared remarks. Delivery distance is also down 25% since early 2022. We talked about activity pairings. That can be a bit of a confusing one to make sure your understanding. But we've got -- obviously, many customers that are buying cars from us. We have many customers that are selling cars to us. And so activity pairing is building the logic into our schedule that allows us to ensure that when a customer leaves a hub or a vending machine, they can complete two transactions in a single path, which is obviously a lot more efficient. That's gone from about 1 in 14 customers to approximately 1 out of 3 customers in the last year. So, we're making gains all over the place. And we are seeing that really show up in operational gains first, which then I think you're starting to get a peek into impact they'll have financially, but that does take more time. So we tend to roll these out in markets. We get a sense for the impact of both customer experience and cost and efficiency, and then we roll them out nationwide, and then we kind of are able to realize the dollar gains thereafter. So I think you'll probably start to see more of those gains over the next two quarters, which is why we're feeling really good about our cost reduction plan over the next two quarters. But we've been doing all of that and many, many more examples that would fit under the same umbrella. But we take different forms in every group, and we've seen customer experiences go up in the last six months. So I think overall, we're really excited about the way that's playing out. We still have a lot of work to do, but the team is doing a great job.\nSharon Zackfia: Okay. Last question for me. I know you said you're working towards EBITDA breakeven at current volumes. What's your line of sight on timing on that?\nErnie Garcia: As fast as possible. I think we're going to be moving as quickly as we possibly can. We gave, I think, some hopefully helpful guide rails in there around driving down SG&A dollars by $100 million over the next two quarters. I think Mark spoke quite a bit about some of the GPU visibility that we have that is very high. Something that is imposing a very significant cost across GPU right now is the choice to drive down our inventory rapidly. We're very confident that's the right choice for the business. Sales volumes are low relative to the inventory that we're carrying and, therefore, turn times are high. And especially in a high depreciation environment, it's important to get those two things in balance, but the transition from too large of inventory to the right size of inventory means that turn times are even longer. That showed up in lower GPU in the quarter and in an allowance that we're taking as more of those cars that we expect to sell in the future are likely to have negative margins. So, that's a transitory cost. If you look at the rate at which we're selling cars relative to the cars that we have in inventory, it's a much better number, but the transition is expensive. So, I think there's a lot of visibility there. Mark also spoke a bit about the visibility we have in finance as we had a loan sale timing shift in Q4 that was costly. So, I think there's hopefully a lot of building blocks there that will give you a sense. And our goal is heads down sprint, and we'll get there as quickly as we can.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Bottiglieri with Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nChris Bottiglieri: The first one is, in Q1, are you still taking provisions to increase the inventory allowance adjustment that's causing pressure retail GPU and wholesale? Is there a way to frame out how much is left? Like what percentage of units are 90 days or older? And they're still in inventory today? And what's normal? Looks like -- I imagine this happens routinely, but just give us context for what's left.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So I mean, I think the -- I think there's a couple of different ways to think about that. One, I wouldn't say there is any concept of what's left. I think we -- to set the allowance on 12/31, we looked at the cars that we had on balance sheet on 12/31. And then we formed expectations about the cars that we're going to sell at a loss and at what level those cars we\u2019re going to sell at a loss, and then we recorded that allowance on that basis. I do think some of the things that benefit the inventory allowance is inventory size. I think shrinking inventory, getting inventory more in line with sales volume. Those are certainly beneficial from the standpoint of retail inventory allowance. As you sort of alluded to, a retail inventory allowance is something that's always in our results. We adjust our allowance every month, and retail inventory allowance is reflected in our results every quarter. It just happened to be particularly large on 12/31 in light of the dynamics that we saw in Q4 with much higher than normalized inventory size and also very elevated industry-wide retail depreciation rates. So, that's why it had an outsized effect on Q4. I think just to take that point home, I do think we've made really strong moves in normalizing our inventory size in Q4 and so far in Q1, our inventory size is much closer to a normal size relative to sales volumes than certainly it was in Q4. And we do think that over time, that will flow into positive tailwinds for retail GPU as we called out throughout our materials.\nChris Bottiglieri: Got you. Okay. Thanks. And then just a bigger picture question. If I can squeeze one more in. When you're speaking to these profitability at current levels, are you extrapolating market share of your immature markets still like some natural run rate of the mature business? Because I think your national market share compared to Atlanta or some of them are early market at a similar point in time. Was Atlanta profitable on that penetration? Like I guess what gives you the visibility to achieve profitability at such a low volume level? And I think personally, you get well above that over time, so I'm not sure why this profitability level frankly matters in the near term, but just curious how you're thinking about all that.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Yes. So I mean, I think we mean that in the simplest way it can be interpreted, which is we believe that we can achieve EBITDA positive at the current volumes that we're at across the entire company. We're not extrapolating to kind of market shares that we have in some more mature markets. We're making a ton of progress on SG&A, and there's room for a ton more progress, frankly, given all the operational gains that we're seeing, and there's a lot of visibility in GPU progress as well. So, I think this last year has been a massive change in priorities for the Company. The world changed on us very, very quickly. And we shifted our priorities very, very quickly. And undoubtedly, that's been a difficult transition. But I think there's no doubt that it's leading to a more efficient company. I think that is not yet fully showing up in the numbers, but there's no doubt it's showing up very clearly in the operational numbers, and we expect it to show up in the numbers in the not-too-distant future. So, we believe that we can get to EBITDA positivity at current volumes and to significantly positive EBITDA at current volumes, and then we obviously expect to continue to grow from there and to get even more EBITDA positive on a unit basis from there as well. So, I think we've got a lot of work in front of us, but we've got a lot of great visibility as well.\nOperator: The next question is from Rajat Gupta with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRajat Gupta: Ernie, I think the elephant in the room is the $600 million or so of interest expense, if you get to EBITDA breakeven at some point next year or later next year. You also need to add more debt at some stage to continue to just pay the ongoing additional debt. Is there anything you can do or considering to use that burden, perhaps some form of restructuring that can take place, leveraging the real estate and find some sort of a middle ground with the bondholders? Just curious what level of engagement you have there. Any broader thoughts on that? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, so I mean, I think our plan, we try to break into three steps. Step one is get to EBITDA positive. We've got to have mile markers along the way. Step two is get a meaningfully positive EBITDA per unit, positive unit economics. And then step three is to start to grow. And we believe that with that plan, we have believed and continue to believe that we have the opportunity to run that plan and to not need to raise additional capital. Obviously, the question about whether or not we'll raise capital in the future is largely a function of the speed at which we drive down SG&A, the speed at which we drive up GPU and the speed at which we're able to also drive up units, once we bought them. And subtle changes in the shape of those curves can change the answer quite a bit. So, our plan is to not need to raise additional capital. But obviously, we'll be paying attention. We'll do what we need to do that's right for the business. I think we have access to capital in many forms. We've obviously got a lot of real estate that's very high quality. We have approximately $2 billion of real estate, approximately half in ADESA and half kind of original Carvana real estate. The majority of that is inspection centers, which are high-quality financeable properties. We've got a lot of other assets as well, and we've got capacity to put in more secured debt. We've got capacity to put in more unsecured debt. Obviously, in the future, we chose to -- and we believe it was the right choice, we could raise equity. So, I think we have a lot of options if we choose that that's the right path for the Company. But today, we're focused on the operating plan that's got our full attention, and we're marching that to hit the numbers that we've outlined.\nRajat Gupta: Got it. That's clear. Maybe just on SG&A, you talked about the additional $100 million in reduction in the first half year. And you also mentioned coming across different buckets. I think one area where I believe you've not seen the meaningful reduction yet is the other SG&A, seemingly a bigger fixed component of your SG&A. Is a good chunk of that $100 million coming from that particular line item? Because I think you mentioned also that you don't expect more forced reductions or force reduction. So just curious like if you could help us understand where that $100 million is coming from. Thanks.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes. So, we talked a little bit about that in the letter. The -- we do expect the SG&A reductions, the $100 million in aggregate in quarterly expense reductions that we're targeting over the next two quarters to come across the major line items. So in that, I would include payroll, I would include advertising, logistics and the other expense bucket. I do think there's -- we certainly see opportunities to reduce other SG&A expenses, including in categories that you may traditionally think of as fixed. I think we have numerous projects ongoing to just be more efficient in our corporate and technology expenses. I think there's many areas across that component of SG&A, where we're very focused on efficiency and do expect to gain savings from that component as part of our plan over the next two quarters.\nOperator: And the next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Just a follow-up on the last question. Even if you do hit your breakeven EBITDA goal, you're still carrying $100 million plus in CapEx and $600 million in interest expense. So maybe burning $700 million or so in cash. And your liquidity got -- support that for a period of time. But eventually, you'll run out of time. How do you expect to address that conundrum?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, I think as we discussed, step 1 of the plan is breakeven adjusted EBITDA, and step 2 is to go beyond that, and then step 3 is to grow. So, that's undoubtedly a milestone in the plan, but it's not the plan, and we think we've got a lot of visibility beyond that. So, as we discussed, we're focused to hit that plan. And we believe that if we hit in the ways that we're aiming to hit it, we've got a real shot at not requiring additional capital. If we're wrong, then we have lots of ways to go out and get additional capital.\nSeth Basham: Got it. And secondly, as it relates to the loan sales to Ally, could you help us understand the margins on those under the new agreement relative to the old agreement and whether there is still substantial loans on the balance sheet at this point in time relative to $1.3 billion that you had at the end of the quarter?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think first order, we completed the deal with Ally. It's the seventh year in that relationship. That's something that we're extremely proud of. We think it's been a great program for both of us. They've certainly been there for us in difficult times, including recently. They were there for us in COVID. And we would like to think that we've been great partners for them as well, especially in better times, and that they've had access to high-quality loans that are generally outperforming similar credit quality loans across that entire time. So, I think that's been a great partnership for us. And I think as we headed to the end of the year, we had a bunch of loans that we're looking to sell. We are also getting that renewal done. And it made sense to kind of complete the renewal first and push that over the years. So, we had approximately $1 billion of extra loans that shifted over year-end. As part of that deal, as you'd imagine, Ally does have more spread than they've historically had. But that spread is reflective of market conditions, which is kind of the structure that we generally have in our deal. And then we take those spreads, and we pass them on, and that enabled us to earn similar finance GPU to what we've earned in the past. So I think that's been a great deal for us. It gives us certainty of execution, and they've been a great partner for a long time, and we couldn't be happier with it. And then in addition, today, we also closed our first securitization of the year. So, we'll continue to operate a multichannel strategy, and we plan to catch up on loan sales in the first half of this year.\nOperator: The next question is from Zachary Fadem with Wells Fargo.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Sam Reed [ph] pinch hitting for Zach Fadem. First, big picture. Kind of what's the assumption for industry volumes that you're embedding in your Q1 unit outlook? And does that sequential pullback you're looking from here, what you're seeing across the industry? Thanks. And then I've got one other industry follow-up.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Yes. So, let me start a little bigger picture. I think we're now a 10-year-old company. And I think for -- basically, for nine years of our life, well, we were in a reasonably stable environment. We were certainly in a stable environment for 7.5 years of our life, and then we went through COVID, but we still had somewhat similar used vehicle sales volume at the industry level. And then, I think for the last year, we saw those volumes at the industry level drop by -- on the order of 10%, give or take, and I certainly think that has correlated with a bunch of choices that we've made to shrink up and to focus on profitability, and I think basically with more pressure on independence even relative to franchise dealers. And so undoubtedly, the last year has been a much slower year for us. It's the first year where we actually shrunk by 3%. We've grown very, very quickly in all previous years. And so, I think the correlation is there where when the market was shrinking, we were shrinking. When the market was stable, we were growing. I do think that that is more correlation than it is direct causation. The market moving up or down by 10% relative to all the growth rates that we've seen in every year of our life prior to this year would be very, very small relative to how quickly we were growing. So I think, of course, we always have something of an embedded view around what's going to happen at the industry level. But we generally don't think that that's the biggest driver of our success. I think it happens to have correlated because many things occurred. Most notably, interest rates shooting up and car price shooting up over the last year that had a real impact on the industry in general, but us in particular. So, I would say probably the best way to evaluate that is we generally are looking at the market being flattish go forward. But we also, I don't think, are ever speaking in terms that are precise enough to where likely movements in the macro industry level sales volumes are that likely to impact us super dramatically. We would expect them to flow through to our results in the same way that they impact the industry in sum total. And then I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question?\nUnidentified Analyst: No, it's just another industry question here. It kind of follows on advertising and volumes. You've seen -- you guys have done a good job of pulling back on advertising. But what are you seeing kind of across the industry? And is there a similar pullback that's taking place across your peer set? And as you pull back on advertising, can you compare and contrast your share of voice today versus where it might have been before you started to pull back?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, let's start with the maybe peers in automotive because I think the automotive world, yes, there's been a lot of interesting things happening over the last 1.5-year that are probably more distorted than any period that I can remember in my career. When I say distorted, I mean abnormal. There's been a lot of things that have been abnormal. So, we went through this period where cars very rapidly appreciated. And for the most part, consumers were going to get enough spots where that didn't necessarily impact industry-level sales volumes that much in 2022 as we saw cars start to slowly come down, but rates go up. We saw affordability stay in a pretty similar spot, but we saw the industry generally get softer. I think franchise dealers have done incredibly well through the last two years. I think if you kind of grab there, pick your kind of bottom line metric, but to make it comparable to ours, if you grab their EBITDA margins over the last 20 years, you would see extreme outliers over the last couple of years. I think that while new volumes have gone down, new margins have gone up by more than the volumes have gone down, and so there's been a lot of profitability there. I think given how high car prices are, they've been able to convert many would-be new car buyers in to used car buyers, and they've had an advantaged supply of used cars as they've been returned off lease. And those off-lease returns were priced in a completely different vehicle price environment. So they're able to acquire those cars at residuals that are far below the market value, even though historically, on average, residuals roughly approximated the market value. And so I think for franchise dealers, it's been a great environment. And I think many of them have not been super aggressively pulling back if we speak kind of an aggregate over the last 1.5 years. I think for independents, there's probably two categories there as well. There's those that were buying strictly from auction and those that were buying elsewhere. I think for those buying certainly from auction, it's been a very tough environment because the auction is the place where there's also been dramatic changes over the last couple of years, and it's been hard to acquire cars to carry a normal relative to history margin there. I think for those that have acquired cars from customers at meaningful scale, I think the last couple of years have actually been somewhat average from a profitability perspective. And so I think most of those retailers have probably played kind of a relatively average gain from an advertising perspective over the last couple of years. So I think those things are starting to change a little bit as we saw the market soften a little bit in 2022. We've recently seen the market be reasonably strong as it relates to changes in prices early this year. I think a lot of dealers probably came into the year with low inventories and weren't feeling super confident after November and December. And there's normally kind of a seasonal inventory build in car price appreciation around this time of the year when tax money is coming, and we've definitely seen that this year. And then, I think there's another peer set as well, which is kind of growth companies and technology companies out there, and I think that peer set has undoubtedly pulled back materially on marketing. I think the moves there have probably been much more dramatic, and we are certainly pulling back pretty dramatically on marketing. I think you can see that in our results in Q4, and there's certainly more of that to come. We're in a unique environment where GPUs are lower than they've been in the recent past. And kind of all those constant, that means fewer transactions make sense to acquire. We've also focused almost exclusively on profitability over the last year. That means many transactions that we would have acquired because we believe that they made sense over a longer-term time horizon, we have not been acquiring more recently. And then the customer responsiveness is different in this environment. And so, we've been retesting all of our different marketing channels. In many ways, most effectively through our many markets, we'll use our markets as laboratories to turn on and off different marketing channels to try to assess what we think the effectiveness is of any given marketing channel. And I think that we found that in this environment, in most cases, there's room for us to probably pull back quite a bit on marketing because we're not getting the return that we've got in the past. And so, we're doing that, we're doing that purposefully. We're making sure we roll out those tests and we do it in a way that doesn't derail the entire business and cause it to get out of balance. But I think that there's a real economic opportunity there for us to pull back on marketing. And so, we've been doing that, and we'll likely do that. When we do that, we are much more likely to back in direct marketing channels than we are in brand channels. I think one of the reasons that we're able to efficiently pull back on marketing spend today is because we've been able to build a high-quality brand over a long period of time, and so we want to be careful that we preserve that and continue to invest in that brand. But I do think there's opportunities in these direct channels, and I think you're starting to see that show up in some of our results. So, that was a long answer to a question you partially asked. I hope it was helpful, but that's how we're thinking about all that.\nOperator: The next question is from Winnie Dong with Deutsche Bank.\nUnidentified Analyst: I was wondering if you can give us an update on sort of the integration of ADESA and where you are with footprint integration relative to the logistical savings that can be achieved for the benefit of GPU. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned getting back to that $4,000 in GPU. I was wondering if you can frame it around what you think the time frame is to achieving that? That's my first question, and then I have a follow-up. Thanks\nErnie Garcia: Great. Sure. So I think we're making a ton of progress with the integration of ADESA. ADESA has 56 incredible sites around the country, and we currently have 75% of the cars that we buy from customers that we plan to sell wholesale that are now landing at ADESA properties. That's a really significant change from obviously where we were six months ago or certainly 12 months ago when we -- prior to the acquisition. That's very helpful from an efficiency perspective. It means those cars are on the ground in a location, where they can get rapidly inspected and sold. It means that the transportation to those locations is much less than it would have historically been because we're closer to ADESA. And so you'll start to see that flowing through in our wholesale margin. That footprint is incredible, and we really look forward to the gains that we'll continue to get in wholesale, in logistics and, ultimately, in reconditioning over time. But I think a lot of those gains will come more when we get to step 3 of the equation, which is turning growth back up. In the meantime, the ADESA team has been doing a great job. It's been a tough couple of years for auction businesses. I think post pandemic has been a very odd time for the auction business in general. But they've been doing a great job. They've got a great plan. We feel good about the path that they're on, and so we're excited there. And then, as it relates to the time frame to getting back to $4,000 GPU, I apologize for not being more precise in this response, but I think we tried to give some building blocks that we think are pretty big, and so I'll just -- I'll repeat some of those. If you kind of start with our GPU that was at about $2,600 and then you look at kind of the retail allowance, which we obviously don't expect to be a recurring item, that would get you up $600. If you look at our wholesale allowance, which is the same concept that exists in our wholesale inventory, that's another $100. If you look at the shift in our loan sale timing, that's just shy of $500. Mark gave a helpful stat that talked about our sales of cars that are less than 90 days aged in Q4, which would have been an additional $600 on top of all of that. We still have a significant room in our non-vehicle COGS. We called out that there was probably $600 of possible gains there in Q1 or Q2 relative to what we had achieved in the past. We probably have $300 or $400 of additional gains there to be had. We're getting those gains more slowly as a result of shrinking our inventory than we might have otherwise if we weren't shrinking our inventory. Shrinking our inventory means that we're buying fewer cars, and it means that the overhead of the inspection centers is spread between fewer cars. And there's some efficiency impacts when you're buying fewer cars, but that's also transitory. So, I think that's a big opportunity for us. And there are others. So I think the opportunity is all there. It's very clear. We just have executing to do, and we'll go get it.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then, I was wondering if you can also comment on sort of like the go-forward strategy in terms of mix of inventory. I think you had previously indicated that you going -- on a go-forward basis going to tailor towards the lower price inventory just given the current macro conditions. Can you give us a sense of that\u2019s something still on the plan amid your plan to reduce inventory?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes, I can take that one. So just to set the stage a little bit, so the way we typically approach inventory mix is by evaluating what our customers are shopping for on the site and balancing that against what we're seeing in the market in terms of what customers or other suppliers are selling. And the combination of those two things dictate what mix of inventory we end up putting on the site. I would say we've talked a lot about inventory on this call. And certainly, our inventory has been too large relative to sales volume. We were working very ambitiously to correct that. In terms of mix, I wouldn't say there's any particular patterns to call out. I think the -- I think we'll continue to evaluate as we look forward from where we are here in Q1 and just be reading the demand signals, reading the supply signals and doing our best to balance the two of those. But right now, I don't think that points to any particular shift that's worth calling out at this time.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMichael Montani: Just wanted to ask, if I could, when do you think that you would be in a position to kind of switch back to offense with respect to taking market share again? Would it be potentially third quarter when the SG&A reductions would have been substantively made? And if it is, do you need to basically start growing SG&A in accelerated pace to take market share, or do you think there's enough muscle that you could just be more productive, I guess, at a lower run rate moving forward?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think it's the third step in the plan right now. And the reason it's the third step in the plan is that I do think -- we were one of the more aggressive growth companies out there for the entirety of our life, basically from when we started 10 years ago until about a year ago. And that requires an alignment of thousands of people with priorities and what's being done and how we're working on things and how we make decisions. And I think that it's a lot of work, and it's very difficult to turn that quickly and focus completely on profitability, which is what we've done over the last 12 months. And there are definitely some, I would say, transition costs to just get thousands of people aligned on a new set of goals that we're all equally excited about and that we have a lot of work to do and a lot of gains to be had. And so, I think we paid those kind of fixed costs to transition. And I think as a result, we'll probably hang out here with priorities that look more like our current priorities for a little longer than might even be kind of optimal given what the market is putting in front of us just because it is expensive to have these big priority changes. And so, I don't know exactly when that will be. I think even over the last 3 or 4 months, we've learned a lot as we've gone. Many of these things that we do, we outline projects that we think make sense and then we roll them out, and then we learn what the reality is. They have some impacts to customer experience. They have some impacts to customer conversion. They have some impacts to our underlying costs. And they suggest an optimal path forward as it relates to the balance of the way that we pull those levers and the volume that we sell. And so, I think what we've seen over the last 3 or 4 months is more of our projects are probably having bigger operational gains than we may have kind of hoped for, but they're also pushing in the direction of fewer sales. And so, that's where we've aggressively shifted in the last several months toward smaller inventory, and we plan to kind of catch and bottom at a smaller level of sales than we probably would have imagined even six months ago. And I think we still have learning to do because there's still many, many of these projects in our backlog that we're rolling out. So, I don't think we know exactly what the answer to that question is. But I don't think it obviously has to be a super long time, and I think that it's time for growth. We're going to head into growth a much more efficient company. We're going to head into growth, a company that knows exactly how to do that. We're going to head into grow the company that has an infrastructure advantage that is materially different than the infrastructure advantage we had when we were growing last time. So, I think that will be an exciting time. It's not obviously that far away, but I don't think we yet know exactly when it is. And for now, we're going to keep our heads down on the plan that we outlined.\nMichael Montani: Got it. And if I could just quickly follow up on one other angle was EBITDA. So for this year, I was getting to EBITDA loss in the $400 million to $600 million range for 2023. And that's basically like a slight decline in units, low $3,000s in total GPU, SG&A improvements like you've discussed and so kind of $1 billion plus of cash burn if you include the interest expense. I didn't know if you'd care to kind of comment on any of that or any key drivers that could give upside or downside to consider.\nMark Jenkins: I would suggest reading our shareholder letter. I think we talked a lot about some of the near-term drivers of profitability as well as a sort of broader way to think about our plan, and I think that will most likely be helpful for trying to shed some light on our near-term expectations.\nOperator: The next question is from Ron Josey with Citi.\nRon Josey: I wanted to ask more about supply and just how you balance the supply reductions with demand and conversion rates? And wondering how this sort of conversion rates are trending? I'm assuming they're coming down simply because people might not have what they're looking for. And so just historically, I understand inventory is coming down, just wondering on conversion there. And then, maybe on the flip side of the marketing question. Ernie, you've seen the reduced marketing investments. Just talk to us about any lessons learned in terms of maybe awareness or traffic as you pull back on advertising. I think you said some of it didn't have a positive -- as positive in ROI. Maybe just talk about just inherent sort of awareness at Carvana that you don't need to market as much going forward and maintain sort of the sales that they are. Thank you, guys.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you. Okay. Sure. So let's start with the first question. I think undoubtedly, inventory impacts conversion. And so as inventory is reduced, we expect conversion to also be reduced and so sales to be reduced, all else constant. I think the way that we can kind of try to think about that and reduce that to a math equation that is going to kind of flow into the second question is we can basically say, okay, given our estimates of inventory elasticity, what is the sales benefit of carrying a larger inventory and then what is the depreciation cost of carrying a larger inventory? And we can compare those two, and we can effectively get to a customer acquisition cost for those incremental transactions. And the way all that math works is you -- one, at any given level of depreciation you have kind of an optimal balance of inventory relative to sales, which shows up in a turn time goal. And then the way you kind of shift around that is when depreciation is higher, you want to have a smaller inventory. And when depreciation is lower, you want to have a larger inventory. And I think we're, A, in a -- well, right now, we're actually kind of in a maybe even appreciating environment in the wholesale market, but we've been for a year in a rapidly depreciating environment. And I think probably the smarter guess over the next year or two is that it will be a depreciating environment on average because car prices are still elevated relative to other goods. So, that as well as the fact that we have until recently had a large inventory relative to sales, both point in the same direction, which is the optimal inventory is smaller. And as discussed earlier, that's costly in terms of the margin we realized as we're transitioning out of that large inventory. And to some degree, it's also costly as it relates to sales. But we can do all the math on that and try to make the smartest choice as we can. I think we talked a lot on the way up about the positive feedback in the business. As the business gets bigger, it gets better. And it is also true that when we are shrinking, that creates kind of negative feedback loops that we have to be mindful of and make it a little bit harder. But that's all taken into account as we build out our plans and calculate what we think is the best set of moves in this environment, given our current priorities. So, I think the impacts are exactly as you'd expect directionally, and then I hope that was helpful color in terms of the way that we think about it and the way that it impacts the business. On marketing, I would say there's a lot of potential learnings there. We're in a pretty different world than we were two years ago, and so I think we ought to be careful to not extrapolate them as absolute truth. We have to evaluate we're learning of things that are true in this environment. I think it is highly likely that our brand is materially stronger than it was a couple of years ago. And I think as we go through and we reevaluate various marketing channels, I think that does seem to be having an impact on what we think the ROI is of those various channels. Again, I reserve the right to kind of end up being wrong on that, but I think that's what the data looks like today. I think a general learning is it's important when you're growing fast and the business is rapidly changing to make sure that you revisit decisions that you previously made that might have been made under different contexts. And I think that marketing looks like there may be some opportunities there as well. We're under different context. There were choices that made more sense than they make under today's context. And I think so far, what we've learned has pushed us in the direction of lower marketing. But again, marketing is a delicate thing because you're building a brand, which is a very hard-to-measure thing, and it's very important that you continue to build that brand. And so I think you want to take care. And it's, I think, easier to move with more conviction in a more quantitative way when you're talking about direct channels because those have less of an immediate brand impact. They still have a brand impact because they show up in terms of ex transactions, and then those people who buy cars may tell their friends and family about it. But they have less brand impact than the brand channels, and so we will be more careful with the brand channels. But we'll be careful in general, and we're definitely doing a lot of testing as we move down in total marketing spend.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ernie Garcia for any closing remarks.\nErnie Garcia: Perfect. Well, thank you everyone for joining the call. To everyone on team Carvana, thank you so much for the work you guys are doing. This has been a tough year, undoubtedly. We've made huge strides, massive changes, a huge pivot in priorities, and I'm just always reminded of how much you care and how much you fight. This is a team of fighters. You have been fighting hard, and it is showing up. It's going to keep showing up. We've still got some fighting left to do, but we're going to do it. So, thanks to all. We'll talk to you guys next quarter.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ernie Garcia",
            "content": "Thanks, Meg. And thanks, everyone, for joining the call. 10 years ago, in January 2013, we launched Carvana in Atlanta, Georgia. We were a passionate group of people who believe we could build something new in the world that we would be proud of. What we need to do was simple: to change the way people buy and sell cars. There were a million little reasons to bet against us and most people who cared enough to even be aware of what we were trying to do would have. But there were two big reasons why we believe we could do it. One, there was room for new offering that customers would love. Two, we were a scrappy group who cared and were ready to fight for our dream. We stand here 10 years later in a place it was hard to imagine from where we started. We built an offering customers do love. We have brought that offering to over 300 markets across the country. We have bought and sold cars in a whole new way to millions of people, and we've laid the foundations to buy and sell many millions more. The big things overpowered the little things. This story skips a lot of time and as a result, it skips a lot of detail and gives too simple an impression. It feels linear. But the truth is there were a lot of ups and downs along the way. There were high highs and there were low lows. There were fun days and there were hard days. I think the truth of building something new in the world that there are usually more hard days than there are easy days, even though it doesn't sound that way in the stories. This is still true. Progress is rarely linear, and 2022 reminded us of that again. So what happened in 2022? The story is straightforward. One, we came into the year positioned for growth, similar to what we had experienced in the prior nine years. Two, after the pandemic snarled the automotive supply chains and historically rapidly rising interest rates combined to dramatically impact the affordability of used cars. Three, rising interest rates and market sentiment drove a significant shift in our priorities away from growth and toward profitability. Four, this combined to lead to markedly lower volumes than we had positioned for, and as a result, we've been carrying excess costs. 2022 had a lot of hard days. But we're a scrappy group, and hard days aren't always the worst thing in the world for scrappy people. Scrappy people find a way, and we're finding a way. The hard days are making us better, and we're doing our best work right now. As part of this work, we have three major milestones that we are marching forward. The first step is to drive the business to breakeven adjusted EBITDA. This is our current goal, and we will discuss the key drivers of this goal more in these remarks. The second step is to drive the business to significant positive unit economics. Breakeven adjusted EBITDA is a milestone, but it is not our goal. Our goal is positive free cash flow. The third step is to return to growth. Since launching in 2013, we have made capital investments of more than $4 billion, building the nation's largest used vehicle inspection and reconditioning infrastructure, first-party automotive logistics network and last mile automotive delivery network. We believe the investments we've already made laid the groundwork for not only significant growth in the future, but significantly more efficient growth that is significantly profitable. Today, we're focused on the first step, and we are well on our way with high visibility on the progress we expect to make. First, we expect to continue our SG&A expense reduction plan by reducing quarterly SG&A expenses by approximately $100 million in aggregate over the next two quarters. This will complete over $1 billion annualized SG&A cost reduction since the first quarter of 2022. We expect these expense reductions to be broad-based across all large SG&A expense components. But importantly, we do not expect the future reduction for us to be part of this plan. Second, we expect our weekly retail unit sales volume to stabilize relative to the declines we saw in the second half of 2022 as the seasonal headwinds we faced at that time transitioned to seasonal tailwinds. Stabilizing weekly retail unit sales volume will allow our SG&A expense savings to catch up to retail unit volumes, allowing us to demonstrate SG&A leverage that was elusive during periods of retail unit declines. Third, we expect a substantial reduction in our inventory size, which we accelerated in Q4 to lead to significant gains in retail GPU. While we don't expect to see meaningful gains on retail GPU in Q1, we expect to see the benefits of reducing inventory size become apparent in the following quarters. The progress we are making shows up first in operational metrics and then flows in the financial metrics later as those operational efficiencies get rolled out and utilized across the business. Across all operating groups, the operational progress we have already made and are continuing to make is significant. In logistics, our average delivery business is down 25% since early 2022. In market operations, we have built scheduling systems that currently allow us to pair over 1 out of 3 retail deliveries with a vehicle pickup, up from 1 out of 14 retail sales just one year ago. In customer care, our advocates are spending 40% less time in the phone per sale than they were in early 2022. And our vending machine pickup rates have more than doubled since the start of last year, with 40% of our customers nationwide now picking up their car at a vending machine even though we only have vending machines in a subset of our markets. Importantly, we have done all this while improving quality of our customer experiences over the last six months. As is often the case when working through these transitions and when the operational progress is beginning to convert into financial progress, there are some onetime items and extrapolations that need to be made to really see the quality of the progress we are currently making. These are outlined in the shareholder letter, and Mark will provide some color on them as well, but the progress is really beginning to show up. This will continue to get clear and to require less explanation over time as we expect the combination of these three factors to lead to significantly improved adjusted EBITDA profitability over the next two quarters. 2022 was a hard year, and we still have a lot of hard work in front of us to get to where we want to be. But we have a clear plan, and we are executing. This is still a 40 million unit a year market on average. We still have just 1% market share. We are still a passionate scrappy group who cares and who's ready to fight for our dream. Our customers do love our offering. We have built the capabilities and laid the foundations to buy and sell cars with millions and millions of customers, and there are still a million little reasons to bet against us. We expect the big things to overpower the little things just as they have in the past. We are firmly on the path to building the nation's largest and most profitable automotive retailer and to achieving our mission of changing the way people buy cars. The march continues. Mark? Sure. So first, apologies for the fast talking. That is my habit. And so, in the prepared remarks, I didn't compare it to anything. It is 40% nationwide at vending machines, even though we only have vending machines in a subset of markets, and that is roughly double since early 2022. We are testing other pickup options as well, and we are incentivizing customers to do that. And what I would say there is, I think across the entire business, we're testing all kinds of opportunities to decrease our operational costs and then see what the impact is to both customer speed of getting them a car and also customer experience. And I think this is one of many areas where we're seeing really strong results there. I think it depends on the customer, and I think that's why we've kind of structured the system to give them their option. So, I think all of those things are important. And I think the easiest thing that we can measure is, in aggregate, how customers are responding to the sum total of their experience. And we are talking now about the vending machine, but there's many other examples there that I'll repeat that I kind of spoke about in my prepared remarks. Delivery distance is also down 25% since early 2022. We talked about activity pairings. That can be a bit of a confusing one to make sure your understanding. But we've got -- obviously, many customers that are buying cars from us. We have many customers that are selling cars to us. And so activity pairing is building the logic into our schedule that allows us to ensure that when a customer leaves a hub or a vending machine, they can complete two transactions in a single path, which is obviously a lot more efficient. That's gone from about 1 in 14 customers to approximately 1 out of 3 customers in the last year. So, we're making gains all over the place. And we are seeing that really show up in operational gains first, which then I think you're starting to get a peek into impact they'll have financially, but that does take more time. So we tend to roll these out in markets. We get a sense for the impact of both customer experience and cost and efficiency, and then we roll them out nationwide, and then we kind of are able to realize the dollar gains thereafter. So I think you'll probably start to see more of those gains over the next two quarters, which is why we're feeling really good about our cost reduction plan over the next two quarters. But we've been doing all of that and many, many more examples that would fit under the same umbrella. But we take different forms in every group, and we've seen customer experiences go up in the last six months. So I think overall, we're really excited about the way that's playing out. We still have a lot of work to do, but the team is doing a great job. As fast as possible. I think we're going to be moving as quickly as we possibly can. We gave, I think, some hopefully helpful guide rails in there around driving down SG&A dollars by $100 million over the next two quarters. I think Mark spoke quite a bit about some of the GPU visibility that we have that is very high. Something that is imposing a very significant cost across GPU right now is the choice to drive down our inventory rapidly. We're very confident that's the right choice for the business. Sales volumes are low relative to the inventory that we're carrying and, therefore, turn times are high. And especially in a high depreciation environment, it's important to get those two things in balance, but the transition from too large of inventory to the right size of inventory means that turn times are even longer. That showed up in lower GPU in the quarter and in an allowance that we're taking as more of those cars that we expect to sell in the future are likely to have negative margins. So, that's a transitory cost. If you look at the rate at which we're selling cars relative to the cars that we have in inventory, it's a much better number, but the transition is expensive. So, I think there's a lot of visibility there. Mark also spoke a bit about the visibility we have in finance as we had a loan sale timing shift in Q4 that was costly. So, I think there's hopefully a lot of building blocks there that will give you a sense. And our goal is heads down sprint, and we'll get there as quickly as we can. Sure. Yes. So I mean, I think we mean that in the simplest way it can be interpreted, which is we believe that we can achieve EBITDA positive at the current volumes that we're at across the entire company. We're not extrapolating to kind of market shares that we have in some more mature markets. We're making a ton of progress on SG&A, and there's room for a ton more progress, frankly, given all the operational gains that we're seeing, and there's a lot of visibility in GPU progress as well. So, I think this last year has been a massive change in priorities for the Company. The world changed on us very, very quickly. And we shifted our priorities very, very quickly. And undoubtedly, that's been a difficult transition. But I think there's no doubt that it's leading to a more efficient company. I think that is not yet fully showing up in the numbers, but there's no doubt it's showing up very clearly in the operational numbers, and we expect it to show up in the numbers in the not-too-distant future. So, we believe that we can get to EBITDA positivity at current volumes and to significantly positive EBITDA at current volumes, and then we obviously expect to continue to grow from there and to get even more EBITDA positive on a unit basis from there as well. So, I think we've got a lot of work in front of us, but we've got a lot of great visibility as well. Sure. Well, so I mean, I think our plan, we try to break into three steps. Step one is get to EBITDA positive. We've got to have mile markers along the way. Step two is get a meaningfully positive EBITDA per unit, positive unit economics. And then step three is to start to grow. And we believe that with that plan, we have believed and continue to believe that we have the opportunity to run that plan and to not need to raise additional capital. Obviously, the question about whether or not we'll raise capital in the future is largely a function of the speed at which we drive down SG&A, the speed at which we drive up GPU and the speed at which we're able to also drive up units, once we bought them. And subtle changes in the shape of those curves can change the answer quite a bit. So, our plan is to not need to raise additional capital. But obviously, we'll be paying attention. We'll do what we need to do that's right for the business. I think we have access to capital in many forms. We've obviously got a lot of real estate that's very high quality. We have approximately $2 billion of real estate, approximately half in ADESA and half kind of original Carvana real estate. The majority of that is inspection centers, which are high-quality financeable properties. We've got a lot of other assets as well, and we've got capacity to put in more secured debt. We've got capacity to put in more unsecured debt. Obviously, in the future, we chose to -- and we believe it was the right choice, we could raise equity. So, I think we have a lot of options if we choose that that's the right path for the Company. But today, we're focused on the operating plan that's got our full attention, and we're marching that to hit the numbers that we've outlined. Sure. Well, I think as we discussed, step 1 of the plan is breakeven adjusted EBITDA, and step 2 is to go beyond that, and then step 3 is to grow. So, that's undoubtedly a milestone in the plan, but it's not the plan, and we think we've got a lot of visibility beyond that. So, as we discussed, we're focused to hit that plan. And we believe that if we hit in the ways that we're aiming to hit it, we've got a real shot at not requiring additional capital. If we're wrong, then we have lots of ways to go out and get additional capital. Sure. So I think first order, we completed the deal with Ally. It's the seventh year in that relationship. That's something that we're extremely proud of. We think it's been a great program for both of us. They've certainly been there for us in difficult times, including recently. They were there for us in COVID. And we would like to think that we've been great partners for them as well, especially in better times, and that they've had access to high-quality loans that are generally outperforming similar credit quality loans across that entire time. So, I think that's been a great partnership for us. And I think as we headed to the end of the year, we had a bunch of loans that we're looking to sell. We are also getting that renewal done. And it made sense to kind of complete the renewal first and push that over the years. So, we had approximately $1 billion of extra loans that shifted over year-end. As part of that deal, as you'd imagine, Ally does have more spread than they've historically had. But that spread is reflective of market conditions, which is kind of the structure that we generally have in our deal. And then we take those spreads, and we pass them on, and that enabled us to earn similar finance GPU to what we've earned in the past. So I think that's been a great deal for us. It gives us certainty of execution, and they've been a great partner for a long time, and we couldn't be happier with it. And then in addition, today, we also closed our first securitization of the year. So, we'll continue to operate a multichannel strategy, and we plan to catch up on loan sales in the first half of this year. Sure. Yes. So, let me start a little bigger picture. I think we're now a 10-year-old company. And I think for -- basically, for nine years of our life, well, we were in a reasonably stable environment. We were certainly in a stable environment for 7.5 years of our life, and then we went through COVID, but we still had somewhat similar used vehicle sales volume at the industry level. And then, I think for the last year, we saw those volumes at the industry level drop by -- on the order of 10%, give or take, and I certainly think that has correlated with a bunch of choices that we've made to shrink up and to focus on profitability, and I think basically with more pressure on independence even relative to franchise dealers. And so undoubtedly, the last year has been a much slower year for us. It's the first year where we actually shrunk by 3%. We've grown very, very quickly in all previous years. And so, I think the correlation is there where when the market was shrinking, we were shrinking. When the market was stable, we were growing. I do think that that is more correlation than it is direct causation. The market moving up or down by 10% relative to all the growth rates that we've seen in every year of our life prior to this year would be very, very small relative to how quickly we were growing. So I think, of course, we always have something of an embedded view around what's going to happen at the industry level. But we generally don't think that that's the biggest driver of our success. I think it happens to have correlated because many things occurred. Most notably, interest rates shooting up and car price shooting up over the last year that had a real impact on the industry in general, but us in particular. So, I would say probably the best way to evaluate that is we generally are looking at the market being flattish go forward. But we also, I don't think, are ever speaking in terms that are precise enough to where likely movements in the macro industry level sales volumes are that likely to impact us super dramatically. We would expect them to flow through to our results in the same way that they impact the industry in sum total. And then I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question? Sure. Well, let's start with the maybe peers in automotive because I think the automotive world, yes, there's been a lot of interesting things happening over the last 1.5-year that are probably more distorted than any period that I can remember in my career. When I say distorted, I mean abnormal. There's been a lot of things that have been abnormal. So, we went through this period where cars very rapidly appreciated. And for the most part, consumers were going to get enough spots where that didn't necessarily impact industry-level sales volumes that much in 2022 as we saw cars start to slowly come down, but rates go up. We saw affordability stay in a pretty similar spot, but we saw the industry generally get softer. I think franchise dealers have done incredibly well through the last two years. I think if you kind of grab there, pick your kind of bottom line metric, but to make it comparable to ours, if you grab their EBITDA margins over the last 20 years, you would see extreme outliers over the last couple of years. I think that while new volumes have gone down, new margins have gone up by more than the volumes have gone down, and so there's been a lot of profitability there. I think given how high car prices are, they've been able to convert many would-be new car buyers in to used car buyers, and they've had an advantaged supply of used cars as they've been returned off lease. And those off-lease returns were priced in a completely different vehicle price environment. So they're able to acquire those cars at residuals that are far below the market value, even though historically, on average, residuals roughly approximated the market value. And so I think for franchise dealers, it's been a great environment. And I think many of them have not been super aggressively pulling back if we speak kind of an aggregate over the last 1.5 years. I think for independents, there's probably two categories there as well. There's those that were buying strictly from auction and those that were buying elsewhere. I think for those buying certainly from auction, it's been a very tough environment because the auction is the place where there's also been dramatic changes over the last couple of years, and it's been hard to acquire cars to carry a normal relative to history margin there. I think for those that have acquired cars from customers at meaningful scale, I think the last couple of years have actually been somewhat average from a profitability perspective. And so I think most of those retailers have probably played kind of a relatively average gain from an advertising perspective over the last couple of years. So I think those things are starting to change a little bit as we saw the market soften a little bit in 2022. We've recently seen the market be reasonably strong as it relates to changes in prices early this year. I think a lot of dealers probably came into the year with low inventories and weren't feeling super confident after November and December. And there's normally kind of a seasonal inventory build in car price appreciation around this time of the year when tax money is coming, and we've definitely seen that this year. And then, I think there's another peer set as well, which is kind of growth companies and technology companies out there, and I think that peer set has undoubtedly pulled back materially on marketing. I think the moves there have probably been much more dramatic, and we are certainly pulling back pretty dramatically on marketing. I think you can see that in our results in Q4, and there's certainly more of that to come. We're in a unique environment where GPUs are lower than they've been in the recent past. And kind of all those constant, that means fewer transactions make sense to acquire. We've also focused almost exclusively on profitability over the last year. That means many transactions that we would have acquired because we believe that they made sense over a longer-term time horizon, we have not been acquiring more recently. And then the customer responsiveness is different in this environment. And so, we've been retesting all of our different marketing channels. In many ways, most effectively through our many markets, we'll use our markets as laboratories to turn on and off different marketing channels to try to assess what we think the effectiveness is of any given marketing channel. And I think that we found that in this environment, in most cases, there's room for us to probably pull back quite a bit on marketing because we're not getting the return that we've got in the past. And so, we're doing that, we're doing that purposefully. We're making sure we roll out those tests and we do it in a way that doesn't derail the entire business and cause it to get out of balance. But I think that there's a real economic opportunity there for us to pull back on marketing. And so, we've been doing that, and we'll likely do that. When we do that, we are much more likely to back in direct marketing channels than we are in brand channels. I think one of the reasons that we're able to efficiently pull back on marketing spend today is because we've been able to build a high-quality brand over a long period of time, and so we want to be careful that we preserve that and continue to invest in that brand. But I do think there's opportunities in these direct channels, and I think you're starting to see that show up in some of our results. So, that was a long answer to a question you partially asked. I hope it was helpful, but that's how we're thinking about all that. Great. Sure. So I think we're making a ton of progress with the integration of ADESA. ADESA has 56 incredible sites around the country, and we currently have 75% of the cars that we buy from customers that we plan to sell wholesale that are now landing at ADESA properties. That's a really significant change from obviously where we were six months ago or certainly 12 months ago when we -- prior to the acquisition. That's very helpful from an efficiency perspective. It means those cars are on the ground in a location, where they can get rapidly inspected and sold. It means that the transportation to those locations is much less than it would have historically been because we're closer to ADESA. And so you'll start to see that flowing through in our wholesale margin. That footprint is incredible, and we really look forward to the gains that we'll continue to get in wholesale, in logistics and, ultimately, in reconditioning over time. But I think a lot of those gains will come more when we get to step 3 of the equation, which is turning growth back up. In the meantime, the ADESA team has been doing a great job. It's been a tough couple of years for auction businesses. I think post pandemic has been a very odd time for the auction business in general. But they've been doing a great job. They've got a great plan. We feel good about the path that they're on, and so we're excited there. And then, as it relates to the time frame to getting back to $4,000 GPU, I apologize for not being more precise in this response, but I think we tried to give some building blocks that we think are pretty big, and so I'll just -- I'll repeat some of those. If you kind of start with our GPU that was at about $2,600 and then you look at kind of the retail allowance, which we obviously don't expect to be a recurring item, that would get you up $600. If you look at our wholesale allowance, which is the same concept that exists in our wholesale inventory, that's another $100. If you look at the shift in our loan sale timing, that's just shy of $500. Mark gave a helpful stat that talked about our sales of cars that are less than 90 days aged in Q4, which would have been an additional $600 on top of all of that. We still have a significant room in our non-vehicle COGS. We called out that there was probably $600 of possible gains there in Q1 or Q2 relative to what we had achieved in the past. We probably have $300 or $400 of additional gains there to be had. We're getting those gains more slowly as a result of shrinking our inventory than we might have otherwise if we weren't shrinking our inventory. Shrinking our inventory means that we're buying fewer cars, and it means that the overhead of the inspection centers is spread between fewer cars. And there's some efficiency impacts when you're buying fewer cars, but that's also transitory. So, I think that's a big opportunity for us. And there are others. So I think the opportunity is all there. It's very clear. We just have executing to do, and we'll go get it. Sure. So I think it's the third step in the plan right now. And the reason it's the third step in the plan is that I do think -- we were one of the more aggressive growth companies out there for the entirety of our life, basically from when we started 10 years ago until about a year ago. And that requires an alignment of thousands of people with priorities and what's being done and how we're working on things and how we make decisions. And I think that it's a lot of work, and it's very difficult to turn that quickly and focus completely on profitability, which is what we've done over the last 12 months. And there are definitely some, I would say, transition costs to just get thousands of people aligned on a new set of goals that we're all equally excited about and that we have a lot of work to do and a lot of gains to be had. And so, I think we paid those kind of fixed costs to transition. And I think as a result, we'll probably hang out here with priorities that look more like our current priorities for a little longer than might even be kind of optimal given what the market is putting in front of us just because it is expensive to have these big priority changes. And so, I don't know exactly when that will be. I think even over the last 3 or 4 months, we've learned a lot as we've gone. Many of these things that we do, we outline projects that we think make sense and then we roll them out, and then we learn what the reality is. They have some impacts to customer experience. They have some impacts to customer conversion. They have some impacts to our underlying costs. And they suggest an optimal path forward as it relates to the balance of the way that we pull those levers and the volume that we sell. And so, I think what we've seen over the last 3 or 4 months is more of our projects are probably having bigger operational gains than we may have kind of hoped for, but they're also pushing in the direction of fewer sales. And so, that's where we've aggressively shifted in the last several months toward smaller inventory, and we plan to kind of catch and bottom at a smaller level of sales than we probably would have imagined even six months ago. And I think we still have learning to do because there's still many, many of these projects in our backlog that we're rolling out. So, I don't think we know exactly what the answer to that question is. But I don't think it obviously has to be a super long time, and I think that it's time for growth. We're going to head into growth a much more efficient company. We're going to head into growth, a company that knows exactly how to do that. We're going to head into grow the company that has an infrastructure advantage that is materially different than the infrastructure advantage we had when we were growing last time. So, I think that will be an exciting time. It's not obviously that far away, but I don't think we yet know exactly when it is. And for now, we're going to keep our heads down on the plan that we outlined. Thank you. Okay. Sure. So let's start with the first question. I think undoubtedly, inventory impacts conversion. And so as inventory is reduced, we expect conversion to also be reduced and so sales to be reduced, all else constant. I think the way that we can kind of try to think about that and reduce that to a math equation that is going to kind of flow into the second question is we can basically say, okay, given our estimates of inventory elasticity, what is the sales benefit of carrying a larger inventory and then what is the depreciation cost of carrying a larger inventory? And we can compare those two, and we can effectively get to a customer acquisition cost for those incremental transactions. And the way all that math works is you -- one, at any given level of depreciation you have kind of an optimal balance of inventory relative to sales, which shows up in a turn time goal. And then the way you kind of shift around that is when depreciation is higher, you want to have a smaller inventory. And when depreciation is lower, you want to have a larger inventory. And I think we're, A, in a -- well, right now, we're actually kind of in a maybe even appreciating environment in the wholesale market, but we've been for a year in a rapidly depreciating environment. And I think probably the smarter guess over the next year or two is that it will be a depreciating environment on average because car prices are still elevated relative to other goods. So, that as well as the fact that we have until recently had a large inventory relative to sales, both point in the same direction, which is the optimal inventory is smaller. And as discussed earlier, that's costly in terms of the margin we realized as we're transitioning out of that large inventory. And to some degree, it's also costly as it relates to sales. But we can do all the math on that and try to make the smartest choice as we can. I think we talked a lot on the way up about the positive feedback in the business. As the business gets bigger, it gets better. And it is also true that when we are shrinking, that creates kind of negative feedback loops that we have to be mindful of and make it a little bit harder. But that's all taken into account as we build out our plans and calculate what we think is the best set of moves in this environment, given our current priorities. So, I think the impacts are exactly as you'd expect directionally, and then I hope that was helpful color in terms of the way that we think about it and the way that it impacts the business. On marketing, I would say there's a lot of potential learnings there. We're in a pretty different world than we were two years ago, and so I think we ought to be careful to not extrapolate them as absolute truth. We have to evaluate we're learning of things that are true in this environment. I think it is highly likely that our brand is materially stronger than it was a couple of years ago. And I think as we go through and we reevaluate various marketing channels, I think that does seem to be having an impact on what we think the ROI is of those various channels. Again, I reserve the right to kind of end up being wrong on that, but I think that's what the data looks like today. I think a general learning is it's important when you're growing fast and the business is rapidly changing to make sure that you revisit decisions that you previously made that might have been made under different contexts. And I think that marketing looks like there may be some opportunities there as well. We're under different context. There were choices that made more sense than they make under today's context. And I think so far, what we've learned has pushed us in the direction of lower marketing. But again, marketing is a delicate thing because you're building a brand, which is a very hard-to-measure thing, and it's very important that you continue to build that brand. And so I think you want to take care. And it's, I think, easier to move with more conviction in a more quantitative way when you're talking about direct channels because those have less of an immediate brand impact. They still have a brand impact because they show up in terms of ex transactions, and then those people who buy cars may tell their friends and family about it. But they have less brand impact than the brand channels, and so we will be more careful with the brand channels. But we'll be careful in general, and we're definitely doing a lot of testing as we move down in total marketing spend. Perfect. Well, thank you everyone for joining the call. To everyone on team Carvana, thank you so much for the work you guys are doing. This has been a tough year, undoubtedly. We've made huge strides, massive changes, a huge pivot in priorities, and I'm just always reminded of how much you care and how much you fight. This is a team of fighters. You have been fighting hard, and it is showing up. It's going to keep showing up. We've still got some fighting left to do, but we're going to do it. So, thanks to all. We'll talk to you guys next quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our results in 2022 were driven by numerous external factors as well as our internal decisions made to shift priorities toward profitability. We came into 2022 significantly overbuilt for the volume we ultimately realized. Through the year, we have been executing our plan to drive profitability by steadily reducing expenses, normalizing inventory size and executing profitability initiatives that make us more efficient, more resilient and more flexible. For the full year 2022, retail units sold totaled 412,296, a decrease of 3% year-over-year. While this was the first year that our retail units sold declined year-over-year, 2022 marked our ninth consecutive year of market share gains against the backdrop of double-digit industry declines. Revenue totaled $13.604 billion in 2022, an increase of 6% year-over-year, marking our ninth consecutive year of revenue growth. We finished the year as the second largest seller of used vehicles in the country for the third consecutive year. The scale that we have already achieved and the time line on which we have achieved it demonstrates the long-standing strength of our customer offering. Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our remaining remarks on fourth quarter results with a particular focus on sequential changes and the unique items impacting the quarter as well as our near-term outlook. Our long-term financial goal is to generate significant net income and free cash flow. In service of this goal, in the near term, our management team is focused on driving progress on a set of non-GAAP financial metrics that are inputs into this long-term goal. In order to provide clear visibility into our progress, beginning in Q4, we are reporting two new non-GAAP metrics, non-GAAP gross profit and non-GAAP SG&A expense, that adjust for certain noncash and nonrecurring revenues and expenses. We are also updating our adjusted EBITDA definition to exclude revenue from Root warrants as well as share-based compensation and restructuring expenses. We provide more detail on these metrics in the supplemental financial tables available on the Events and Presentations page of our IR website and in our Form 10-K. In the fourth quarter, retail units sold totaled 86,977, a decrease of 23% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. Our sequential decline in retail units sold was only slightly larger than the industry's sequential decline of 12%, despite several actions we are taking to increase near-term profitability, including: one, normalizing inventory size; two, reducing advertising; three, proactively adjusting to increases in benchmark interest rates; and four, continuing to focus on executing our profitability initiatives. Total revenue was $2.8 billion in Q4, a decrease of 24% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, approximately in line with retail units sold. Non-GAAP total GPU was $2,667 in Q4 versus $3,870 in Q3. Total GPU in Q4 was driven by several unique items across the retail, wholesale and other components. Non-GAAP retail GPU was $632 in Q4 versus $1,267 in Q3. Retail GPU was impacted by a $52 million or $598 per unit adjustment to our retail inventory allowance, which was primarily driven by elevated industry-wide retail depreciation rates and higher than normalized inventory size relative to sales volumes. Other sequential changes in retail GPU were primarily driven by higher retail depreciation rates, partially offset by wider spreads between retail prices and acquisition prices and lower cost of sales. In addition to the allowance adjustment, retail GPU was also impacted by carrying a higher than normalized inventory size relative to sales, which resulted in longer turn times. Longer turn times lead to higher vehicle depreciation, which has a negative impact on retail GPU, other things being equal. One way to quantify the impact of extended turn times is to isolate retail GPU for vehicles sold within 90 days of the acquisition date. These vehicles realized approximately $600 per unit higher retail GPU in Q4 compared to retail units in aggregate. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $552 in Q4 versus $682 in Q3. Wholesale GPU included a combined $103 per unit impact due to a $5 million adjustment to our wholesale inventory allowance and a $4 million loss on certain retail vehicles we sold in the wholesale market in the quarter. Sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by these impacts and lower seasonal wholesale marketplace volume. Non-GAAP other GPU was $1,483 in Q4 and versus $1,921 in Q3. Other GPU was primarily impacted by a shift in the timing of a sale of a pool of loans to Ally from December to January to align with the upsize and extension of our forward flow purchase agreement. We estimate this shift in timing reduced other gross profit by $42 million or $483 per retail unit sold based on the actual sales price of the loans we realized in January, less incremental interest income we earned on the loans in December. In Q4, we made significant progress reducing SG&A expenses for the second consecutive quarter, reducing non-GAAP SG&A expense by $60 million sequentially, following a greater than $60 million sequential reduction in Q3. These expense reductions were broad-based, including advertising, compensation and benefits, logistics and other. While we significantly reduced SG&A expense over the past two quarters, we have not yet meaningfully levered SG&A expense per retail unit sold because retail units sold have declined at a pace similar to SG&A expense reductions. As Ernie discussed, we expect our weekly retail unit sales volume to stabilize relative to the declines we saw in the second half of 2022 as seasonal headwinds transition to seasonal tailwinds. We expect stabilizing retail unit sales to allow our SG&A expense savings to catch up to retail unit volumes leading to SG&A leverage. Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 was a loss of $291 million or 10.1% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by a total of $103 million due to the unique retail, wholesale and other GPU items described above. Finally, as a result of the decline in trading prices of our securities by the end of the fourth quarter, we recorded a goodwill impairment expense of $847 million. The goodwill impairment was not related to changes in our long-term expectations for our business or the operations of any prior acquisitions. As we've discussed previously, our goal is to manage the business to achieve over 4,000 total GPU and significant adjusted EBITDA profitability at current, higher or lower volume levels. Focusing in on Q1 2023, we currently expect the following. On retail units, we currently expect the sequential reduction in retail units sold in Q1 compared to Q4 as we continue to normalize our inventory size, optimize marketing spend and make progress on our profitability initiatives. On GPU, we currently expect a sequential increase in total GPU in Q1 compared to Q4. We expect retail GPU to increase in Q1 due to multiple offsetting effects. First, we are quickly reducing our inventory size by purchasing fewer retail vehicles. Purchasing fewer retail vehicles means fewer low age units are added to the website, which other things being equal, increases the average age of our inventory and of retail units sold and reduces retail GPU. At the same time, we expect our lower inventory size to lead to a retail inventory allowance adjustment benefit in Q1, leading total Q1 retail GPU to be higher than Q4. We also expect a sequential increase in other GPU in Q1, following the shift in the timing of loan sales from December to January previously discussed. On SG&A, we are currently targeting an aggregate of approximately $1 million reduction in quarterly non-GAAP SG&A expense by Q2 2023 compared to Q4 2022 as we continue to execute our plan across all areas of the business. On December 31st, we had approximately $3.9 billion in total liquidity resources, including $1.9 billion in cash and revolving availability and $2 billion in unpledged real estate and other assets, including more than $1.1 billion of real estate acquired with ADESA. We also ended the quarter with approximately 1.3 million annual units of inspection and reconditioning center capacity at full utilization, including ADESA locations. Over the last several years, we've made significant investments into building out one of the auto industry's largest and most expansive inspection and reconditioning network. While we remain focused on more efficiently leveraging our existing footprint in the near term, we believe having access to this massive infrastructure positions us very well for growth with limited incremental investment in the future. Our liquidity position, production runway and our clear and focused operating plan position us well to achieve our goal of driving positive cash flow and becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer in the future. Thank you for your attention. We will now take questions. Sure. So I mean, I think the -- I think there's a couple of different ways to think about that. One, I wouldn't say there is any concept of what's left. I think we -- to set the allowance on 12/31, we looked at the cars that we had on balance sheet on 12/31. And then we formed expectations about the cars that we're going to sell at a loss and at what level those cars we're going to sell at a loss, and then we recorded that allowance on that basis. I do think some of the things that benefit the inventory allowance is inventory size. I think shrinking inventory, getting inventory more in line with sales volume. Those are certainly beneficial from the standpoint of retail inventory allowance. As you sort of alluded to, a retail inventory allowance is something that's always in our results. We adjust our allowance every month, and retail inventory allowance is reflected in our results every quarter. It just happened to be particularly large on 12/31 in light of the dynamics that we saw in Q4 with much higher than normalized inventory size and also very elevated industry-wide retail depreciation rates. So, that's why it had an outsized effect on Q4. I think just to take that point home, I do think we've made really strong moves in normalizing our inventory size in Q4 and so far in Q1, our inventory size is much closer to a normal size relative to sales volumes than certainly it was in Q4. And we do think that over time, that will flow into positive tailwinds for retail GPU as we called out throughout our materials. Sure. Yes. So, we talked a little bit about that in the letter. The -- we do expect the SG&A reductions, the $100 million in aggregate in quarterly expense reductions that we're targeting over the next two quarters to come across the major line items. So in that, I would include payroll, I would include advertising, logistics and the other expense bucket. I do think there's -- we certainly see opportunities to reduce other SG&A expenses, including in categories that you may traditionally think of as fixed. I think we have numerous projects ongoing to just be more efficient in our corporate and technology expenses. I think there's many areas across that component of SG&A, where we're very focused on efficiency and do expect to gain savings from that component as part of our plan over the next two quarters. Sure. Yes, I can take that one. So just to set the stage a little bit, so the way we typically approach inventory mix is by evaluating what our customers are shopping for on the site and balancing that against what we're seeing in the market in terms of what customers or other suppliers are selling. And the combination of those two things dictate what mix of inventory we end up putting on the site. I would say we've talked a lot about inventory on this call. And certainly, our inventory has been too large relative to sales volume. We were working very ambitiously to correct that. In terms of mix, I wouldn't say there's any particular patterns to call out. I think the -- I think we'll continue to evaluate as we look forward from where we are here in Q1 and just be reading the demand signals, reading the supply signals and doing our best to balance the two of those. But right now, I don't think that points to any particular shift that's worth calling out at this time. I would suggest reading our shareholder letter. I think we talked a lot about some of the near-term drivers of profitability as well as a sort of broader way to think about our plan, and I think that will most likely be helpful for trying to shed some light on our near-term expectations."

And now with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thanks, Mike. And thanks, everyone for joining the call. The third quarter was a quarter of strong operational progress against the difficult industry and economic backdrop. We are on track with our goals from an expense and operational efficiency standpoint, but industry demand interest rate and depreciation headwinds are slowing our progress on overall profitability. We made gains here, but they were slower than we would have liked. And these headwinds are likely to persist over the near term making precise forecasting of that progress more difficult.  To organize these remarks, I plan to provide our thoughts on five important questions. One, what is driving our expense and operational gains? Two, what are the key headwinds we face? And how do changes those dynamics impact us? Three, how do we believe we are doing relative to the industry? Four, What does all this mean for the near term? And five, what does it all mean for the long term?  First, what is driving our expense and operational gains? In a letter we provide a number of data points, including that we reduce expenses by about $90 million in the quarter $360 million on an annualized basis, as well as many underlying operational metrics that are making those expense reductions possible. We're extremely proud of this progress, it is the result of an intense focus on efficiency throughout the company, in the way that we manage the business, the way that we organize and set our priorities and the way that we execute day to day. As we have faced the changes in the economy, our industry and in markets over the last several quarters, the people of Carvana have come together and are doing great work. We have a lot of work left to do, but we know it and we know how we're going to go about doing it.  Thanks to everyone inside the company for all the hard work you're putting in. We still have a long way to go. And there are probably additional unexpected difficulties between here and the end of all this. We've got to keep our heads down and keep marching.  Next, what are the key headwinds we face and how to change those dynamics impact us? There are three key headwinds that we are facing right now, industry level demand, interest rate increases and vehicle price depreciation. Let's take these one at a time.  First industry level demand. There are many data sources available to assess industry level demand, but regardless of the source demand is slow. Industry data sources estimate new sales down approximately 10% to 15%, year-over-year in the third quarter. And many of the forward-looking indicators that we use internally, including web searches and artist activity on carvanha.com indicate further slowing recently. Cars are an expensive discretionary often finance purchase that inflated much more than other goods in the economy over the last couple of years, and is clearly having an impact on people's purchasing decisions.  The good news is that historically used cars have been a relatively resilient category. And the depressed level of sales that we see today are similar to periods of fairly severe economic difficulty in the past, potentially suggesting that there's less medium term downsides and there may be further categories. This possibility is also supported by higher depreciation rates that should over time, make cars more affordable again, and afford interest rate curve it suggested the majority of the interest rate increases are behind us. Regardless, we're building our plans around assumptions that the next year is a difficult one in our industry and in the economy as a whole.  Next interest rate increases. Interest rates have risen rapidly with the two-year treasury a good benchmark for automotive loans rising 3.9% over the last year and 2.6% since 2019. In addition, credit spreads have risen about 1% in the last year. To put this in perspective for a customer utilizing financing the moves into your current yields plus credit spreads of last year are equivalent in their impacts the customer's monthly payment of about a $3,000 price increase. As a result, for customers using financing cars ended the quarter at their most unaffordable point ever, despite the fact that retail prices have dropped roughly 10% this year. As benchmark, interest rates risk spreads and market expectations for future credit performance evolve over time, we do expect those changes to impact our other GPU and sales volumes before the market fully adjusts, which is built into our expectation that other GPU will move down in the fourth quarter relative to the third.  Lastly, vehicle depreciation. Over the medium term we believe vehicle depreciation is good as it is necessary to bring cars back into line with other goods in terms of cost and affordability and therefore it's healthy for volume. In the near term, it is less clear. Two key dynamics that have a big impact on retail GPU is the average spread between acquisition prices and retail prices and the rate of daily depreciation. Historically on average, the wholesale retail spread roughly captures the depreciation dealers expect to see prior to selling a car which creates stability in industry retail margins, it can be seen over time. We've seen this in action recently as depreciation rates have increased over the last few quarters and in both quarters we saw acquisition spreads widen in a way that was approximately offsetting.  Looking forward, we expect this to continue to be the case on average, but we don't know exactly how it'll play out quarter to quarter. We have recently seen wholesale retail spreads widen further and have also seen daily depreciation rates move up meaningfully. Given these moves, our expectation for the fourth quarter is that retail GPU will decrease relative to the third quarter. Over time we expect us to normalize it, as it historically has. But the reason volatility is making it tougher call than it usually is.  Moving on to how do we believe we are doing relative to the industry? This is a much more difficult question to answer simply with our results than it normally is given the dynamics discussed above as well as the volume impacts of our focus on profitability. We discuss much of this in the shareholder letter in a way that we hope provide some clarity and understanding, but to summarize our beliefs, they are this. The realized sales volumes year-over-year, we are clearly taking market share relative to the industry. Quarter-over-quarter, we are most likely not taking realize sales market share relative to the industry as a whole, but it depends on which data sources we compare to. If we use our best understanding of the differential impacts to conversion for our customers versus the average customer and industry due to the choices we are making and setting interest rates, as well as the impacts driven by our focus on profitability, it is likely we're seeing somewhat meaningful gains and top funnel demand market share. We expect this to begin to show up and realize sales when the interest rate and general industry environment approaches more stability, and when we stop further decreasing conversion to our profitability initiatives.  Now heading to what does this mean in the near term. In the near term, our goal is clear to march toward profitability as quickly as we can regardless of industry level sales volumes. To achieve this, we plan to continue to rapidly reduce expenses to continue to put our focus on efficiency gains throughout every area of the company, and to continue to evaluate and test what levers we should pull to maximize the number of our more profitable sales and to minimize the number of less profitable sales.  Lastly, I want to hit the question of what does this mean for the long term? This is an easy question to skip in a difficult environment. But in the end is the most important question. Our belief is this, if we manage through the current environment as we intend to the long term will be even brighter. All the things that define our opportunity we started to Carvana and were three year ago when the environment felt very different are still true today. Nothing focuses us like difficulty in the last several quarters have undoubtedly been difficult. The next couple may be as well. Well it's never fun. While we're in the middle of difficult time. If we use the clarity and focus to provide will be better on the side of it. There's our intention to march continues, Mark.\nMark Jenkins : Thank you, Ernie. And thank you all for joining us today. We made significant progress in Q3 executing our plan of reducing SG&A expenses and progressing toward profitability. Despite significant volume headwinds driven by a variety of external and internal factors. In Q3, retail units sold totaled 102,570, a decrease of 8%. We gained market share versus the comparable period in 2021, despite the impact of high use vehicle prices, rising interest rates, and several initiatives focused on improving near term profitability.  Total revenue was $3.386 billion in Q3, a decrease of 3%. Total Revenue included $193 million from ADESA, which was included in our results for the full quarter and Q3. Total gross profit per unit was $3,500 in Q3, a decrease of $1,172 year-over-year and an increase of $132 sequentially. Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our more detailed commentary on sequential changes. Following the acquisition of ADESA, we are recording total GPU retail GPU and wholesale GPU, both including and excluding depreciation, and amortization expense or D&A and share based compensation expense associated with Ernie's 1 million unit milestone gift or gift SPC.  Historically, Carvana has reported GPU including D&A, while ADESA has reported gross profit excluding D&A. For the purpose of clarity, we're now providing both. Total gross profit per unit excluding D&A and gift SPC was 3,870 in Q3, an increase of $221 sequentially. Retail GPU was 1,131 in Q3, flat compared to 1131 in Q2. Retail GPU excluding D&A and gift SPC was 1,267 in Q3 compared to 1,276, in Q2. Sequential changes in retail GPU were primarily driven by higher spreads between retail prices and acquisition prices and lower retail cost of sales offset by higher retail depreciation rates in Q3 compared to Q2.  Wholesale GPU was $448 in Q3, compared to $383 in Q2, a sequential increase of $65. Wholesale GPU excluding D&A was 682 in Q3 Compared to 519 in Q2. Sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by consolidating a full quarter of ADESA in Q3.  Other GPU was 1921 in Q3, compared to 1854 in Q2. Sequential changes and other GPU were primarily driven by higher origination rates relative to benchmark interest rates, and improved securitization credit spreads relative to Q2, partially offset by lower ancillary product attachment rates.  Looking toward Q4, we expect to maintain flexibility to optimize our low nails channel mix as the quarter progresses. We made significant progress reducing SG&A expenses in Q3. Carvana only SG&A expense, excluding impacts from ADESA declined by $89 million compared to Q2. These SG&A expense reductions were broad based, including in payroll, advertising, logistics, and other SG&A expense. We expect to make continued progress on reducing SG&A expense in the coming quarters as we continue to execute our plan across all areas of the business.  Our progress in the quarter have led to an adjusted EBITDA improvement of $39 million in Q3 compared to Q2 despite lower retail units sold. Adjusted EBITDA margin was minus 5.9% in Q3, compared to minus 6.2% in Q2, and improvement of 0.3%. Adjusted EBITDA excludes impacts from Ernie's gifts of personal stock to Carvana employees, as well as other income and expense, which primarily includes changes in the fair value of securities, but it includes non-gift share based compensation. In May 2022, we outlined a stretch goal for Q4 2022 of $4,000 SG&A expense for retail units sold, excluding D&A SPC and ADESA expenses. This equated to a stretch goal of 4,350 to 4,450, including ADESA expenses. We are making strong progress reducing SG&A expenses on an absolute dollar basis. But due to the current volume environment, we do not expect to reach the stretch goal on a per unit basis in Q4.  Our goal is to manage the business to achieve greater than $4,000 total GPU and significant adjusted EBITDA profitability at current volume levels, while also building in flexibility to achieve profitability at higher or lower volume levels through our efficiency and cost savings initiatives.  On September 30, we had approximately $4.4 billion in total liquidity resources, including $2.3 billion in cash in revolving availability, and $2.1 billion in unpledged real estate and other assets, including approximately $1 billion of real estate acquired from ADESA. We also ended the quarter with approximately 1.2 million units of inspection and reconditioning center capacity at full utilization, giving us substantial infrastructure for future profitable growth. This strong liquidity position, our significant production capacity runway, and our clear and focused operating plan positions us well on our path to achieve our goal of driving positive cash flow and becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer.  Thank you for your attention. Will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nChris Bottiglieri : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess the first one is it appears that the broader used vehicle market may be facing incremental pressure in Q4 above and beyond we've seen in Q3. That seems to be the sense the habit that you're seeing as well in Q4. I guess my question is like what's changing right now? There's certain pockets the market and I'm talking Carvana specifically, we're pretty clear there. But what do you see in the market itself is the low income consumers dropping out is every customer segment behaving similarly? Like what are you seeing in the market environment itself in Q4, relative to Q3\nErnie Garcia: Sure, well I think there's certainly a lot of headwinds. I think, we've seen a tremendous amount of appreciation in car price over the last several years, we put a stat in the shareholder letter that, for a customer that is looking at car prices today and utilizing financing, their payment is up about 160% of what it would have been pre-pandemic. And I think recently, we've seen car prices depreciate to the tune of give or take 10% so far this year, but we've also seen interest rates shoot up very rapidly. And I think that that overall has harmed affordability.  I think, it's always hard to set out the rest of what's going on in the economy. But clearly, it feels like sentiment broadly is, is decreasing, there's a bunch of different statistics that we can look at around yield consumer confidence or consumer willingness to buy a car at any point in time. And I think that we tend to see some negative drift in those areas. I think we don't know exactly how that will unfold from here. I think we're trying to position the business in a way where we're well positioned to earn significant positive EBITDA. These volumes were lower volumes, we're going to keep marching on expenses as fast as we can. I do think that we see you at the top funnel, we see that we're still taking market share, and potentially at a pretty fast rate. And so I think that leads us hopeful for where, demand can ultimately go and where sales can ultimately go over time.  But I think the next six to 12 months are certainly more uncertain than they have been in recent periods where it was pretty reliable, that kind of car sales would come in flat quarter-over-quarter, we're just focused on our own market share gains. So I'm there's a lot of things happening, I think all the things you pointed to around demographic shifts, whether it's income or credit, whatever else, all those are active, and all those are moving the directions that you'd expect. But I don't know that there's anything particularly notable that wouldn't be expected that's occurring, just general softness, I think we do see that across the entire industry.\nChris Bottiglieri : Got it, okay. And then just given the uncertainty, can you talk about the financing outlook. Like if, if the world stays uncertain, seems like the ABS markets are like periodically open and periodically, that's like close, but just more expensive to get deals done. Like if you had to abandon the ABS markets for a couple of quarters? Do you'd have enough liquidity through ally or other partners lined up that you could actually, like, sell those receivables? Like, how should we think about that risk of being able to. You'd have still a very high level of receivables originating so maybe just talk about your confidence, again those receivables offloaded in this environment?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So yeah, what I would say is, I think the relationship with Ally remains extremely strong. We recently extended our floor plan line there for the next 18 months. I think that the way that our relationship works is we're regularly in contact with one another, we're making sure that we come up with a plan that works great for both of us. I think as we've discussed in the past, the way that we've always thought about balancing our channels is making sure that we have access to a very high quality channel like Ally, which in good times is probably a little bit more expensive for us. But it ensures that in tougher times where the ABS market can kind of go through difficult periods, that we've got a home for our loans.  And so I think we feel good about the way that we've positioned that over time, we feel great about the relationship we've got. We'll be renewing that deal as we head into next year, as we have over the last several years, I don't think we have any expectations for how that renewal go that are different than it's been in the past. We generally set that up in a way where the economics between us and Ally are set up to ensure that they have rates of return that are comparable to what they get elsewhere in the market. And our arrangement is set up in a way that is dynamic. So it's those adjustments have been happening in real time throughout this year as the markets been changing.  So I don't think we'd have any expectations for something particularly discreet. They've been a great partner for us in the past. And we've gone through periods where the ABS market was in a tough spot, including COVID. And we generally try to size our commitment between us in a way that that insulates us from that. So I think that's generally the plan there. And I think as I said, we feel good about it. It's a great relationship. They've been great to us, and hopefully they feel the same way about how we've been to them. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRajat Gupta : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Based on your fourth quarter unit and GPU guide, it looks like the fourth quarter cash burn, your excluding inventory is likely to be similar to the third quarter. And you might need to either draw on the revolver again or tap into the real estate. Should we expect you to start tapping into the real estate in the near term already? Or maybe you've already done it in the fourth quarter? And if yes, how should we think about the cap rates or if you offer the sale leaseback or maybe LTVs in case of a mortgage. And I have a follow up thanks. \nMark Jenkins : Sure, yeah. So, on Q4, already touched along, a lot of the key dynamics. We do expect volume to be lower sequentially relative to Q3. We also expect GPU to be lower sequentially relative to Q3 as well, due to some of the dynamics that Ernie discussed. At the same time, we also expect SG&A expenses to be down significantly, as well, as we continue to execute on all of our efficiency and cost savings initiatives. And so those are obviously offsetting, obviously offsetting factors. We also I would add, expect capital expenditures to continue to come down in Q4 relative to Q3.  So I think those are some of the dynamics on Q4, specifically. In terms of our real estate assets, obviously, we have a very large and attractive real estate portfolio. We just acquired a nationwide network of auction sites, from ADESA. And I think those are, large sites and very desirable markets, we think are really attractive pieces of real estate, that was a big motivation for us undertaking that acquisition. We've also been building some large IRCs in attractive markets around the country, as well. And so, I think we have a great real estate portfolio. In terms of, how we're thinking about financing that, yeah, do you think we have multiple options for the way we can finance that traditionally, in history, we've used sale leaseback transactions, I think we've executed about $500 million of those so far in our history as a company. But I think there can also be other forms of financing for large real estate portfolios. So I think that's something we're thinking about, I don't think the -- I don't think we're going to thoughtful about the timeline on executing any real estate transactions. But we do feel like we've got a really nice base of assets there.\nRajat Gupta : So you're not tapping to any right in front of you so far?\nMark Jenkins : I think we're going to be very thoughtful about, the best way and timing for financing those assets.\nRajat Gupta : Maybe the other follow up, you mentioned that you're looking to be profitable at 4,000 plus in GPU and current volume levels. That would imply somewhere close to $100 million plus, that needs to come out from your quarterly SG&A. Can you highlight maybe a few areas where there's still some low hanging fruit, or any initiatives that are already underway to get there? And lastly, any sense of timing when you do expect to get there? This might be independent, the macro, my guess? Thanks.\nMark Jenkins : Sure. So I mean, I would start by just pointing to the progress that we made last quarter, where we reduce expenses by about $9 million quarter-over-quarter, which is obviously a big number, and is a is a meaningful number relative to the step down to we look to make in the future. I think, undoubtedly, as you continue to march down expenses, it gets every incremental dollar gets a little harder than the last. But you're we're still at levels of expense that are much higher than we would like to be. And we're still in a place where there's obviously some low hanging fruit. I think, if we look at the gains that we made last quarter, it's probably most fair to massage out the impacts of the reduction in force that we had in May, which probably reduces that kind of $90 million in gains to something more like 70, but still a really meaningful number. And I think that was very broad base that came across the board.  And other payroll we reduce expenses by $20 million in advertising $14 million in logistics $14 million, which is 20% of logistics spend quarter-over-quarter, and then we made gains across the board everywhere else. And other we, we cut out $90 million of cost, which was 8% overall. And that was all powered by a lot of operational great gains across all of our operational groups. The logistics network had a bunch of meaningful improvements. Network utilization was up 8% quarter-over-quarter, we've seen average shipping miles per sale down 10% that continued to go down further, since the quarter ended. We've rolled out a new management structure at our logistics hubs only a small subset so far, but in those hubs, we're seeing an additional 10% of gains in kind of cost per mile. And we expect to roll that out across the country over the coming quarters.  So I think we're really excited about gains that we're making an idea we put a table in the letter that tries to break that down so you can kind of see where that's all coming from and it really is coming from across the business. And we expect gains from here to also come from across the business because there is still a lot of low hanging fruit.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nick Jones with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nNick Jones : Great, thanks for taking the questions. I guess you're taking a big step back and looking at next year, is it is it kind of for used car retail is it really just kind of seeing prices come down and affordability come down or will this be difficult if OEMs kind of put more cars into the ecosystem? I guess kind of how are you thinking about what kind of key indicators to you indicate things are kind of normalizing as we kind of get through 4Q and start looking into next year?\nErnie Garcia: I think that's probably a very complicated question. So I think all we can do is kind of reach back in history and try to give you some data points that we think might be relevant. I think the point that you've made about OEMs producing fewer cars over the last couple of years is correct and relevant. Although I will say that if we go back to the 2008-2009 recession, there were dramatically more cars pulled out of the ecosystem during that period. And if we look at used car sales over the next several years, they were pretty marginally impacted by that. I think debatably in the data, you can kind of see an echo of that decrease in OEM production, but it's not particularly pronounced. And I think the reduction in volume over the last couple of years, I said, has been a small fraction of the reduction volume over the couple of years surrounding that recession. I think cars also inflated dramatically relative to other goods in a dynamic that I think is pretty abnormal and unprecedented, at least in my knowledge set. Cars really moved up materially in cost. And the rest of kind of good in the economy for a long time were relatively stable. And now kind of cars are really coming down in cost at the same time that other goods in the economy are going up. And so I think debatably on kind of like a relative affordability, relative value basis, cars are potentially moving in a good direction. I think that may also be true just depending on what your view is of rates, but if we use the forward interest rate curve as an indication of where rates are going to go, there should be more of the increases behind us than there are in front of us. And for most customers who use financing to buy a car, that's obviously a meaningful input. I think if we look back to 2008 and 2009 as well, and we try to say, where did the used car market bottom, it did probably bottom, give or take, six months before the stock market bottomed and maybe a little longer than that before like the economy bottomed in some total. I think that did correspond at the time with roughly when the fed started cutting interest rates, which who knows when that happens in this cycle. But I think that's how that played out last cycle. And as I said, I think there's a lot of dynamics that are pretty different right now and pretty unprecedented. So I think without trying to look at everything like the glass is half full, I do think -- we want to make sure that we prepare for the worst, but I do think there's reasons to believe that there could be some good things that can happen in auto relative to other categories over the next 12 months. And I think those are driven by the fact that cars are extremely expensive. They're extremely sensitive to interest rates. And there's been a lot of movement in those areas recently, and it looks more likely that some of that movement will unwind in the future than not. So we pay attention every else will. I think we'll be setting up the business to be as flexible as it possibly can be. We'll be driving down expenses as quickly as possible. And like I said, planning for the worst and hoping for the best. But it's a hard 1 to call, I think, at this point.\nNick Jones : Got it. And maybe just 1 quick follow-up on GPU. How at risk is GPU from some of these factors like depreciation rates? I mean how much -- how should we think about that kind of into 4Q and into next year? Can that compress kind of quite a bit? Or do you feel comfortable that it's kind of range-bound and you can protect GPU to an extent?\nErnie Garcia: So let me start with the market factors, and then I'll kind of roll into the things that we're in control of. I think the first and simplest mental model for all this is that different players in the industry, whether we're talking about the finance industry or the automotive retail industry, are generally trying to kind of achieve a certain profit for the efforts that they're undertaking, right? And so I think, over time, there's obviously kind of ballast in the market that is trying to kind of find its normal range. I think that it is probably true that, that ballast is stronger in the forces that impact retail GPU than finance GPU. And that's because in our view at least, retailers have much more similar cost structures. They have much more similar profit goals. They don't have variation in input costs. They tend to not have huge cash cushions, which puts in this well where they need to kind of earn period to period. And I think that's why if you look over time, you see a lot of correlation between depreciation rates and wholesale retail spreads, and you see a lot of stability in retail margins across many retailers across many cycles. And so I think from a market force perspective, that has historically been a pretty stable number. And I think that would be our expectation going forward. But I also think that we're in a period where some of those moves are just happening very, very fast. And I think when they happen very fast, I think it leaves room for either kind of error relative to what we've seen in the past. And so I think we need to prepare for that. I think on the finance GPU side, I think there's room for those forces to be a little bit slower. Different finance companies have different underlying cost of funds and utilize different methods for passing on cost of fund increases to their customers. We've seen evidence for many finance companies out there that they've been passing on cost of funds more in line with fed funds than with two-year treasury, which is more of the benchmark that we use. I think to the extent that's true, once kind of treasury is correctly predicting what fed fund is going to do over the next two years, it should stabilize and then the fed funds rate would likely continue to go up and kind of that gap would collapse and that would probably be helpful for us, both in terms of finance GPU and in terms of retail sales volumes that are driven by the quality offers that we give to our financing customers. But I do think that just given that, that's a market that's dominated by fewer players with more variation input costs and who do have cash cushions who can absorb different strategies, I think there's more risk that, that could move around in more abnormal ways relative to history. But I think we're just going to have to watch that and see it play out. Now what's in our control? What's in our control is where we set price and where we set interest rates and where we set bids on cars that we're buying from customers. And I think that in all those areas, there's probably a little bit of room for us to be able to adjust to an environment where underlying costs, regardless of what one of those costs take, go up. If it's our -- the input cost of our cars or the cost of financing for our customers, I do think we have some natural offsets there where we likely have some room. And so as we said, kind of I think our number one goal is going to be really focused on expenses in this environment, really focused on being purposeful about driving more of our most profitable sales and fewer of our less profitable sales, pay very close attention to what's going on in the world around us as it's moving as dynamically as it has been, and then pull the levers that we've got control of to try to do the best we can to manage through it all. And I think that's the plan. And like I said, we'll be paying close attention from here. There's a lot of room for things to vary relative to the past over the next couple of quarters.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas : Hey, Ernie, does the business need more equity capital? And would your family consider giving up control if that was required to maintain the company as a going concern?\nErnie Garcia: So I think you'll -- as you see here, our goals are going to be on driving down expenses and trying to get positive EBITDA as quickly as we can. We've got a bunch of committed liquidity. We've got a bunch of real estate. And I think that we feel like that puts us in a good position to ride out this storm. And we're making great moves inside the company. So I think that we're extremely optimistic about riding all that out. And then I just think as it relates to hypotheticals, we'll stay away from those. We're just going to keep running our play and moving forward.\nAdam Jonas : All right, Ernie. Just as a follow-up. On CapEx, the $90 million in the quarter, backing out the first half, was that gap between the $50 million target? How much of that was ADESA? And you said you'd target a reduction, but I didn't know if you could identify a bit of a quantum from the -- into fourth quarter of how much that could be reduced. Appreciate it.\nMark Jenkins : Sure. We -- I think we initially laid out some CapEx targets by quarter in May. And I think our budget for Q43 was $100 million at the time, and I think we came just under that at $90 million. And our target at the time for Q44 was $50 million.\nOperator: Next question will come from John Colantuoni with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Colantuoni : Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. So just curious if you could lay out which areas of the industry, you saw the biggest deterioration relative to your expectations last quarter. And how much those areas of surprise impacted vehicle GPU and SG&A per unit? I guess what I'm asking is if you look back at those areas of surprise, -- can you help size how much progress you would have made on your operational goals absent the softening macro?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. I think when we laid out our operating plan in May, we talked about several goals that we laid out for the end of this year, and we kind of talked about how -- in order to hit those goals, we would expect to get a little bit of help from units. So we're clearly in a spot where units have moved in the wrong direction over the last quarter. And I think that, that's probably the area where there's been the biggest change relative to what our expectations would have been then. Now I think a lot has moved, right? We've seen interest rates move up materially and most customers use financing to buy a car. We've seen depreciation rates move up quite a bit. We've seen that probably slow down our progress on GPU as we focus on originating more profitable sales and fewer less profitable sales. I think the kind of line of which sales you want to originate moves up and down with GPU. And then you also have kind of just the broader headwinds in the industry. So I think those have been the adjustments that we've been making in real time as we've been adjusting to the changing world, just like everyone else. I think -- again, I think we got to be careful with hypotheticals, but I think to just try to provide something of a framework, I do think that in short periods of time and within reasonable range of units, today, expenses and units are moving somewhat independently, right? They're certainly not completely independent. They're obviously variable costs involved with selling a car. But when you're overbuilt, the underlying variable costs are obviously much, much lower. And so I think had units been higher, I think it could have made a material difference to where our results were on a per unit basis. But I think, like I said, all we can do is kind of keep doing the best job we can forecasting the world in front of us, recognize that it's probably better to miss conservative and to miss aggressive and then try to drive down expenses and make the best decisions we can, pulling the other levers as we manage through it. And so that's what we'll continue to do.\nJohn Colantuoni : Great. And I wanted to ask about your expectations for how used car prices coming down in the coming months impacts used cars demand. Do you see consumers waiting for used car prices to hit a floor before buying, picks up more materially? Or do you see there being more of a linear relationship between declining prices and rising demand? And at what point do we start to see that material uptick in used car velocity? Do prices need to reach pre-pandemic prices or 5% above pre-pandemic prices? I'm curious if you sort of thought about that at all. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. I think they're all good questions, and I think they're all hard to answer. What I would say is I think probably all those different forces are continuous forces. And then there's kind of the unknown of just what our consumer is going to be feeling as we head through the next six to 12 months, depending on everything else that's going on in the economy, I think that's pretty hard to call. I don't think that there's -- we don't believe that there's any kind of particular lines that prices have to drop below. We just think the kind of lower is better. And we think the consumer spent a lot over the last 18 months reading article after article about how expensive cars were. And that probably is not helpful in a way that's unbelievably difficult to measure. But we see pop out in some surveys of consumer perceptions of how good of a time it is to buy a car right now. So I think what we want, I think, is to root for the fundamentals, which is we want to root for interest rates to stabilize. We want to root for car prices to go down and get more affordable for our customers. We want to root for economic stability. And I think all of those things are helpful. And I think all of those are also under uncertainty, and so we wouldn't want to precisely call when those forces start to move in our direction.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham : Good afternoon. You're taking actions to improve GPU, but those actions are having or impact on unit sales even beyond market forces. And in the fourth quarter, you're anticipating volumes and GPU to be down sequentially. Do you take more drastic actions in one direction or the other here to improve on those metrics even as you consider the macro forces?\nErnie Garcia: I think we're going to try to miss aggressive is what I would say. And we've got the whole company pushing hard in this direction of managing expenses down. And I do think the progress that we've made is great. And I do -- once again, I want to point to the fact that I think there's a lot of people inside Carvana doing some of the best and fastest, most effective work they've ever done. I think as a company, we're getting more done now than we ever have. And I think that it's unfortunate is coming at the time we're facing so many headwinds and so it's a little bit harder to see the fruits of all that labor. But I think that there's a lot of great work being done. And I think that in the fullness of time, that will all kind of ultimately show up. But I think for now, it's more of the same. I just think we keep our heads down and keep fighting through that. And then when we get to the other side of this, really, which I would define in kind of two steps. I think one big move is just stability. Once rates stop going up, and we get to a spot where there is a little bit of stability in the economy, even if car sales stay at a depressed level and we're able to just kind of continue to grow our demand market share from there, I think that puts us in a really good spot. And then I think once you get to the extremely exciting place where the entire industry turns around, I think that's great because then I think we have double tailwinds there. We have kind of our own market share gains that we would expect to get that would be accentuated by increase in GPU, which make more sales more attractive for us to go attack. And then you'd also have the tailwinds of the industry itself.  But I think we're just kind of not planning for that for now. We're just trying to drive down expenses and we'll pay attention and make adjustments as we need to.\nSeth Basham : Just to follow up, considering you have capacity for 1.4 million units and you're on a run rate of $400,000 or less, and you have a lot of markets that are doing low volumes and aren't near IRCs, wouldn't it be prudent at this point in time to IRCs and pull out of some markets?\nErnie Garcia: So I think, as I said, I'm going to say one level probably more abstract than you wish here, but I think we're definitely going to be taking actions to try and drive down expenses as quickly as we feel like we responsibly can. And we have been, and you can see kind of the benefits there in our results. Again, we dropped expenses by $90 million last quarter, quarter-over-quarter. That's pretty fast. And that's due to a lot of choices we made across the company and a lot of great execution, and our goal is to continue doing that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel : Hi, good afternoon. So first question I have, we talked a lot about the degree to which you're working on the expense side of the business and then the challenges out there. So in the nearer term, as you're contingent with these demand headwinds, I know they're big in terms of both affordability and you're probably confidence, is there any other levers that Carvana could pull to try to offset that from the demand side or there are tools at your disposal that you would consider pulling?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Something we haven't talked about on this call is I do think the underlying demand picture looks better than the sales picture in our minds at least. I think if we -- one way to try to massage out kind of differential impacts of kind of interest rate policies between us and other players and to massage out some of the impacts of rising rates is to just look at the sales volume that we have for customers that use cash to buy cars from us. And so if we look at that, we grew by over 20% year-over-year in the quarter, which was over 30% faster than the rest of the company. So that's pretty meaningful gains there. I think we also have spoken a bit abstractly about many of these choices we're making to try to pursue more profitable sales and to forego less profitable sales across the company. That takes many, many different forms. But I think the easiest form to kind of understand there and for us to articulate is to just look at different regions in the country. So if we look at the middle of the country, which is where we have many more of our inspection centers and many more cars that are closer to our customers, we grew 4% quarter-over-quarter. If we look at the two coasts, we shrunk pretty meaningfully quarter-over-quarter. And so the middle of the country -- or excuse me, year-over-year. And so the middle of the country outgrew the coast by over 10% there as well. And there's many underlying actions that are causing kind of more of our sales to be concentrated in the middle of the country as we pursue more profitable sales. But even in the middle of the country, they're impacted by our choice to pursue more profitable sales and to forego less profitable sales. And so when you look at all that, you kind of can start to -- you got to be careful when you're layering multiple effects and compounding them, but you can see that when we look at cash customers, there's a lot of growth there. And when we look at the middle of the country where we're making less dramatic moves to cut out less profitable sales, there's growth there. And you start to layer that on top of each other, and you can see that there really is underlying demand growth. And so I think our view is if the industry can stabilize and if we can get to a spot where GPUs were -- they can kind of settle out and be a little more stable and a little more reliable as we get stability in interest rates, I think that gives us a chance to start to go express that underlying demand growth again. But for the time being, I think we have to prudently manage the business for profitability and cash flow, and we've faced a number of headwinds that have caused us to pull back. So I think the underlying demand, we believe, is still there like it was before, but I think the pretty dramatic change in sort of strategic direction from a heavy focus on growth to a heavy focus on cost certainly is imposing a cost on volumes that you're seeing in our results.\nBrian Nagel : Perfect. And just 1 follow-up, Ernie. So look, Carvana is unique, it's still primarily a virtual model. As you look at this -- the overall demand picture, what's happening in the sector from a demand -- do you think that Carvana and its still largely virtual model is incrementally hampered here versus maybe more traditional dealers or vice versa?\nErnie Garcia: I think undoubtedly, the swing in strategy from grow as fast as you can to get profitable as fast as you can is a big change. And I think that has many impacts across every part of the company. And I think that, that change in strategy, all else constant, has probably made our work a little bit harder than four different retailers out there that weren't pursuing as aggressive of a growth strategy, and we're kind of already in more of a profit mindset.  So I think that -- probably that has been the bigger driver of kind of differential pressure that we felt. Now that said, I think if you look at the direction of our results, whether it's expenses or EBITDA or whatever else, I think the direction is good. We decreased our EBITDA loss in the quarter. I think given the headwinds that are seen everywhere else, a lot of other retailers are probably seeing their results get worse in the quarter, right? So I think directionally, we're making some pretty good steps or taking some pretty good steps. But I think probably that change, all else constant, has been hard, and I think that we're making it, and I think the team is doing a great job. And I would associate that more with the change in strategy than I would with the model. I think the business model kind of is built and aimed at a certain volume, we believe has kind of lower variable costs and higher fixed costs in the traditional business. But even at this level of volume is positioned to earn a lot of EBITDA when you're in a place where you're kind of stable and you're not swinging from one strategy to another.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Pierce with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Pierce : Hey. Another end market question. I'm just kind of curious, we've been seeing wholesale prices come down pretty aggressively, but we're not seeing that at the retail level. So is it -- when this happens and when these spreads widen out, what do we need to see? Do you always need a clear existing inventory? Like are they not willing to do that because they don't want to take losses? Like I'm just trying to get a sense of when demand might actually come back and we need to see not just lower prices -- well, lower prices kind of what -- how would you think about demand coming back and when that could happen? Or what happens when these spreads widen out this much?\nErnie Garcia: Yeah, sure. I think -- I mean you largely described the dynamic that I think has been the average dynamic over time, which is, generally speaking, wholesale prices lead. And so whether it's up or down, they tend to lead. And it's because, for the most part, kind of a heavily simplified mental model is that dealers are not buying cars at wholesale and then they plan to make a certain amount of profit on that car, and they sell that car between 30 and 90 days later, and they're going to aim for kind of earning the profit that they're shooting for on that car in 30 to 90 days. And so when we saw prices appreciating over the last twp years, we saw the wholesale market leading up the retail market. And if you looked in real time, you saw the wholesale retail spread massively collapsed. But then that was offset in dealers profit margins by the appreciation that we've seen or equivalently by the lag time with which they would kind of change their pricing to the market. And then as it's gone down, we're seeing more of the same. And I think if you look over the last two years, there have been many, many changes of direction of depreciation. And every time there's been at least a directionally offsetting change in wholesale retail spreads. So I think that what we're seeing in the wholesale market is most likely to be used a preview of what we're going to see in the retail market over the next couple of months. That's at least been the way that it's historically played out, and that it's played out over the last couple of years.\nChristopher Pierce : So is it too simplistic to think that it would be better to push inventory and reset at these lower prices? I know that turns, et cetera, is 30 to 90 days like you spoke about. But it seems like instead of just waiting and waiting and having lower unit sales, I'm just kind of curious how dealers would think about those 2 situations. So hope to earn my standard GPU or just kind of move on from this aged inventory.\nErnie Garcia: So I think that, that framework is, I think, more of like a real-time earnings optimizing framework instead of like a total earnings over -- across time framework. And I think many dealers oftentimes think about optimizing kind of total cash. And if you were to take retail cars today and go and clear them in the wholesale market that is now leading the retail market down, you would take kind of pretty large losses that would be certain. You would be able to then replace that with lower cost inventory that you could put out on your lot and if your goal was to earn the same profit as before, then you probably could lower prices quickly and sell more cars, but you would just be kind of getting more earnings to offset your previous losses. And so I think usually, what most retailers out there do and what we do is we try to kind of optimize for what we think is the value across cars and customers across time. And it's usually pretty expensive to take cars out of retail and go sell them wholesale kind of regardless of what the market is. There can be occasions where that can make sense. But generally speaking, as long as there's anything near healthy demand in your retail channel, you're usually better off selling those cars through retail when you kind of calculate some of the impacts across time.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Naved Khan with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nVincent Sengelmann : Hey, guys This is Vincent for Naved. So regarding working capital, you've again lowered inventory closer to the $2 billion to $2.5 billion target range you mentioned previously. So just curious how much lower you expect that to go. And how is your progress in moving on a third-party conditioning impact to the?\nMark Jenkins : Sure. Yeah. So I think we took a nice step-down in inventory in Q3, second consecutive quarter of moving it down towards more normalized levels. We do expect inventory to decline again in Q4 to get sort of inside that range that we laid out previously. And so we do think that's -- that also makes sense in light of the current depreciation environment and in light of our goals of getting inventory to a more normalized level relative to retail unit sales. So yeah, we do expect to do that in Q4 and feel good about the path that we're on there.\nVincent Sengelmann : Okay. Great. And then can you provide any color on kind of your ability to reach the base year-end SG&A unit goal given a reduction in retail volumes?\nErnie Garcia: Do you mind restating the question? I'm not sure we followed. I apologize.\nVincent Sengelmann : Yeah. No worries. Just wondering if you can provide color on like your base year-end SG&A per unit goal given reduction in volumes, retail volumes.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Yeah. So you're referencing the stretch goal for Q4?\nVincent Sengelmann : Yeah.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Yeah. I think our goal is to continue to push down expenses as quickly as we possibly can. We try to give a framework for how quickly we think we can push those down. We were able to lower them kind of without accounting for the RIF. Last quarter, we were able to load them by about 12%. As we said, I think it obviously gets harder to lower expenses as your expense base drops, but we think there's still a lot of little hanging fruit and so we're going to try to continue to lower that. And then I think right now, inside of reasonable ranges, expenses and units are much more loosely tied together than they normally would be. And so I think those things are probably moving more independent normal, and we'll just be seeking to push down expenses as quickly as we possibly can to try to get to breakeven EBITDA and then ultimately the positive cash flow ASAP.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nat Schindler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nNat Schindler : Yes. Hi, guys. There's -- going back to an earlier comment about equity financing. Well, let's not talk about equity financing specifically and go over that again, but more how do you fix the debt financing that you have -- what are your options right now? Because even getting the positive cash flow, even getting to your long-term targets -- sorry, not positive EBITDA, even getting to your long-term EBITDA target, you would have to sell a whole lot of cars just to cover your current interest expense. What can you do to fix that debt load?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Let me start with this. I mean I think if we hit our long-term EBITDA targets even at today's units, we'd be in a great spot from a cash flow perspective. I think and would be able to comfortably cover our interest expense. So I think that I want to make sure that, that's at least clear. And I think that you look across time at other retailers that have been at similar scale to where we are today, who have been able to achieve sufficient kind of positive EBITDA to cover what our interest expense is today, so I think our goal is as stated, and I apologize for going through it over and over again, but I think in this environment, we've got to really focus on what's in our direct control.  And the thing that is most directly in our control is expenses. And so we're going to keep marching that down as quickly as we possibly can. And then we're going to pay a lot of attention to how we originate the most profitable sales that we can to try to accelerate our path to breakeven EBITDA and beyond. And so that's the plan right there. That's just what we're going to be working on.\nNat Schindler : So wait, even at 400,000 annual units, or, let's say, 100,000 in a quarter where you are right now, you had $150 million in interest income. At 13.5% EBITDA, you wouldn't cover that.\nErnie Garcia: I think you just make sure you're multiplying by the kind of retail price, and I think you'll probably get there.\nNat Schindler : Okay. You'll barely get there. Yes. Sorry. But---\nErnie Garcia: Yeah, I think we'd get there with a little bit of cushion. But yes, but either way.\nNat Schindler : Okay. So is there anything that you have on the near term on the horizon that you can think of to do to finance that debt any other way, though, other than just driving that EBITDA?\nErnie Garcia: I think -- as we stated earlier, I think the number one input to all this is expenses that drives into EBITDA. From there, we've got, to kind of use round numbers, about $4 billion of kind of total access to liquidity. Approximately half of that is immediately available. The other half is broken down to be about $1 billion of ADESA real estate and about $1 billion of other real estate. Between all that, that gives us a lot of access to liquidity. And so I think that's primarily how we're thinking about it at the moment, and we'll continue to march forward with our plan.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Michael Montani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nMichael Montani : Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask, first off, if I could. You had mentioned trying to pull back in certain markets to emphasize more profitable sales. But I also wanted to ask about some of the initiatives that you all have going on. I'm thinking of, for example, third-party listings. I had seen that you may be pulling back or pausing on that. So I just wanted to understand where that sits, the Hertz partnership. And then I had a separate follow-up.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So what I would say is I think when we think about -- I'm going to ask this generally and maybe not precisely related to some of the things that you brought for your question, but hopefully, it's useful. When we think about trying to aim for more profitable sales, what does that mean? There's certainly variability in the kind of gross profit associated with different types of sales. Obviously, sales where customers finance with us are more profitable than those where they don't. And those where they choose to buy a warranty are more profitable than those where they don't. And then I think there's a number of other dynamics kind of across car type, et cetera. There's also kind of variation in the underlying costs of completing a sale. If it's a car that's nearby to an inspection center, it can be much, much lower. If it's a car that's maybe further away but where we're charging a shipping fee, it can be higher, but it can be offset by the benefit of that shipping fee. And so I think there can be variation in underlying cost of sales. And then there can also be a variation in the cost to acquire different types of sales, whether it's sales different types of customers or different types of cars. That can vary in some of those different channels can also attract customers with kind of variable levels of either gross profit or expected expense. And so I think across all those different areas, we're trying to just be very thoughtful right now and make sure that we're pulling levers that we think will drive the most profitable sales and drive the fewest less profitable sales. And I think that, that's taking many different forms. And then you brought up Hertz. I would say that partnership continues to go very well. We're putting even more focus and attention on that right now as we think it's a big opportunity and there's alignment between two groups. We're excited about the results there for sure. I think that it's led to some other opportunities between us, especially as we've added ADESA to kind of -- to augment the overall capabilities that we have. So I think that continues to go really well.  And I think you said you had a follow-up.\nMichael Montani : Yeah. Thanks. So the follow-up is just around CapEx. And I think in May, you all had outlined some different scenarios and what you felt was baseline kind of CapEx spend. But just wondering, volumes remain kind of challenged in terms of where we're at right now. Do you have further flexibility there? Can you just give us some sensitivity on kind of the CapEx outlay pace?\nMark Jenkins : Sure. Yeah. And everything I'm about to say is also in the shareholder letter for future reference. But in May, we laid out a 2023 full year CapEx budget in the range of $100 million to $200 million, depending on the amount of elective capital expenditures we decide to undertake. I think from where we sit today, we expect to be in the lower half of that range.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nErnie Garcia: All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call. And to everyone inside Carvana, thank you guys again for all the work that you're putting in. I do think that we are getting more done than we ever have. I know it's against a tough backdrop. I think -- you've heard it over and over again, but I hope we're all prepared for the environment to continue to be tough. And I think we still have a lot of work left to do, but I do think we're all doing a great job, and we could not thank you guys more for it. So thanks for everything you guys do. And thanks again to everyone on the call. We'll talk to you soon.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. And thanks, everyone for joining the call. The third quarter was a quarter of strong operational progress against the difficult industry and economic backdrop. We are on track with our goals from an expense and operational efficiency standpoint, but industry demand interest rate and depreciation headwinds are slowing our progress on overall profitability. We made gains here, but they were slower than we would have liked. And these headwinds are likely to persist over the near term making precise forecasting of that progress more difficult.  To organize these remarks, I plan to provide our thoughts on five important questions. One, what is driving our expense and operational gains? Two, what are the key headwinds we face? And how do changes those dynamics impact us? Three, how do we believe we are doing relative to the industry? Four, What does all this mean for the near term? And five, what does it all mean for the long term?  First, what is driving our expense and operational gains? In a letter we provide a number of data points, including that we reduce expenses by about $90 million in the quarter $360 million on an annualized basis, as well as many underlying operational metrics that are making those expense reductions possible. We're extremely proud of this progress, it is the result of an intense focus on efficiency throughout the company, in the way that we manage the business, the way that we organize and set our priorities and the way that we execute day to day. As we have faced the changes in the economy, our industry and in markets over the last several quarters, the people of Carvana have come together and are doing great work. We have a lot of work left to do, but we know it and we know how we're going to go about doing it.  Thanks to everyone inside the company for all the hard work you're putting in. We still have a long way to go. And there are probably additional unexpected difficulties between here and the end of all this. We've got to keep our heads down and keep marching.  Next, what are the key headwinds we face and how to change those dynamics impact us? There are three key headwinds that we are facing right now, industry level demand, interest rate increases and vehicle price depreciation. Let's take these one at a time.  First industry level demand. There are many data sources available to assess industry level demand, but regardless of the source demand is slow. Industry data sources estimate new sales down approximately 10% to 15%, year-over-year in the third quarter. And many of the forward-looking indicators that we use internally, including web searches and artist activity on carvanha.com indicate further slowing recently. Cars are an expensive discretionary often finance purchase that inflated much more than other goods in the economy over the last couple of years, and is clearly having an impact on people's purchasing decisions.  The good news is that historically used cars have been a relatively resilient category. And the depressed level of sales that we see today are similar to periods of fairly severe economic difficulty in the past, potentially suggesting that there's less medium term downsides and there may be further categories. This possibility is also supported by higher depreciation rates that should over time, make cars more affordable again, and afford interest rate curve it suggested the majority of the interest rate increases are behind us. Regardless, we're building our plans around assumptions that the next year is a difficult one in our industry and in the economy as a whole.  Next interest rate increases. Interest rates have risen rapidly with the two-year treasury a good benchmark for automotive loans rising 3.9% over the last year and 2.6% since 2019. In addition, credit spreads have risen about 1% in the last year. To put this in perspective for a customer utilizing financing the moves into your current yields plus credit spreads of last year are equivalent in their impacts the customer's monthly payment of about a $3,000 price increase. As a result, for customers using financing cars ended the quarter at their most unaffordable point ever, despite the fact that retail prices have dropped roughly 10% this year. As benchmark, interest rates risk spreads and market expectations for future credit performance evolve over time, we do expect those changes to impact our other GPU and sales volumes before the market fully adjusts, which is built into our expectation that other GPU will move down in the fourth quarter relative to the third.  Lastly, vehicle depreciation. Over the medium term we believe vehicle depreciation is good as it is necessary to bring cars back into line with other goods in terms of cost and affordability and therefore it's healthy for volume. In the near term, it is less clear. Two key dynamics that have a big impact on retail GPU is the average spread between acquisition prices and retail prices and the rate of daily depreciation. Historically on average, the wholesale retail spread roughly captures the depreciation dealers expect to see prior to selling a car which creates stability in industry retail margins, it can be seen over time. We've seen this in action recently as depreciation rates have increased over the last few quarters and in both quarters we saw acquisition spreads widen in a way that was approximately offsetting.  Looking forward, we expect this to continue to be the case on average, but we don't know exactly how it'll play out quarter to quarter. We have recently seen wholesale retail spreads widen further and have also seen daily depreciation rates move up meaningfully. Given these moves, our expectation for the fourth quarter is that retail GPU will decrease relative to the third quarter. Over time we expect us to normalize it, as it historically has. But the reason volatility is making it tougher call than it usually is.  Moving on to how do we believe we are doing relative to the industry? This is a much more difficult question to answer simply with our results than it normally is given the dynamics discussed above as well as the volume impacts of our focus on profitability. We discuss much of this in the shareholder letter in a way that we hope provide some clarity and understanding, but to summarize our beliefs, they are this. The realized sales volumes year-over-year, we are clearly taking market share relative to the industry. Quarter-over-quarter, we are most likely not taking realize sales market share relative to the industry as a whole, but it depends on which data sources we compare to. If we use our best understanding of the differential impacts to conversion for our customers versus the average customer and industry due to the choices we are making and setting interest rates, as well as the impacts driven by our focus on profitability, it is likely we're seeing somewhat meaningful gains and top funnel demand market share. We expect this to begin to show up and realize sales when the interest rate and general industry environment approaches more stability, and when we stop further decreasing conversion to our profitability initiatives.  Now heading to what does this mean in the near term. In the near term, our goal is clear to march toward profitability as quickly as we can regardless of industry level sales volumes. To achieve this, we plan to continue to rapidly reduce expenses to continue to put our focus on efficiency gains throughout every area of the company, and to continue to evaluate and test what levers we should pull to maximize the number of our more profitable sales and to minimize the number of less profitable sales.  Lastly, I want to hit the question of what does this mean for the long term? This is an easy question to skip in a difficult environment. But in the end is the most important question. Our belief is this, if we manage through the current environment as we intend to the long term will be even brighter. All the things that define our opportunity we started to Carvana and were three year ago when the environment felt very different are still true today. Nothing focuses us like difficulty in the last several quarters have undoubtedly been difficult. The next couple may be as well. Well it's never fun. While we're in the middle of difficult time. If we use the clarity and focus to provide will be better on the side of it. There's our intention to march continues, Mark. Sure, well I think there's certainly a lot of headwinds. I think, we've seen a tremendous amount of appreciation in car price over the last several years, we put a stat in the shareholder letter that, for a customer that is looking at car prices today and utilizing financing, their payment is up about 160% of what it would have been pre-pandemic. And I think recently, we've seen car prices depreciate to the tune of give or take 10% so far this year, but we've also seen interest rates shoot up very rapidly. And I think that that overall has harmed affordability.  I think, it's always hard to set out the rest of what's going on in the economy. But clearly, it feels like sentiment broadly is, is decreasing, there's a bunch of different statistics that we can look at around yield consumer confidence or consumer willingness to buy a car at any point in time. And I think that we tend to see some negative drift in those areas. I think we don't know exactly how that will unfold from here. I think we're trying to position the business in a way where we're well positioned to earn significant positive EBITDA. These volumes were lower volumes, we're going to keep marching on expenses as fast as we can. I do think that we see you at the top funnel, we see that we're still taking market share, and potentially at a pretty fast rate. And so I think that leads us hopeful for where, demand can ultimately go and where sales can ultimately go over time.  But I think the next six to 12 months are certainly more uncertain than they have been in recent periods where it was pretty reliable, that kind of car sales would come in flat quarter-over-quarter, we're just focused on our own market share gains. So I'm there's a lot of things happening, I think all the things you pointed to around demographic shifts, whether it's income or credit, whatever else, all those are active, and all those are moving the directions that you'd expect. But I don't know that there's anything particularly notable that wouldn't be expected that's occurring, just general softness, I think we do see that across the entire industry. Sure. So yeah, what I would say is, I think the relationship with Ally remains extremely strong. We recently extended our floor plan line there for the next 18 months. I think that the way that our relationship works is we're regularly in contact with one another, we're making sure that we come up with a plan that works great for both of us. I think as we've discussed in the past, the way that we've always thought about balancing our channels is making sure that we have access to a very high quality channel like Ally, which in good times is probably a little bit more expensive for us. But it ensures that in tougher times where the ABS market can kind of go through difficult periods, that we've got a home for our loans.  And so I think we feel good about the way that we've positioned that over time, we feel great about the relationship we've got. We'll be renewing that deal as we head into next year, as we have over the last several years, I don't think we have any expectations for how that renewal go that are different than it's been in the past. We generally set that up in a way where the economics between us and Ally are set up to ensure that they have rates of return that are comparable to what they get elsewhere in the market. And our arrangement is set up in a way that is dynamic. So it's those adjustments have been happening in real time throughout this year as the markets been changing.  So I don't think we'd have any expectations for something particularly discreet. They've been a great partner for us in the past. And we've gone through periods where the ABS market was in a tough spot, including COVID. And we generally try to size our commitment between us in a way that that insulates us from that. So I think that's generally the plan there. And I think as I said, we feel good about it. It's a great relationship. They've been great to us, and hopefully they feel the same way about how we've been to them. I think that's probably a very complicated question. So I think all we can do is kind of reach back in history and try to give you some data points that we think might be relevant. I think the point that you've made about OEMs producing fewer cars over the last couple of years is correct and relevant. Although I will say that if we go back to the 2008-2009 recession, there were dramatically more cars pulled out of the ecosystem during that period. And if we look at used car sales over the next several years, they were pretty marginally impacted by that. I think debatably in the data, you can kind of see an echo of that decrease in OEM production, but it's not particularly pronounced. And I think the reduction in volume over the last couple of years, I said, has been a small fraction of the reduction volume over the couple of years surrounding that recession. I think cars also inflated dramatically relative to other goods in a dynamic that I think is pretty abnormal and unprecedented, at least in my knowledge set. Cars really moved up materially in cost. And the rest of kind of good in the economy for a long time were relatively stable. And now kind of cars are really coming down in cost at the same time that other goods in the economy are going up. And so I think debatably on kind of like a relative affordability, relative value basis, cars are potentially moving in a good direction. I think that may also be true just depending on what your view is of rates, but if we use the forward interest rate curve as an indication of where rates are going to go, there should be more of the increases behind us than there are in front of us. And for most customers who use financing to buy a car, that's obviously a meaningful input. I think if we look back to 2008 and 2009 as well, and we try to say, where did the used car market bottom, it did probably bottom, give or take, six months before the stock market bottomed and maybe a little longer than that before like the economy bottomed in some total. I think that did correspond at the time with roughly when the fed started cutting interest rates, which who knows when that happens in this cycle. But I think that's how that played out last cycle. And as I said, I think there's a lot of dynamics that are pretty different right now and pretty unprecedented. So I think without trying to look at everything like the glass is half full, I do think -- we want to make sure that we prepare for the worst, but I do think there's reasons to believe that there could be some good things that can happen in auto relative to other categories over the next 12 months. And I think those are driven by the fact that cars are extremely expensive. They're extremely sensitive to interest rates. And there's been a lot of movement in those areas recently, and it looks more likely that some of that movement will unwind in the future than not. So we pay attention every else will. I think we'll be setting up the business to be as flexible as it possibly can be. We'll be driving down expenses as quickly as possible. And like I said, planning for the worst and hoping for the best. But it's a hard 1 to call, I think, at this point. So let me start with the market factors, and then I'll kind of roll into the things that we're in control of. I think the first and simplest mental model for all this is that different players in the industry, whether we're talking about the finance industry or the automotive retail industry, are generally trying to kind of achieve a certain profit for the efforts that they're undertaking, right? And so I think, over time, there's obviously kind of ballast in the market that is trying to kind of find its normal range. I think that it is probably true that, that ballast is stronger in the forces that impact retail GPU than finance GPU. And that's because in our view at least, retailers have much more similar cost structures. They have much more similar profit goals. They don't have variation in input costs. They tend to not have huge cash cushions, which puts in this well where they need to kind of earn period to period. And I think that's why if you look over time, you see a lot of correlation between depreciation rates and wholesale retail spreads, and you see a lot of stability in retail margins across many retailers across many cycles. And so I think from a market force perspective, that has historically been a pretty stable number. And I think that would be our expectation going forward. But I also think that we're in a period where some of those moves are just happening very, very fast. And I think when they happen very fast, I think it leaves room for either kind of error relative to what we've seen in the past. And so I think we need to prepare for that. I think on the finance GPU side, I think there's room for those forces to be a little bit slower. Different finance companies have different underlying cost of funds and utilize different methods for passing on cost of fund increases to their customers. We've seen evidence for many finance companies out there that they've been passing on cost of funds more in line with fed funds than with two-year treasury, which is more of the benchmark that we use. I think to the extent that's true, once kind of treasury is correctly predicting what fed fund is going to do over the next two years, it should stabilize and then the fed funds rate would likely continue to go up and kind of that gap would collapse and that would probably be helpful for us, both in terms of finance GPU and in terms of retail sales volumes that are driven by the quality offers that we give to our financing customers. But I do think that just given that, that's a market that's dominated by fewer players with more variation input costs and who do have cash cushions who can absorb different strategies, I think there's more risk that, that could move around in more abnormal ways relative to history. But I think we're just going to have to watch that and see it play out. Now what's in our control? What's in our control is where we set price and where we set interest rates and where we set bids on cars that we're buying from customers. And I think that in all those areas, there's probably a little bit of room for us to be able to adjust to an environment where underlying costs, regardless of what one of those costs take, go up. If it's our -- the input cost of our cars or the cost of financing for our customers, I do think we have some natural offsets there where we likely have some room. And so as we said, kind of I think our number one goal is going to be really focused on expenses in this environment, really focused on being purposeful about driving more of our most profitable sales and fewer of our less profitable sales, pay very close attention to what's going on in the world around us as it's moving as dynamically as it has been, and then pull the levers that we've got control of to try to do the best we can to manage through it all. And I think that's the plan. And like I said, we'll be paying close attention from here. There's a lot of room for things to vary relative to the past over the next couple of quarters. So I think you'll -- as you see here, our goals are going to be on driving down expenses and trying to get positive EBITDA as quickly as we can. We've got a bunch of committed liquidity. We've got a bunch of real estate. And I think that we feel like that puts us in a good position to ride out this storm. And we're making great moves inside the company. So I think that we're extremely optimistic about riding all that out. And then I just think as it relates to hypotheticals, we'll stay away from those. We're just going to keep running our play and moving forward. Sure. I think when we laid out our operating plan in May, we talked about several goals that we laid out for the end of this year, and we kind of talked about how -- in order to hit those goals, we would expect to get a little bit of help from units. So we're clearly in a spot where units have moved in the wrong direction over the last quarter. And I think that, that's probably the area where there's been the biggest change relative to what our expectations would have been then. Now I think a lot has moved, right? We've seen interest rates move up materially and most customers use financing to buy a car. We've seen depreciation rates move up quite a bit. We've seen that probably slow down our progress on GPU as we focus on originating more profitable sales and fewer less profitable sales. I think the kind of line of which sales you want to originate moves up and down with GPU. And then you also have kind of just the broader headwinds in the industry. So I think those have been the adjustments that we've been making in real time as we've been adjusting to the changing world, just like everyone else. I think -- again, I think we got to be careful with hypotheticals, but I think to just try to provide something of a framework, I do think that in short periods of time and within reasonable range of units, today, expenses and units are moving somewhat independently, right? They're certainly not completely independent. They're obviously variable costs involved with selling a car. But when you're overbuilt, the underlying variable costs are obviously much, much lower. And so I think had units been higher, I think it could have made a material difference to where our results were on a per unit basis. But I think, like I said, all we can do is kind of keep doing the best job we can forecasting the world in front of us, recognize that it's probably better to miss conservative and to miss aggressive and then try to drive down expenses and make the best decisions we can, pulling the other levers as we manage through it. And so that's what we'll continue to do. Sure. I think they're all good questions, and I think they're all hard to answer. What I would say is I think probably all those different forces are continuous forces. And then there's kind of the unknown of just what our consumer is going to be feeling as we head through the next six to 12 months, depending on everything else that's going on in the economy, I think that's pretty hard to call. I don't think that there's -- we don't believe that there's any kind of particular lines that prices have to drop below. We just think the kind of lower is better. And we think the consumer spent a lot over the last 18 months reading article after article about how expensive cars were. And that probably is not helpful in a way that's unbelievably difficult to measure. But we see pop out in some surveys of consumer perceptions of how good of a time it is to buy a car right now. So I think what we want, I think, is to root for the fundamentals, which is we want to root for interest rates to stabilize. We want to root for car prices to go down and get more affordable for our customers. We want to root for economic stability. And I think all of those things are helpful. And I think all of those are also under uncertainty, and so we wouldn't want to precisely call when those forces start to move in our direction. I think we're going to try to miss aggressive is what I would say. And we've got the whole company pushing hard in this direction of managing expenses down. And I do think the progress that we've made is great. And I do -- once again, I want to point to the fact that I think there's a lot of people inside Carvana doing some of the best and fastest, most effective work they've ever done. I think as a company, we're getting more done now than we ever have. And I think that it's unfortunate is coming at the time we're facing so many headwinds and so it's a little bit harder to see the fruits of all that labor. But I think that there's a lot of great work being done. And I think that in the fullness of time, that will all kind of ultimately show up. But I think for now, it's more of the same. I just think we keep our heads down and keep fighting through that. And then when we get to the other side of this, really, which I would define in kind of two steps. I think one big move is just stability. Once rates stop going up, and we get to a spot where there is a little bit of stability in the economy, even if car sales stay at a depressed level and we're able to just kind of continue to grow our demand market share from there, I think that puts us in a really good spot. And then I think once you get to the extremely exciting place where the entire industry turns around, I think that's great because then I think we have double tailwinds there. We have kind of our own market share gains that we would expect to get that would be accentuated by increase in GPU, which make more sales more attractive for us to go attack. And then you'd also have the tailwinds of the industry itself.  But I think we're just kind of not planning for that for now. We're just trying to drive down expenses and we'll pay attention and make adjustments as we need to. So I think, as I said, I'm going to say one level probably more abstract than you wish here, but I think we're definitely going to be taking actions to try and drive down expenses as quickly as we feel like we responsibly can. And we have been, and you can see kind of the benefits there in our results. Again, we dropped expenses by $90 million last quarter, quarter-over-quarter. That's pretty fast. And that's due to a lot of choices we made across the company and a lot of great execution, and our goal is to continue doing that. Sure. Something we haven't talked about on this call is I do think the underlying demand picture looks better than the sales picture in our minds at least. I think if we -- one way to try to massage out kind of differential impacts of kind of interest rate policies between us and other players and to massage out some of the impacts of rising rates is to just look at the sales volume that we have for customers that use cash to buy cars from us. And so if we look at that, we grew by over 20% year-over-year in the quarter, which was over 30% faster than the rest of the company. So that's pretty meaningful gains there. I think we also have spoken a bit abstractly about many of these choices we're making to try to pursue more profitable sales and to forego less profitable sales across the company. That takes many, many different forms. But I think the easiest form to kind of understand there and for us to articulate is to just look at different regions in the country. So if we look at the middle of the country, which is where we have many more of our inspection centers and many more cars that are closer to our customers, we grew 4% quarter-over-quarter. If we look at the two coasts, we shrunk pretty meaningfully quarter-over-quarter. And so the middle of the country -- or excuse me, year-over-year. And so the middle of the country outgrew the coast by over 10% there as well. And there's many underlying actions that are causing kind of more of our sales to be concentrated in the middle of the country as we pursue more profitable sales. But even in the middle of the country, they're impacted by our choice to pursue more profitable sales and to forego less profitable sales. And so when you look at all that, you kind of can start to -- you got to be careful when you're layering multiple effects and compounding them, but you can see that when we look at cash customers, there's a lot of growth there. And when we look at the middle of the country where we're making less dramatic moves to cut out less profitable sales, there's growth there. And you start to layer that on top of each other, and you can see that there really is underlying demand growth. And so I think our view is if the industry can stabilize and if we can get to a spot where GPUs were -- they can kind of settle out and be a little more stable and a little more reliable as we get stability in interest rates, I think that gives us a chance to start to go express that underlying demand growth again. But for the time being, I think we have to prudently manage the business for profitability and cash flow, and we've faced a number of headwinds that have caused us to pull back. So I think the underlying demand, we believe, is still there like it was before, but I think the pretty dramatic change in sort of strategic direction from a heavy focus on growth to a heavy focus on cost certainly is imposing a cost on volumes that you're seeing in our results. I think undoubtedly, the swing in strategy from grow as fast as you can to get profitable as fast as you can is a big change. And I think that has many impacts across every part of the company. And I think that, that change in strategy, all else constant, has probably made our work a little bit harder than four different retailers out there that weren't pursuing as aggressive of a growth strategy, and we're kind of already in more of a profit mindset.  So I think that -- probably that has been the bigger driver of kind of differential pressure that we felt. Now that said, I think if you look at the direction of our results, whether it's expenses or EBITDA or whatever else, I think the direction is good. We decreased our EBITDA loss in the quarter. I think given the headwinds that are seen everywhere else, a lot of other retailers are probably seeing their results get worse in the quarter, right? So I think directionally, we're making some pretty good steps or taking some pretty good steps. But I think probably that change, all else constant, has been hard, and I think that we're making it, and I think the team is doing a great job. And I would associate that more with the change in strategy than I would with the model. I think the business model kind of is built and aimed at a certain volume, we believe has kind of lower variable costs and higher fixed costs in the traditional business. But even at this level of volume is positioned to earn a lot of EBITDA when you're in a place where you're kind of stable and you're not swinging from one strategy to another. Yeah, sure. I think -- I mean you largely described the dynamic that I think has been the average dynamic over time, which is, generally speaking, wholesale prices lead. And so whether it's up or down, they tend to lead. And it's because, for the most part, kind of a heavily simplified mental model is that dealers are not buying cars at wholesale and then they plan to make a certain amount of profit on that car, and they sell that car between 30 and 90 days later, and they're going to aim for kind of earning the profit that they're shooting for on that car in 30 to 90 days. And so when we saw prices appreciating over the last twp years, we saw the wholesale market leading up the retail market. And if you looked in real time, you saw the wholesale retail spread massively collapsed. But then that was offset in dealers profit margins by the appreciation that we've seen or equivalently by the lag time with which they would kind of change their pricing to the market. And then as it's gone down, we're seeing more of the same. And I think if you look over the last two years, there have been many, many changes of direction of depreciation. And every time there's been at least a directionally offsetting change in wholesale retail spreads. So I think that what we're seeing in the wholesale market is most likely to be used a preview of what we're going to see in the retail market over the next couple of months. That's at least been the way that it's historically played out, and that it's played out over the last couple of years. So I think that, that framework is, I think, more of like a real-time earnings optimizing framework instead of like a total earnings over -- across time framework. And I think many dealers oftentimes think about optimizing kind of total cash. And if you were to take retail cars today and go and clear them in the wholesale market that is now leading the retail market down, you would take kind of pretty large losses that would be certain. You would be able to then replace that with lower cost inventory that you could put out on your lot and if your goal was to earn the same profit as before, then you probably could lower prices quickly and sell more cars, but you would just be kind of getting more earnings to offset your previous losses. And so I think usually, what most retailers out there do and what we do is we try to kind of optimize for what we think is the value across cars and customers across time. And it's usually pretty expensive to take cars out of retail and go sell them wholesale kind of regardless of what the market is. There can be occasions where that can make sense. But generally speaking, as long as there's anything near healthy demand in your retail channel, you're usually better off selling those cars through retail when you kind of calculate some of the impacts across time. Do you mind restating the question? I'm not sure we followed. I apologize. Sure. Yeah. So you're referencing the stretch goal for Q4? Sure. Yeah. I think our goal is to continue to push down expenses as quickly as we possibly can. We try to give a framework for how quickly we think we can push those down. We were able to lower them kind of without accounting for the RIF. Last quarter, we were able to load them by about 12%. As we said, I think it obviously gets harder to lower expenses as your expense base drops, but we think there's still a lot of little hanging fruit and so we're going to try to continue to lower that. And then I think right now, inside of reasonable ranges, expenses and units are much more loosely tied together than they normally would be. And so I think those things are probably moving more independent normal, and we'll just be seeking to push down expenses as quickly as we possibly can to try to get to breakeven EBITDA and then ultimately the positive cash flow ASAP. Sure. Let me start with this. I mean I think if we hit our long-term EBITDA targets even at today's units, we'd be in a great spot from a cash flow perspective. I think and would be able to comfortably cover our interest expense. So I think that I want to make sure that, that's at least clear. And I think that you look across time at other retailers that have been at similar scale to where we are today, who have been able to achieve sufficient kind of positive EBITDA to cover what our interest expense is today, so I think our goal is as stated, and I apologize for going through it over and over again, but I think in this environment, we've got to really focus on what's in our direct control.  And the thing that is most directly in our control is expenses. And so we're going to keep marching that down as quickly as we possibly can. And then we're going to pay a lot of attention to how we originate the most profitable sales that we can to try to accelerate our path to breakeven EBITDA and beyond. And so that's the plan right there. That's just what we're going to be working on. I think you just make sure you're multiplying by the kind of retail price, and I think you'll probably get there. Yeah, I think we'd get there with a little bit of cushion. But yes, but either way. I think -- as we stated earlier, I think the number one input to all this is expenses that drives into EBITDA. From there, we've got, to kind of use round numbers, about $4 billion of kind of total access to liquidity. Approximately half of that is immediately available. The other half is broken down to be about $1 billion of ADESA real estate and about $1 billion of other real estate. Between all that, that gives us a lot of access to liquidity. And so I think that's primarily how we're thinking about it at the moment, and we'll continue to march forward with our plan. Sure. So what I would say is I think when we think about -- I'm going to ask this generally and maybe not precisely related to some of the things that you brought for your question, but hopefully, it's useful. When we think about trying to aim for more profitable sales, what does that mean? There's certainly variability in the kind of gross profit associated with different types of sales. Obviously, sales where customers finance with us are more profitable than those where they don't. And those where they choose to buy a warranty are more profitable than those where they don't. And then I think there's a number of other dynamics kind of across car type, et cetera. There's also kind of variation in the underlying costs of completing a sale. If it's a car that's nearby to an inspection center, it can be much, much lower. If it's a car that's maybe further away but where we're charging a shipping fee, it can be higher, but it can be offset by the benefit of that shipping fee. And so I think there can be variation in underlying cost of sales. And then there can also be a variation in the cost to acquire different types of sales, whether it's sales different types of customers or different types of cars. That can vary in some of those different channels can also attract customers with kind of variable levels of either gross profit or expected expense. And so I think across all those different areas, we're trying to just be very thoughtful right now and make sure that we're pulling levers that we think will drive the most profitable sales and drive the fewest less profitable sales. And I think that, that's taking many different forms. And then you brought up Hertz. I would say that partnership continues to go very well. We're putting even more focus and attention on that right now as we think it's a big opportunity and there's alignment between two groups. We're excited about the results there for sure. I think that it's led to some other opportunities between us, especially as we've added ADESA to kind of -- to augment the overall capabilities that we have. So I think that continues to go really well.  And I think you said you had a follow-up. All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining the call. And to everyone inside Carvana, thank you guys again for all the work that you're putting in. I do think that we are getting more done than we ever have. I know it's against a tough backdrop. I think -- you've heard it over and over again, but I hope we're all prepared for the environment to continue to be tough. And I think we still have a lot of work left to do, but I do think we're all doing a great job, and we could not thank you guys more for it. So thanks for everything you guys do. And thanks again to everyone on the call. We'll talk to you soon."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie. And thank you all for joining us today. We made significant progress in Q3 executing our plan of reducing SG&A expenses and progressing toward profitability. Despite significant volume headwinds driven by a variety of external and internal factors. In Q3, retail units sold totaled 102,570, a decrease of 8%. We gained market share versus the comparable period in 2021, despite the impact of high use vehicle prices, rising interest rates, and several initiatives focused on improving near term profitability.  Total revenue was $3.386 billion in Q3, a decrease of 3%. Total Revenue included $193 million from ADESA, which was included in our results for the full quarter and Q3. Total gross profit per unit was $3,500 in Q3, a decrease of $1,172 year-over-year and an increase of $132 sequentially. Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our more detailed commentary on sequential changes. Following the acquisition of ADESA, we are recording total GPU retail GPU and wholesale GPU, both including and excluding depreciation, and amortization expense or D&A and share based compensation expense associated with Ernie's 1 million unit milestone gift or gift SPC.  Historically, Carvana has reported GPU including D&A, while ADESA has reported gross profit excluding D&A. For the purpose of clarity, we're now providing both. Total gross profit per unit excluding D&A and gift SPC was 3,870 in Q3, an increase of $221 sequentially. Retail GPU was 1,131 in Q3, flat compared to 1131 in Q2. Retail GPU excluding D&A and gift SPC was 1,267 in Q3 compared to 1,276, in Q2. Sequential changes in retail GPU were primarily driven by higher spreads between retail prices and acquisition prices and lower retail cost of sales offset by higher retail depreciation rates in Q3 compared to Q2.  Wholesale GPU was $448 in Q3, compared to $383 in Q2, a sequential increase of $65. Wholesale GPU excluding D&A was 682 in Q3 Compared to 519 in Q2. Sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by consolidating a full quarter of ADESA in Q3.  Other GPU was 1921 in Q3, compared to 1854 in Q2. Sequential changes and other GPU were primarily driven by higher origination rates relative to benchmark interest rates, and improved securitization credit spreads relative to Q2, partially offset by lower ancillary product attachment rates.  Looking toward Q4, we expect to maintain flexibility to optimize our low nails channel mix as the quarter progresses. We made significant progress reducing SG&A expenses in Q3. Carvana only SG&A expense, excluding impacts from ADESA declined by $89 million compared to Q2. These SG&A expense reductions were broad based, including in payroll, advertising, logistics, and other SG&A expense. We expect to make continued progress on reducing SG&A expense in the coming quarters as we continue to execute our plan across all areas of the business.  Our progress in the quarter have led to an adjusted EBITDA improvement of $39 million in Q3 compared to Q2 despite lower retail units sold. Adjusted EBITDA margin was minus 5.9% in Q3, compared to minus 6.2% in Q2, and improvement of 0.3%. Adjusted EBITDA excludes impacts from Ernie's gifts of personal stock to Carvana employees, as well as other income and expense, which primarily includes changes in the fair value of securities, but it includes non-gift share based compensation. In May 2022, we outlined a stretch goal for Q4 2022 of $4,000 SG&A expense for retail units sold, excluding D&A SPC and ADESA expenses. This equated to a stretch goal of 4,350 to 4,450, including ADESA expenses. We are making strong progress reducing SG&A expenses on an absolute dollar basis. But due to the current volume environment, we do not expect to reach the stretch goal on a per unit basis in Q4.  Our goal is to manage the business to achieve greater than $4,000 total GPU and significant adjusted EBITDA profitability at current volume levels, while also building in flexibility to achieve profitability at higher or lower volume levels through our efficiency and cost savings initiatives.  On September 30, we had approximately $4.4 billion in total liquidity resources, including $2.3 billion in cash in revolving availability, and $2.1 billion in unpledged real estate and other assets, including approximately $1 billion of real estate acquired from ADESA. We also ended the quarter with approximately 1.2 million units of inspection and reconditioning center capacity at full utilization, giving us substantial infrastructure for future profitable growth. This strong liquidity position, our significant production capacity runway, and our clear and focused operating plan positions us well on our path to achieve our goal of driving positive cash flow and becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer.  Thank you for your attention. Will now take questions. Sure, yeah. So, on Q4, already touched along, a lot of the key dynamics. We do expect volume to be lower sequentially relative to Q3. We also expect GPU to be lower sequentially relative to Q3 as well, due to some of the dynamics that Ernie discussed. At the same time, we also expect SG&A expenses to be down significantly, as well, as we continue to execute on all of our efficiency and cost savings initiatives. And so those are obviously offsetting, obviously offsetting factors. We also I would add, expect capital expenditures to continue to come down in Q4 relative to Q3.  So I think those are some of the dynamics on Q4, specifically. In terms of our real estate assets, obviously, we have a very large and attractive real estate portfolio. We just acquired a nationwide network of auction sites, from ADESA. And I think those are, large sites and very desirable markets, we think are really attractive pieces of real estate, that was a big motivation for us undertaking that acquisition. We've also been building some large IRCs in attractive markets around the country, as well. And so, I think we have a great real estate portfolio. In terms of, how we're thinking about financing that, yeah, do you think we have multiple options for the way we can finance that traditionally, in history, we've used sale leaseback transactions, I think we've executed about $500 million of those so far in our history as a company. But I think there can also be other forms of financing for large real estate portfolios. So I think that's something we're thinking about, I don't think the -- I don't think we're going to thoughtful about the timeline on executing any real estate transactions. But we do feel like we've got a really nice base of assets there. I think we're going to be very thoughtful about, the best way and timing for financing those assets. Sure. So I mean, I would start by just pointing to the progress that we made last quarter, where we reduce expenses by about $9 million quarter-over-quarter, which is obviously a big number, and is a is a meaningful number relative to the step down to we look to make in the future. I think, undoubtedly, as you continue to march down expenses, it gets every incremental dollar gets a little harder than the last. But you're we're still at levels of expense that are much higher than we would like to be. And we're still in a place where there's obviously some low hanging fruit. I think, if we look at the gains that we made last quarter, it's probably most fair to massage out the impacts of the reduction in force that we had in May, which probably reduces that kind of $90 million in gains to something more like 70, but still a really meaningful number. And I think that was very broad base that came across the board.  And other payroll we reduce expenses by $20 million in advertising $14 million in logistics $14 million, which is 20% of logistics spend quarter-over-quarter, and then we made gains across the board everywhere else. And other we, we cut out $90 million of cost, which was 8% overall. And that was all powered by a lot of operational great gains across all of our operational groups. The logistics network had a bunch of meaningful improvements. Network utilization was up 8% quarter-over-quarter, we've seen average shipping miles per sale down 10% that continued to go down further, since the quarter ended. We've rolled out a new management structure at our logistics hubs only a small subset so far, but in those hubs, we're seeing an additional 10% of gains in kind of cost per mile. And we expect to roll that out across the country over the coming quarters.  So I think we're really excited about gains that we're making an idea we put a table in the letter that tries to break that down so you can kind of see where that's all coming from and it really is coming from across the business. And we expect gains from here to also come from across the business because there is still a lot of low hanging fruit. Sure. We -- I think we initially laid out some CapEx targets by quarter in May. And I think our budget for Q43 was $100 million at the time, and I think we came just under that at $90 million. And our target at the time for Q44 was $50 million. Sure. Yeah. So I think we took a nice step-down in inventory in Q3, second consecutive quarter of moving it down towards more normalized levels. We do expect inventory to decline again in Q4 to get sort of inside that range that we laid out previously. And so we do think that's -- that also makes sense in light of the current depreciation environment and in light of our goals of getting inventory to a more normalized level relative to retail unit sales. So yeah, we do expect to do that in Q4 and feel good about the path that we're on there. Sure. Yeah. And everything I'm about to say is also in the shareholder letter for future reference. But in May, we laid out a 2023 full year CapEx budget in the range of $100 million to $200 million, depending on the amount of elective capital expenditures we decide to undertake. I think from where we sit today, we expect to be in the lower half of that range."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please note, this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Levin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Levin: Thank you MJ. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on Carvana's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Please note that this call will be simultaneously webcast on the Investor Relations section of the company's corporate website at investors.carvana.com. The second quarter shareholder letter is also posted on the IR website. Also we posted a set of supplemental financial tables for Q2 to assist investors in understanding the moving pieces this quarter with the consolidation of ADESA and we've updated our operating plan deck to reflect the addition of ADESA. Both can be found on the Events & Presentations page of our IR website. Joining me on the call today are Ernie Garcia, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Jenkins, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we start, I would like to remind you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including but not limited to Carvana's market opportunities and future financial results that involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed here. A detailed discussion of the material factors that cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements can be found in the Risk Factors section of Carvana's most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2022. The forward-looking statements and risks in this conference call are based on current expectations as of today and Carvana assumes no obligation to update or revise them whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Unless otherwise noted on today\u2019s call, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis. Our commentary today will include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our shareholder letter issued today, a copy of which can be found on our Investor Relations website. And now with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thanks Mike and thanks all for joining the call. The second quarter was probably the most dynamic quarter we've had at Carvana. We shifted our priorities for the first time in company history to favor efficiency and cash flow in recognition of the changes to the market and the economic landscape as well as to enable us to quickly adjust to changes in our industry that had caused our expenses to be out of balance with sales volumes. We also completed our acquisition of ADESA in a transaction that we believe will be transformative over time. First, I want to hit our change in priorities to favor efficiency in cash flow. We began to make the biggest changes inside the company in May. These changes have been significant. They've resulted in prioritization shifts across every group in the business. They've resulted in the creation of new processes to increase focus and drive progress on these priorities. While it is early in the execution of our plan this is going very well so far. At Carvana we've always said high standards for ourselves. And I think it's one of the reasons we've been pretty successful so far. In the long run the ability to keep pressure on ourselves is probably one of the greatest differentiators in how groups of people perform but there's no substitute for the focus and motivation provided by market and economic disruption. Everyone feels it and difficulty reveals people. What is revealing about the people of Carvana is something I already knew and something I can't thank them all enough for. The people of Carvana Care and they don't shy away from a challenge. They are fighters. The people of Carvana are focused in making faster progress than we have made at any point in our history. They're working hard but they're finding the fun in it and they're making change they're proud of. And as a result we are rolling out new capabilities, products and processes at an incredible rate. Our plan is to continue until we reach our goals. This drove a lot of progress in the quarter in a short period of time. We grew units sequentially by over 10% and reduced total SG&A by 5% at the same time causing us to drive cash SG&A down per unit by $850 in the quarter to $5,400. We've set a stretch goal to hit $4,000 cash SG&A per unit in the fourth quarter excluding impacts from ADESA. This is going to be a hard mark to hit but so far we're on the path. From there we will continue to our mid-term goal of $3,000 per unit. We will keep pushing. We also drove up GPU by $500 in the quarter to $3,400. We provided some bridges back to $4,500 and beyond in our shareholder letter. The biggest thing separating us from climbing back to that level is execution. We'll be pushing here as well. Now turning to the ADESA acquisition. We are excited about joining forces with ADESA when we completed the deal. Now that we've begun working with the team, we are more excited. First, I want to give credit to the ADESA team. They've embraced us in a way that we couldn't have reasonably expected. They're a fun group of warm people who are enthusiastic about doing right by their customers and about finding ways to do even better. On a personal level it has been fun to meet so many people inside the company to learn from them, and to see how interested they are in learning from us. Our alignment is leading to extremely fast progress on our integration. We already have over half the cars we buy from our customers that we plan to sell through the wholesale channel landing at 46 ADESA locations nationwide. We've already embedded market operations hubs at 18 ADESA sites. ADESA is already reconditioning over 500 cars a week in locations that complement our existing IRC footprint primarily on the coast. In addition we have also already deepened our relationship with Hertz in ways we couldn't have without ADESA. Overtime, we expect, ADESA to dramatically increase the scale and customer proximity of our inspection center network. We expect it to strengthen and simplify our logistics capabilities and we expect to find cost savings and revenue opportunities that wouldn't be possible without our combined capabilities. We still have a long way to go to complete our integration. And this is another area where we will continue to push. Now I'd like to turn to what we're thinking about the near-term. We are going to maintain our current priorities for the foreseeable future to drive efficiencies that we believe serve our short- and long-term goals best in this environment. While we continue to expect to rapidly gain market share our shift in focus means growth in units and revenue will be slower than it otherwise would be in the short-term. We also don't know exactly what to expect from industry level sales in the near-term in light of everything going on in the economy. In July for example there was another industry-wide reduction in demand levels which has impacted us as well. We have meaningful latent demand and several levers to drive growth which we will begin to pull overtime, but the speed that we pull those levers will be driven by the progress we are making in our higher priorities. In more difficult times people tend to get more nearsighted. There are good reasons for this. There's value in dialing into important cost fundamentals to get less attention at easier times. And as you can see from our priorities, we are focusing more on fundamentals in this environment as well. That said, it's still important to maintain awareness of the mountain we are climbing. Through a long-term lens Q2 has the potential to be one of our greatest quarters. It serves as a catalyst to put more focus on driving efficiency. This was something we were going to do at some point anyway and the environment has provided pressure that we will use to make progress faster than we likely would have otherwise. Our visibility to much higher volumes in high. On the demand side of the equation, we continue to take market share in this environment and the market shares we have in our most mature cohorts provide a clear map to growing volume dramatically. In addition, previous periods of economic strain have accelerated consolidation in our industry. On the supply side the acquisition of ADESA is a game changer. Simply put execution is all that separates us from millions of sales per year. From a GPU perspective, our bridge back to 2021 level is straightforward and from there opportunity remains. SG&A has been and remains our biggest opportunity. We have a clear plan. That plan is being aggressively executed against with concrete goals in every group of the company. And we have the historical performance we have seen in our more mature cohorts as proof points. We remain firmly on the path to achieving our mission of changing the way people buy cars and are becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. The Mark continues. Mark?\nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie and thank you all for joining us today. We made significant progress in Q2, on many fronts. We closed our acquisition of ADESA. We set clear operating priorities, focused on reducing SG&A expense and driving toward positive free cash flow. And we made significant sequential progress on our key metrics, despite facing continued macro-related pressures and working through internal constraints. In Q2, retail units sold totaled 117,564, an increase of 9%. We gained significant market share in Q2, despite the impact of high-used vehicle prices, rising interest rates and other economy-wide factors on our industry. Total revenue in Q2 was $3.884 billion, an increase of 16%. Total revenue included $108 million from our acquisition of ADESA's wholesale marketplace, which closed on May 9. Total gross profit per unit in Q2 was $3,368 a decrease of $1,752 a year and an increase of $535 sequentially. Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our more detailed commentary on sequential changes. Retail GPU was $1,131 in Q2 compared to $808 in Q1, a sequential increase of $323. Retail gross profit included a $51 per unit impact from Ernie's one million unit milestone gift to Carvana employees and a $34 per unit impact from our May reduction in force. Excluding these impacts retail GPU in Q2 was $1,216 compared to $884 in Q1. Sequential changes in retail GPU were primarily driven by higher spreads between retail sales prices and acquisition prices. Retail reconditioning and inbound transport costs were similar in Q2 and Q1, as we primarily sold vehicles in Q2 that were reconditioned prior to our cost efficiency initiatives. Wholesale GPU was $383 in Q2, compared to $219 in Q1, a sequential increase of $164. Sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by a $43 impact from the ADESA wholesale marketplace, net of $128 of depreciation and amortization expense as well as increased spreads between wholesale sales prices and acquisition prices. Other GPU was $1854 in Q2 compared to $1806 in Q1. Sequential changes in other GPU were primarily driven by higher customer rates relative to benchmark interest rates partially offset by wider credit spreads and a change in loan sales channel mix. Looking toward Q3, we expect to sell loans in the whole loan sales format but will maintain flexibility to optimize our channel mix as the quarter progresses. We made significant progress reducing SG&A per retail units sold in Q2 with SG&A per unit excluding depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and ADESA declining by $942 compared to Q1. We expect to make continued progress on reducing SG&A expense in the coming quarters as we continue to focus on operating efficiency across all areas of the business. Adjusted EBITDA margin in Q2 was minus 6.2% compared to minus 10.2% in Q1, an improvement of four percentage points. Adjusted EBITDA excludes impacts from Ernie's gift to personal stock to Carvana employees as well as other income and expense which primarily includes changes in the fair value of securities but it includes non-gift share-based compensation and expenses related to our May reduction in force. Adjusted EBITDA also included a minus $2 million impact from the acquisition of ADESA inclusive of $3 million of one-time expenses and the reallocation of $2 million of gross profit generated from Carvana business that was internalized following the acquisition. Following quarter end, we began implementing changes that we expect to positively impact EBITDA contribution from ADESA by approximately $7 million per quarter by later this year. As a result of the way the teams have come together, all we have continued to learn about the ADESA business, the rapid progress we are making in integration and the long-term opportunity that exists between our two companies, we are as excited as ever about our acquisition of ADESA. On June 30, we had approximately $4.7 billion in total liquidity resources including $2.7 billion in cash and revolving availability and $2.1 billion of real estate and other assets including approximately $1 billion of real estate acquired with ADESA. We also ended the quarter with approximately 1.2 million annual units of inspection and reconditioning center capacity at full utilization giving us substantial infrastructure for future growth. This strong liquidity position our significant production capacity runway and our clear and focused operating plan positions us well on our path to achieve our goals of driving positive cash flow and becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Zach Fadem of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nZach Fadem: Hey, good afternoon. Ernie at the current level of 8000 to 9000 cars per week, should we view this as a fair characterization of demand for your business today or more so a level that you're intentionally managing to as you shift the focus to profitability? And assuming it's the latter, can you talk about the level that units need to restep up to in order to achieve the stretch SG&A per unit goal in Q4? \nErnie Garcia: Sure. So let's start with where units are. I think in the second quarter, we grew units by 9% at a time when the market was probably shrinking by around 15% give or take. So when you look at that, I think we did continue to take market share. It's certainly at a slower rate than we historically have, but still at a pretty fast rate when you kind of really stop and take in. So I think that something to be happy with in light of the circumstances. We have obviously changed our focus quite a bit and that has real impacts. When you think about year-over-year growth rates a year ago, everyone across every group inside Carvana had their number one priority just driving growth. Today the number one priority is driving efficiency. And that has all kinds of impacts. We talked about the logistics network for example in the shareholder letter that gives some examples, but there are examples like that everywhere else. And so I think there's certainly some impacts that are happening when you think about it from a year-over-year basis. I think when you look at it sequentially I think there's some impact there as well that take the same form in terms of the shift to focus. We decreased our marketing budget by about 15% quarter-over-quarter. That was certainly from elevated levels in Q1 that we're not interested in sustaining. But nonetheless, it's a 15% reduction in marketing spend quarter-over-quarter. That's going to have something impact all else constant. We've also been purpose about managing our inventory down. So from peaks and more recent we probably have around 20% fewer cars that are visible for our customers today than we had recently. Again, all else constant that would put a bit of a headwind on growth. So I think we're making the choice today that we think enable us to drive efficiency as quickly as we possibly can and we think that's the right thing to do with the business and we're making a lot of progress as a result. And that's the way that we're prioritizing things. I think when we think about kind of what the opportunity is long-term I think honestly it's the exact same way we would have thought about it six months ago or 12 months ago. I don't think there's really anything different. We have years and years of history across hundreds of markets of continually gaining market penetration. And I think extrapolating off that's not super hard. And then even in this environment with a focus change, we continue to take market share. So I think from a long-term perspective, we don't really look at it differently. And I think we're certainly reducing the speed at which we're growing today given the shift in focus, but our hope and belief is that by getting more efficient it makes it easier to grow faster in the future because you have kind of less work to do per sale. And so we'll hope to get that back over time at some point. I think when we look to our goals we -- there's kind of two ways that we can make progress toward $4,000 cash SG&A ex ADESA. I think one is just general progress in the business and driving more efficiency and one is certainly getting more units so we can kind of have more units to have our fixed cost flow over. And I think both are very powerful. The first is probably sufficient to get to that goal. It's probably insufficient to get to that goal in the fourth quarter. So without growth, you'd probably expect that to push out further in time. We don't want to I think specifically give thoughts on exactly what we expect the growth to be as we head through the next couple of quarters. But I think our expectation of stretching to get that $4000 goal, it does have gains in both areas, but the primary focus is efficiency throughout the business.\nZach Fadem: Got it. That all makes sense. And in terms of your SG&A run rate in dollars, it looks like the primary step-down sequentially was pretty much all advertising. And as you look to Q3 and Q4, can you walk through how the reduction in force impacts the comp and benefits line and maybe pinpoint specifically, how the SG&A dollar decline should trend from here and then what the synergies from ADESA for the logistics or market occupancy lines how those flow in as well?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So I'll hit that one. So I think our -- just as a starting point, we did see pretty meaningful SG&A dollar savings in Q2 relative to Q1. I do think those came across multiple buckets including I think total payroll declined by -- on the order of $20 million. Advertising came down by on the order of $25 million slightly less. Other SG&A also declined. So we did see declines across multiple buckets looking from Q1 to Q2. And I think that's due to all the things that we've talked about around looking to drive efficiencies. Certainly, the reduction in force impacted the payroll number. And so -- but I do think we're seeing gains across multiple areas of the business. One number that stepped up from an SG&A spend perspective was logistics in Q2 relative to Q1. I think a big portion of that step-up was related to third-party transport services that we used in Q2 to work to clear certain backlogs out of the logistics network in areas that were particularly constrained. And so that's something -- that's an expense that we bore in Q2 but don't expect to bear to nearly the same degree in Q3. So, that's one particular example. As we're looking out over the rest of the year we really do see opportunities across all areas of the business. They continue to drive SG&A efficiency. And so we will be looking to do that across the business. Some of the bigger buckets I do think continuing to match staffing levels to volume I think would be one of the bigger ones there but we do see many opportunities. Overall, I would say obviously we're very pleased with our progress on SG&A per unit in Q2 bringing it down by on the order of $1,000 quarter-over-quarter. We're excited about the progress that we hope to be prepared. \nOperator: The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi, good afternoon. A question on reconditioning and inbound transport. I know it was kind of similar in the second quarter to the first quarter. And there's obviously a timing lag here. But given the work you've done where is that running now in terms of improvement? I'm assuming on cars reconditioned today and transported today is no longer a $600 delta. And then secondarily I just wanted to as you shifted focus as a company to cost, how have you changed like the incentive structure within the organization? \nErnie Garcia: Sure. I'll try to take those and then feel free to jump in if you'd like Mark. So, I think first with kind of COGS expenses we really started to make a lot of these changes in the middle of May. And so that's obviously going to take some time to then flow all the way through to sales which is when we'll see that in retail GPU. We're making a lot of progress in those underlying expenses just like we are in SG&A. And so those will show up over time. We expect to continue to make progress there. And then the SG&A immediately as you get the progress whereas the COGS benefit you make the progress and then you have kind of the time lag until you sell the car and then it flows through. So, there's kind of is a delay there. And again those kind of cost reductions really just started over the last month and a half. In terms of focus inside the organization and kind of, incentive structure, I would say in many ways it's similar. It's just the projects that we're kind of pulling off the wall are different and they're cost-focused instead of being growth-focused. I think we have implemented a number of different processes that we're finding really efficient inside the company. not to dive into too much detail but across every group in the company we've got very clear projects. We're doing I think a better job than we have in the past narrowing our focus on those that are most likely to make the biggest impact the fastest. We've got every group meeting together on Monday and reporting the progress against expectations every single week. On Tuesday, we're getting all of our operational groups together and we go through how each group is performing relative to other groups internally. So, we make sure that we can take full advantage of internal benchmarking. And then, obviously, a lot of work is happening in the rest of the week as well. And so I think really it's more about the projects that we're pulling off the board. We've always had a lot of areas that we wanted to work on. It was just a question of what we prioritized. And so I think our priorities have changed. But I think we've also implemented some processes that have driven additional focus and attention and accountability and speed. And I really do think the results of that so far has been pretty great. Yes, I think just it's hard to put this in a model but we have a project that we rolled out for example in the last couple of days. And just kind of sitting in the room with the team is that was rolled out and there were people across many different offices on a Zoom call with 50 people going back and forth talking about the statistics in real-time of how this new product was working. It was really cool to see. And you could see on everyone's faces there was just a lot of pride in what they had built that they had built it fast and rolled it out quickly. And like I said that's a hard thing to put in a model but it's probably the most valuable thing over time because that just compounds over and over again. And I do think that as we've gone through this change of focus the people inside Carvana have done an unbelievable job embracing that getting excited about it and then pushing very hard. And I think that the enthusiasm and speed of which we're getting things done is something that I'm extremely excited about and grateful to the team for.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMichael Montani: Hey, thanks for taking the question. So, first I was just hoping if you could give some incremental color around the consumer in terms of maybe what you're seeing in demand trends for high income versus lower income. And then also if there's any impact in terms of credit availability and/or ASPs of the vehicles that you're selling, if there's kind of a noteworthy divergence in trend there for high versus low price tag units.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. I don't know if we have anything too interesting to share here versus what we've shared in the past or what you might expect. But I think in general, the trends are -- as you'd expect that I think we're seeing higher incomes in general kind of fare a little bit better in this environment, higher FICOs in general fare a little bit better in this environment. All else constant, that's leading to higher purchase prices. It's leading to differences in mix and attach rates for finance and products like that. So, I mean I think the impacts that we're seeing are probably those that you'd expect. I think from a credit perspective, across automotive I think in general, most finance companies continue to see pretty strong performance. I think there's been a slow drift back to more normalized 2019 levels off of kind of what was absolutely exceptional performance in 2020 and 2021. So, I don't think there's anything too notable happening there just yet. And so yes, I think the only other notable thing is, this is a large ticket purchase. It's a purchase that is financed, it's discretionary. I think historically, it has oftentimes been a purchase that leads the economy. And then, it also kind of uniquely in this environment, it's driven by kind of the complexity of OEMs global supply chains. This is probably one of the products that has inflated the most in terms of price relative to all other products in the economy. And so, it's probably an area that is felt relatively more stressed so far broadly. That's not great when you're looking at it in hindsight. But I think when you look at it from a forward lens, it's debatably good news, because it's hard to say exactly what's going to come from the economy here. But if we start from a place to believing that the kind of industry has already taken a deeper stress than the rest of the economy, I think it means kind of any additional stresses from here and expectations should probably be less than any recovery from here and expectations should probably be more. So, I think we'll see how that all unfolds over time. We're certainly in a unique time where it's obviously impacting customers in lots of ways. But as I said, I don't think that it's anything unexpected for our customer versus other customers out there.\nMichael Montani: And then just in terms of pricing, just curious if you all have a view that we may see a flat or even decreasing retail pricing from here. And if we do see retail prices decrease into the back half of the year, does that make it harder to reach the GPU goals that you've set out, or have you already kind of planned for that?\nErnie Garcia: So, I think that's hard to say, but I do think -- let me give you first just a fact. I think we have seen depreciation kind of return to the market so far this year. So that is something that is occurring. Next is something of a mental model. It's not totally dissimilar to what we just discussed. But I think given that car prices have inflated more than other goods and services, it is probably likely that on average they will depreciate faster in the future to kind of get back into alignment with their relationship with other goods and services. So I think that's a reasonable expectation. I think whether or not that has an impact on retail GPU, is a little bit less clear than you might, because it's largely a function of what are dealer expectations. Historically, when there's more depreciation, you see a bigger spread between wholesale prices and retail prices, because dealers are in effect kind of building in the expected depreciation into the price they pay for a car at the wholesale market. To the extent that occurs, you could see decreasing prices without noticeably decreasing retail GPUs. To the extent the depreciation is unexpected I think, you could see decrease in GPUs as you go through that period. On average you have seen kind of the former. You've seen basically flattish retail GPUs as car prices have decreased. And I do think that in the early depreciation we've seen so far, there's evidence that that relationship remains. Even in our results from this quarter you can see that we began to see higher spreads between the price that we paid for cars and the price we were able to receive for cars. And so, I do think there's some evidence of that spread widening again. Obviously, that's -- we don't know exactly how that will play out, but that's how it's historically played out and there is some evidence that's playing out that way now as well.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Bottiglieri of Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nChris Bottiglieri: Hey, guys. I think you got to beat me to my first question a little bit there. But, can you give us a sense like obviously, the $600 didn't flow the room from the logistics and reconditioning. But you did see like frankly, pretty good improvement sequentially in a retail GPU. And you seem to highlight market improvements there. Is that all just kind of would you cited a second ago on kind of move in to wholesale pricing, or are there other factors that led you to kind of expand that retail GPU $400 sequentially?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. I'll take that one. I think we were very pleased with our retail GPU progress in the quarter, frankly, I think it was a nice step-up once adjusting for our reduction in force in Ernie's gift $1,216 in the quarter a meaningful step-up from Q1. And so, I think we feel really good about that number in light of the fact that we still have -- I think that number includes very elevated reconditioning and inbound transport costs. And so, I think, we view that as a real positive. I think, what were some of the sequential drivers. So one simple one is about $100 of the sequential gain. We had lost about $100 of shipping revenue per unit in Q1 due to refunds driven by significant logistics network delays. We basically got that back in the second quarter. So that was part of the sequential bridge. A second part of the sequential bridge is Q4, 2021, was a really high time to be purchasing cars. And so, as we moved away from Q4, 2021, I think, that had a positive impact on retail GPU where in Q1 we were just selling more cars that were purchased in Q4 than we sold in Q2. And Q4 was a very high price time to be purchasing. So that was a favorable impact going from Q1 to Q2 as well. And so, I think those are the big impacts. I think -- yes, I think those were the primary impacts, yes, in Q2 and I think leaves us feeling in a pretty strong position in light of the opportunities that we still see on the cost side of GPU.\nChrist Bottiglieri: Got you. That's really helpful. And then, just an unrelated question. If I look at the ADESA financials like, the best I can tell, it looks like I take kind of like the $7 million improvement and kind of like double the quarter-to-date ADESA financials. It seems like you're probably running $13 million a quarter on ADESA profitability, which may be a tad below the $100 million you were targeting. And I know volumes declined sequentially. But -- so I guess my question is, with that long preamble is like, is this a good run rate for profitability until volumes improve, or is there other reasons to be more positive on kind of profitability ramping ADESA near term?\nErnest Garcia: Sure. So, I think, we try to provide some guidance in our deck our operating plan deck of kind of around $100 million as being a good kind of ballpark estimate for where ADESA would be. I think we're clearly at a trough for kind of the auction business today. It's -- or I don't want to say necessarily, precisely the trough. We're at a low point relative to recent history for the auction business. For ADESA, in 2019, they were at approximately 1.8 million units per year which is obviously a very large number. They're on the order of 1 million shy of that today. I think there's plenty of room for the business to continue to improve from here. I think a reasonable way to think about how it might improve from here is to kind of look back to 2008 and what occurred back then. In 2008, the units dropped by actually a lesser amount, because it wasn't really kind of a perfect storm for auctions like the last couple of years has been. And then, it took about five years for all the volume to come back as the OEMs got their production back up after bankruptcy and everything else. I think, the fundamentals were not as severe. The technicals were more severe in the auction business, kind of, this time around. And so, I think, there's potential that the recovery could be faster, but I think it's hard to know exactly how quickly that will occur. I think a good touristic for thinking about what flow-through looks like in that business is probably something on the order of $250 of kind of incremental EBITDA per unit is probably a reasonable way to think about it. And so, I think, when we look forward we don't quite know if we're exactly at the trough for auctions, but I think there's lots of reasons to be somewhat optimistic. There are some indications that OEMs are starting to increase their production. Car prices are starting to dip a little bit, which makes it a little bit less likely that any given franchise dealer is going to keep every kind of off-lease car like they have been. OEMs are starting to sell more cars to rental car companies, which ran with our companies are normally big sellers. I think there's room for finance companies to start selling more cars as well. So I don't think we know exactly how that will play out, but I think over time there's certainly room for volume to continue to come back and ADESA's built a great business with a lot of great customers. So they're well positioned when it does. And so I think there's room for it to certainly move materially beyond kind of what our kind of medium-term average expectation of $100 million that we put in that deck is. So we still think that kind of on average that's probably a reasonable way to think about what the earnings power of the business is. And then, obviously, there's a ton of things that we're extremely excited about in terms of the way that we're working together. Our integration really is going very well. I know, I said it in my prepared remarks, but we closed that transaction 2.5 months ago and we have cars on the ground in 46 locations. We have people that are actively working dropping off retail cars, picking up cars we're buying from customers out of 18 locations. Those numbers are growing quickly. We've already started to ramp up production in coastal locations. There's a lot of cost savings there as well. When we buy a car from a customer and we're able to drop it off at a nearby ADESA instead of running through our logistics network we can save pretty material dollars per transaction there. And it also dramatically simplifies our logistics network. There's a ton of gains there. I talked about some benefits that we've had with some partners where we've been able to do things that we couldn't have otherwise done. So I do think that just the deeper we get into the ADESA transaction the more excited we get not just about the extremely exciting long-term opportunities around reconditioning and logistics, but also around the near-term opportunities just ways that we can be more efficient together. And again, I do want to give the team credit there. You never know exactly how integration is going to go. I think when you do an acquisition then you kind of walk over to other side of the deal closes, and you get to go meet all the people and have your first couple of conversations. You don't quite know what the reception is going to be and I really will say the ADESA team has just greeted us with completely open arms, and it has been really great. And I think the integration has gone a lot better than it might have otherwise because of how open-minded they've been, and how much they've already been able to teach us. So we remain extremely excited about it. We think it's a huge deal in the long-term. And we also think that there's very big gains that we can make in the near-term as well but it's going to require work and we're hard at it. \nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: Hey, everybody. I just had a question about working capital specifically inventory, which of course, just declined very substantially about $466 million. I believe that number includes ADESA in there. So correct me, if I'm wrong. So is that a level that you feel is kind of normal to finish the year with? Was it -- do you see it as kind of more correcting from what was the last couple of quarters of just your the issues between COVID and IRC bottlenecks and now you're at a normal level, or is that -- or is there some kind of making up to do and you need to have like a flow out again in order to achieve the volume that you want? My first question. \nMark Jenkins: Sure. So I'll take that one. So we did reduce inventory meaningfully quarter-over-quarter. As a note that doesn't include any impacts from ADESA who doesn't have material inventory. So that's just related to Carvana. I think the main way to think about that is, we talked a bit about this on the Q1 call, but we did meaningfully overbuild in various areas of the business, kind of, moving into Q1 of this year. That included infrastructure. That included staffing. That also included inventory. So we definitely have been at an above normalized level of inventory. And so we've been sort of steadily marching it down like over the course of Q2 and also so far in Q3. I think we do expect to continue to lower inventory balance here in the third quarter just as we sort of normalize the size of inventory to get to our target level. I sort of think of our target level as somewhere in the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range. And I think we'll continue -- we were above that at the end of Q2. And so I do think we'll continue to lower that just to get inventory size in line with our targets aligned with the rest of the business. So I think that's one point. I do think we've got lots of opportunities to get more out of our inventory as we move away from third-party reconditioning. The third-party reconditioning typically has much longer cycle times than first-party reconditioning. And so as we move away from third-party reconditioning that will have a positive impact on recon cycle time. Many of our cost initiatives are also speed initiatives that have the goals of speeding up the number of days between when we acquire a car and get it the RC speeding up the number of days between when we start -- inspect the car and get it fully reconditioned. And so we do think we've got a number of levels to get more out of our inventory as it normalizes. \nAdam Jonas: That's very clear. Just a follow-up then housekeeping. How many cars did you have in inventory at the end of 2Q in terms of units and how that compared to 1Q? Thanks.\nMark Jenkins : Sure. So the -- so we don't report that number specifically, but we did see a unit decline in inventory as well that was think of it as approximately in line with the balance decline.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nick Jones with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nNick Jones: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess two if I could. On the time buffers in certain states related to title and registration, is that a structural hurdle that's going to persist? Can you drive more efficiency there and kind of get rid of that over time? And how do you expect that to impact, I guess, conversion in the States? And then the second question, there was a bullet about not passing through the cost of fund increases. How should we think about, I guess, when you might start passing this through? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Those are two big questions, they'll lend themselves to long answer. So we'll try to be as concise as we can. So first on the time buffers, I do think that's been associated with just ensuring that we're delivering the cleanest and fastest experience to our customers on the registration front that we possibly can. I'm going to kind of jump into just an explanation on that as well for moms, I can imagine that's a question people on the call may have. We definitely unfortunately gotten a lot of attention for registration over the last maybe three to six months. And I think unfortunately that narrative is probably both pretty exaggerated and then also lagging -- kind of lagging where reality is. So I think I want to talk a little bit about kind of the progress we've made there. So today we probably have about kind of one-third the rate of customers that are getting the delayed plates that we had even a year ago. That puts us at kind of the best levels we've ever been in our company history. And while it's unfortunately kind of hard to get really clear data around how other dealers perform in registration that is an imperfect process across the entire industry. Unfortunately, I think, over time it's something that things want to improve, but it is a complicated process. And so we do our best to try to pull down what data we can to look at various parts of the flow, whether it's title processes or registration processes. And it is the case that in the majority of states, we're performing better than the majority of dealers. And so I think that's something that we're generally pretty proud of. We think we're especially proud of that in light of the fact that in order to give our customers a seven-day return policy and a nationwide inventory, we oft-times take on more complicated underlying registration tasks. And when you control for the complexity of that we're sort of better again than most dealers out there. So I think again the team has done a great job. I think the way that we're executing today is better than we've ever executed in the past and it's a level that we're proud of, but certainly not satisfied with. We're going to continue to push and we've got a lot of improvements in process, a lot of additional improvements in product that we're rolling out to make sure that we're getting all the paperwork that we need to from customers that is clear to customers what to upload and what to have ready at the time of delivery, et cetera. And so we're working on all those process and I think continually getting better all the time. We're also working to improve the system. We're working with several states as partners. We view the states as partners and many states view us as partners as well. Many of these states have registration modernization initiatives underway. And so we proactively work with them on those. We've been part of legislative change in a number of states. We've seen policy changes in a number of other states, as a result of our involvement. And so I do think this is something that's actually continually improving. And I do think it's something where we do expect those buffers to go away over time. So we think it's hard to predict exactly when we'll be pulling those back, but the expectation is absolutely that we will pull those back over time. And then certainly that does impact sales conversion. There's no question that faster delivery times impact sales conversion. And when we add these time buffers the form it takes to a customer is just they see a longer delivery time. And so that does impact conversion. And we expect to continue to make progress there over time. On the interest rate changes, what I would say we have passed through some interest rate changes over the last many months if we go back to when interest rates started to increase in the back half of last year. But in general, when interest rates start to increase, we tend to see finance companies ourselves included pass through those increases in benchmarks, or risk spreads a little more slowly than they show up. And I think that's where the term interest rates are sticky comes from. And so the sum of interest rates -- interest rate increases both benchmarks and risk spreads has not yet been passed all the way to consumers. I think it's hard to say exactly what will be the smart rate for that to be passed through over time. In many ways, it's a function of what other finance companies are doing. We, obviously, don't have perfect data on what the finance companies are doing, but we do have good data there. And so when we monitor many different larger banks and financial institutions, we've seen a lot of those institutions start to raise interest rates really starting in March and April a couple of months after we did. And we tend to see them over the last several months raising interest rates by something between 25 and 50 basis points give or take a month, which actually can make a pretty big difference pretty fast. So we don't know exactly how other finance companies are going to react. We'll continue to monitor elasticities and try to make smart decisions about how we're handling interest rates on our side. But certainly we've seen an increase in benchmarks and spreads that has not been passed all the way through. And then we try to provide some math to make it straightforward for investors to understand what the impact of that is holding all else constant. And we're, obviously, hopeful that over time that comes back.\nOperator: The next question is from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot and good evening, and thanks for all the great information. I have a follow-up question after the last question that was asked. First as it relates to the titling registration challenges, are there any states where you are not able to currently sell vehicles because of those challenges? And then secondly, are there any issues currently with selling vehicles that don't have clean titles?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So there are no states where we're not able to sell vehicles today and no issues with the clean title issue as well. I do think over time these things can periodically pop-up. We recently had Illinois pop-up. We were excited to have a judge give us time to make sure that we were able to work with the state and make sure we could resolve some of the maybe miscommunication disagreements that we've had. So we look forward to working with them. We share the same goals that they've got. The regulators in all these states just want to make sure the customers get the best registration process they possibly can and that's the goal that we share. So we look forward to working with them. And our hope is that we can partner with them in the same way that we've partnered with many other regulators in many other states. I also say that as part of that something -- sometimes good things can come out of a more difficult situation, but something that's great that came out of Illinois is when we were shut down for a period of time there as we were working to resolve some of these misunderstandings with the state, we did reach out to customers and asked for support. In 48 hours, we had 6,000 customers sign a petition of support. We have thousands of comments that came in supporting Carvana. Since then we've had thousands more come in as well. And so I think that was a powerful message from our customers that certainly customers across the country and in the state of Illinois all other states as well are really loving the Carvana experience. And those are people that are intimately familiar with our process that instantly came to our aid there, which I think was a great sign. And so I think periodically over time there is certainly risk that we'll run into these -- with the state here or there. But in general, we've got a great relationship across states and we view the states as partners. And our goal is to make sure that we continue to evolve all those relationships, so that we can view all the safest partners and they can view us the same way.\nSeth Basham: Great. And as a follow-up on the financing business, can you talk about the channel mix shift for some your finance receivables in the second quarter? How much would you sell to Ally? What's the remaining availability with that agreement? And then your decision to potentially sell whole loans in the third quarter what's driving that?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So what I would say is I think whatever we thought about where we're going to sell our receivables, we're trying to balance maximizing proceeds and minimizing cross time volatility. I think that's always been our goal. That's been the reason we've set up a platform that enabled us to move in both directions. And, obviously, there's been a lot more noise I think across financial markets over the last many months than there has been in quite some time. And so I think -- and a form that basically takes is that increases volatility in a process like securitization. And so what we elected to do is in this environment I think we're kind of leaning more in the direction of reduced volatility than we are in the direction of maximized proceeds. And we elected to work with Ally to purchase more of our loans which is something that we did in COVID as well with very similar motivations. And I think that that's a relationship that we feel has worked out great for us. And that we hope and believe that, they believe it worked out great for them as well. So I think that's the way that we generally think about it. We make sure that we always have access to all the different channels. And we're monitoring what our expectations would be in each channel again in both of those dimensions, both the expectation and kind of volatility around that expectation. I think as we head through the rest of the year, it's hard to know exactly where things are going to go. It is a pretty dynamic kind of macroeconomic backdrop, and these markets can be sensitive to the way the data flows in across that backdrop. I think several weeks ago the ABS markets were in rougher shape. I think the last couple of weeks have actually been very good, in the ABS market. So we'll continue to monitor those markets and try to make the best decision that we possibly can. But our baseline expectation today is to continue to lean more in the direction of pooled loan sales. But again, we want to ensure that we have flexibility to exercise whatever freedom we think is the right choice to make as we move through the rest of the year.\nMark Jenkins: And then on the question about capacity, so our agreement with Ally was most recently upsized in March and has $3.2 billion of capacity remaining.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRajat Gupta: Great. Thanks for taking the questions and for all the color provided on the call so far. I just had a follow-up on one of the earlier questions on SG&A. So what happens when you get to the $4,000 target? One of the questions we get a lot is trying to address is once you get to the $4,000 and you continue to reduce that even further, how should we think about growth particularly in the context of some reduced ad spending recently some of the other growth initiatives that you had that you're tempering recently? What kind of like -- what's the growth algorithm for the company will get to that lower SG&A level? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think the short answer on what do we do when we get to $4,000 as we keep going. I think is kind of the plan. So first let's talk about the walk from where we are to $4,000. That's a level that we've hit many times before in the company's history. And so I don't think in our minds at least there's a big question about whether or not we can get to $4,000. I think the question is how quickly can we responsibly get to $4,000? We do have hundreds of locations and many functions across those locations. So there's, many hundreds of groups that we have to manage across the business. And we have to make sure that we're managing our expenses down at a rate that is both fast because we want to get it down as quickly as we can, but also that doesn't derail these different groups, in different locations, in different functional areas because that's costly as well. And so I think the goal -- the stretch goal of $4,000 at the end of this year is basically more a function of the pace at which we think we can responsibly get there. But then a question about whether or not we believe that we can get there. I think as we look from $4,000 down to kind of the midterm goal of $3,000 and beyond that to our long-term model, I think it's just about driving additional efficiencies. We have many ways to look at where those efficiencies are. I think probably the easiest is to just look at our cohorts. We provided some data in the past about, what our SG&A expenses are in some of our more mature cohorts. And so I think that provides visibility into what we've been able to do. And we were able to do that before we really put focus on prioritizing processes and products that make us more efficient. So as we kind of move through this period where we've prioritized those process improvements and product enhancements, we think that we're positioning ourselves better to outperform that than ever before. We think across every group inside the company we now have concrete goals that build up to our midterm goal of $3,000 per unit. I think we've always had bottoms-up models to inform our long-term financial model. But now that's converting into actual kind of products and projects that we have across all these different teams to get us there. And then, in terms of what it means for growth, I think the biggest impact to growth are probably based on the kind of shift in focus and just a question of which projects we prioritize, and where we put our effort across the business. And so, I think as we get to lower and lower SG&A levels, I think the impact there to growth in our expectation at least are probably positive. And again, I think the simplest way to think about that or at least the way that we think about that is that the amount of work it takes to increase sales by any given amount is in many ways kind of proportionate to your expenses per unit because they kind of represent the work that's being done inside the company to sell a unit. And as we drive those expenses down, it means there's less work to do per unit. It means with the same amount of work we can grow units by more. So I think, we're excited about what kind of these efficiency goals are going to mean for our growth in kind of the medium term. But I think as I said we're really focused on gaining efficiency today. And I think we're making a lot of progress. We undoubtedly have a lot more progress to make and the team recognizes that and is extremely focused. But we're on a very good path and we're excited about it. \nRajat Gupta: Got it. And maybe just a follow-up on the SG&A. Within the comp and benefits line, is there a way that you can help dissect for us what the corporate employee costs are versus some of the more personnel-related expenses in terms of employees who are involved in the actual buy-sell financing part of the transaction? Any metrics you can share around efficiency there, transaction time for sale or employee hours per sale or something of that sort? And so where are we today? And where do you expect to get to as you get to your $4,000 or the $3,500 target next year? Thank you.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. I can hit that one in a couple of different ways. So I do think we've -- I think on comp for example, you can see what we've achieved in the past is on sort of compensation and benefits for retail units sold. I think that's a useful benchmark for where it can go. I think we've laid out midterm goals that are available on the Investor Relations website that also give a sense of where it can go sort of beyond what we've already achieved in the past. I think -- and so I think, those are hopefully helpful resources for you on that question. I think, in terms of what we're seeing from an efficiency perspective, we're absolutely seeing efficiency gains throughout the business. I think, our teams are working every day on those efficiency gains. And I think, we're seeing things like hours per delivery is coming down and sort of the customer care phone time per sale is coming down. Those are a few examples. Utilization in the logistics network is going up. There's -- there are many, many more. That's just a few. But I do think, we're seeing very positive trends in some of these efficiency metrics that we've been focused on over the last several weeks or slightly longer. And so, I think some of those internal metrics that all of the teams are focused on, we're feeling really good about the way they're -- those are trending.\nOperator: The next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Baird. Please go ahead.\nColin Sebastian: Thanks. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, I was going to ask about sort of the whole process of managing the process improvements, but I think that maybe takes a little too long to answer here. So, instead as follow-ups, I guess first off what --- in terms of not using the ABS market is that factored into the GPU, or what's the impact on other GPU if you do not access the ABS market? And then secondly in terms of widening the scope of inventory to capture more value-priced cars if that -- if you are doing that, are you seeing more demand through the mass market part of the funnel? Is that something that you're marketing against, or does that sort of -- that traffic sort of naturally come to the website and the app? How does that work? Thank you.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So, I think on the first question, so the way we've always thought about this is we have a two-channel strategy for monetizing our loans. We use the securitization market. And then we sell loans through whole loan sales or for flow agreement. And I think the way we think about that two-channel strategy is that it balances economics and stability. And what I mean by that is typically in the securitization market you see better monetization but the securitization market involves more variability. And so the forward flow and whole loan sales typically have lower monetization but add a degree of stability. So that's basically the way we thought about it. In terms of our forward-looking expectations, I think we plan around expectations for ABS or for whole loan sales. As we laid out in Q3, our current expectation is we'll be selling loans in a whole loan sale format but we'll continue to evaluate as the quarter progresses.\nErnie Garcia: And then I think there's certainly demand for lower-priced cars. I think that's definitely something that's true. There's basically just a dearth of lower-priced cars out there industry-wide today. It is also true that those that are seeking higher-priced cars are probably less impacted by the economy at least so far in kind of the form that this thing has taken so far. So in terms of like demand across cars I would say it shifted to cheaper cars less than you might expect in light of kind of the desirability of those inexpensive cars but then also kind of the relative strength of the higher income consumer, which offsets that to a degree. But I think we're continuing to push in that direction. We've got a number of initiatives to make sure that we're able to provide our customers with a diverse set of cars that fit their needs across all different dimensions that matter including price and working on different product enhancements to make it easier for customers to afford cars in this difficult environment when prices are high. So I think that's an area that will continue to get focused from us and it's an area where we've made progress so far and plan to make more progress going forward.\nOperator: The last question will come from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Hi, good afternoon. So I know we're trying to rein down here. So I'll ask one \u2013 I guess one question with two parts. But with regard to ADESA, well there's a lot of \u2013 there's been chatter out there about now that Carvana owns ADESA maybe some historic customers or partners with ADESA would no longer want to do business with ADESA because they're now competitors to Carvana. So the question I have are you seeing that dynamic? If so is that factored into kind of the parameters you've given us for the ADESA business? And then secondly, just as we think about ADESA and its enhancement to the overall Carvana model, at what point or at what point would there kind of be that breakout moment where we really start to see the true benefits that ADESA is bringing to Carvana? \nErnie Garcia: Sure. I try to go on site as you said we are tight on time. Let me start with I think for sure we saw some customers of ADESA initially react negatively to the news. And we do feel like we lost some volume as a result of that immediately as the transaction was announced. I do think since then the news is actually pretty good. Obviously, we don't know how this will play out over time but we've seen a number of those customers already come back. We've seen some big commercial accounts start to shift more business back to ADESA. And so I think that so far at least it feels like the team at ADESA has done a good job, weathering the turbulence of that transaction which obviously causes everyone to kind of stop and reevaluate for a moment but it feels like we're in a pretty good spot. And then I do think looking forward it's hard to know that's going to unfold. Again, ADESA is approximately one million units back of where it was in 2019. So there's a lot of room for volume increases from here kind of regardless of the number of customers that come back. But we'll be fighting and shooting to provide great experiences to all the historical customers of ADESA and trying to explain why we think that ADESA is still a great option for them. And as I said I think so far the news there is pretty good. I think in terms of when to see what you expect to see the benefits of ADESA I think hopefully it's relatively quick. We're already seeing operationally some benefits today that are pretty material. And hopefully it's kind of continual over time and continually increasing. And hopefully, it's continue increasing for a long time. I think that there are many areas to reduce costs, there are many areas to drive revenue, there are many areas to collaborate on solutions for our shared customers that kind of benefit from our shared capabilities. And then there's obviously a lot of room to recondition more cars closer to our customers and to enhance our logistics network to get cars to customers faster. And I think unlocking all of that is many, many year plan that we're excited about running at as quickly as we can and we're excited to do it with the team at ADESA.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. \nErnie Garcia: Perfect. All right. Well, thanks everyone for joining the call. To everyone inside Carvana and ADESA, thank you so much for everything that you guys have done. The last several months have been dynamic, I believe, it was the word that we used in the prepared remarks. You all have felt that and seen that. And I think that people always have to decide how they respond to any kind of adversity. And I think the way that people inside Carvana have responded has been unbelievable. I think we could not ask for more. We couldn't be prouder to be working side-by-side with you guys. The progress that we're making is exceptional. I hope you're proud of what you're doing. If we keep our heads down we're going to continue to make a lot of progress really quickly. And that has been awesome to see and is exciting for the future. And then for the ADESA team, we've done this a couple of times now but I really do just feel extremely grateful that you have embraced us in the way that you have. And I think that hopefully we're both seeing the gains from that. I think it's showing up in the results already and we're excited about where we can go from here. So, we look forward to continuing to work with you. Thanks everyone. We'll talk to you next time. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "Ernie Garcia",
            "content": "Thanks Mike and thanks all for joining the call. The second quarter was probably the most dynamic quarter we've had at Carvana. We shifted our priorities for the first time in company history to favor efficiency and cash flow in recognition of the changes to the market and the economic landscape as well as to enable us to quickly adjust to changes in our industry that had caused our expenses to be out of balance with sales volumes. We also completed our acquisition of ADESA in a transaction that we believe will be transformative over time. First, I want to hit our change in priorities to favor efficiency in cash flow. We began to make the biggest changes inside the company in May. These changes have been significant. They've resulted in prioritization shifts across every group in the business. They've resulted in the creation of new processes to increase focus and drive progress on these priorities. While it is early in the execution of our plan this is going very well so far. At Carvana we've always said high standards for ourselves. And I think it's one of the reasons we've been pretty successful so far. In the long run the ability to keep pressure on ourselves is probably one of the greatest differentiators in how groups of people perform but there's no substitute for the focus and motivation provided by market and economic disruption. Everyone feels it and difficulty reveals people. What is revealing about the people of Carvana is something I already knew and something I can't thank them all enough for. The people of Carvana Care and they don't shy away from a challenge. They are fighters. The people of Carvana are focused in making faster progress than we have made at any point in our history. They're working hard but they're finding the fun in it and they're making change they're proud of. And as a result we are rolling out new capabilities, products and processes at an incredible rate. Our plan is to continue until we reach our goals. This drove a lot of progress in the quarter in a short period of time. We grew units sequentially by over 10% and reduced total SG&A by 5% at the same time causing us to drive cash SG&A down per unit by $850 in the quarter to $5,400. We've set a stretch goal to hit $4,000 cash SG&A per unit in the fourth quarter excluding impacts from ADESA. This is going to be a hard mark to hit but so far we're on the path. From there we will continue to our mid-term goal of $3,000 per unit. We will keep pushing. We also drove up GPU by $500 in the quarter to $3,400. We provided some bridges back to $4,500 and beyond in our shareholder letter. The biggest thing separating us from climbing back to that level is execution. We'll be pushing here as well. Now turning to the ADESA acquisition. We are excited about joining forces with ADESA when we completed the deal. Now that we've begun working with the team, we are more excited. First, I want to give credit to the ADESA team. They've embraced us in a way that we couldn't have reasonably expected. They're a fun group of warm people who are enthusiastic about doing right by their customers and about finding ways to do even better. On a personal level it has been fun to meet so many people inside the company to learn from them, and to see how interested they are in learning from us. Our alignment is leading to extremely fast progress on our integration. We already have over half the cars we buy from our customers that we plan to sell through the wholesale channel landing at 46 ADESA locations nationwide. We've already embedded market operations hubs at 18 ADESA sites. ADESA is already reconditioning over 500 cars a week in locations that complement our existing IRC footprint primarily on the coast. In addition we have also already deepened our relationship with Hertz in ways we couldn't have without ADESA. Overtime, we expect, ADESA to dramatically increase the scale and customer proximity of our inspection center network. We expect it to strengthen and simplify our logistics capabilities and we expect to find cost savings and revenue opportunities that wouldn't be possible without our combined capabilities. We still have a long way to go to complete our integration. And this is another area where we will continue to push. Now I'd like to turn to what we're thinking about the near-term. We are going to maintain our current priorities for the foreseeable future to drive efficiencies that we believe serve our short- and long-term goals best in this environment. While we continue to expect to rapidly gain market share our shift in focus means growth in units and revenue will be slower than it otherwise would be in the short-term. We also don't know exactly what to expect from industry level sales in the near-term in light of everything going on in the economy. In July for example there was another industry-wide reduction in demand levels which has impacted us as well. We have meaningful latent demand and several levers to drive growth which we will begin to pull overtime, but the speed that we pull those levers will be driven by the progress we are making in our higher priorities. In more difficult times people tend to get more nearsighted. There are good reasons for this. There's value in dialing into important cost fundamentals to get less attention at easier times. And as you can see from our priorities, we are focusing more on fundamentals in this environment as well. That said, it's still important to maintain awareness of the mountain we are climbing. Through a long-term lens Q2 has the potential to be one of our greatest quarters. It serves as a catalyst to put more focus on driving efficiency. This was something we were going to do at some point anyway and the environment has provided pressure that we will use to make progress faster than we likely would have otherwise. Our visibility to much higher volumes in high. On the demand side of the equation, we continue to take market share in this environment and the market shares we have in our most mature cohorts provide a clear map to growing volume dramatically. In addition, previous periods of economic strain have accelerated consolidation in our industry. On the supply side the acquisition of ADESA is a game changer. Simply put execution is all that separates us from millions of sales per year. From a GPU perspective, our bridge back to 2021 level is straightforward and from there opportunity remains. SG&A has been and remains our biggest opportunity. We have a clear plan. That plan is being aggressively executed against with concrete goals in every group of the company. And we have the historical performance we have seen in our more mature cohorts as proof points. We remain firmly on the path to achieving our mission of changing the way people buy cars and are becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. The Mark continues. Mark? Sure. So let's start with where units are. I think in the second quarter, we grew units by 9% at a time when the market was probably shrinking by around 15% give or take. So when you look at that, I think we did continue to take market share. It's certainly at a slower rate than we historically have, but still at a pretty fast rate when you kind of really stop and take in. So I think that something to be happy with in light of the circumstances. We have obviously changed our focus quite a bit and that has real impacts. When you think about year-over-year growth rates a year ago, everyone across every group inside Carvana had their number one priority just driving growth. Today the number one priority is driving efficiency. And that has all kinds of impacts. We talked about the logistics network for example in the shareholder letter that gives some examples, but there are examples like that everywhere else. And so I think there's certainly some impacts that are happening when you think about it from a year-over-year basis. I think when you look at it sequentially I think there's some impact there as well that take the same form in terms of the shift to focus. We decreased our marketing budget by about 15% quarter-over-quarter. That was certainly from elevated levels in Q1 that we're not interested in sustaining. But nonetheless, it's a 15% reduction in marketing spend quarter-over-quarter. That's going to have something impact all else constant. We've also been purpose about managing our inventory down. So from peaks and more recent we probably have around 20% fewer cars that are visible for our customers today than we had recently. Again, all else constant that would put a bit of a headwind on growth. So I think we're making the choice today that we think enable us to drive efficiency as quickly as we possibly can and we think that's the right thing to do with the business and we're making a lot of progress as a result. And that's the way that we're prioritizing things. I think when we think about kind of what the opportunity is long-term I think honestly it's the exact same way we would have thought about it six months ago or 12 months ago. I don't think there's really anything different. We have years and years of history across hundreds of markets of continually gaining market penetration. And I think extrapolating off that's not super hard. And then even in this environment with a focus change, we continue to take market share. So I think from a long-term perspective, we don't really look at it differently. And I think we're certainly reducing the speed at which we're growing today given the shift in focus, but our hope and belief is that by getting more efficient it makes it easier to grow faster in the future because you have kind of less work to do per sale. And so we'll hope to get that back over time at some point. I think when we look to our goals we -- there's kind of two ways that we can make progress toward $4,000 cash SG&A ex ADESA. I think one is just general progress in the business and driving more efficiency and one is certainly getting more units so we can kind of have more units to have our fixed cost flow over. And I think both are very powerful. The first is probably sufficient to get to that goal. It's probably insufficient to get to that goal in the fourth quarter. So without growth, you'd probably expect that to push out further in time. We don't want to I think specifically give thoughts on exactly what we expect the growth to be as we head through the next couple of quarters. But I think our expectation of stretching to get that $4000 goal, it does have gains in both areas, but the primary focus is efficiency throughout the business. Sure. I'll try to take those and then feel free to jump in if you'd like Mark. So, I think first with kind of COGS expenses we really started to make a lot of these changes in the middle of May. And so that's obviously going to take some time to then flow all the way through to sales which is when we'll see that in retail GPU. We're making a lot of progress in those underlying expenses just like we are in SG&A. And so those will show up over time. We expect to continue to make progress there. And then the SG&A immediately as you get the progress whereas the COGS benefit you make the progress and then you have kind of the time lag until you sell the car and then it flows through. So, there's kind of is a delay there. And again those kind of cost reductions really just started over the last month and a half. In terms of focus inside the organization and kind of, incentive structure, I would say in many ways it's similar. It's just the projects that we're kind of pulling off the wall are different and they're cost-focused instead of being growth-focused. I think we have implemented a number of different processes that we're finding really efficient inside the company. not to dive into too much detail but across every group in the company we've got very clear projects. We're doing I think a better job than we have in the past narrowing our focus on those that are most likely to make the biggest impact the fastest. We've got every group meeting together on Monday and reporting the progress against expectations every single week. On Tuesday, we're getting all of our operational groups together and we go through how each group is performing relative to other groups internally. So, we make sure that we can take full advantage of internal benchmarking. And then, obviously, a lot of work is happening in the rest of the week as well. And so I think really it's more about the projects that we're pulling off the board. We've always had a lot of areas that we wanted to work on. It was just a question of what we prioritized. And so I think our priorities have changed. But I think we've also implemented some processes that have driven additional focus and attention and accountability and speed. And I really do think the results of that so far has been pretty great. Yes, I think just it's hard to put this in a model but we have a project that we rolled out for example in the last couple of days. And just kind of sitting in the room with the team is that was rolled out and there were people across many different offices on a Zoom call with 50 people going back and forth talking about the statistics in real-time of how this new product was working. It was really cool to see. And you could see on everyone's faces there was just a lot of pride in what they had built that they had built it fast and rolled it out quickly. And like I said that's a hard thing to put in a model but it's probably the most valuable thing over time because that just compounds over and over again. And I do think that as we've gone through this change of focus the people inside Carvana have done an unbelievable job embracing that getting excited about it and then pushing very hard. And I think that the enthusiasm and speed of which we're getting things done is something that I'm extremely excited about and grateful to the team for. Sure. I don't know if we have anything too interesting to share here versus what we've shared in the past or what you might expect. But I think in general, the trends are -- as you'd expect that I think we're seeing higher incomes in general kind of fare a little bit better in this environment, higher FICOs in general fare a little bit better in this environment. All else constant, that's leading to higher purchase prices. It's leading to differences in mix and attach rates for finance and products like that. So, I mean I think the impacts that we're seeing are probably those that you'd expect. I think from a credit perspective, across automotive I think in general, most finance companies continue to see pretty strong performance. I think there's been a slow drift back to more normalized 2019 levels off of kind of what was absolutely exceptional performance in 2020 and 2021. So, I don't think there's anything too notable happening there just yet. And so yes, I think the only other notable thing is, this is a large ticket purchase. It's a purchase that is financed, it's discretionary. I think historically, it has oftentimes been a purchase that leads the economy. And then, it also kind of uniquely in this environment, it's driven by kind of the complexity of OEMs global supply chains. This is probably one of the products that has inflated the most in terms of price relative to all other products in the economy. And so, it's probably an area that is felt relatively more stressed so far broadly. That's not great when you're looking at it in hindsight. But I think when you look at it from a forward lens, it's debatably good news, because it's hard to say exactly what's going to come from the economy here. But if we start from a place to believing that the kind of industry has already taken a deeper stress than the rest of the economy, I think it means kind of any additional stresses from here and expectations should probably be less than any recovery from here and expectations should probably be more. So, I think we'll see how that all unfolds over time. We're certainly in a unique time where it's obviously impacting customers in lots of ways. But as I said, I don't think that it's anything unexpected for our customer versus other customers out there. So, I think that's hard to say, but I do think -- let me give you first just a fact. I think we have seen depreciation kind of return to the market so far this year. So that is something that is occurring. Next is something of a mental model. It's not totally dissimilar to what we just discussed. But I think given that car prices have inflated more than other goods and services, it is probably likely that on average they will depreciate faster in the future to kind of get back into alignment with their relationship with other goods and services. So I think that's a reasonable expectation. I think whether or not that has an impact on retail GPU, is a little bit less clear than you might, because it's largely a function of what are dealer expectations. Historically, when there's more depreciation, you see a bigger spread between wholesale prices and retail prices, because dealers are in effect kind of building in the expected depreciation into the price they pay for a car at the wholesale market. To the extent that occurs, you could see decreasing prices without noticeably decreasing retail GPUs. To the extent the depreciation is unexpected I think, you could see decrease in GPUs as you go through that period. On average you have seen kind of the former. You've seen basically flattish retail GPUs as car prices have decreased. And I do think that in the early depreciation we've seen so far, there's evidence that that relationship remains. Even in our results from this quarter you can see that we began to see higher spreads between the price that we paid for cars and the price we were able to receive for cars. And so, I do think there's some evidence of that spread widening again. Obviously, that's -- we don't know exactly how that will play out, but that's how it's historically played out and there is some evidence that's playing out that way now as well. Sure. Those are two big questions, they'll lend themselves to long answer. So we'll try to be as concise as we can. So first on the time buffers, I do think that's been associated with just ensuring that we're delivering the cleanest and fastest experience to our customers on the registration front that we possibly can. I'm going to kind of jump into just an explanation on that as well for moms, I can imagine that's a question people on the call may have. We definitely unfortunately gotten a lot of attention for registration over the last maybe three to six months. And I think unfortunately that narrative is probably both pretty exaggerated and then also lagging -- kind of lagging where reality is. So I think I want to talk a little bit about kind of the progress we've made there. So today we probably have about kind of one-third the rate of customers that are getting the delayed plates that we had even a year ago. That puts us at kind of the best levels we've ever been in our company history. And while it's unfortunately kind of hard to get really clear data around how other dealers perform in registration that is an imperfect process across the entire industry. Unfortunately, I think, over time it's something that things want to improve, but it is a complicated process. And so we do our best to try to pull down what data we can to look at various parts of the flow, whether it's title processes or registration processes. And it is the case that in the majority of states, we're performing better than the majority of dealers. And so I think that's something that we're generally pretty proud of. We think we're especially proud of that in light of the fact that in order to give our customers a seven-day return policy and a nationwide inventory, we oft-times take on more complicated underlying registration tasks. And when you control for the complexity of that we're sort of better again than most dealers out there. So I think again the team has done a great job. I think the way that we're executing today is better than we've ever executed in the past and it's a level that we're proud of, but certainly not satisfied with. We're going to continue to push and we've got a lot of improvements in process, a lot of additional improvements in product that we're rolling out to make sure that we're getting all the paperwork that we need to from customers that is clear to customers what to upload and what to have ready at the time of delivery, et cetera. And so we're working on all those process and I think continually getting better all the time. We're also working to improve the system. We're working with several states as partners. We view the states as partners and many states view us as partners as well. Many of these states have registration modernization initiatives underway. And so we proactively work with them on those. We've been part of legislative change in a number of states. We've seen policy changes in a number of other states, as a result of our involvement. And so I do think this is something that's actually continually improving. And I do think it's something where we do expect those buffers to go away over time. So we think it's hard to predict exactly when we'll be pulling those back, but the expectation is absolutely that we will pull those back over time. And then certainly that does impact sales conversion. There's no question that faster delivery times impact sales conversion. And when we add these time buffers the form it takes to a customer is just they see a longer delivery time. And so that does impact conversion. And we expect to continue to make progress there over time. On the interest rate changes, what I would say we have passed through some interest rate changes over the last many months if we go back to when interest rates started to increase in the back half of last year. But in general, when interest rates start to increase, we tend to see finance companies ourselves included pass through those increases in benchmarks, or risk spreads a little more slowly than they show up. And I think that's where the term interest rates are sticky comes from. And so the sum of interest rates -- interest rate increases both benchmarks and risk spreads has not yet been passed all the way to consumers. I think it's hard to say exactly what will be the smart rate for that to be passed through over time. In many ways, it's a function of what other finance companies are doing. We, obviously, don't have perfect data on what the finance companies are doing, but we do have good data there. And so when we monitor many different larger banks and financial institutions, we've seen a lot of those institutions start to raise interest rates really starting in March and April a couple of months after we did. And we tend to see them over the last several months raising interest rates by something between 25 and 50 basis points give or take a month, which actually can make a pretty big difference pretty fast. So we don't know exactly how other finance companies are going to react. We'll continue to monitor elasticities and try to make smart decisions about how we're handling interest rates on our side. But certainly we've seen an increase in benchmarks and spreads that has not been passed all the way through. And then we try to provide some math to make it straightforward for investors to understand what the impact of that is holding all else constant. And we're, obviously, hopeful that over time that comes back. Sure. So there are no states where we're not able to sell vehicles today and no issues with the clean title issue as well. I do think over time these things can periodically pop-up. We recently had Illinois pop-up. We were excited to have a judge give us time to make sure that we were able to work with the state and make sure we could resolve some of the maybe miscommunication disagreements that we've had. So we look forward to working with them. We share the same goals that they've got. The regulators in all these states just want to make sure the customers get the best registration process they possibly can and that's the goal that we share. So we look forward to working with them. And our hope is that we can partner with them in the same way that we've partnered with many other regulators in many other states. I also say that as part of that something -- sometimes good things can come out of a more difficult situation, but something that's great that came out of Illinois is when we were shut down for a period of time there as we were working to resolve some of these misunderstandings with the state, we did reach out to customers and asked for support. In 48 hours, we had 6,000 customers sign a petition of support. We have thousands of comments that came in supporting Carvana. Since then we've had thousands more come in as well. And so I think that was a powerful message from our customers that certainly customers across the country and in the state of Illinois all other states as well are really loving the Carvana experience. And those are people that are intimately familiar with our process that instantly came to our aid there, which I think was a great sign. And so I think periodically over time there is certainly risk that we'll run into these -- with the state here or there. But in general, we've got a great relationship across states and we view the states as partners. And our goal is to make sure that we continue to evolve all those relationships, so that we can view all the safest partners and they can view us the same way. Sure. So what I would say is I think whatever we thought about where we're going to sell our receivables, we're trying to balance maximizing proceeds and minimizing cross time volatility. I think that's always been our goal. That's been the reason we've set up a platform that enabled us to move in both directions. And, obviously, there's been a lot more noise I think across financial markets over the last many months than there has been in quite some time. And so I think -- and a form that basically takes is that increases volatility in a process like securitization. And so what we elected to do is in this environment I think we're kind of leaning more in the direction of reduced volatility than we are in the direction of maximized proceeds. And we elected to work with Ally to purchase more of our loans which is something that we did in COVID as well with very similar motivations. And I think that that's a relationship that we feel has worked out great for us. And that we hope and believe that, they believe it worked out great for them as well. So I think that's the way that we generally think about it. We make sure that we always have access to all the different channels. And we're monitoring what our expectations would be in each channel again in both of those dimensions, both the expectation and kind of volatility around that expectation. I think as we head through the rest of the year, it's hard to know exactly where things are going to go. It is a pretty dynamic kind of macroeconomic backdrop, and these markets can be sensitive to the way the data flows in across that backdrop. I think several weeks ago the ABS markets were in rougher shape. I think the last couple of weeks have actually been very good, in the ABS market. So we'll continue to monitor those markets and try to make the best decision that we possibly can. But our baseline expectation today is to continue to lean more in the direction of pooled loan sales. But again, we want to ensure that we have flexibility to exercise whatever freedom we think is the right choice to make as we move through the rest of the year. Sure. So I think the short answer on what do we do when we get to $4,000 as we keep going. I think is kind of the plan. So first let's talk about the walk from where we are to $4,000. That's a level that we've hit many times before in the company's history. And so I don't think in our minds at least there's a big question about whether or not we can get to $4,000. I think the question is how quickly can we responsibly get to $4,000? We do have hundreds of locations and many functions across those locations. So there's, many hundreds of groups that we have to manage across the business. And we have to make sure that we're managing our expenses down at a rate that is both fast because we want to get it down as quickly as we can, but also that doesn't derail these different groups, in different locations, in different functional areas because that's costly as well. And so I think the goal -- the stretch goal of $4,000 at the end of this year is basically more a function of the pace at which we think we can responsibly get there. But then a question about whether or not we believe that we can get there. I think as we look from $4,000 down to kind of the midterm goal of $3,000 and beyond that to our long-term model, I think it's just about driving additional efficiencies. We have many ways to look at where those efficiencies are. I think probably the easiest is to just look at our cohorts. We provided some data in the past about, what our SG&A expenses are in some of our more mature cohorts. And so I think that provides visibility into what we've been able to do. And we were able to do that before we really put focus on prioritizing processes and products that make us more efficient. So as we kind of move through this period where we've prioritized those process improvements and product enhancements, we think that we're positioning ourselves better to outperform that than ever before. We think across every group inside the company we now have concrete goals that build up to our midterm goal of $3,000 per unit. I think we've always had bottoms-up models to inform our long-term financial model. But now that's converting into actual kind of products and projects that we have across all these different teams to get us there. And then, in terms of what it means for growth, I think the biggest impact to growth are probably based on the kind of shift in focus and just a question of which projects we prioritize, and where we put our effort across the business. And so, I think as we get to lower and lower SG&A levels, I think the impact there to growth in our expectation at least are probably positive. And again, I think the simplest way to think about that or at least the way that we think about that is that the amount of work it takes to increase sales by any given amount is in many ways kind of proportionate to your expenses per unit because they kind of represent the work that's being done inside the company to sell a unit. And as we drive those expenses down, it means there's less work to do per unit. It means with the same amount of work we can grow units by more. So I think, we're excited about what kind of these efficiency goals are going to mean for our growth in kind of the medium term. But I think as I said we're really focused on gaining efficiency today. And I think we're making a lot of progress. We undoubtedly have a lot more progress to make and the team recognizes that and is extremely focused. But we're on a very good path and we're excited about it. And then I think there's certainly demand for lower-priced cars. I think that's definitely something that's true. There's basically just a dearth of lower-priced cars out there industry-wide today. It is also true that those that are seeking higher-priced cars are probably less impacted by the economy at least so far in kind of the form that this thing has taken so far. So in terms of like demand across cars I would say it shifted to cheaper cars less than you might expect in light of kind of the desirability of those inexpensive cars but then also kind of the relative strength of the higher income consumer, which offsets that to a degree. But I think we're continuing to push in that direction. We've got a number of initiatives to make sure that we're able to provide our customers with a diverse set of cars that fit their needs across all different dimensions that matter including price and working on different product enhancements to make it easier for customers to afford cars in this difficult environment when prices are high. So I think that's an area that will continue to get focused from us and it's an area where we've made progress so far and plan to make more progress going forward. Sure. I try to go on site as you said we are tight on time. Let me start with I think for sure we saw some customers of ADESA initially react negatively to the news. And we do feel like we lost some volume as a result of that immediately as the transaction was announced. I do think since then the news is actually pretty good. Obviously, we don't know how this will play out over time but we've seen a number of those customers already come back. We've seen some big commercial accounts start to shift more business back to ADESA. And so I think that so far at least it feels like the team at ADESA has done a good job, weathering the turbulence of that transaction which obviously causes everyone to kind of stop and reevaluate for a moment but it feels like we're in a pretty good spot. And then I do think looking forward it's hard to know that's going to unfold. Again, ADESA is approximately one million units back of where it was in 2019. So there's a lot of room for volume increases from here kind of regardless of the number of customers that come back. But we'll be fighting and shooting to provide great experiences to all the historical customers of ADESA and trying to explain why we think that ADESA is still a great option for them. And as I said I think so far the news there is pretty good. I think in terms of when to see what you expect to see the benefits of ADESA I think hopefully it's relatively quick. We're already seeing operationally some benefits today that are pretty material. And hopefully it's kind of continual over time and continually increasing. And hopefully, it's continue increasing for a long time. I think that there are many areas to reduce costs, there are many areas to drive revenue, there are many areas to collaborate on solutions for our shared customers that kind of benefit from our shared capabilities. And then there's obviously a lot of room to recondition more cars closer to our customers and to enhance our logistics network to get cars to customers faster. And I think unlocking all of that is many, many year plan that we're excited about running at as quickly as we can and we're excited to do it with the team at ADESA. Perfect. All right. Well, thanks everyone for joining the call. To everyone inside Carvana and ADESA, thank you so much for everything that you guys have done. The last several months have been dynamic, I believe, it was the word that we used in the prepared remarks. You all have felt that and seen that. And I think that people always have to decide how they respond to any kind of adversity. And I think the way that people inside Carvana have responded has been unbelievable. I think we could not ask for more. We couldn't be prouder to be working side-by-side with you guys. The progress that we're making is exceptional. I hope you're proud of what you're doing. If we keep our heads down we're going to continue to make a lot of progress really quickly. And that has been awesome to see and is exciting for the future. And then for the ADESA team, we've done this a couple of times now but I really do just feel extremely grateful that you have embraced us in the way that you have. And I think that hopefully we're both seeing the gains from that. I think it's showing up in the results already and we're excited about where we can go from here. So, we look forward to continuing to work with you. Thanks everyone. We'll talk to you next time."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie and thank you all for joining us today. We made significant progress in Q2, on many fronts. We closed our acquisition of ADESA. We set clear operating priorities, focused on reducing SG&A expense and driving toward positive free cash flow. And we made significant sequential progress on our key metrics, despite facing continued macro-related pressures and working through internal constraints. In Q2, retail units sold totaled 117,564, an increase of 9%. We gained significant market share in Q2, despite the impact of high-used vehicle prices, rising interest rates and other economy-wide factors on our industry. Total revenue in Q2 was $3.884 billion, an increase of 16%. Total revenue included $108 million from our acquisition of ADESA's wholesale marketplace, which closed on May 9. Total gross profit per unit in Q2 was $3,368 a decrease of $1,752 a year and an increase of $535 sequentially. Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our more detailed commentary on sequential changes. Retail GPU was $1,131 in Q2 compared to $808 in Q1, a sequential increase of $323. Retail gross profit included a $51 per unit impact from Ernie's one million unit milestone gift to Carvana employees and a $34 per unit impact from our May reduction in force. Excluding these impacts retail GPU in Q2 was $1,216 compared to $884 in Q1. Sequential changes in retail GPU were primarily driven by higher spreads between retail sales prices and acquisition prices. Retail reconditioning and inbound transport costs were similar in Q2 and Q1, as we primarily sold vehicles in Q2 that were reconditioned prior to our cost efficiency initiatives. Wholesale GPU was $383 in Q2, compared to $219 in Q1, a sequential increase of $164. Sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by a $43 impact from the ADESA wholesale marketplace, net of $128 of depreciation and amortization expense as well as increased spreads between wholesale sales prices and acquisition prices. Other GPU was $1854 in Q2 compared to $1806 in Q1. Sequential changes in other GPU were primarily driven by higher customer rates relative to benchmark interest rates partially offset by wider credit spreads and a change in loan sales channel mix. Looking toward Q3, we expect to sell loans in the whole loan sales format but will maintain flexibility to optimize our channel mix as the quarter progresses. We made significant progress reducing SG&A per retail units sold in Q2 with SG&A per unit excluding depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation and ADESA declining by $942 compared to Q1. We expect to make continued progress on reducing SG&A expense in the coming quarters as we continue to focus on operating efficiency across all areas of the business. Adjusted EBITDA margin in Q2 was minus 6.2% compared to minus 10.2% in Q1, an improvement of four percentage points. Adjusted EBITDA excludes impacts from Ernie's gift to personal stock to Carvana employees as well as other income and expense which primarily includes changes in the fair value of securities but it includes non-gift share-based compensation and expenses related to our May reduction in force. Adjusted EBITDA also included a minus $2 million impact from the acquisition of ADESA inclusive of $3 million of one-time expenses and the reallocation of $2 million of gross profit generated from Carvana business that was internalized following the acquisition. Following quarter end, we began implementing changes that we expect to positively impact EBITDA contribution from ADESA by approximately $7 million per quarter by later this year. As a result of the way the teams have come together, all we have continued to learn about the ADESA business, the rapid progress we are making in integration and the long-term opportunity that exists between our two companies, we are as excited as ever about our acquisition of ADESA. On June 30, we had approximately $4.7 billion in total liquidity resources including $2.7 billion in cash and revolving availability and $2.1 billion of real estate and other assets including approximately $1 billion of real estate acquired with ADESA. We also ended the quarter with approximately 1.2 million annual units of inspection and reconditioning center capacity at full utilization giving us substantial infrastructure for future growth. This strong liquidity position our significant production capacity runway and our clear and focused operating plan positions us well on our path to achieve our goals of driving positive cash flow and becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. Sure. So I'll hit that one. So I think our -- just as a starting point, we did see pretty meaningful SG&A dollar savings in Q2 relative to Q1. I do think those came across multiple buckets including I think total payroll declined by -- on the order of $20 million. Advertising came down by on the order of $25 million slightly less. Other SG&A also declined. So we did see declines across multiple buckets looking from Q1 to Q2. And I think that's due to all the things that we've talked about around looking to drive efficiencies. Certainly, the reduction in force impacted the payroll number. And so -- but I do think we're seeing gains across multiple areas of the business. One number that stepped up from an SG&A spend perspective was logistics in Q2 relative to Q1. I think a big portion of that step-up was related to third-party transport services that we used in Q2 to work to clear certain backlogs out of the logistics network in areas that were particularly constrained. And so that's something -- that's an expense that we bore in Q2 but don't expect to bear to nearly the same degree in Q3. So, that's one particular example. As we're looking out over the rest of the year we really do see opportunities across all areas of the business. They continue to drive SG&A efficiency. And so we will be looking to do that across the business. Some of the bigger buckets I do think continuing to match staffing levels to volume I think would be one of the bigger ones there but we do see many opportunities. Overall, I would say obviously we're very pleased with our progress on SG&A per unit in Q2 bringing it down by on the order of $1,000 quarter-over-quarter. We're excited about the progress that we hope to be prepared. Sure. I'll take that one. I think we were very pleased with our retail GPU progress in the quarter, frankly, I think it was a nice step-up once adjusting for our reduction in force in Ernie's gift $1,216 in the quarter a meaningful step-up from Q1. And so, I think we feel really good about that number in light of the fact that we still have -- I think that number includes very elevated reconditioning and inbound transport costs. And so, I think, we view that as a real positive. I think, what were some of the sequential drivers. So one simple one is about $100 of the sequential gain. We had lost about $100 of shipping revenue per unit in Q1 due to refunds driven by significant logistics network delays. We basically got that back in the second quarter. So that was part of the sequential bridge. A second part of the sequential bridge is Q4, 2021, was a really high time to be purchasing cars. And so, as we moved away from Q4, 2021, I think, that had a positive impact on retail GPU where in Q1 we were just selling more cars that were purchased in Q4 than we sold in Q2. And Q4 was a very high price time to be purchasing. So that was a favorable impact going from Q1 to Q2 as well. And so, I think those are the big impacts. I think -- yes, I think those were the primary impacts, yes, in Q2 and I think leaves us feeling in a pretty strong position in light of the opportunities that we still see on the cost side of GPU. Sure. So I'll take that one. So we did reduce inventory meaningfully quarter-over-quarter. As a note that doesn't include any impacts from ADESA who doesn't have material inventory. So that's just related to Carvana. I think the main way to think about that is, we talked a bit about this on the Q1 call, but we did meaningfully overbuild in various areas of the business, kind of, moving into Q1 of this year. That included infrastructure. That included staffing. That also included inventory. So we definitely have been at an above normalized level of inventory. And so we've been sort of steadily marching it down like over the course of Q2 and also so far in Q3. I think we do expect to continue to lower inventory balance here in the third quarter just as we sort of normalize the size of inventory to get to our target level. I sort of think of our target level as somewhere in the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range. And I think we'll continue -- we were above that at the end of Q2. And so I do think we'll continue to lower that just to get inventory size in line with our targets aligned with the rest of the business. So I think that's one point. I do think we've got lots of opportunities to get more out of our inventory as we move away from third-party reconditioning. The third-party reconditioning typically has much longer cycle times than first-party reconditioning. And so as we move away from third-party reconditioning that will have a positive impact on recon cycle time. Many of our cost initiatives are also speed initiatives that have the goals of speeding up the number of days between when we acquire a car and get it the RC speeding up the number of days between when we start -- inspect the car and get it fully reconditioned. And so we do think we've got a number of levels to get more out of our inventory as it normalizes. Sure. So the -- so we don't report that number specifically, but we did see a unit decline in inventory as well that was think of it as approximately in line with the balance decline. And then on the question about capacity, so our agreement with Ally was most recently upsized in March and has $3.2 billion of capacity remaining. Sure. I can hit that one in a couple of different ways. So I do think we've -- I think on comp for example, you can see what we've achieved in the past is on sort of compensation and benefits for retail units sold. I think that's a useful benchmark for where it can go. I think we've laid out midterm goals that are available on the Investor Relations website that also give a sense of where it can go sort of beyond what we've already achieved in the past. I think -- and so I think, those are hopefully helpful resources for you on that question. I think, in terms of what we're seeing from an efficiency perspective, we're absolutely seeing efficiency gains throughout the business. I think, our teams are working every day on those efficiency gains. And I think, we're seeing things like hours per delivery is coming down and sort of the customer care phone time per sale is coming down. Those are a few examples. Utilization in the logistics network is going up. There's -- there are many, many more. That's just a few. But I do think, we're seeing very positive trends in some of these efficiency metrics that we've been focused on over the last several weeks or slightly longer. And so, I think some of those internal metrics that all of the teams are focused on, we're feeling really good about the way they're -- those are trending. Sure. So, I think on the first question, so the way we've always thought about this is we have a two-channel strategy for monetizing our loans. We use the securitization market. And then we sell loans through whole loan sales or for flow agreement. And I think the way we think about that two-channel strategy is that it balances economics and stability. And what I mean by that is typically in the securitization market you see better monetization but the securitization market involves more variability. And so the forward flow and whole loan sales typically have lower monetization but add a degree of stability. So that's basically the way we thought about it. In terms of our forward-looking expectations, I think we plan around expectations for ABS or for whole loan sales. As we laid out in Q3, our current expectation is we'll be selling loans in a whole loan sale format but we'll continue to evaluate as the quarter progresses."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Levin, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Levin: Thank you, Betsy. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on Carvana's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that, this call will be simultaneously webcast on the Investor Relations section of the company's corporate website at investors.carvana.com. The first quarter shareholder letter is also posted on the IR website. Also, we posted additional information on the ADESA US acquisition transactions, which can be found in the Events and Presentations page of the IR website. Joining me on the call today are Ernie Garcia, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Jenkins, Chief Financial Officer. Before we start, I would like to remind you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, Carvana's market opportunities and future financial results that involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed here. A detailed discussion of the material factors that cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements can be found in the Risk Factors section of Carvana's most recent Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements and risks in this conference call are based on current expectations as of today, and Carvana assumes no obligation to update or revise them whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Unless otherwise noted on today's call, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis. Our commentary today will include non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our shareholder letter issued today, a copy of which can be found on our Investor Relations website. And now with that said, I'd like to turn it over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thanks, Mike, and thanks everyone for joining our call. The first quarter was a challenging quarter for Carvana. There were a number of impacts on the business, some internal and some external that combined to negatively impact our financial results. We view these impacts as transitory setbacks, and I will hit them first. Secondly, I will discuss what we are working on internally to address each of these impacts. Next, I'll touch on the underlying demand for our offering. And finally, I'll close on our thoughts on the long term. First, let's discuss the impacts to our results. There were three primary drivers of our results in the first quarter. The first is our operational constraints that most severely impacted our inspection centers and logistics network. These began with Omicron, were exacerbated by winter storms and then the path to recovery has been slowed by our inspection center logistics network and inventory growth causing us to produce and move more inventory to newly opened IRCs that are further away from our average customers, leading to additional network complexity. These effects had negative impacts on both sales volumes and retail GPU. The second was industry-wide impacts. Affordability and general consumer sentiment combine to drive fewer industry-wide sales in prior periods. While we continue to rapidly grow market share throughout the quarter, the combination of these economic factors and our operational constraints caused our growth to come in lower than we were anticipating. Because of the operational requirements of our business, we generally plan and build for growth 6 to 12 months in advance, depending on the lead times necessary to ramp each operational team. On average, across our history, this has served us well as it has enabled us to maintain much higher levels of growth in businesses with our operational complexity historically have been able to achieve. But given the internal and external factors described above, this quarter, it caused us to carry more expenses than we had sales to offset them with. This led to total SG&A levels that were largely on plan in total dollars being much higher per unit than prior periods and, to a lesser degree, also flowed through COGS driving down total GPU. Thirdly, interest rates moved up rapidly in the quarter. As we originate the loans our customers use to buy parts from us and then sell them later, interest rate increases between initially showing our customers their financing terms and ultimately selling those loans leads to a reduction in the value of the loans we sell, which impact of reducing other GPU. These factors combined to lead to a clear step back in our financial results. While this isn't what we are shooting for, it is straightforward to understand and it suggests straightforward solutions. Returning to positive EBITDA and resuming our marks to our long-term financial model from there, requires that we resolve our operational constraints that we get our expenses and sales back into balance through a combination of sales increases and cost efficiencies and that we adjust our process in our finance group to reduce the impact of rapidly rising rates on GPU until we return to an environment with more stable rates. We have detailed plans that are already in motion in each of these areas. Our logistics team has clear plans in several key areas to catch up the level of our metrics were a year ago and then to move significantly beyond them. The addition of ADESA to our network will help to accelerate these plans further. Logistics progress will also unlock the ability to make more of our inventory visible to more of our customers, which is a straightforward way to drive sales up faster, as faster delivery time, larger selections increase customer conversion. Beyond that, the team is working on several near and medium-term plans to improve the selection of more affordable cars we have for our customers. These plans start as simply as buying a greater quantity of less expensive cars and extend the changes to our inspection center processes to produce more of those cars and the other product enhancements that make it easier for our customers to find and purchase less expensive cars. In addition, we are using our temporary excess capacity as an opportunity to gain additional cost efficiencies. While we are always aiming for cost improvement, the constant pressure of growth often dominates our priorities and slows our progress. Across the company, we have each of our operational teams focused on process and product improvements to increase efficiency in an effort to reduce cost and improve our scalability as part of project catapult. We are determined to make the most of this opportunity. Next, I want to touch on the underlying demand for our offering. Here, the signs continue to look great. We continue to rapidly gain market share in this difficult environment as we grew by 14%, while the market around us was shrinking. Further, we can look at subpopulations of our customers that are less impacted by affordability and interest rates to get a deeper view into demand. Our customers with FICO scores over 700 grew approximately 50% despite our logistics constraints and our ongoing suppression of inventory visibility. Lastly, I want to close with a couple of thoughts on the long term. At any point in time, the company's success is driven by the sum of the structural forces that define an industry by the macroeconomic backdrop and by company-specific factors. In the long run, the macroeconomic backdrop disappears from that equation as it just becomes its average. Structurally, nothing has changed. We're a fragmented 40 million unit per year market, with significant margins and customers who are open to and excited about something new. From a company-specific perspective, we continue to make constant progress. During this period, we have excess capacity, we have a transitory reduction in the amount of energy necessary to keep up with growth. While we will not allow that to reduce our energy output, but we\u2019ll not allow that to reduce our energy output in the least. We will simply point more of our energy towards system and process improvements to maintain the same aggregate level of relentless improvement. In nine years, we've gone from an idea to a company with over $12 billion in revenue, and we are still just 1% of our market. In nine years, we went from the company with negative gross profit to a company with over 4,500 gross profit per unit. In nine years, we went from the company that lost $0.30 of EBITDA for every dollar of revenue to a company with approximately EBITDA breakeven just last year. That constant progress has been the result of the opportunity our market has presented us, the power of the business model we have built, the quality of the team we have assembled and the endless effort, creativity and passion the team is poured in. Some quarters are bumpier than others. Unfortunately, in the real world, they are rarely perfectly straight lines to anywhere. While it might be a little harder to see this quarter than most, we remain squarely on the path to building the largest and most profitable automotive retailer and to changing the way people buy and sell cars. The march continues. Mark.\nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Carvana continued to gain market share in Q1, but several external and internal factors impacted our financial results. Some of these impact the used vehicle industry as a whole, such as Omicron, used vehicle prices, interest rates and other macroeconomic factors and others were more specific to Carvana such as reconditioning and logistics network disruptions. The impact of these factors on retail units sold volume was the primary driver of our results in Q1. We generally prepare for sales volume 6 to 12 months in advance, meaning we built capacity in most of our business functions for significantly more volume than we fulfilled in Q1. With our costs relatively fixed in the short term, the lower retail unit volume led to higher cost of goods sold per unit and higher SG&A per unit. These effects, combined with rapidly rising interest rates and widening credit spreads to lead to lower EBITDA margin. In Q1, retail units sold totaled 105,185, an increase of 14%. Total revenue was $3.497 billion, an increase of 56%. Total gross profit per unit in Q1 was $2,833 a decrease of $823 year-over-year. This total gross profit included a $76 per unit impact from Ernie's 1 million Unit Milestone Gift to Carvana employees. Retail GPU was $808 in Q1, a decrease of $403. Retail GPU was impacted by a more than $600 per unit increase in reconditioning and inbound transport costs relative to the prior year and a more than $100 per unit decrease in shipping revenue, driven by refunds to customers following extended delivery times. Retail cost increases in Q1 were primarily due to inefficiencies in the inspection and reconditioning centers and logistics network, which in turn were driven by Omicron, severe weather events and the extended time lines required to recover from these events, and due to lower retail units sold volume, which increased per unit cost. We believe the factors impacting Q1 were transitory, and we expect to see retail costs move toward more normalized levels over the coming quarters as our logistics network normalizes, and our expense levels are better balanced with sales volumes. Wholesale GPU was $219 in Q1, a decrease of $8, driven by higher volume, offset by lower profit per unit. Other GPU was $1,806 in Q1, a decrease of $412. Year-over-year changes in other GPU were primarily driven by higher benchmark interest rates at the time of loan sale relative to origination interest rates and widening of credit spreads following the onset of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, partially offset by the impact of higher industry-wide used vehicle prices on average loan size. Looking sequentially, the rapid rise in benchmark interest rates and widening credit spreads had a significant impact from the spread between funding costs and origination interest rates in Q1 versus Q4. This increase in spread had a more than $600 impact on other GPU in Q1. We expect this spread to move toward more normalized levels over the coming quarters. The same factors that impacted retail units sold and total GPU also impacted EBITDA margin in Q1. EBITDA margin was minus 11.6%, a decrease from minus 1.3%. EBITDA margin included a 0.8% negative impact from Ernie's 1 million Unit Milestone Gift to Carvana employees. While we faced a uniquely difficult environment in the first quarter, we are already seeing positive trends across our key metrics, and we expect meaningful sequential improvement in Q2 versus Q1 in retail units sold, revenue, total GPU, SG&A per retail unit sold and EBITDA margin. In our last shareholder letter, we provided an expectation that we would achieve over 4,000 GPU and approximately EBITDA breakeven in the last three quarters of 2022 taken in aggregate. We now expect to return to over 4,000 GPU and positive EBITDA to be pushed back a few quarters and then to resume our march toward our long-term financial model. We are on track to close our acquisition of ADESA U.S. in May and are excited about the role that ADESA U.S. will play in our path toward our long-term goals. The ADESA U.S. footprint includes 56 sites with approximately 6.5 million square feet of buildings on more than 4,000 acres. We expect to be able to build approximately two million units of annual reconditioning capacity in these locations, while still operating ADESA U.S.\u2019s wholesale auction business. This is the equivalent of approximately 30 greenfield Carvana IRC locations in terms of the production volume that we expect to unlock over time. Adding the ADESA U.S. footprint will dramatically improve our logistics network over time. With the addition of these locations, we will eventually have reconditioned inventory within 50 miles of 58% of the US population and within 200 miles of 94%. This will have the benefit of reducing shipping distances, times and costs, accelerating us to our long-term financial model. We expect the ADESA U.S. purchase price to be financed primarily with $2.275 billion in unsecured notes. In addition, we expect to raise an additional $1 billion in preferred equity and $1 billion in common equity for future real estate improvements on the ADESA U.S. sites and for general corporate purposes. These financing transactions will place us in our strongest total liquidity resources and production capacity position ever, giving us a strong foundation for profitable growth and significant flexibility to execute our plan. On March 31, we had approximately $1.7 billion in total liquidity resources, including cash, revolving availability and financeable real estate and securities. In total, we expect the transactions to generate approximately $1.9 billion of net cash proceeds after payment of the ADESA U.S. purchase price and more than $900 million of financeable real estate, bringing our total liquidity resources to approximately $4.5 billion pro forma for the transactions. In addition, we estimate that the ADESA U.S. locations have approximately 200,000 units of facility capacity that is available for use with limited incremental site improvements. Mining our own IRCs with these ADESA U.S. locations, we expect total annual capacity at full utilization to be approximately 1.4 million units by the end of 2022. We are excited to join forces with the ADESA U.S. team on the path toward our long-term goals of buying and selling millions of cars per year and becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJohn Parke: Hey, good afternoon, guys. This is John Parke on for Zach.\nMark Jenkins: Hey, John.\nJohn Parke: I guess with the two offerings you just announced, it doesn't sound like you guys are really changing the way you put on financing the acquisition. But can you guys kind of share how you're thinking about the debt terms, I guess, the incremental interest expense as well as any associated CapEx plan with this acquisition in 2022?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So, yes, I think we have announced our plans for financing the ADESA purchase as well as future real estate improvements on the ADESA site and additional funds for general corporate purposes. We expect that to take the form of $2.275 billion in unsecured notes, $1 billion of preferred equity and $1 billion of common equity. I think the specific terms on that, we'll discuss in the coming days. But I think that's the basic transaction structure. I think we feel really great about that transaction structure. I think it gives us a lot of flexibility to execute our plan. I think we feel really great about the trajectory that we're on. We feel really great about joining forces with ADESA U.S. and all the benefits that, that brings to our core business. And so, yes, I think we feel grateful about the acquisition and the financing structure. And then in terms of some of your questions on specifics on the securities, I think, we'll talk more about that in the coming days. In terms of CapEx, one of the nice benefits of the ADESA acquisition is, we do expect it to meaningfully reduce our quarterly CapEx outflows from the levels that over the past several quarters. And the reason for that is we have been spending a significant amount through 2021 and early 2022 on building out our own Carvana greenfield IRCs. That's been a meaningful use of capital expenditures for us. Now with the ADESA locations online, we do expect to be outlaying meaningfully less CapEx on certainly Carvana greenfield IRCs and then in general. So I think that's the directional guidance that I would give there.\nJohn Parke: Great. And then just kind of switching gears a little bit on like, I guess, financing GPU. You guys talked about the $600 sequential impact from the compressing ABS spreads normalizing. I guess, I mean, is there any way to kind of help us think about like what a normal level of other GPU should be?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So, I mean, I think we have talked a little bit about other GPU. I think we had a strong year on other GPU in 2021. We do think there was tailwinds to our other GPU in 2021 that came from elevated industry-wide used vehicle prices, because basically, the way that, that works is, the higher used vehicle prices lead to higher average loan sizes, which leads to higher other GPU, other things being equal. We sized that about $150 per unit. And then I think the other point that I would make on other GPU is, we see significant opportunities in front of us to expand other GPU from a fundamental perspective off of what we've seen historically. I think that takes the form of fundamental improvements in the finance platform, other fundamental improvements in ancillary products, including existing and new ancillary products. So, I think overall, we feel like we built a business to generate very significant other revenues and very significant other GPU over time. I think Q1 was certainly an outlier, not representative at all of what we would expect to see on a normalized basis.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP. Please go ahead.\nChris Bottiglieri: Hey thanks for taking the question. Yes, I guess the first question is one of your peers today highlighted that there's been some chatter that ADESA is losing a bunch of its OEM relationships because of the acquisition. So, I just want to get a sense for like as you think about the EBITDA you've acquired, what type of attrition standards that you've -- attrition estimates you've assumed? And then two, I guess, just like bigger picture, is there any opportunity to restructure the deal to incorporate some of this? Do you have to pay up breakage fee, if you walk away from a deal? Just be helpful to think through that before you approach the Capital Markets Day.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, let me just start with the reiteration of how excited we are about this transaction. We do think it's a -- has the potential to be a truly transformative transaction, giving us a nationwide footprint, the capacity to produce a lot more cars, the ability to put those cars closer to customers to shrink delivery times to reduce delivery costs, to enhance the customer experience, and to do it at greater volume and to do it all faster and also to accelerate our path to our long-term financial model because of the benefits of those locations. So, we're extremely excited about that. And then we're also excited about the auction business itself and the way that, that kind of works when paired with the Carvana business. So, I want to start there, and that dominates anything that happens kind of quarter-to-quarter, day-to-day or any other results. I do think that there has been across the auction business in general across all different auction groups. There has been something of a reduction in volume over the last quarter, much like we've seen in retail, and I think ADESA has not been immune to that. I think there have been a small handful of both buyers and sellers who have elected at least in the short-term and not do business with ADESA's part of the transaction. That\u2019s actually probably been maybe a little less than we were anticipating so far. We've heard some really positive news as well. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s actually pulling through and impacting the results in a way that is noticeable as of yet. So, I think most importantly we are extremely about the transaction. It's very much a long-term foundational view that is generating that excitement and that extends across reconditioning, logistics, and the exciting things that we can do together with the auction.  So, we're excited. I think there will probably be some of that noise, maybe there's a little bit more of that in the future, but it's been -- it has not been at a level that is concerning at least to us.\nChris Bottiglieri: Got you. That's helpful. Then just a related follow-up. It looks like there's an extra $1 billion of capital being raised now. Can you maybe just talk about that just because how frankly scared the macro backdrop is you're just being a little bit conservative with the balance sheet, or would you look to kind of repay some debt outstanding with some of the proceeds? Trying to understand what the extra $1 billion comes from. I apologize if you already addressed this.\nMark Jenkins: No, you're good. So, what I would say is I think the way that we've chosen to structure this purchase and the capital that we're raising is aimed at giving us maximum flexibility. It dramatically enhances our liquidity position. I think it does give us a lot of flexibility in the future to do interesting things. Undoubtedly, this quarter is not what we were planning for. We both hit in our prepared remarks. It's in the shareholder letter. We do plan for growth six to 12 months in advance. The world looks very different six, 12 months ago. And so we built for a different environment than we find ourselves in today that had costs. Those show up in the results that we're reporting. And now we're starting from a worst place when we would have liked to start. And so I think for the remainder of this year, we have to kind of dig out of that hole a little bit. So, that also generates rationale for a little bit of additional cushion. And then obviously, the macro backdrop is uncertain. And I think that extends to the broader macro economy and also to the way the auto industry is going to evolve from here. There are some pretty unique things happening in the auto industry these days that I at least haven't seen in my career. And so, we think that, given the opportunity that we've got, the size of that opportunity, the strength of which our customers have responded to our offering over the last nine years, the market share that we've seen continually growing across our markets, the continued market share growth that we've seen, the addition of ADESA and the ability for us to build into that opportunity. We just want to make sure that we position ourselves very well to ride out whatever storm may or may not come. And so, I think that this structure gives us the ability to do that. It gives us the ability to continue to run our play. And that's what we're going to do, because we think the opportunity is absolutely massive.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Colantuoni with Jefferies. Please, go ahead.\nJohn Colantuoni: Thanks for taking my questions. So the shareholder letter mentioned aligning revenue and costs over the coming quarters, while also mentioning that profitability suffered somewhat in Q1 from having a high level of fixed costs. Maybe you could just help square those two comments, and also help detail some of the levers you have to become more efficient over the coming quarters.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, I mean, first of all, let's walk through how I think the numbers work in the simplest way we can. So, as we said, we aim for growth 6 to 12 months in advance. And that's because we've grown at a very fast rate. We do have real ops. Our growth is not continuous and smooth. It tends to be discontinuous around tax season, which is the end of February, early March. So that requires planning, and we have to build up our operational capacity ahead of time. If we go back in time to Q4, we grew at 57%. In Q3, we're growing at 74%. So we clearly were growing at higher rates, and we were anticipating higher rates of sales in Q1, because we didn't appreciate what would happen industry-wide with affordability and interest rates and consumer sentiment, everything pushing overall volumes down. And so, we build more capacity. And so, one way to look at that is, if you look at our SG&A per unit, it's at levels that we haven't been at in a really long time. And we've been at much, much lower levels. We've been on the order of $2,500 less many times in our history. And so, even if we just kind of do a simple math there and say we would have aimed for this level of growth and not kind of built for a higher level of growth across 100,000 sales, that's $250 million, that's a really big difference. And so, we built for more than showed up. And I think that's where we find ourselves today. The other impact that kind of drove the results was some of that kind of extra capacity we built also does flow through COGS, and it impacted various GPU line items, and then we saw interest rates move back. And so some of those things kind of led us to where we are. I think going forward, the most important thing that we can do is we just need to align our cost levels with sales. And the good news is, we've been growing market share very consistently even through this environment. So the underlying business continues to grow relative to the market. We grew at 14% in the quarter, which isn't as fast as we would have liked, but it's very solid in light of a shrinking environment. We continue to see more evidence of the underlying demand growth if we look a bit deeper. We pointed to the statistic of customers over 700 FICO grew that 50% in the quarter. Across all of our cohorts, we saw growth year-over-year in the quarter despite the shrinking market. So I think what we have to do now is, we just have to continue to position the business to benefit from that growth. We have to try to do our best to understand what's going to happen in the macro environment, because as we're continuing to take market share, there's a question about what's going on with the aggregate level of sales across the industry? As long as that's still shrinking, that will be a headwind to growth. When that abates and even stabilizes somewhere that should be less of a headwind, which will be beneficial. And then at some point, that, that will reverse and will turn into a tailwind. And then we also have some operational levers that we have that are in our control. We talked about -- we definitely took a hit from Omicron and logistics network. And then that was extended by winter storms. And then, as we've opened three inspection centers in the last quarter and on the quarter before it. And we've got kind of inventory in different places, that grew a little faster than we anticipated. That put a little bit of extra strain on the network. Unfortunately, that extra strain has put us in a position where we have not yet increased the visibility of inventory across our network to customers everywhere. So those are operational undertakings that we're very focused on. We want to try to get our logistics network back to where it was a year ago and then continue to proceed positively from there that would lead to faster delivery times and greater sales all else constant. And then, that puts us in a spot to be able to make inventory visible, which should also lead to greater sales of all comp. And so that's the kind of easiest and most important way to get back to balances to drive up sales. And then, I think something that we're trying to do internally and something that I'm incredibly proud of the team for is every moment, whether it's the moment you plan for, if it's a little bit different than the moment you anticipated, it is some sort of an opportunity. And as a company for the last nine years, we've been characterized by sprinting as fast as we possibly can to keep up with the demand that we've seen. And I think the company has done a great job. The team has done a great job keeping up with that growth and growing GPU and levering EBITDA. But undoubtedly, when you're growing that fast, there are just trade-offs to get made, and there are priorities that you have to kind of surrender to. And so growth usually wins. And that means that kind of cost reductions off times do take a back seat. And we haven't had a lot of opportunities where there's less immediate pressure on us to grow. And I think the advantage that we have today and the opportunity we have today is we do have excess capacity. And so we've got the team pointing their energy at, let's find ways to get more efficient fast than we otherwise would have, because still got all this effort. And now we have this new opportunity where we're not pointing a lot of that effort in the direction of just keeping our head above water with growth. And so that's the other big opportunity that we've got. And somewhere in the mix there between growing sales as a result of our market share growth, growing sales as a result of continuing to improve our operations with the overlay of whatever happens in the market. And then, getting expenses because of this opportunity that we've got, we expect to get back in balance, and then we'll continue to build from there. So that's our plan. And we feel really good about it.\nJohn Colantuoni: Thanks for that. Just wanted to quickly ask about, the proposed offering from this morning -- from this afternoon, sorry, it sounds like last quarter, the $1 billion of additional financing was being mostly invested into the ADESA assets. But the proposed offering, mentioned that you'll also be now investing that $1 billion into working capital and general corporate purposes in addition to that, the investments in the ADESA assets. So two questions and that's also in addition to raising an additional $1 billion in equity. So two questions here, can you just quantify how much of that $1 billion you'll be investing into each of the buckets that you outlined in the proposed offering? And then second, what changed since last quarter that's necessitating an additional $2 billion in cash? Thanks.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So on the construction improvements to the ADESA locations, there's nothing changed there. So we still expect to invest approximately $1 million over a period of multiple years in the ADESA locations in order to move them from what we estimate is about 200,000 infrastructure capacity today, if fully staffed from an annual retail reconditioning perspective up to 2 million annual units of production capacity at full utilization when fully staffed, which is our goal for the ADESA locations. So that is exactly the same as we've always thought about it. I think we do plan to fill out the locations. We expect that to cost about $1 billion over a period of multiple years. In terms of the additional capital, I mean, I think the way we're thinking about that is, we have a very big opportunity as a company. I think we're extremely excited about the opportunity in front of us to take meaningful market share to drive strong unit economics, to take advantage of the ADESA acquisition, to get additional reconditioning capacity closer to more customers to improve customer experience and fast speed delivery times, take advantage of the logistics network benefits that come from having a more broadly distributed footprint.  And so, I think we decided to raise that additional capital just to allow us to completely focus on that goal building toward our long-term model and to stop having conversations about liquidity and what happens in a deep recession and a prolonged recession and all those sorts of things. So, I think we feel really good about the transaction structure that we've put together. I think we feel great about the ADESA acquisition and the overall trajectory that, that places us on.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nMichael Montani: Thanks for taking the question. I had two questions. The first one was around the demand side. So last quarter, you had given some color around how units grew for households with $100,000 plus of income versus those with $50K. So, I was wondering if you could discuss that and/or the impact of stimulus, which we think could have been 500 bps to 1,000 bps? And then I had a separate question.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. So what I would say is, at a high level, those kinds of metrics remain the same or kind of even more severe, where those with higher incomes have outgrown those with lower incomes by even more recently. So, I think this kind of theme of affordability has continued to get stronger over the last several months. So, whether you're looking at that in income, in credit, we provided the statistic with customer builder 700 FICO or an age. I think that basically shows up anywhere.  So that is clearly something that is very active in terms of what's going on in the auto industry today. Those with higher incomes and better credit are still buying cars at much higher levels than those with lower incomes and lower credit in this environment. I think it's hard to disentangle the stimulus. There were several different ways of stimulus last year and the year before and it's hard for us to precisely disentangle that. Clearly, that is something we're comping over. Last year, it was tax season here as a little bit of stimulus story thereafter.  And this year, tax season, in general, I would say was much softer in terms of impact than tax seasons historically have been. I think it's hard to disentangle the kind of comping stimulus effect from the affordability issues and the general consumer confidence and just kind of socioeconomic issues and everything going on in the world. But clearly, it all played something of a role.\nJohn Colantuoni: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the headcount front, we had seen a pretty significant kind of quarter-on-quarter reduction in job openings. And I'm just wondering if you could talk to kind of if you assume volumes are relatively similar or improved kind of only modestly. How long do you think it would take to kind of rightsize the cost structure for that kind of environment? Is it kind of a one quarter thing, or is it more two to three quarters?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I don't think we're going to give precise time lines on that. What I'll say is, we're going to be working hard in every direction. We've been growing market share quickly. We clearly have operational opportunities that we expect will drive additional growth, all else constant. We're clearly focused from a product perspective on driving additional affordability, which I think will be helpful for customers. And then we're also very focused on gaining cost efficiencies as quickly as we can. I would say our plan right now is sprint in all those different directions. And then, we'll see where that all comes. I think it's -- historically, it's been easier for us to provide specific guidance and forecast when we're trying to predict what's going on with our demand and what's going on with our execution. I think today we have a significant overlay of dynamism in the economy broadly. And I think we want to be careful about being too specific in any of our projections as a result of that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question today comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. So I apologize, I want to focus a bit shorter term. But just there was a lot of comment -- you made a lot of comments, a lot of detail with regard to the effects in the quarter being transitory. Could you help us -- could you talk more about the trend through the quarter than you're hearing even into Q2, both with unit sales as well as GPU and maybe some of the early improvements you're already starting to see as some of these factors begin to abate?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, I think we'll definitely have to talk about Q1. I mean, in Q1, I would say it was for the most part, just kind of continually -- it looked like the industry environment was deteriorating throughout is I think probably the simplest way to characterize that. And again, disentangling how much of that was affordability, how much of that was just general consumer confidence or interest rates is very, very hard. But I think just looking at auto sales across the industry and looking at auto sales of peers, it looked like it was deteriorating throughout the quarter. And I think it's very, very early in Q2, so I don't think we're going to provide too specific of a view there. But I do think that from the time that we last spoke and had our last earnings call, things clearly continued to deteriorate from an industry perspective. Now, we do think that's transitory. There's a question of duration. But this industry is a $40 million transaction industry. It's been that way for a very long time. If you kind of zoom out over any reasonable period of time, that's what it averages and kind of that -- those transactions come from the fact that there's 27 million cars on the road and consumers trade with each other once every 6.75 [ph] years, and that's kind of the math that works out. In a moment like this, it gets very easy for many people to kind of put off the decision to purchase a car for many possible underlying reasons. And so historically, you can see car sales slow for a period and generally, that generates pent-up demand. And it alleviates relatively quickly. I think we do have extra dynamics going on right now. We have inflation. We have reduced new car production. We have car prices that are massively outpacing inflation in terms of price increases. So I think it's hard to know exactly how those forces will all play out in the near-term. I think from our perspective, we made this comment in prepared remarks, the most important thing we can do is continue to build towards the structural opportunity that sits in front of us, which is this 40 million opportunity and continue to make gains as a company and then just position ourselves to be resilient to whatever the macro economy brings us, and we think capital is a big part of that, and we think we've positioned ourselves well for whatever that does bring.\nBrian Nagel: Okay. That's helpful. And then so just to follow up on that. I mean that you're talking primarily about the unit sales been. But with regard to -- on the GPU side in particular, the reconditioning costs, have you started to see that dynamic improve yet?\nErnie Garcia: Sorry. So yes, so on the retail cost side. So, I mean, I do think Omicron had very acute effects, for example, on the reconditioning centers and we are moving further away from that. So I think that's beneficial other things being equal. We definitely have been seeing improvements in the logistics network versus the most disruptive points. So I think that's beneficial other things being equal. So I would say we are seeing some positive data there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rajat Gupta from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nRajat Gupta: Hi. Good afternoon. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Just first one to know on the -- the consumer environment in the near-term. In the shareholder letter, you mentioned that you're seeing a pretty substantial sequential improvement already in your metrics, including sales. Is that primarily a function of just elevating some of the capacity constraints or bottlenecks, or is there something in the demand environment that's helping that? Just wanted to clarify that, and I have a follow up.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think -- I guess these are a bit difficult to disentangle. But from a logistics perspective, for example, we have made some gains. We're -- if we kind of look at where we were a year ago and then compare ourselves to the peak, depending on what metric you're looking at, we've maybe made kind of half the gains back to where we would like to be if we were in the same spot as we were a year ago. And then we've got to go from there. So I think there have been some benefits that are specific to Carvana that we believe are driving some benefit. And then we also do believe that we are growing market share. And so as long as even kind of the rate of industry-wide sales shrinking reduces all else constant, that should be positive for us as long as we continue to execute on our side. So I think, like I said, it's very early in the quarter. We don't want to talk too much about it, but I think there have been some at least operational gains that we are making, and they are likely having a positive impact.\nRajat Gupta: Got it. Thanks for clarifying that. And the other thing you mentioned in the auto GPU that you are able to successfully pass on the benchmark increases through APRs in the month of April. Have you seen any impact on demand because of that, or has that been very consistent versus what you would have expected? I mean some of your competitors had some different perspectives on that. So I was just curious like what you're seeing in like, how is that influencing demand, if at all? Like or is it all pretty much sticking pretty nicely? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. I would say all else constant, there's no question that increasing interest rates negatively impacts demand, and it's something that we try to make sure that we're measuring carefully all the time inside the company. I think the other thing that's true is that benchmark rates go up and as risk spreads go up, the rest of the market also raises interest rates. And so from a kind of competitive option perspective, consumer options just in general kind of go up. And so I think that there is kind of this term that's often used that we've used in the past as well that interest rates are somewhat sticky where when they're going up, it's sometimes difficult to pass all of the increases on to customers instantly in a way that is economically optimal. It just tends to take a little bit longer because different groups do take different views and it takes a little bit of time to adjust. But generally, that adjustment period is not super long, and then the same is true on the other side as well. So I think undoubtedly, we would expect to see more demand if we were not raising interest rates with the environment, but I think that, that would be \u2013 the rest of the market is also raising interest with the environment. And so I think that -- we are not seeing the same impacts that we would see if we were raising interest rates by ourselves out the market raising interest rates alongside us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: Hey, Ernie. What \u2013 can you tell us about Project Catapult, please? You're referring to a lot of the cost actions. And based on the e-mails I'm getting tonight, your quarterly cash burn and how \u2013 and what you can control to manage that even if it wasn't part of the plan is kind of a big impact on how long the capital that you're in process of raising can last you depending on outcome. So it sounds super important, but you mentioned logistics teams and some stuff, but I don't know if you could be a little more specific with those efficiency levers in terms of dollar terms or how we can dynamic that?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, first of all, Project Catapult the internal term that we use for the project that's running across all of our different operational groups right now. So that was a little bit of an internal call out to our teams. There's a lot going on across \u2013 across every single operational team. There are very clear goals and very clear metrics and a cadence of kind of catching up and accountability to make sure that we can gain as quickly as we possibly can. And we really are excited internally about using this as an opportunity to make gains that are hard to make in moments where you have as much pressure as we've had on average from growth. So I think there are many, many different subcomponents to that plan, and it does cross every operational team and several product teams as well. So I don't even really know where to begin, but I would say that the overall theme is called the catapult and put ourselves in a spot where we're really ready to efficiently grow when the market supports us and where we get gains in the near-term in all these areas where we know we can be better, and we finally have an opportunity to focus on it. So that's the general theme.\nAdam Jonas: So Ernie, I'm interpreting that as it's not purely a cost cutting program. It's an efficiency program that can yield savings in a prolonged period of half the growth that you would have anticipated if at 14%, if that was prolonged and not what you're capacitized for that you could lower the burn rate in the next couple of quarters? Is that relevant?\nErnie Garcia: Yeah, I think efficiency is kind of lower cost and simpler to scale up. And so I think it's the pursuit of efficiencies across all of our different operational teams.\nOperator: The next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot. My first question is just a clarifying one on the last one. So you are in the process of cutting costs in certain areas of the business to reduce the cash burn.\nErnie Garcia: Sorry, that was your question. Yes. So, we are working on these projects that I discussed to find efficiencies across the business. That extends to every operating team, and all those constant, we do expect that to reduce variable costs.\nSeth Basham: Okay. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is just understanding when you announce the ADESA deal, you were thinking of financing at that point in time from my understanding, solely with debt and now you're financing it probably with preferred equity and an additional equity cushion. So, what changed related to that financing component for the ADESA acquisition and the improvements from the debt components of the preferred equity component between then and now?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think you maybe separate that into two. So, one is the addition of equity. And I think that, that was driven by giving us more flexibility as discussed earlier. We do think our opportunity is enormous. We think the market around us has moved a little bit. We think that suggests that we should put ourselves into a position where we can operate as flexibly as possible to take full advantage of the opportunity that we've got. And so I think that's an addition. And then, I think in the capital structure, we evaluated a lot of different possible solutions and evaluated those through a lot of different lenses, cost efficiency, flexibility, pre-payability and came down with this being the right capital structure. So I think there are a bunch of considerations there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Thanks. A couple real quick ones here, one and then a follow-up. Just on used car pricing in the industry, what's your view on where it's going? Some of the indexes seem to be coming down on a sequential basis, and then the year-over-year growth has been a little bit less than it has been yet you're seeing the opposite, your used car -- your ASPs are up and up at an accelerating rate, one of your competitors that reported this morning, same thing year-over-year increases were higher than last quarter and sequentially, the prices are getting higher. So, why the discrepancy do you think, and where do you see used car prices going?\nErnie Garcia: Well, that's a very hard question. So let's start with maybe the discrepancy. I think the discrepancy could be partially in timing and then it could also be the gap between wholesale markets and retail markets. So, we definitely saw car prices -- let's start with wholesale pricing. We definitely saw wholesale prices kind of move up in the end of last year and into early this year. And then more recently, we've seen wholesale prices kind of start to fall back a bit. But I think when you're comparing quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. It just kind of depends on the blend of where car prices were across the sum of that period. And so, I think maybe some of those discrepancies could just be a function of what different periods you're looking at and what different companies you're looking at. I think generally speaking, retail prices have been lagging wholesale prices. And generally speaking, they moved down a little bit more smoothly or up a little bit more smoothly. The way that a large portion of the market operates is that cars are kind of purchased at a point in time and then they're financed on a floor plan and they're kind of sold cost plus for lack of a kind of more complicated description. There's a lot more that goes into, I think, that's a good first order way to think about it. And so oftentimes, if wholesale prices drop, it's not necessarily clear that retail prices will immediately follow, because many of the cars that are sitting on dealer lots were bought in the previous period, and there's debt against those cars at a price that was prevailing price to that previous period and often times, dealers are not in a position to take loss on those cars or choose not to take a loss on those cars, and say, I'll just prices longer and then sell them at a higher price. So you tend to see a little bit more stability in retail prices. Those -- I started with kind of the historical prices and then moved on to the dynamics and what can sometimes create a gap between wholesale and retail. As far as where it goes from here, I think the simple answer is, I certainly don't know. I think today, depending on what kind of bucket of used car prices you're looking at, many cars are 40% more expensive than a year ago, whereas economy-wide, inflation is closer to 8%. So relative to other goods, cars are more expensive today than they have historically been. You would -- or I guess, I would at least expect that over a medium period of time, cars will likely kind of have the same relationship to other goods that they've historically had. And so that would mean either more inflation or car prices will come down at some point. And then I think probably the single biggest input to car prices today and the single biggest input to a lot of the unique dynamics that are happening across the new car market and the used car market is just new car production levels, which are obviously much lower than they've historically been. And so I think that it's hard to figure out how all that's going to balance out. And I think we'll be paying very close attention trying to do the best job we can to predict it and trying to manage the business in a way that's resilient to whatever direction those things could move. But I don't think we're confident in precisely how it will work out. I will say our hope is that car prices come down. I think all else constant, you would -- we would certainly prefer car prices to come down. I think in transition, there's a chance that, that would provide something of a headwind to retail GPU. I also think because of the dynamics discussed with kind of the gap between the wholesale market and the retail market, it's not obvious that headwind would be as strong as it might look. And if you saw wholesale prices move down and then also would clearly be a benefit to our customers if car prices were lower, and that would probably play a big part in returning the industry to normal, which would cause kind of the industry dynamics to reverse from what's been a headwind recently to a tailwind, which we think would be great for the business. So I think our hope is the car prices to go down. I think we would like to stay away from trying to precisely call it.\nMichael Baker : Yes. That makes sense. And just a follow-up on that. You said in the past, Ernie, that the ideal environment is lower used car prices, as you just reiterated, but also lower interest rates. I think what we might get here is one of those lower car prices, but I think we're seeing higher interest rates. How would you sort of characterize that environment honestly, one to 10, let's say, as being -- 10 being the most ideal environment?\nErnie Garcia: I mean, I think if we're going with one to 10, I think 10 would have to be everything is low and competition gives up and consumers are excited, I think, that competes. That would be 10. I think moving off of that idea, I think, the most important thing is cars that people can afford because of the sum of vehicle prices and interest rates, which the vast majority of consumers are financing their purchases. And so affordability for them is kind of the intersection of -- or the combination of both car prices and interest rates. And then I just think stability. We feel like we've got an enormous opportunity, and we want to build into that opportunity. But building into that opportunity as efficiently as possible is made easier if we have clear visibility into what the future holds. And so if we had more stability in the market, I think that would be easier for us to just kind of stably grow and to be able to rely on what the market's going to do around us. And I think we care more about that probably than levels of either rates or prices but certainly would love for affordability to get better for our customers as well.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Pierce with Needham. Please go ahead.\nChris Pierce: Just two. On the first one, we talked a lot about efficiency, but you guys spent $21 million more dollars to 8,000 less cars as far as advertising. I just want to think about advertising. Is that something that was preplanned and that kind of the demand environment is stuck up by any guys, or is that something that's kind of a bigger picture sacred cow? And the second question will be around credit spreads? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So what I would say on that is, I think, as I said, across the board, we build our plans out in advance. And then something that we've learned to do over time is be careful about yanking wheel too much too quickly because generally, you regret it when you do. And I think when we talk about marketing, in particular, we still remain a relatively young brand that's building a lot of awareness. And we think that there's a lot of value in continuing to build awareness and understanding of what we do and trust in what we do. And we also think that all times, marketing is something that has a potentially long payoff. I think a lot of times, marketing dollars are thought of as kind of a direct investment where dollar goes in and a sale comes out. But the truth is a lot of what you're doing with marketing is getting impressions on people and communicating what you do and how you do it, and those impressions add up and you build a brand with that and the payoff of marketing can be long. And so we will look to make moves that we think are intelligent across the board across time as we're managing the business, but we also try to be careful to not yank the wheel too much. So that's part of what you're seeing.\nChris Pierce: Understood. And then if I look at Q1 API or some securitization versus Q4, if you're going to -- and we're talking about higher FICO score customers being a larger part of the growth. I guess, can APR move higher because as interest rates entire large even these customers, your best customers will face higher rates? I'm just trying to figure out how the spread can widen because you've only got two levers and your yield levers, the lever you don't really have much control over?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think the similar way to probably think about that is just customers with higher FICOs are different customers than customers with lower FICOs. And so the interest rate spread that matters there is the spread between their rates and their funding costs. And on other customers, their rate and their funding costs. And so I think what matters is keeping the spread between those two things in a place that you can monetize in a consistent way. I think what happened in the quarter that is unique, the mix shift effects don't matter all that much because the spreads are kind of priced in, in a way that is thoughtful and the mix shifts don't matter too much. What happened in the quarter is when we originate a loan, we have an interest rate that we show to a customer and there's an expectation of the underlying funding cost. And then if the actual funding cost ends up being different than that expectation because either benchmarks or risk premiums or expected losses move between the moment of origination and the moment of sale then that ends up being a headwind. And so what we saw, obviously, was pretty dramatic in straight moves. I believe it's the most dramatic benchmarks have moved since the great financial crisis, and that had an impact. But I think that, we're -- if you look at the actual rates that were charged to customers at any point in time and the expected funding costs throughout the quarter, we\u2019re originating loans in a very similar spot to where we were previously.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Naved Khan with SunTrust. Please, go ahead.\nRobert Zeller: Thanks. This is Robert Zeller on for Naved. So just -- I'm just curious on the -- so you guys are planning 6 to 12 months in ahead. What short-term measures you guys have, what operational measures you have in place to react to near-term market swings or exogenous macro conditions? And then, secondly, have you said publicly or can you give us some sort of understanding of where the ADESA locations, what they're operating at today. So appreciate the projections and forecasts on what they can do at full capacity, but maybe what their -- what levels they\u2019re operating at today for not full capacity? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think, in the near term, our goal is, kind of, as outlined earlier on the call. We want to do everything we can to improve the operational constraints that we think are constricting sales that we can show customers more cars and drive sales up. And then, we're working hard to drive as much cost efficiency as we possibly can, and we'll see how that all kind of plays out. On the ADESA side, ADESA currently has facility capacity for approximately 200,000 cars per year, a little over 200,000 cars per year. And so, that kind of already exists in these sites. And then, over time, we'll be making the investments to be able to ramp up that facility capacity to the 2 million that we that we outlined earlier and in our deck. The actual utilization is far below the capacity they have. And so, there's an ability for us to hire and train and unlock more of that capacity, but there are steps between where we are in doing that. But the facilities exist and are ready to go, but there's still a need for hiring and training to unlock the 2K-plus. And then, just would reiterate again, I think, we put our shareholder letter kind of our footprint and the ADESA footprint. And I really think that that's a powerful page to take a look at, because it's -- if you look at our footprint today and you look at where our reconditioning centers are and you think about this through the lens of the logistics constraints that we've seen over the last four or five months, you can really see how that works, right? We're buying cars nationwide, and we're shipping a lot of those cars to middle of the country to get reconditioned and we ship them all the way back out to customers. And when you kind of look at that ADESA footprint and you overlay it on the map, you can see how all of those kind of inbound and outbound transport legs really reduced. And to kind of maximally get advantage of our business model, our logistics network, it does require a coordination between where cars are produced and logistics network and where cars are purchased. And we think that this gives us an incredible opportunity to coordinate that much better, much more tightly and with lower distances and times sitting between cars and customers. So we're obviously really excited about that, and we'll look to gain the benefits from that as quickly as we can.\nRobert Zeller: Great. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nErnie Garcia: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. To everyone on team Carvana, let\u2019s really take advantage of the opportunity. We've talked about it a lot internally, but this is an opportunity that we have. And if we take advantage of it, we're going to look back on it very fondly. And I think there's a huge chance that we can make this into a big positive. So let's do that. I appreciate everything you guys do, appreciate your taking the time to listen to the call, and we'll talk to you again next quarter. Thanks.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ernie Garcia",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and thanks everyone for joining our call. The first quarter was a challenging quarter for Carvana. There were a number of impacts on the business, some internal and some external that combined to negatively impact our financial results. We view these impacts as transitory setbacks, and I will hit them first. Secondly, I will discuss what we are working on internally to address each of these impacts. Next, I'll touch on the underlying demand for our offering. And finally, I'll close on our thoughts on the long term. First, let's discuss the impacts to our results. There were three primary drivers of our results in the first quarter. The first is our operational constraints that most severely impacted our inspection centers and logistics network. These began with Omicron, were exacerbated by winter storms and then the path to recovery has been slowed by our inspection center logistics network and inventory growth causing us to produce and move more inventory to newly opened IRCs that are further away from our average customers, leading to additional network complexity. These effects had negative impacts on both sales volumes and retail GPU. The second was industry-wide impacts. Affordability and general consumer sentiment combine to drive fewer industry-wide sales in prior periods. While we continue to rapidly grow market share throughout the quarter, the combination of these economic factors and our operational constraints caused our growth to come in lower than we were anticipating. Because of the operational requirements of our business, we generally plan and build for growth 6 to 12 months in advance, depending on the lead times necessary to ramp each operational team. On average, across our history, this has served us well as it has enabled us to maintain much higher levels of growth in businesses with our operational complexity historically have been able to achieve. But given the internal and external factors described above, this quarter, it caused us to carry more expenses than we had sales to offset them with. This led to total SG&A levels that were largely on plan in total dollars being much higher per unit than prior periods and, to a lesser degree, also flowed through COGS driving down total GPU. Thirdly, interest rates moved up rapidly in the quarter. As we originate the loans our customers use to buy parts from us and then sell them later, interest rate increases between initially showing our customers their financing terms and ultimately selling those loans leads to a reduction in the value of the loans we sell, which impact of reducing other GPU. These factors combined to lead to a clear step back in our financial results. While this isn't what we are shooting for, it is straightforward to understand and it suggests straightforward solutions. Returning to positive EBITDA and resuming our marks to our long-term financial model from there, requires that we resolve our operational constraints that we get our expenses and sales back into balance through a combination of sales increases and cost efficiencies and that we adjust our process in our finance group to reduce the impact of rapidly rising rates on GPU until we return to an environment with more stable rates. We have detailed plans that are already in motion in each of these areas. Our logistics team has clear plans in several key areas to catch up the level of our metrics were a year ago and then to move significantly beyond them. The addition of ADESA to our network will help to accelerate these plans further. Logistics progress will also unlock the ability to make more of our inventory visible to more of our customers, which is a straightforward way to drive sales up faster, as faster delivery time, larger selections increase customer conversion. Beyond that, the team is working on several near and medium-term plans to improve the selection of more affordable cars we have for our customers. These plans start as simply as buying a greater quantity of less expensive cars and extend the changes to our inspection center processes to produce more of those cars and the other product enhancements that make it easier for our customers to find and purchase less expensive cars. In addition, we are using our temporary excess capacity as an opportunity to gain additional cost efficiencies. While we are always aiming for cost improvement, the constant pressure of growth often dominates our priorities and slows our progress. Across the company, we have each of our operational teams focused on process and product improvements to increase efficiency in an effort to reduce cost and improve our scalability as part of project catapult. We are determined to make the most of this opportunity. Next, I want to touch on the underlying demand for our offering. Here, the signs continue to look great. We continue to rapidly gain market share in this difficult environment as we grew by 14%, while the market around us was shrinking. Further, we can look at subpopulations of our customers that are less impacted by affordability and interest rates to get a deeper view into demand. Our customers with FICO scores over 700 grew approximately 50% despite our logistics constraints and our ongoing suppression of inventory visibility. Lastly, I want to close with a couple of thoughts on the long term. At any point in time, the company's success is driven by the sum of the structural forces that define an industry by the macroeconomic backdrop and by company-specific factors. In the long run, the macroeconomic backdrop disappears from that equation as it just becomes its average. Structurally, nothing has changed. We're a fragmented 40 million unit per year market, with significant margins and customers who are open to and excited about something new. From a company-specific perspective, we continue to make constant progress. During this period, we have excess capacity, we have a transitory reduction in the amount of energy necessary to keep up with growth. While we will not allow that to reduce our energy output, but we'll not allow that to reduce our energy output in the least. We will simply point more of our energy towards system and process improvements to maintain the same aggregate level of relentless improvement. In nine years, we've gone from an idea to a company with over $12 billion in revenue, and we are still just 1% of our market. In nine years, we went from the company with negative gross profit to a company with over 4,500 gross profit per unit. In nine years, we went from the company that lost $0.30 of EBITDA for every dollar of revenue to a company with approximately EBITDA breakeven just last year. That constant progress has been the result of the opportunity our market has presented us, the power of the business model we have built, the quality of the team we have assembled and the endless effort, creativity and passion the team is poured in. Some quarters are bumpier than others. Unfortunately, in the real world, they are rarely perfectly straight lines to anywhere. While it might be a little harder to see this quarter than most, we remain squarely on the path to building the largest and most profitable automotive retailer and to changing the way people buy and sell cars. The march continues. Mark. Sure. So, let me just start with the reiteration of how excited we are about this transaction. We do think it's a -- has the potential to be a truly transformative transaction, giving us a nationwide footprint, the capacity to produce a lot more cars, the ability to put those cars closer to customers to shrink delivery times to reduce delivery costs, to enhance the customer experience, and to do it at greater volume and to do it all faster and also to accelerate our path to our long-term financial model because of the benefits of those locations. So, we're extremely excited about that. And then we're also excited about the auction business itself and the way that, that kind of works when paired with the Carvana business. So, I want to start there, and that dominates anything that happens kind of quarter-to-quarter, day-to-day or any other results. I do think that there has been across the auction business in general across all different auction groups. There has been something of a reduction in volume over the last quarter, much like we've seen in retail, and I think ADESA has not been immune to that. I think there have been a small handful of both buyers and sellers who have elected at least in the short-term and not do business with ADESA's part of the transaction. That's actually probably been maybe a little less than we were anticipating so far. We've heard some really positive news as well. We don't think that's actually pulling through and impacting the results in a way that is noticeable as of yet. So, I think most importantly we are extremely about the transaction. It's very much a long-term foundational view that is generating that excitement and that extends across reconditioning, logistics, and the exciting things that we can do together with the auction.  So, we're excited. I think there will probably be some of that noise, maybe there's a little bit more of that in the future, but it's been -- it has not been at a level that is concerning at least to us. Sure. So, I mean, first of all, let's walk through how I think the numbers work in the simplest way we can. So, as we said, we aim for growth 6 to 12 months in advance. And that's because we've grown at a very fast rate. We do have real ops. Our growth is not continuous and smooth. It tends to be discontinuous around tax season, which is the end of February, early March. So that requires planning, and we have to build up our operational capacity ahead of time. If we go back in time to Q4, we grew at 57%. In Q3, we're growing at 74%. So we clearly were growing at higher rates, and we were anticipating higher rates of sales in Q1, because we didn't appreciate what would happen industry-wide with affordability and interest rates and consumer sentiment, everything pushing overall volumes down. And so, we build more capacity. And so, one way to look at that is, if you look at our SG&A per unit, it's at levels that we haven't been at in a really long time. And we've been at much, much lower levels. We've been on the order of $2,500 less many times in our history. And so, even if we just kind of do a simple math there and say we would have aimed for this level of growth and not kind of built for a higher level of growth across 100,000 sales, that's $250 million, that's a really big difference. And so, we built for more than showed up. And I think that's where we find ourselves today. The other impact that kind of drove the results was some of that kind of extra capacity we built also does flow through COGS, and it impacted various GPU line items, and then we saw interest rates move back. And so some of those things kind of led us to where we are. I think going forward, the most important thing that we can do is we just need to align our cost levels with sales. And the good news is, we've been growing market share very consistently even through this environment. So the underlying business continues to grow relative to the market. We grew at 14% in the quarter, which isn't as fast as we would have liked, but it's very solid in light of a shrinking environment. We continue to see more evidence of the underlying demand growth if we look a bit deeper. We pointed to the statistic of customers over 700 FICO grew that 50% in the quarter. Across all of our cohorts, we saw growth year-over-year in the quarter despite the shrinking market. So I think what we have to do now is, we just have to continue to position the business to benefit from that growth. We have to try to do our best to understand what's going to happen in the macro environment, because as we're continuing to take market share, there's a question about what's going on with the aggregate level of sales across the industry? As long as that's still shrinking, that will be a headwind to growth. When that abates and even stabilizes somewhere that should be less of a headwind, which will be beneficial. And then at some point, that, that will reverse and will turn into a tailwind. And then we also have some operational levers that we have that are in our control. We talked about -- we definitely took a hit from Omicron and logistics network. And then that was extended by winter storms. And then, as we've opened three inspection centers in the last quarter and on the quarter before it. And we've got kind of inventory in different places, that grew a little faster than we anticipated. That put a little bit of extra strain on the network. Unfortunately, that extra strain has put us in a position where we have not yet increased the visibility of inventory across our network to customers everywhere. So those are operational undertakings that we're very focused on. We want to try to get our logistics network back to where it was a year ago and then continue to proceed positively from there that would lead to faster delivery times and greater sales all else constant. And then, that puts us in a spot to be able to make inventory visible, which should also lead to greater sales of all comp. And so that's the kind of easiest and most important way to get back to balances to drive up sales. And then, I think something that we're trying to do internally and something that I'm incredibly proud of the team for is every moment, whether it's the moment you plan for, if it's a little bit different than the moment you anticipated, it is some sort of an opportunity. And as a company for the last nine years, we've been characterized by sprinting as fast as we possibly can to keep up with the demand that we've seen. And I think the company has done a great job. The team has done a great job keeping up with that growth and growing GPU and levering EBITDA. But undoubtedly, when you're growing that fast, there are just trade-offs to get made, and there are priorities that you have to kind of surrender to. And so growth usually wins. And that means that kind of cost reductions off times do take a back seat. And we haven't had a lot of opportunities where there's less immediate pressure on us to grow. And I think the advantage that we have today and the opportunity we have today is we do have excess capacity. And so we've got the team pointing their energy at, let's find ways to get more efficient fast than we otherwise would have, because still got all this effort. And now we have this new opportunity where we're not pointing a lot of that effort in the direction of just keeping our head above water with growth. And so that's the other big opportunity that we've got. And somewhere in the mix there between growing sales as a result of our market share growth, growing sales as a result of continuing to improve our operations with the overlay of whatever happens in the market. And then, getting expenses because of this opportunity that we've got, we expect to get back in balance, and then we'll continue to build from there. So that's our plan. And we feel really good about it. Sure. So I don't think we're going to give precise time lines on that. What I'll say is, we're going to be working hard in every direction. We've been growing market share quickly. We clearly have operational opportunities that we expect will drive additional growth, all else constant. We're clearly focused from a product perspective on driving additional affordability, which I think will be helpful for customers. And then we're also very focused on gaining cost efficiencies as quickly as we can. I would say our plan right now is sprint in all those different directions. And then, we'll see where that all comes. I think it's -- historically, it's been easier for us to provide specific guidance and forecast when we're trying to predict what's going on with our demand and what's going on with our execution. I think today we have a significant overlay of dynamism in the economy broadly. And I think we want to be careful about being too specific in any of our projections as a result of that. Sure. Well, I think we'll definitely have to talk about Q1. I mean, in Q1, I would say it was for the most part, just kind of continually -- it looked like the industry environment was deteriorating throughout is I think probably the simplest way to characterize that. And again, disentangling how much of that was affordability, how much of that was just general consumer confidence or interest rates is very, very hard. But I think just looking at auto sales across the industry and looking at auto sales of peers, it looked like it was deteriorating throughout the quarter. And I think it's very, very early in Q2, so I don't think we're going to provide too specific of a view there. But I do think that from the time that we last spoke and had our last earnings call, things clearly continued to deteriorate from an industry perspective. Now, we do think that's transitory. There's a question of duration. But this industry is a $40 million transaction industry. It's been that way for a very long time. If you kind of zoom out over any reasonable period of time, that's what it averages and kind of that -- those transactions come from the fact that there's 27 million cars on the road and consumers trade with each other once every 6.75 [ph] years, and that's kind of the math that works out. In a moment like this, it gets very easy for many people to kind of put off the decision to purchase a car for many possible underlying reasons. And so historically, you can see car sales slow for a period and generally, that generates pent-up demand. And it alleviates relatively quickly. I think we do have extra dynamics going on right now. We have inflation. We have reduced new car production. We have car prices that are massively outpacing inflation in terms of price increases. So I think it's hard to know exactly how those forces will all play out in the near-term. I think from our perspective, we made this comment in prepared remarks, the most important thing we can do is continue to build towards the structural opportunity that sits in front of us, which is this 40 million opportunity and continue to make gains as a company and then just position ourselves to be resilient to whatever the macro economy brings us, and we think capital is a big part of that, and we think we've positioned ourselves well for whatever that does bring. Sorry. So yes, so on the retail cost side. So, I mean, I do think Omicron had very acute effects, for example, on the reconditioning centers and we are moving further away from that. So I think that's beneficial other things being equal. We definitely have been seeing improvements in the logistics network versus the most disruptive points. So I think that's beneficial other things being equal. So I would say we are seeing some positive data there. Sure. So I think -- I guess these are a bit difficult to disentangle. But from a logistics perspective, for example, we have made some gains. We're -- if we kind of look at where we were a year ago and then compare ourselves to the peak, depending on what metric you're looking at, we've maybe made kind of half the gains back to where we would like to be if we were in the same spot as we were a year ago. And then we've got to go from there. So I think there have been some benefits that are specific to Carvana that we believe are driving some benefit. And then we also do believe that we are growing market share. And so as long as even kind of the rate of industry-wide sales shrinking reduces all else constant, that should be positive for us as long as we continue to execute on our side. So I think, like I said, it's very early in the quarter. We don't want to talk too much about it, but I think there have been some at least operational gains that we are making, and they are likely having a positive impact. Sure. I would say all else constant, there's no question that increasing interest rates negatively impacts demand, and it's something that we try to make sure that we're measuring carefully all the time inside the company. I think the other thing that's true is that benchmark rates go up and as risk spreads go up, the rest of the market also raises interest rates. And so from a kind of competitive option perspective, consumer options just in general kind of go up. And so I think that there is kind of this term that's often used that we've used in the past as well that interest rates are somewhat sticky where when they're going up, it's sometimes difficult to pass all of the increases on to customers instantly in a way that is economically optimal. It just tends to take a little bit longer because different groups do take different views and it takes a little bit of time to adjust. But generally, that adjustment period is not super long, and then the same is true on the other side as well. So I think undoubtedly, we would expect to see more demand if we were not raising interest rates with the environment, but I think that, that would be \u2013 the rest of the market is also raising interest with the environment. And so I think that -- we are not seeing the same impacts that we would see if we were raising interest rates by ourselves out the market raising interest rates alongside us. Sure. Well, first of all, Project Catapult the internal term that we use for the project that's running across all of our different operational groups right now. So that was a little bit of an internal call out to our teams. There's a lot going on across \u2013 across every single operational team. There are very clear goals and very clear metrics and a cadence of kind of catching up and accountability to make sure that we can gain as quickly as we possibly can. And we really are excited internally about using this as an opportunity to make gains that are hard to make in moments where you have as much pressure as we've had on average from growth. So I think there are many, many different subcomponents to that plan, and it does cross every operational team and several product teams as well. So I don't even really know where to begin, but I would say that the overall theme is called the catapult and put ourselves in a spot where we're really ready to efficiently grow when the market supports us and where we get gains in the near-term in all these areas where we know we can be better, and we finally have an opportunity to focus on it. So that's the general theme. Yeah, I think efficiency is kind of lower cost and simpler to scale up. And so I think it's the pursuit of efficiencies across all of our different operational teams. Sorry, that was your question. Yes. So, we are working on these projects that I discussed to find efficiencies across the business. That extends to every operating team, and all those constant, we do expect that to reduce variable costs. Sure. So I think you maybe separate that into two. So, one is the addition of equity. And I think that, that was driven by giving us more flexibility as discussed earlier. We do think our opportunity is enormous. We think the market around us has moved a little bit. We think that suggests that we should put ourselves into a position where we can operate as flexibly as possible to take full advantage of the opportunity that we've got. And so I think that's an addition. And then, I think in the capital structure, we evaluated a lot of different possible solutions and evaluated those through a lot of different lenses, cost efficiency, flexibility, pre-payability and came down with this being the right capital structure. So I think there are a bunch of considerations there. Well, that's a very hard question. So let's start with maybe the discrepancy. I think the discrepancy could be partially in timing and then it could also be the gap between wholesale markets and retail markets. So, we definitely saw car prices -- let's start with wholesale pricing. We definitely saw wholesale prices kind of move up in the end of last year and into early this year. And then more recently, we've seen wholesale prices kind of start to fall back a bit. But I think when you're comparing quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. It just kind of depends on the blend of where car prices were across the sum of that period. And so, I think maybe some of those discrepancies could just be a function of what different periods you're looking at and what different companies you're looking at. I think generally speaking, retail prices have been lagging wholesale prices. And generally speaking, they moved down a little bit more smoothly or up a little bit more smoothly. The way that a large portion of the market operates is that cars are kind of purchased at a point in time and then they're financed on a floor plan and they're kind of sold cost plus for lack of a kind of more complicated description. There's a lot more that goes into, I think, that's a good first order way to think about it. And so oftentimes, if wholesale prices drop, it's not necessarily clear that retail prices will immediately follow, because many of the cars that are sitting on dealer lots were bought in the previous period, and there's debt against those cars at a price that was prevailing price to that previous period and often times, dealers are not in a position to take loss on those cars or choose not to take a loss on those cars, and say, I'll just prices longer and then sell them at a higher price. So you tend to see a little bit more stability in retail prices. Those -- I started with kind of the historical prices and then moved on to the dynamics and what can sometimes create a gap between wholesale and retail. As far as where it goes from here, I think the simple answer is, I certainly don't know. I think today, depending on what kind of bucket of used car prices you're looking at, many cars are 40% more expensive than a year ago, whereas economy-wide, inflation is closer to 8%. So relative to other goods, cars are more expensive today than they have historically been. You would -- or I guess, I would at least expect that over a medium period of time, cars will likely kind of have the same relationship to other goods that they've historically had. And so that would mean either more inflation or car prices will come down at some point. And then I think probably the single biggest input to car prices today and the single biggest input to a lot of the unique dynamics that are happening across the new car market and the used car market is just new car production levels, which are obviously much lower than they've historically been. And so I think that it's hard to figure out how all that's going to balance out. And I think we'll be paying very close attention trying to do the best job we can to predict it and trying to manage the business in a way that's resilient to whatever direction those things could move. But I don't think we're confident in precisely how it will work out. I will say our hope is that car prices come down. I think all else constant, you would -- we would certainly prefer car prices to come down. I think in transition, there's a chance that, that would provide something of a headwind to retail GPU. I also think because of the dynamics discussed with kind of the gap between the wholesale market and the retail market, it's not obvious that headwind would be as strong as it might look. And if you saw wholesale prices move down and then also would clearly be a benefit to our customers if car prices were lower, and that would probably play a big part in returning the industry to normal, which would cause kind of the industry dynamics to reverse from what's been a headwind recently to a tailwind, which we think would be great for the business. So I think our hope is the car prices to go down. I think we would like to stay away from trying to precisely call it. I mean, I think if we're going with one to 10, I think 10 would have to be everything is low and competition gives up and consumers are excited, I think, that competes. That would be 10. I think moving off of that idea, I think, the most important thing is cars that people can afford because of the sum of vehicle prices and interest rates, which the vast majority of consumers are financing their purchases. And so affordability for them is kind of the intersection of -- or the combination of both car prices and interest rates. And then I just think stability. We feel like we've got an enormous opportunity, and we want to build into that opportunity. But building into that opportunity as efficiently as possible is made easier if we have clear visibility into what the future holds. And so if we had more stability in the market, I think that would be easier for us to just kind of stably grow and to be able to rely on what the market's going to do around us. And I think we care more about that probably than levels of either rates or prices but certainly would love for affordability to get better for our customers as well. Sure. So what I would say on that is, I think, as I said, across the board, we build our plans out in advance. And then something that we've learned to do over time is be careful about yanking wheel too much too quickly because generally, you regret it when you do. And I think when we talk about marketing, in particular, we still remain a relatively young brand that's building a lot of awareness. And we think that there's a lot of value in continuing to build awareness and understanding of what we do and trust in what we do. And we also think that all times, marketing is something that has a potentially long payoff. I think a lot of times, marketing dollars are thought of as kind of a direct investment where dollar goes in and a sale comes out. But the truth is a lot of what you're doing with marketing is getting impressions on people and communicating what you do and how you do it, and those impressions add up and you build a brand with that and the payoff of marketing can be long. And so we will look to make moves that we think are intelligent across the board across time as we're managing the business, but we also try to be careful to not yank the wheel too much. So that's part of what you're seeing. Sure. So I think the similar way to probably think about that is just customers with higher FICOs are different customers than customers with lower FICOs. And so the interest rate spread that matters there is the spread between their rates and their funding costs. And on other customers, their rate and their funding costs. And so I think what matters is keeping the spread between those two things in a place that you can monetize in a consistent way. I think what happened in the quarter that is unique, the mix shift effects don't matter all that much because the spreads are kind of priced in, in a way that is thoughtful and the mix shifts don't matter too much. What happened in the quarter is when we originate a loan, we have an interest rate that we show to a customer and there's an expectation of the underlying funding cost. And then if the actual funding cost ends up being different than that expectation because either benchmarks or risk premiums or expected losses move between the moment of origination and the moment of sale then that ends up being a headwind. And so what we saw, obviously, was pretty dramatic in straight moves. I believe it's the most dramatic benchmarks have moved since the great financial crisis, and that had an impact. But I think that, we're -- if you look at the actual rates that were charged to customers at any point in time and the expected funding costs throughout the quarter, we're originating loans in a very similar spot to where we were previously. Sure. So I think, in the near term, our goal is, kind of, as outlined earlier on the call. We want to do everything we can to improve the operational constraints that we think are constricting sales that we can show customers more cars and drive sales up. And then, we're working hard to drive as much cost efficiency as we possibly can, and we'll see how that all kind of plays out. On the ADESA side, ADESA currently has facility capacity for approximately 200,000 cars per year, a little over 200,000 cars per year. And so, that kind of already exists in these sites. And then, over time, we'll be making the investments to be able to ramp up that facility capacity to the 2 million that we that we outlined earlier and in our deck. The actual utilization is far below the capacity they have. And so, there's an ability for us to hire and train and unlock more of that capacity, but there are steps between where we are in doing that. But the facilities exist and are ready to go, but there's still a need for hiring and training to unlock the 2K-plus. And then, just would reiterate again, I think, we put our shareholder letter kind of our footprint and the ADESA footprint. And I really think that that's a powerful page to take a look at, because it's -- if you look at our footprint today and you look at where our reconditioning centers are and you think about this through the lens of the logistics constraints that we've seen over the last four or five months, you can really see how that works, right? We're buying cars nationwide, and we're shipping a lot of those cars to middle of the country to get reconditioned and we ship them all the way back out to customers. And when you kind of look at that ADESA footprint and you overlay it on the map, you can see how all of those kind of inbound and outbound transport legs really reduced. And to kind of maximally get advantage of our business model, our logistics network, it does require a coordination between where cars are produced and logistics network and where cars are purchased. And we think that this gives us an incredible opportunity to coordinate that much better, much more tightly and with lower distances and times sitting between cars and customers. So we're obviously really excited about that, and we'll look to gain the benefits from that as quickly as we can. Thank you. Great. Well, thank you, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. To everyone on team Carvana, let's really take advantage of the opportunity. We've talked about it a lot internally, but this is an opportunity that we have. And if we take advantage of it, we're going to look back on it very fondly. And I think there's a huge chance that we can make this into a big positive. So let's do that. I appreciate everything you guys do, appreciate your taking the time to listen to the call, and we'll talk to you again next quarter. Thanks."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Carvana continued to gain market share in Q1, but several external and internal factors impacted our financial results. Some of these impact the used vehicle industry as a whole, such as Omicron, used vehicle prices, interest rates and other macroeconomic factors and others were more specific to Carvana such as reconditioning and logistics network disruptions. The impact of these factors on retail units sold volume was the primary driver of our results in Q1. We generally prepare for sales volume 6 to 12 months in advance, meaning we built capacity in most of our business functions for significantly more volume than we fulfilled in Q1. With our costs relatively fixed in the short term, the lower retail unit volume led to higher cost of goods sold per unit and higher SG&A per unit. These effects, combined with rapidly rising interest rates and widening credit spreads to lead to lower EBITDA margin. In Q1, retail units sold totaled 105,185, an increase of 14%. Total revenue was $3.497 billion, an increase of 56%. Total gross profit per unit in Q1 was $2,833 a decrease of $823 year-over-year. This total gross profit included a $76 per unit impact from Ernie's 1 million Unit Milestone Gift to Carvana employees. Retail GPU was $808 in Q1, a decrease of $403. Retail GPU was impacted by a more than $600 per unit increase in reconditioning and inbound transport costs relative to the prior year and a more than $100 per unit decrease in shipping revenue, driven by refunds to customers following extended delivery times. Retail cost increases in Q1 were primarily due to inefficiencies in the inspection and reconditioning centers and logistics network, which in turn were driven by Omicron, severe weather events and the extended time lines required to recover from these events, and due to lower retail units sold volume, which increased per unit cost. We believe the factors impacting Q1 were transitory, and we expect to see retail costs move toward more normalized levels over the coming quarters as our logistics network normalizes, and our expense levels are better balanced with sales volumes. Wholesale GPU was $219 in Q1, a decrease of $8, driven by higher volume, offset by lower profit per unit. Other GPU was $1,806 in Q1, a decrease of $412. Year-over-year changes in other GPU were primarily driven by higher benchmark interest rates at the time of loan sale relative to origination interest rates and widening of credit spreads following the onset of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, partially offset by the impact of higher industry-wide used vehicle prices on average loan size. Looking sequentially, the rapid rise in benchmark interest rates and widening credit spreads had a significant impact from the spread between funding costs and origination interest rates in Q1 versus Q4. This increase in spread had a more than $600 impact on other GPU in Q1. We expect this spread to move toward more normalized levels over the coming quarters. The same factors that impacted retail units sold and total GPU also impacted EBITDA margin in Q1. EBITDA margin was minus 11.6%, a decrease from minus 1.3%. EBITDA margin included a 0.8% negative impact from Ernie's 1 million Unit Milestone Gift to Carvana employees. While we faced a uniquely difficult environment in the first quarter, we are already seeing positive trends across our key metrics, and we expect meaningful sequential improvement in Q2 versus Q1 in retail units sold, revenue, total GPU, SG&A per retail unit sold and EBITDA margin. In our last shareholder letter, we provided an expectation that we would achieve over 4,000 GPU and approximately EBITDA breakeven in the last three quarters of 2022 taken in aggregate. We now expect to return to over 4,000 GPU and positive EBITDA to be pushed back a few quarters and then to resume our march toward our long-term financial model. We are on track to close our acquisition of ADESA U.S. in May and are excited about the role that ADESA U.S. will play in our path toward our long-term goals. The ADESA U.S. footprint includes 56 sites with approximately 6.5 million square feet of buildings on more than 4,000 acres. We expect to be able to build approximately two million units of annual reconditioning capacity in these locations, while still operating ADESA U.S.'s wholesale auction business. This is the equivalent of approximately 30 greenfield Carvana IRC locations in terms of the production volume that we expect to unlock over time. Adding the ADESA U.S. footprint will dramatically improve our logistics network over time. With the addition of these locations, we will eventually have reconditioned inventory within 50 miles of 58% of the US population and within 200 miles of 94%. This will have the benefit of reducing shipping distances, times and costs, accelerating us to our long-term financial model. We expect the ADESA U.S. purchase price to be financed primarily with $2.275 billion in unsecured notes. In addition, we expect to raise an additional $1 billion in preferred equity and $1 billion in common equity for future real estate improvements on the ADESA U.S. sites and for general corporate purposes. These financing transactions will place us in our strongest total liquidity resources and production capacity position ever, giving us a strong foundation for profitable growth and significant flexibility to execute our plan. On March 31, we had approximately $1.7 billion in total liquidity resources, including cash, revolving availability and financeable real estate and securities. In total, we expect the transactions to generate approximately $1.9 billion of net cash proceeds after payment of the ADESA U.S. purchase price and more than $900 million of financeable real estate, bringing our total liquidity resources to approximately $4.5 billion pro forma for the transactions. In addition, we estimate that the ADESA U.S. locations have approximately 200,000 units of facility capacity that is available for use with limited incremental site improvements. Mining our own IRCs with these ADESA U.S. locations, we expect total annual capacity at full utilization to be approximately 1.4 million units by the end of 2022. We are excited to join forces with the ADESA U.S. team on the path toward our long-term goals of buying and selling millions of cars per year and becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. Hey, John. Sure. So, yes, I think we have announced our plans for financing the ADESA purchase as well as future real estate improvements on the ADESA site and additional funds for general corporate purposes. We expect that to take the form of $2.275 billion in unsecured notes, $1 billion of preferred equity and $1 billion of common equity. I think the specific terms on that, we'll discuss in the coming days. But I think that's the basic transaction structure. I think we feel really great about that transaction structure. I think it gives us a lot of flexibility to execute our plan. I think we feel really great about the trajectory that we're on. We feel really great about joining forces with ADESA U.S. and all the benefits that, that brings to our core business. And so, yes, I think we feel grateful about the acquisition and the financing structure. And then in terms of some of your questions on specifics on the securities, I think, we'll talk more about that in the coming days. In terms of CapEx, one of the nice benefits of the ADESA acquisition is, we do expect it to meaningfully reduce our quarterly CapEx outflows from the levels that over the past several quarters. And the reason for that is we have been spending a significant amount through 2021 and early 2022 on building out our own Carvana greenfield IRCs. That's been a meaningful use of capital expenditures for us. Now with the ADESA locations online, we do expect to be outlaying meaningfully less CapEx on certainly Carvana greenfield IRCs and then in general. So I think that's the directional guidance that I would give there. Sure. So, I mean, I think we have talked a little bit about other GPU. I think we had a strong year on other GPU in 2021. We do think there was tailwinds to our other GPU in 2021 that came from elevated industry-wide used vehicle prices, because basically, the way that, that works is, the higher used vehicle prices lead to higher average loan sizes, which leads to higher other GPU, other things being equal. We sized that about $150 per unit. And then I think the other point that I would make on other GPU is, we see significant opportunities in front of us to expand other GPU from a fundamental perspective off of what we've seen historically. I think that takes the form of fundamental improvements in the finance platform, other fundamental improvements in ancillary products, including existing and new ancillary products. So, I think overall, we feel like we built a business to generate very significant other revenues and very significant other GPU over time. I think Q1 was certainly an outlier, not representative at all of what we would expect to see on a normalized basis. No, you're good. So, what I would say is I think the way that we've chosen to structure this purchase and the capital that we're raising is aimed at giving us maximum flexibility. It dramatically enhances our liquidity position. I think it does give us a lot of flexibility in the future to do interesting things. Undoubtedly, this quarter is not what we were planning for. We both hit in our prepared remarks. It's in the shareholder letter. We do plan for growth six to 12 months in advance. The world looks very different six, 12 months ago. And so we built for a different environment than we find ourselves in today that had costs. Those show up in the results that we're reporting. And now we're starting from a worst place when we would have liked to start. And so I think for the remainder of this year, we have to kind of dig out of that hole a little bit. So, that also generates rationale for a little bit of additional cushion. And then obviously, the macro backdrop is uncertain. And I think that extends to the broader macro economy and also to the way the auto industry is going to evolve from here. There are some pretty unique things happening in the auto industry these days that I at least haven't seen in my career. And so, we think that, given the opportunity that we've got, the size of that opportunity, the strength of which our customers have responded to our offering over the last nine years, the market share that we've seen continually growing across our markets, the continued market share growth that we've seen, the addition of ADESA and the ability for us to build into that opportunity. We just want to make sure that we position ourselves very well to ride out whatever storm may or may not come. And so, I think that this structure gives us the ability to do that. It gives us the ability to continue to run our play. And that's what we're going to do, because we think the opportunity is absolutely massive. Sure. So on the construction improvements to the ADESA locations, there's nothing changed there. So we still expect to invest approximately $1 million over a period of multiple years in the ADESA locations in order to move them from what we estimate is about 200,000 infrastructure capacity today, if fully staffed from an annual retail reconditioning perspective up to 2 million annual units of production capacity at full utilization when fully staffed, which is our goal for the ADESA locations. So that is exactly the same as we've always thought about it. I think we do plan to fill out the locations. We expect that to cost about $1 billion over a period of multiple years. In terms of the additional capital, I mean, I think the way we're thinking about that is, we have a very big opportunity as a company. I think we're extremely excited about the opportunity in front of us to take meaningful market share to drive strong unit economics, to take advantage of the ADESA acquisition, to get additional reconditioning capacity closer to more customers to improve customer experience and fast speed delivery times, take advantage of the logistics network benefits that come from having a more broadly distributed footprint.  And so, I think we decided to raise that additional capital just to allow us to completely focus on that goal building toward our long-term model and to stop having conversations about liquidity and what happens in a deep recession and a prolonged recession and all those sorts of things. So, I think we feel really good about the transaction structure that we've put together. I think we feel great about the ADESA acquisition and the overall trajectory that, that places us on. Sure. So what I would say is, at a high level, those kinds of metrics remain the same or kind of even more severe, where those with higher incomes have outgrown those with lower incomes by even more recently. So, I think this kind of theme of affordability has continued to get stronger over the last several months. So, whether you're looking at that in income, in credit, we provided the statistic with customer builder 700 FICO or an age. I think that basically shows up anywhere.  So that is clearly something that is very active in terms of what's going on in the auto industry today. Those with higher incomes and better credit are still buying cars at much higher levels than those with lower incomes and lower credit in this environment. I think it's hard to disentangle the stimulus. There were several different ways of stimulus last year and the year before and it's hard for us to precisely disentangle that. Clearly, that is something we're comping over. Last year, it was tax season here as a little bit of stimulus story thereafter.  And this year, tax season, in general, I would say was much softer in terms of impact than tax seasons historically have been. I think it's hard to disentangle the kind of comping stimulus effect from the affordability issues and the general consumer confidence and just kind of socioeconomic issues and everything going on in the world. But clearly, it all played something of a role."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note that this event is being recorded today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meg Kehan with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMeg Kehan: Thanks, Joe. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on Carvana's fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings conference call. Please note that this call will be simultaneously webcast on the Investor Relations section of the Company's corporate website at investors.carvana.com. The fourth quarter shareholder letter is also posted on the IR website. Additionally, we posted set of supplemental financial tables for Q4, which can be found on the Events and Presentations page of our IR website. Joining me on the call today are Ernie Garcia, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Jenkins, Chief Financial Officer. Before we start, I would like to remind you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to Carvana's market opportunities and future financial results that involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed here. A detailed discussion of the material factors that cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements can be found in the Risk Factors section of Carvana's most recent Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements and risks in this conference call are based upon current expectations as of today, and Carvana assumes no obligation to update or revise them whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Our commentary today will include non-GAAP financial metrics. Unless otherwise specified, all references to GPU and SG&A will be to the non-GAAP metrics and all references to EBITDA will be to adjusted EBITDA. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our shareholder letter issued today, a copy of which can be found on our IR website. And with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thanks, Meg, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. 2023 was an exceptional year for Carvana. It was our best year from a financial perspective by a long way. Full-year, GPU was nearly $1,000 better than our previous best in 2021. Our full-year adjusted EBITDA per unit was over $900 higher than our previous best, and we have clear visibility to further improvements, as you can see in our outlook. The last two years have been initially characterized as negative for Carvana. In early 2022, we took a quick trip from a company that was perceived to be able to do a little wrong to one that was perceived to be able to do little right. That wasn't a fun transition for anyone. In each of our letters since we went public in 2017, we have signed off with the march continues. The reason is because we believe this statement is a simple reduction of a massively important and generally underappreciated principle. Getting up again and again and relentlessly pushing forward is part of every success story, but that tenacity is easy to claim and hard to achieve. It's hard because the moments when you have to get back up again, feel very different in the moment than when they are imagined. They feel different for every stakeholder and most importantly, they feel different for every member of the team. I will never know exactly we did right to attract the team that we have, but that combination of things, which undoubtedly includes elements of luck, is almost certainly the most important thing we have ever done as a company. It's very hard for a group to go through a period like the last two years and not to disintegrate under the pressure. We didn't disintegrate. We thought, we came together and we got better. The fact that we got better creates room for the last two years to be recharacterized in the future. Time will ultimately pass judgment on the impact of the last two years on the Carvana story. But my personal take is that it's been our proudest period and that when the story is written, this period and our team's response will be viewed very favorably. To the Carvana team, there is nothing we can say in words that will convey the gratitude we have for the fight you've always put up, but I hope you know it's real. Thank you. While the success of 2023 deserves a moment of reflection, the truth is we still have a lot of marching to do. Our goals are big. From here, the key questions are this. Where are we? Where are we going? And how are we going to get there? First, where are we? Today, Carvana sits in the strongest position we have ever been in for five reasons. I would ask that you come back to this and evaluate each element for yourself. Number one, our customers love the experiences we deliver. And as we execute these experiences are getting even better. Number two, the financial power of our business model is becoming clear every quarter and is highly differentiated across every line item of our income statement, there remain many significant opportunities for additional improvement. We plan to get them. Number three, our infrastructure is simply unmatched. We have built a vertically-integrated machine with 6,500 acres of land and over 500,000 parking spots that scalably and cost effectively gets cars from one customer to another more efficiently than any other machine that serves the same purpose. Number four, competitively, we have never had more separation as we continue to execute, that gap is getting bigger. And number five, we compete in a $1 trillion market, and we currently have approximately 1% market share. The potential is obvious. So where are we going? From the early days of Carvana, we have never flinched in our goals. They have been and remain to become the largest and most profitable automotive retailer and to buy and sell millions of cars per year. And finally, how are we going to get there? We are going to continue to march. We are still an ambitious group with big dreams and hustle. We will keep sprinting in our goals to drive as much positive changes as we can as quickly as possible as we always have. We are also a group that is constantly learning. Every stage in Carvana's journey teaches us new lessons and adds to our toolkit. As long as that is true, and as long as we always get back up, our best day is always today. The march continues, Mark.\nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our fourth quarter highlighted the significant and sustainable progress we have made on our path to profitability. We set company records for fourth quarter and full-year total GPU and adjusted EBITDA, completing a year in which we improved adjusted EBITDA by nearly $1.4 billion and positioning us well for further adjusted EBITDA growth in 2024. As part of our earnings materials this quarter, we provide a detailed look at our fourth quarter and full-year results. I'll start by summarizing three key takeaways. First, our FY2023 results and Q1 2024 outlook resoundingly demonstrate the ability of our online sales model to generate significant adjusted EBITDA. Based on our Q1 outlook, we expect to generate significantly above $100 million of adjusted EBITDA, equating to significantly above $1,200 per retail unit sold. Despite declining used vehicle prices, industry volumes that remain below pre-pandemic levels and sizable costs of carrying capacity for future growth. Second, we are now beginning to demonstrate record adjusted EBITDA profitability while also showing early signs of growth. Based on industry data sources, we gained market share on a sequential basis in Q4 and our outlook calls for retail unit growth not only on a sequential basis, but also on a year-over-year basis in Q1 and in full-year 2024. Third, we have a unique and powerful infrastructure for significantly and efficiently scaling retail unit volume with excess capacity in our existing footprint to support multiples of profitable growth. We expect this growth to be paired with significant operating leverage as we leverage our underutilized overhead costs. Moving now to our fourth quarter results. As we previously discussed, our long-term financial goal is to generate significant GAAP net income and free cash flow. In service of this goal, our management team remains focused on driving progress on a set of key non-GAAP financial metrics that are inputs into this long-term goal, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP SG&A expense and adjusted EBITDA. Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our remaining remarks on sequential changes in these metrics. Retail units sold declined by 6% sequentially, in line with our outlook and better than the industry on a sequential basis. Total revenue was $2.424 billion, a decrease of 13% sequentially. In the fourth quarter, non-GAAP total GPU was $5,730, a sequential decrease of $666 driven primarily by the absence of non-recurring benefits, which positively impacted Q3 and seasonality. Non-GAAP retail GPU $2,970 in Q4 versus $2,877 in Q3, a new company record. Our strength in retail GPU came despite higher-than-normal fourth quarter depreciation and continues to be driven by fundamental gains in non-vehicle cost of sales, customer sourcing, inventory turn times and revenues from additional services, highlighting the value of our vertically-integrated business model. We expect non-GAAP retail GPU in Q1 to be similar to Q4, with the potential for upside. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $881 in Q4 versus $951 in Q3. Sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by fourth quarter seasonality. We expect a sequential increase in wholesale GPU in Q1. Non-GAAP other GPU was $1,879 in Q4 versus $2,568 in Q3. Sequential changes in other GPU were primarily driven by selling a lower volume of loans in Q4 relative to retail units sold that in Q3, as well as lower premium on loan sales resulting from higher industry-wide loss expectations that we have since passed through to our pricing. We expect a sequential increase in other GPU in Q1. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $376 million in Q4 versus $370 million in Q3. Sequential changes in non-GAAP SG&A expense were primarily driven by the absence of a small non-recurring benefit that impacted Q3 and small incremental expenses in Q4. Finally, adjusted EBITDA was $60 million in Q4, a new fourth quarter company record. I'll turn now to our first quarter outlook. While the macroeconomic and industry environment continues to be uncertain, looking toward the first quarter of 2024, we expect the following as long as the environment remains stable. One, we expect retail units sold slightly up on a year-over-year basis; and two, we expect adjusted EBITDA significantly above $100 million. Our confidence about driving significantly above $100 million of adjusted EBITDA is driven by our results so far this quarter. This outlook does not anticipate any material one-time benefits or costs in Q1. For FY2024, we expect to grow retail units sold and adjusted EBITDA compared to FY2023. We are excited about the path we are on, and we look forward to making continued progress toward our goal of becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will take our first question, which will come from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nSharon Zackfia: Hey, good afternoon. I guess a couple of questions. As you think about \u2013 I mean, I'm going to ask a question about the quarter and then something longer term. But on the quarter itself, when you're coming up with that slightly above year-over-year units sold, what are you kind of assuming for tax refund season? Because you've got the bulk of the quarter ahead of you. And I'm curious as well kind of the credit tightening that you did and the rate increases when that happened and kind of how you're factoring that into any kind of curtailment that we might see in trends from here?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I don't think we're making any unique assumptions about tax season. I think most of the information is out there, if you read it, is that tax season probably started a little slower, less money went out as a result of the timing of the holidays, but I think there's an expectation that probably tax season will be pretty strong this year and average refunds will probably be a bit larger. Really kind of the first chunk of significant money, we believe, hit yesterday and last night. And I think our assumption is driving kind of our outlook for Q1 is just anything roughly normal. I don't think we're making super aggressive assumptions there. So I don't think there's anything super notable to discuss. And then as it relates to credit tightening, I think we rolled a lot of that out over the last six months. We've rolled more of that out even more recently. And so I think that's largely \u2013 or that is completely taken into account in our outlook as well.\nSharon Zackfia: Okay. And then, Ernie, you're kind of nicely within your long-term gross margin targets. I know you're going to say there's more you can do on gross profit per car. But is this a point where if we look at the next three to five years, we're looking at more of the SG&A leverage as the driver of margin? Or do you think that 15% to 19% gross margin target is now potentially different than what you thought a few years ago?\nErnie Garcia: I think you know what I'm going to say, but I'm going to say it anyway. I think our view is there's opportunity everywhere, I think a useful way to break it down is kind of variable expenses and fixed expenses. I think fixed expenses, roughly the way we're managing that today is holding that in the range, and we expect that to lever as we turn to growth. And then I think in variable expenses, we still absolutely believe that there are gains to be had. I think the teams have been doing an incredible job. I think if you look at the trajectory of those numbers, it's very strong. And I think we're excited about a lot of initiatives that we still have left. I think in many of those areas, prioritizing those initiatives is still one of our bigger issues internally and just making sure that we're doing one thing at a time and not trying to take on too much at any given time. I think from a gross profit per unit perspective, there's also opportunity there. And I think that's true in basically every line item. I would kind of probably characterize those as fundamental opportunities, meaning regardless of where we choose to price things like rates or the vehicle. We believe we can be more efficient in all those areas. And I think that those \u2013 that can take the form of continued enhancement in credit scoring and credit pricing, credit structuring and innovations that we've been recently rolling out internally that allow us to more precisely kind of connect our credit pricing structuring and risk assessment to individual loans. It can take the form of getting smarter about how we're buying cars, the data that we're in taking to evaluate the value of those cars, a number of things that we're doing at the point of receipt of the cars to make sure that we're cutting out the biggest losers. So I think there's a number of initiatives there as well that are pretty exciting. And then I think we remain in this period of trying to make sure that we're driving efficiencies. And I think despite that, we're obviously looking forward to a very strong Q1 from both a financial perspective and from showing a little bit of growth for the first time in a while. So overall, I think we are just very excited about the way the team has responded in the last couple of years. I think it was pretty hard to imagine from the perspective of two years ago where we're sitting today. I think it was hard to imagine the perspective of a year ago where we're sitting today. And I think that we feel like we've got a lot of room to continue to make improvements, and we look forward to continuing to make those improvements. So I think across the board, we're looking for fundamental gains.\nSharon Zackfia: All right. Thanks, and congrats on a great 2023.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, everybody. So you're guiding to substantially above $100 million for the first quarter, obviously, and that compares to a small loss \u2013 odd million EBITDA on your definition loss prior year. So I'm just \u2013 I'm not asking you to guide specifically for the rest of the year, but your comment of growing full-year EBITDA. I mean, you're already at $120 million or $130 million kind of ahead of that statement just with all what you see in the first quarter. So my question is, could you express the confidence that the remainder of the year you could at least grow EBITDA from Q2 to Q4? Of course, you don't have to answer the question. I just wanted to see if you're willing to go there.\nErnie Garcia: Yes. No. Well, I appreciate the question. I appreciate you handing us out at the end of it. But I think, we got to stick with our guidance. We want to make sure that we stay disciplined on that. We are extremely excited about where we are. I think the trends of the business are very, very strong. I think we obviously had a great 2023 from an EBITDA perspective, but the trends that kind of underline the sum of the year were also very positive and those trends remain, and that's what we see heading into Q1. And I think now the balls in our hand, and we just got to go execute. And if we keep executing, I think there's pretty exciting things in front of us, but we got to go, make those things happen, and we'll continue to update you every quarter.\nAdam Jonas: Okay. Well, Ernie, I appreciate that. I'll interpret that as you're not giving me any \u2013 you're not calling out any reason why you wouldn't be able to grow EBITDA in the remainder of the year, even though you're not giving a formal guide. That's just my interpretation of that. You would call something out if you felt there was something beyond the quarter that you felt was prudent to call out of the headwind, just my interpretation.\nErnie Garcia: Well, if we comment on your interpretation, then I mean this starts to get really \u2013 or really fast. I think you've got your interpretation. We're going to keep marching, we're excited.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, Ernie.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nJohn Healy: Thank you. Ernie, I was hoping you could talk just a little bit about affordability. I would love to get your thoughts on where affordability sits today for your customer and the monthly payment that they're looking at. And theoretically, if we do get with the couple of cuts by the Fed, what would be the sweet spot for you guys? Is there a monthly payment you'd like to see where you'd say that would be the real sweet spot for us to be able to grow same-store sales and show a good margin? I just would love for you to kind of comment on the interest rate environment and what would be ideal for you guys.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, maybe we'll start with a couple sort of data points. So I think roughly speaking, if you \u2013 like inflation adjust car prices against all other goods just using CPI. Car prices themselves are probably still on the order of, give or take, 10% higher than other goods in the economy. So I think that suggests on a price level, there's potentially room for that to continue to moderate over time. I think if you look at monthly payments, which compound that and the moves in interest rates. Again, like high-level swag, monthly payments are probably on the order of more like 20% higher relative to other goods than they were pre-pandemic. So I think that also kind of points a little bit in the direction of room for moderation. But we'll see. I think so far, that model of post shortage, there's usually a glut and car prices should probably normalize relative to other goods. So far, that's been pretty predictive for the last two years. The speed is always hard, but that's at least kind of predicted the direction, I think that we're seeing a lot more new car incentives and aggressiveness right now, which probably points a little bit to more support for that kind of direction in the future, but that's a hard thing to get exactly right. I think, generally speaking, for us, probably lower is better. I'm not sure that there's a level that we're trying to get to. I think it makes cars more affordable for customers. It pulls more people back into the market. And generally speaking, as we've discussed in the past, I think we do exist \u2013 our business is sitting between the wholesale market and the retail market. And so what really matters for us is that spread. And we have kind of over the last two years, we've had kind of the expected case scenario, I would say, but also probably the best case scenario where you've seen depreciation, which made cars more affordable, but you also saw the wholesale market anticipate that depreciation and so margins have been pretty stable. I think if you look at our retail margins we've been near in the 2,800-plus area for the last three quarters, and we expect it to be in a similar spot to maybe even having upside in Q1. And so I think that, that suggests that despite the fact that this depreciation has been occurring and making cars more affordable for our customers, our margins have held in there and been pretty steady. And so overall, I think that's playing out the way that we would like for it to and probably the way that we should have expected it to.\nJohn Healy: Got it. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up. There's been some market chatter out there about you guys playing an active role in helping one of your former competitors liquidate. Can you talk about what that might mean for the business in Q1 or really how the economics of those units being moved might flow through the P&L for you guys?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. I can take that one. The simple answer is we don't expect any material impacts from acquiring units in bulk from competitors. We did acquire a portfolio of about 2,800 units in January from industry player that was selling their units. And so those 2,800 units, I'd expect us to sell them over the next couple of quarters. We did acquire the units in full. So those will be retail units sold when they sell, there'll be gross revenue and generate retail gross profit when they sell. But given the small size of the portfolio that we acquired, would not expect it to have a material impact on either retail units sold over the combination of the next couple of quarters, including Q1 or on retail GPU and either those quarters.\nJohn Healy: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Nick Jones with Citizens. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Jones: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I can. One, as we think about the blending of Phase 2 and 3 and maybe the algorithm for growth from here, is there a level of unit economics where you maybe start to hold and focus more topline growth? Or is the goal really to consistently drive kind of topline growth and unit economics as you kind of approach your long-term targets.\nErnie Garcia: I think the goal is to continually get better everywhere. I think we've benefited a bit in a way over the last two years from being able to kind of simplify our goals and focus just on improving efficiency throughout the business. And I think the primary form that benefit has taken is it just kind of simplified the number of moving pieces in the business and has allowed us to make a lot of progress really fast. That said, I do think that there remains a lot of room for improvement. And as we said earlier, I think one of the biggest issues we deal with internally is just trying to make sure that we're not trying to bite off kind of too many projects because there's still a lot of projects that are pretty exciting. So I think we will continue absolutely to work on projects that we expect to drive efficiency across both variable costs and gross profit. We also do expect as we kind of head into that transition to start to focus a little bit more on projects that are supportive of growth, and that's obviously exciting. I think given where the business model is, it's very clear how powerful that is to the financial model of the business. And we think we're incredibly well positioned for that. We think that the business is in the strongest place it's ever been. We think our customer offering is stronger than it's ever been. We think our infrastructure is ready to support this growth. We think the work that it takes to grow is meaningfully less than it's been in the past. I mean just even to throw some stats out there. Today, we're moving cars inbound to our inspection centers, approximately 20% fewer miles than we were a year ago. Outbound we're moving cars 30% fewer miles. That's because we've got more of these facilities, and we've integrated intelligently into our scheduling systems to make better choices there. On in-market ops, we're now pairing almost 50% of activities, which means when we deliver a car to a customer, on the way back, we are picking up another car to get more efficient. I think that's up 75% year-over-year as we put time and effort into building those systems to make them smarter. And building the scheduling systems to make it more likely that we see overlap. That gets better as we get more density in the network and there's still a lot of room to improve there across customer care. Our advocates are roughly twice as efficient as they were in the past in terms of number of sales per advocate per period. The same is true in title and registration with better performance metrics in that group that are now extremely high quality. So I think we're really well positioned to head into growth when it's time. And I think what we've got to do now as a company is we've got to figure out just how effectively we can manage that transition, how good of a job we can do maintaining the accountability that we had over the last couple of years by keeping things simple as we do head into a more complex optimization equation of both growth and efficiency. But the opportunity is everywhere. The question is how well we execute. The question is not where we're going. We have every intention of selling millions of cars. We've never been better positioned for it, and that is absolutely what we intend to do. But now we've got to figure out how quickly we can do it and how efficient we can be along the way.\nNicholas Jones: And maybe just a follow-up on that. I think you listed off kind of the four buckets you highlighted in your vertically-integrated technology-driven platform from the shareholder letter of the customer sourcing, inbound transport, inspection, reconditioning with [indiscernible] and delivery or do one of those stand out as one of the biggest drivers? And are there any of those whether it's kind of more wood to chop than others in terms of driving efficiency?\nMark Jenkins: I can take that one. So I actually think there's opportunities in all of those areas. I don't think we feel like we're done with any of those. I think we've hit on these types of things at various points, but clear opportunities in inbound transport as we expand the number of sites where we're doing reconditioning, which brings down inbound cost of inbound days on the inbound transport side. I think in the reconditioning centers, they've made tremendous gains, implementing new technology, new processes, standardizing processes across locations, rolling out our proprietary CARLI system across our nationwide infrastructure. That team is not done. That team still sees meaningful opportunity to further develop our technology, refine our processes and standardize and drive execution across our nationwide set of locations. I think in outbound transport, just like the others. It's the same story, pairing technology with process excellence. That's the area where the teams have been focused up to this point, made tremendous gains, and I think they're also looking at their business today, and saying, yes, we still see further opportunity to make gains. And then on the sourcing side, just like every other area. We've got teams that are working to every day pull in more data sources, every day, refine our algorithms \u2013 for putting the optimal valuation on every single car that we look at. And that's, I think, millions of cars that we see and are collecting data on every single day. So I think the main takeaway there is we've made tremendous gains, but the teams that are working on each of those areas see opportunities for meaningful gains from here.\nNicholas Jones: Thanks, Ernie. Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: And our next question will come from John Colantuoni with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First one on retail GPU. Mark mentioned revenue from additional services as one of the drivers of strong GPU in the quarter. Can you just detail what those additional services are and how much they're contributing to 4Q and 1Q GPU? And to the extent you could sort of comment on the sustainability of those additional services? And second, I've noticed sort of you\u2019ve recently started incorporating EBITDA per unit into your public documents. I'm curious if that's just a reflection of your greater operational focus on profitability or if that's sort of nudging people externally to start assessing business on that KPI more? Thanks.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes, I can take both of those. So let me start with retail GPU. So here I think the main idea is we have a unique business model that allows us to take cars that are reconditioned, acquired and stored around the country and make them available to customers in our 300 markets plus nationwide. And so for shorter distance shipments where customer finds a car that's perfect for them that's nearby to them. We have free shipping and in most of the markets we operate based on our data. We have the largest availability of free shipping inventory in those markets, the ones that we have looked at. However, for larger shipments, we've been \u2013 we do use the opportunity of making that selection available to also generate additional revenue, just from long distance, the shipping services provided to customers. And so I think that's where the additional revenue from additional services comes from. It\u2019s really from our ability to move cars long distances efficiently around the country and make much wider selection available to customers as a result of that. Now in terms of how it flows through to retail GPU, that's actually been fairly steady, I would say, over the last three or four quarters. It really hasn't been moving around much sequentially, maybe up or down a little bit, but nothing that's worth calling out. I think it's more when you compare to sort of our pre-pandemic model, we weren't generating as much revenue from having that nationwide logistics network as we are today. So that's the answer to question one. On question two, so in my prepared remarks, I mentioned the idea of being significantly above adjusted EBITDA per unit in Q1. And I think that my motivation for mentioning that was people for a long time they didn't believe just to say it candidly, that a vertically integrated e-commerce online sales model could work. And now we're sitting here in the first quarter of 2024. And I think we're very confidently saying we expect to drive significantly more than $100 million of adjusted EBITDA or significantly more than $1,200 per unit of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter. And we're also doing that in an environment where rates are at multi-decade highs, which I think makes it even a bit more impressive. We're doing it in an environment where the used vehicle industry as a whole is still notably down relative to pre-pandemic levels, which I think makes that adjusted EBITDA generation, even more impressive. Moreover, we're doing it while also carrying significant cost of excess capacity that we view as a huge benefit for us as we look forward because we're generating a lot of adjusted EBITDA now at a volume that is far below what our capacity can support from an overhead cost and fixed infrastructure perspective. And so I just think when you start layering all of those things on top of each other, it gets us very excited about where the model can go. I think it resoundingly answers the questions about whether or not this is a long-term profitable business model, whether or not this is a long-term sustainable business model. I think that's one of the things, as I mentioned, that I think we're just \u2013 we're feeling really good about and why I called out that one data point in my prepared remarks.\nErnie Garcia: Who doesn\u2019t love when Professor Jenkins takes the mic. Everyone in Carvana is celebrating right now.\nOperator: And our next question here will come from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks. Just want to follow-up on an earlier question, just thinking about the framework for retail GPU moving forward. So obviously, as you start to grow, there will be some costs associated with that growth. Very limited growth you're signaling for the first quarter in terms of retail units. But beyond that, as you really ramp, will the cost of growth outweigh all the efficiencies you continue to expect to get in 2024 within the retail GPU line?\nMark Jenkins: Yes. So let's focus in on incremental costs associated with growth in retail cost of sales. So I do think there are some costs associated with higher growth rates and retail cost of sales. I think some of them take the form of just direct hiring and training expenses as you're building up staffing, you're spending money on hiring, training new employees. I think a little bit of it takes the form of newer employees typically take a little time to get up to speed and become as efficient as more tenured employees. And so I think that can have a small impact. I think another dynamic is you may outsource more services for a period of time as you're ramping up. Now in our case, looking forward, I would not expect outsourcing more services to take the form of full car reconditioning by partners, which is something we did in 2021. Don't anticipate that. But on smaller services, on a select basis, I see [indiscernible] you could do that. So I give that detailed list just so you have a clear view of what we view as the some of the incremental costs associated with ramping and it's really those three buckets. Now let's talk a little bit about sizing. Putting all those together, we do not view those as being a particularly significant part of the overall retail GPU story. There are some offsets, for example, getting leverage on fixed facilities expenses in inspection and reconditioning centers, other fixed expenses in those centers. So that's a partial offset to some of the things that I mentioned. And so I think the main takeaway is there are some frictions. However, we do not expect them to be of a particularly large size, just based on the progress that we've made in improving our technology, improving our processes, having a broad base of existing inspection and reconditioning centers from which to build. And so that would be my full set of thoughts on that specific question.\nSeth Basham: All right. That's helpful. And as you work to acquire more inventory without wholesale purchases from the competitors, would you expect your pure metal margin to improve going forward?\nMark Jenkins: So I'm not sure I caught that question.\nSeth Basham: Just thinking about the other component within retail GPU, just your spread between what you're selling cars score and you're buying them for probably getting a nice benefit from some of the inventory you're acquiring [indiscernible] prices in the near term. Beyond the near term, would you expect continued expansion there?\nMark Jenkins: Got it. Yes. So I hit the point about the bulk part. We made a bulk purchase of vehicles from a competitor in January. We purchased about 2,800 units that we expect to sell the majority of over the next couple of quarters. We do not expect a material retail GPU impact from that. There could be some small impact. But just given the size of the portfolio, we do not expect a meaningful impact from that. On the question about metal margin more generally. I mean Ernie called this out early in the call, but with our outlook of being close to Q4 levels with upside or the potential for upside in Q1, that's going to be four consecutive quarters at a pretty substantial retail GPU level. So obviously, with four full quarters at a very strong level, we're feeling really good about the way that we're executing from a retail GPU perspective. We talked about a lot of the fundamentals that are driving that. We talked about \u2013 obviously, all the progress in the reconditioning centers. We're doing a great job sourcing cars for customers. We really normalize inventory turn times. We're generating revenue from additional services, taking advantage of our national logistics network. And so I think we obviously have established a very strong track record on retail GPU with our three final quarters of 2023 and our outlook for Q1.\nSeth Basham: Absolutely. Thank you.\nMark Jenkins: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRajat Gupta: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll take a couple as well. Just to follow-up on a couple of the previous questions around growth. It looks like you've obviously right-sized your cost structure to a large degree. You've comfortably exceeded your long-term model, at least on a gross profit per unit basis. And obviously, the margins look low because of where prices are. So why wouldn't the company press the pedal on growth here a little more meaningfully? Even if GPUs did come back somewhat and you're able to leverage fixed cost from your industry backdrop that's a factoring the decision or any other consideration? Are you just willing to go a little slowly and keep testing how the business is responding? Just curious on the thought process there, and I have a quick follow-up on the finance business.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, I think the first thing we want to do is we want to kind of complete the projects that we've got underway today. And I think we have a number of projects underway today that we expect to continue to drive efficiency. So I think we want to see that through. I think the reason we had to provide this frame earlier our goal is to sell millions of cars and to be the largest, most profitable automotive retailers because that's the place where we're heading. I think the question then is how fast are we going to get there. And I do think that there are reasons to believe that we should be able to grow at faster rates and be very efficient just given how much more efficient the business is today and the fact that infrastructure is sitting there to be filled in, but we have to go execute on that. And so I think we will always be in a rush to make as much progress as we possibly can. But we will try to be intelligent about how we transition between the goal of efficiency and the goal of growth. We think that there are still gains to be had in both areas. And that's why we're labeling that a transition period. The place where we're headed is clear, the speed that we're going to get there is less clear. And so as we start to make that transition, we'll keep giving you feedback to make it clear what we believe at any point in time.\nRajat Gupta: Got it. Okay. That's fair. And just on the finance business, I mean you undersold a couple of hundred million in the fourth quarter. And you noted in the shareholder letter that you don't expect any onetime benefits here in the first quarter either. So does that mean you're likely to run at this elevated level of receivables on the balance sheet from here on? And then what was driving that decision? Thanks.\nMark Jenkins: I can hit that. Yes. So I think the \u2013 I would say the \u2013 what we called out in the outlook is us being significantly above $100 million of adjusted EBITDA that doesn't anticipate any loan sales above originations. I think it's possible that we could oversell originations. That's just not \u2013 it's not necessarily a baseline expectation. And it's also \u2013 I think the most important point is we don't need to feel really good about our significantly above $100 million adjusted EBITDA outlook. And then in terms of the \u2013 is Q4 the base level, the answer to that is no. I do think we'll transition back toward more normalized levels by overselling originations at various points from time-to-time over the course of the year would be my expectation.\nRajat Gupta: Understood. That's clear. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Thanks. A couple real quick sort of asked, but I'll ask it another way, maybe anything unique about the first quarter and not significantly above $100 million that shouldn't translate into something similar in future quarters in 2024.\nMark Jenkins: We did address this in our outlook. So our outlook does not anticipate any onetime benefits or costs.\nMichael Baker: Anything in terms of the market or \u2013 is the first quarter usually more profitable than other quarters? Or anything externally or anything that would suggest that, that kind of quarterly number isn't sustainable?\nErnie Garcia: No. I think our expectations for Q1 are normal seasonality, but nothing \u2013 there's tax season that we discussed earlier that is hitting today. Nothing abnormal beyond that in our assumptions.\nMichael Baker: Thank you. That makes sense. Okay. We've seen a lot of advertisements and announcements on the same day. I understand part of that is sort of the backhaul being more efficient on your backhaul. But is that \u2013 what's the uptake on that? How much of a competitive advantage is that becoming for you from a customer standpoint?\nErnie Garcia: Yes. Well, I mean, first, we're extremely proud of that offering. That's not an easy thing to do. I think it's the kind of thing that I think sort of flexes our vertical integration muscles because to do that well, you have to have a transaction platform that's very quick and easy, that's deeply integrated into your logistics system, which is connected up through your verification system most of those customers are getting financing and they need to get their financing terms and get verified to unlock that. So I think that's a complicated offering to put together that does require vertical integration and a lot of systems intelligently speaking to one another. I think that's something we've been working on for a bit now. But it's something that we've generally been pointing more at efficiency gains than at driving growth. And I think what we mean by that is just as a function of normal course, there are always kind of gaps in any given calendar that pop up for many different reasons. And by building same-day capabilities, we've been able to then basically fill in gaps with additional volume by just making those times available to customers. And so we've been able to basically drive efficiency in our cost while simultaneously giving customers faster delivery. Now to the extent we want to start to flex that into more of a growth tool over time. One, you kind of can just do that with scale because density makes that easier to do. But two, you can lean in a little bit more into your kind of staffing model to enable more of those slots. That, I would say, is sort of a separate choice. The underlying capability is something that we have built something that we're rolling out something that we're extremely excited about, something that does have uptake that is notable and that customers really like. And if you search around in our reviews or online, you can find a lot of commentary on it, where customers are very positively surprised by it. And then I think separately, we have a choice of kind of are we using that just to drive efficiency or are we going to kind of push the lever more in the direction of growth. And over time, as we balance this transition, I think that's probably the direction it will go, but we'll see what speed it goes that direction.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Makes sense. If I could ask one more. Your units available for sale on your website has been pretty consistent, although we did see a pickup lately as we track that. My guess is that's because of taking the inventory from your liquidating competitor \u2013 or am I wrong about that? Is that more of a discretionary decision to start to bump up your inventory in anticipation of stronger growth?\nMark Jenkins: I think that \u2013 I think most likely what you're referencing is the bulk sale or bulk acquisition vehicles from a competitor \u2013 is most likely what you're referencing there in the data. There hasn't been a concerted effort.\nMichael Baker: Right. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ron Josey with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRonald Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe as a quick follow-up, Ernie, this one, just on same-day shipping. I think we just talked about it a little bit, but now live in 11 markets. Rather than focusing on efficiency, I wanted to hear your comments on perhaps the impact to improve conversion rates that's coming from same-day shipping. Is this something that you're seeing to have an impact on just conversion to sale? Or is it say, call it, still too early to tell in the market to see the benefits there? That's question one. And then maybe, Mark, realizing it's also early, but CARLI, now that it's, call it, implement, I wanted to hear about the efficiencies range just across the reconditioning process. And this is in the process of like how AI is changing the business? Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So on same-day delivery, I think we're will elect to not quantify the impact, but absolutely, there's no question that speed drives conversion and that we see that in same delivery as well or same-day delivery as well. So I think that is exciting. That's a powerful feature. And as discussed earlier, I think over time, it's a feature that we can lean into more \u2013 if we choose to use that as a growth lever and then also as we expand our footprint leveraging more of our ADESA for reconditioning, it unlocks the ability to do same-day delivery in many more markets. So I think that's a story that will probably unfold over many years, but we think it's a pretty exciting story. It's a story that is only possible for integration. It's a story that's only possible with an enormous footprint, and I think it's very hard to replicate. So something we're very excited about. And then Mark, do you want to hit CARLI?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes. I can hit CARLI. So I think we're very excited about the progress that we've made, obviously, in the reconditioning centers. A lot of that was operational gains and a lot of that was technology gains led by the nationwide rollout of CARLI. And so we have seen \u2013 I think we've talked about more than $900 step-down non-vehicle retail cost of sales. Since our peak over a year ago, and I think that's been driven by many sources getting better at managing the process of reconditioning, getting better at parts procurement and efficiency and a number of other things. So I think that's been a big success story in the IRCs. And then you also looked in a question about AI more broadly. And that's certainly an area it's widely talked about, but it is something that we're very excited about. I think we have several what we see as significant advantages in our position to take advantage of the rapid development of AI. One is our large scale. So we have \u2013 are collecting enormous numbers of data points every year with all the cars that we're evaluating on a day-to-day basis, all of the customer interactions that we have every single day, whether it's on the website or in our communications with customers, and a number of other things. And we're able to do that at a very large scale. We're also highly vertically integrated, which we think makes AI even more powerful because various parts of the vertically integrated chain can be connecting and learning from one another, driving even further gains on AI. And obviously, we're also technology-centric, which I think along with having large scale and vertical integration is important to making the most use of AI as quickly as possible. We've seen all kinds of gains already in customer care, in particular, getting better at processing documents, automatically speeding up the time it takes to handle calls that come in to our customer care centers. And I think those are a couple of quick examples, but this is certainly something that we're very excited about. We think we're structurally positioned to significantly benefit from it, given our large scale, our vertical integration and our technology focus. And so definitely something that we are excited about.\nErnie Garcia: And just because that's a fun one I would love to jump in and add a couple of points as well. The other thing that we believe is unique about us is our system is totally deterministic, meaning that there is a negotiation. And that means that a customer coming to our site can get a complete answer instantly just driven by logic. And so it means the experience that they can get through these tools are much more complete. And I think there are a few tools that we've worked on in our history that I think have more clearly demonstrated the value of vertical integration because it is very, very hard to answer what can feel to a customer like a very simple question. Do you have any similar cars with the sunroof that will cost me $20 less per month? That's a hard question to answer. And it's an extremely hard question to answer if you're not vertically integrated and if your data isn't organized in a way that enables you to do it and impossible to answer, if you're not \u2013 if your policies don't result in deterministic calcs that drive that and all of ours do. So I think it's really exciting. This is an area where anyone who's paying any attention at all is your mind is constantly blown every week when you kind of see the new things that are rolling out. So I don't think we yet know exactly where this is going to go. I think we do know that we're well positioned to take advantage of it. I think also there's kind of another fundamental at play, which is the value of any given technology is always a function of how well positioned you are to use it versus those you compete with. And I think there's a pretty differentiated story here. We've got a great team. We're paying very close attention. And so we'll see where that takes us. I'm not sure it's driving numerical results yet outside of some things you're seeing in customer care, but we are certainly working on it, and we're excited about where it could go over time.\nRonald Josey: Super helpful. Thanks, guys.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question will come from John Blackledge with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJohn Blackledge: Great. Thanks. Two questions. First, the ad spend was down over 30% year-over-year. Just curious how we should think about ad spend in the first quarter and then 2024? And then just a follow-up on same-day. Recognized it's in 11 markets right now, and it's early days, but what is the typical mix of kind of same-day inventory available in a given market? And how could that trend over time? Thank you.\nMark Jenkins: I could start by hitting the question on ad spend. So ad spend in the first quarter, we expect a slight tick down from where we were in Q4, more toward Q2, Q3 levels, maybe slightly lower, but roughly in the Q2 to Q3 range. So the overall story there is stable ad spend in Q1 relative to the past few quarters.\nErnie Garcia: And then generally speaking, as it relates to inventory availability of same-day, the right kind of first order way to think about that is usually the vehicles that are closest to customers in the markets where we offer it, are available same-day, and we are generally rolling it out in markets where we are nearby inspection centers. And so that is what is governing our choices of which markets rolling that out to, and that's why over time, as we continue to open more capabilities at [indiscernible] locations, we'll be able to expand that further.\nJohn Blackledge: Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ernie Garcia for any closing remarks.\nErnie Garcia: Great. Well, thanks everyone for joining the call. We are extremely excited about the work that has been done by the team here. And to the Carvana team, we do this every call. We always say thank you. I always feel like there's no way it's coming through the phone in the way that we mean it, but we really do hope that you guys feel that and understand and appreciate the impact of all the work that you've done. I don't think it was reasonable to expect the progress that we've made from the perspective of a year ago. And I hope that we have another unreasonable year now and I think we're positioned to do it if we keep charging. So keep marching. Thank you all. We'll talk to you guys next quarter.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ernie Garcia",
            "content": "Thanks, Meg, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. 2023 was an exceptional year for Carvana. It was our best year from a financial perspective by a long way. Full-year, GPU was nearly $1,000 better than our previous best in 2021. Our full-year adjusted EBITDA per unit was over $900 higher than our previous best, and we have clear visibility to further improvements, as you can see in our outlook. The last two years have been initially characterized as negative for Carvana. In early 2022, we took a quick trip from a company that was perceived to be able to do a little wrong to one that was perceived to be able to do little right. That wasn't a fun transition for anyone. In each of our letters since we went public in 2017, we have signed off with the march continues. The reason is because we believe this statement is a simple reduction of a massively important and generally underappreciated principle. Getting up again and again and relentlessly pushing forward is part of every success story, but that tenacity is easy to claim and hard to achieve. It's hard because the moments when you have to get back up again, feel very different in the moment than when they are imagined. They feel different for every stakeholder and most importantly, they feel different for every member of the team. I will never know exactly we did right to attract the team that we have, but that combination of things, which undoubtedly includes elements of luck, is almost certainly the most important thing we have ever done as a company. It's very hard for a group to go through a period like the last two years and not to disintegrate under the pressure. We didn't disintegrate. We thought, we came together and we got better. The fact that we got better creates room for the last two years to be recharacterized in the future. Time will ultimately pass judgment on the impact of the last two years on the Carvana story. But my personal take is that it's been our proudest period and that when the story is written, this period and our team's response will be viewed very favorably. To the Carvana team, there is nothing we can say in words that will convey the gratitude we have for the fight you've always put up, but I hope you know it's real. Thank you. While the success of 2023 deserves a moment of reflection, the truth is we still have a lot of marching to do. Our goals are big. From here, the key questions are this. Where are we? Where are we going? And how are we going to get there? First, where are we? Today, Carvana sits in the strongest position we have ever been in for five reasons. I would ask that you come back to this and evaluate each element for yourself. Number one, our customers love the experiences we deliver. And as we execute these experiences are getting even better. Number two, the financial power of our business model is becoming clear every quarter and is highly differentiated across every line item of our income statement, there remain many significant opportunities for additional improvement. We plan to get them. Number three, our infrastructure is simply unmatched. We have built a vertically-integrated machine with 6,500 acres of land and over 500,000 parking spots that scalably and cost effectively gets cars from one customer to another more efficiently than any other machine that serves the same purpose. Number four, competitively, we have never had more separation as we continue to execute, that gap is getting bigger. And number five, we compete in a $1 trillion market, and we currently have approximately 1% market share. The potential is obvious. So where are we going? From the early days of Carvana, we have never flinched in our goals. They have been and remain to become the largest and most profitable automotive retailer and to buy and sell millions of cars per year. And finally, how are we going to get there? We are going to continue to march. We are still an ambitious group with big dreams and hustle. We will keep sprinting in our goals to drive as much positive changes as we can as quickly as possible as we always have. We are also a group that is constantly learning. Every stage in Carvana's journey teaches us new lessons and adds to our toolkit. As long as that is true, and as long as we always get back up, our best day is always today. The march continues, Mark. Sure. So I don't think we're making any unique assumptions about tax season. I think most of the information is out there, if you read it, is that tax season probably started a little slower, less money went out as a result of the timing of the holidays, but I think there's an expectation that probably tax season will be pretty strong this year and average refunds will probably be a bit larger. Really kind of the first chunk of significant money, we believe, hit yesterday and last night. And I think our assumption is driving kind of our outlook for Q1 is just anything roughly normal. I don't think we're making super aggressive assumptions there. So I don't think there's anything super notable to discuss. And then as it relates to credit tightening, I think we rolled a lot of that out over the last six months. We've rolled more of that out even more recently. And so I think that's largely \u2013 or that is completely taken into account in our outlook as well. I think you know what I'm going to say, but I'm going to say it anyway. I think our view is there's opportunity everywhere, I think a useful way to break it down is kind of variable expenses and fixed expenses. I think fixed expenses, roughly the way we're managing that today is holding that in the range, and we expect that to lever as we turn to growth. And then I think in variable expenses, we still absolutely believe that there are gains to be had. I think the teams have been doing an incredible job. I think if you look at the trajectory of those numbers, it's very strong. And I think we're excited about a lot of initiatives that we still have left. I think in many of those areas, prioritizing those initiatives is still one of our bigger issues internally and just making sure that we're doing one thing at a time and not trying to take on too much at any given time. I think from a gross profit per unit perspective, there's also opportunity there. And I think that's true in basically every line item. I would kind of probably characterize those as fundamental opportunities, meaning regardless of where we choose to price things like rates or the vehicle. We believe we can be more efficient in all those areas. And I think that those \u2013 that can take the form of continued enhancement in credit scoring and credit pricing, credit structuring and innovations that we've been recently rolling out internally that allow us to more precisely kind of connect our credit pricing structuring and risk assessment to individual loans. It can take the form of getting smarter about how we're buying cars, the data that we're in taking to evaluate the value of those cars, a number of things that we're doing at the point of receipt of the cars to make sure that we're cutting out the biggest losers. So I think there's a number of initiatives there as well that are pretty exciting. And then I think we remain in this period of trying to make sure that we're driving efficiencies. And I think despite that, we're obviously looking forward to a very strong Q1 from both a financial perspective and from showing a little bit of growth for the first time in a while. So overall, I think we are just very excited about the way the team has responded in the last couple of years. I think it was pretty hard to imagine from the perspective of two years ago where we're sitting today. I think it was hard to imagine the perspective of a year ago where we're sitting today. And I think that we feel like we've got a lot of room to continue to make improvements, and we look forward to continuing to make those improvements. So I think across the board, we're looking for fundamental gains. Thank you. Yes. No. Well, I appreciate the question. I appreciate you handing us out at the end of it. But I think, we got to stick with our guidance. We want to make sure that we stay disciplined on that. We are extremely excited about where we are. I think the trends of the business are very, very strong. I think we obviously had a great 2023 from an EBITDA perspective, but the trends that kind of underline the sum of the year were also very positive and those trends remain, and that's what we see heading into Q1. And I think now the balls in our hand, and we just got to go execute. And if we keep executing, I think there's pretty exciting things in front of us, but we got to go, make those things happen, and we'll continue to update you every quarter. Well, if we comment on your interpretation, then I mean this starts to get really \u2013 or really fast. I think you've got your interpretation. We're going to keep marching, we're excited. Thank you. Sure. Well, maybe we'll start with a couple sort of data points. So I think roughly speaking, if you \u2013 like inflation adjust car prices against all other goods just using CPI. Car prices themselves are probably still on the order of, give or take, 10% higher than other goods in the economy. So I think that suggests on a price level, there's potentially room for that to continue to moderate over time. I think if you look at monthly payments, which compound that and the moves in interest rates. Again, like high-level swag, monthly payments are probably on the order of more like 20% higher relative to other goods than they were pre-pandemic. So I think that also kind of points a little bit in the direction of room for moderation. But we'll see. I think so far, that model of post shortage, there's usually a glut and car prices should probably normalize relative to other goods. So far, that's been pretty predictive for the last two years. The speed is always hard, but that's at least kind of predicted the direction, I think that we're seeing a lot more new car incentives and aggressiveness right now, which probably points a little bit to more support for that kind of direction in the future, but that's a hard thing to get exactly right. I think, generally speaking, for us, probably lower is better. I'm not sure that there's a level that we're trying to get to. I think it makes cars more affordable for customers. It pulls more people back into the market. And generally speaking, as we've discussed in the past, I think we do exist \u2013 our business is sitting between the wholesale market and the retail market. And so what really matters for us is that spread. And we have kind of over the last two years, we've had kind of the expected case scenario, I would say, but also probably the best case scenario where you've seen depreciation, which made cars more affordable, but you also saw the wholesale market anticipate that depreciation and so margins have been pretty stable. I think if you look at our retail margins we've been near in the 2,800-plus area for the last three quarters, and we expect it to be in a similar spot to maybe even having upside in Q1. And so I think that, that suggests that despite the fact that this depreciation has been occurring and making cars more affordable for our customers, our margins have held in there and been pretty steady. And so overall, I think that's playing out the way that we would like for it to and probably the way that we should have expected it to. Thank you. I think the goal is to continually get better everywhere. I think we've benefited a bit in a way over the last two years from being able to kind of simplify our goals and focus just on improving efficiency throughout the business. And I think the primary form that benefit has taken is it just kind of simplified the number of moving pieces in the business and has allowed us to make a lot of progress really fast. That said, I do think that there remains a lot of room for improvement. And as we said earlier, I think one of the biggest issues we deal with internally is just trying to make sure that we're not trying to bite off kind of too many projects because there's still a lot of projects that are pretty exciting. So I think we will continue absolutely to work on projects that we expect to drive efficiency across both variable costs and gross profit. We also do expect as we kind of head into that transition to start to focus a little bit more on projects that are supportive of growth, and that's obviously exciting. I think given where the business model is, it's very clear how powerful that is to the financial model of the business. And we think we're incredibly well positioned for that. We think that the business is in the strongest place it's ever been. We think our customer offering is stronger than it's ever been. We think our infrastructure is ready to support this growth. We think the work that it takes to grow is meaningfully less than it's been in the past. I mean just even to throw some stats out there. Today, we're moving cars inbound to our inspection centers, approximately 20% fewer miles than we were a year ago. Outbound we're moving cars 30% fewer miles. That's because we've got more of these facilities, and we've integrated intelligently into our scheduling systems to make better choices there. On in-market ops, we're now pairing almost 50% of activities, which means when we deliver a car to a customer, on the way back, we are picking up another car to get more efficient. I think that's up 75% year-over-year as we put time and effort into building those systems to make them smarter. And building the scheduling systems to make it more likely that we see overlap. That gets better as we get more density in the network and there's still a lot of room to improve there across customer care. Our advocates are roughly twice as efficient as they were in the past in terms of number of sales per advocate per period. The same is true in title and registration with better performance metrics in that group that are now extremely high quality. So I think we're really well positioned to head into growth when it's time. And I think what we've got to do now as a company is we've got to figure out just how effectively we can manage that transition, how good of a job we can do maintaining the accountability that we had over the last couple of years by keeping things simple as we do head into a more complex optimization equation of both growth and efficiency. But the opportunity is everywhere. The question is how well we execute. The question is not where we're going. We have every intention of selling millions of cars. We've never been better positioned for it, and that is absolutely what we intend to do. But now we've got to figure out how quickly we can do it and how efficient we can be along the way. Who doesn't love when Professor Jenkins takes the mic. Everyone in Carvana is celebrating right now. Sure. Well, I think the first thing we want to do is we want to kind of complete the projects that we've got underway today. And I think we have a number of projects underway today that we expect to continue to drive efficiency. So I think we want to see that through. I think the reason we had to provide this frame earlier our goal is to sell millions of cars and to be the largest, most profitable automotive retailers because that's the place where we're heading. I think the question then is how fast are we going to get there. And I do think that there are reasons to believe that we should be able to grow at faster rates and be very efficient just given how much more efficient the business is today and the fact that infrastructure is sitting there to be filled in, but we have to go execute on that. And so I think we will always be in a rush to make as much progress as we possibly can. But we will try to be intelligent about how we transition between the goal of efficiency and the goal of growth. We think that there are still gains to be had in both areas. And that's why we're labeling that a transition period. The place where we're headed is clear, the speed that we're going to get there is less clear. And so as we start to make that transition, we'll keep giving you feedback to make it clear what we believe at any point in time. No. I think our expectations for Q1 are normal seasonality, but nothing \u2013 there's tax season that we discussed earlier that is hitting today. Nothing abnormal beyond that in our assumptions. Yes. Well, I mean, first, we're extremely proud of that offering. That's not an easy thing to do. I think it's the kind of thing that I think sort of flexes our vertical integration muscles because to do that well, you have to have a transaction platform that's very quick and easy, that's deeply integrated into your logistics system, which is connected up through your verification system most of those customers are getting financing and they need to get their financing terms and get verified to unlock that. So I think that's a complicated offering to put together that does require vertical integration and a lot of systems intelligently speaking to one another. I think that's something we've been working on for a bit now. But it's something that we've generally been pointing more at efficiency gains than at driving growth. And I think what we mean by that is just as a function of normal course, there are always kind of gaps in any given calendar that pop up for many different reasons. And by building same-day capabilities, we've been able to then basically fill in gaps with additional volume by just making those times available to customers. And so we've been able to basically drive efficiency in our cost while simultaneously giving customers faster delivery. Now to the extent we want to start to flex that into more of a growth tool over time. One, you kind of can just do that with scale because density makes that easier to do. But two, you can lean in a little bit more into your kind of staffing model to enable more of those slots. That, I would say, is sort of a separate choice. The underlying capability is something that we have built something that we're rolling out something that we're extremely excited about, something that does have uptake that is notable and that customers really like. And if you search around in our reviews or online, you can find a lot of commentary on it, where customers are very positively surprised by it. And then I think separately, we have a choice of kind of are we using that just to drive efficiency or are we going to kind of push the lever more in the direction of growth. And over time, as we balance this transition, I think that's probably the direction it will go, but we'll see what speed it goes that direction. Sure. So on same-day delivery, I think we're will elect to not quantify the impact, but absolutely, there's no question that speed drives conversion and that we see that in same delivery as well or same-day delivery as well. So I think that is exciting. That's a powerful feature. And as discussed earlier, I think over time, it's a feature that we can lean into more \u2013 if we choose to use that as a growth lever and then also as we expand our footprint leveraging more of our ADESA for reconditioning, it unlocks the ability to do same-day delivery in many more markets. So I think that's a story that will probably unfold over many years, but we think it's a pretty exciting story. It's a story that is only possible for integration. It's a story that's only possible with an enormous footprint, and I think it's very hard to replicate. So something we're very excited about. And then Mark, do you want to hit CARLI? And just because that's a fun one I would love to jump in and add a couple of points as well. The other thing that we believe is unique about us is our system is totally deterministic, meaning that there is a negotiation. And that means that a customer coming to our site can get a complete answer instantly just driven by logic. And so it means the experience that they can get through these tools are much more complete. And I think there are a few tools that we've worked on in our history that I think have more clearly demonstrated the value of vertical integration because it is very, very hard to answer what can feel to a customer like a very simple question. Do you have any similar cars with the sunroof that will cost me $20 less per month? That's a hard question to answer. And it's an extremely hard question to answer if you're not vertically integrated and if your data isn't organized in a way that enables you to do it and impossible to answer, if you're not \u2013 if your policies don't result in deterministic calcs that drive that and all of ours do. So I think it's really exciting. This is an area where anyone who's paying any attention at all is your mind is constantly blown every week when you kind of see the new things that are rolling out. So I don't think we yet know exactly where this is going to go. I think we do know that we're well positioned to take advantage of it. I think also there's kind of another fundamental at play, which is the value of any given technology is always a function of how well positioned you are to use it versus those you compete with. And I think there's a pretty differentiated story here. We've got a great team. We're paying very close attention. And so we'll see where that takes us. I'm not sure it's driving numerical results yet outside of some things you're seeing in customer care, but we are certainly working on it, and we're excited about where it could go over time. Thank you. And then generally speaking, as it relates to inventory availability of same-day, the right kind of first order way to think about that is usually the vehicles that are closest to customers in the markets where we offer it, are available same-day, and we are generally rolling it out in markets where we are nearby inspection centers. And so that is what is governing our choices of which markets rolling that out to, and that's why over time, as we continue to open more capabilities at [indiscernible] locations, we'll be able to expand that further. Thank you. Great. Well, thanks everyone for joining the call. We are extremely excited about the work that has been done by the team here. And to the Carvana team, we do this every call. We always say thank you. I always feel like there's no way it's coming through the phone in the way that we mean it, but we really do hope that you guys feel that and understand and appreciate the impact of all the work that you've done. I don't think it was reasonable to expect the progress that we've made from the perspective of a year ago. And I hope that we have another unreasonable year now and I think we're positioned to do it if we keep charging. So keep marching. Thank you all. We'll talk to you guys next quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our fourth quarter highlighted the significant and sustainable progress we have made on our path to profitability. We set company records for fourth quarter and full-year total GPU and adjusted EBITDA, completing a year in which we improved adjusted EBITDA by nearly $1.4 billion and positioning us well for further adjusted EBITDA growth in 2024. As part of our earnings materials this quarter, we provide a detailed look at our fourth quarter and full-year results. I'll start by summarizing three key takeaways. First, our FY2023 results and Q1 2024 outlook resoundingly demonstrate the ability of our online sales model to generate significant adjusted EBITDA. Based on our Q1 outlook, we expect to generate significantly above $100 million of adjusted EBITDA, equating to significantly above $1,200 per retail unit sold. Despite declining used vehicle prices, industry volumes that remain below pre-pandemic levels and sizable costs of carrying capacity for future growth. Second, we are now beginning to demonstrate record adjusted EBITDA profitability while also showing early signs of growth. Based on industry data sources, we gained market share on a sequential basis in Q4 and our outlook calls for retail unit growth not only on a sequential basis, but also on a year-over-year basis in Q1 and in full-year 2024. Third, we have a unique and powerful infrastructure for significantly and efficiently scaling retail unit volume with excess capacity in our existing footprint to support multiples of profitable growth. We expect this growth to be paired with significant operating leverage as we leverage our underutilized overhead costs. Moving now to our fourth quarter results. As we previously discussed, our long-term financial goal is to generate significant GAAP net income and free cash flow. In service of this goal, our management team remains focused on driving progress on a set of key non-GAAP financial metrics that are inputs into this long-term goal, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP SG&A expense and adjusted EBITDA. Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our remaining remarks on sequential changes in these metrics. Retail units sold declined by 6% sequentially, in line with our outlook and better than the industry on a sequential basis. Total revenue was $2.424 billion, a decrease of 13% sequentially. In the fourth quarter, non-GAAP total GPU was $5,730, a sequential decrease of $666 driven primarily by the absence of non-recurring benefits, which positively impacted Q3 and seasonality. Non-GAAP retail GPU $2,970 in Q4 versus $2,877 in Q3, a new company record. Our strength in retail GPU came despite higher-than-normal fourth quarter depreciation and continues to be driven by fundamental gains in non-vehicle cost of sales, customer sourcing, inventory turn times and revenues from additional services, highlighting the value of our vertically-integrated business model. We expect non-GAAP retail GPU in Q1 to be similar to Q4, with the potential for upside. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $881 in Q4 versus $951 in Q3. Sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by fourth quarter seasonality. We expect a sequential increase in wholesale GPU in Q1. Non-GAAP other GPU was $1,879 in Q4 versus $2,568 in Q3. Sequential changes in other GPU were primarily driven by selling a lower volume of loans in Q4 relative to retail units sold that in Q3, as well as lower premium on loan sales resulting from higher industry-wide loss expectations that we have since passed through to our pricing. We expect a sequential increase in other GPU in Q1. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $376 million in Q4 versus $370 million in Q3. Sequential changes in non-GAAP SG&A expense were primarily driven by the absence of a small non-recurring benefit that impacted Q3 and small incremental expenses in Q4. Finally, adjusted EBITDA was $60 million in Q4, a new fourth quarter company record. I'll turn now to our first quarter outlook. While the macroeconomic and industry environment continues to be uncertain, looking toward the first quarter of 2024, we expect the following as long as the environment remains stable. One, we expect retail units sold slightly up on a year-over-year basis; and two, we expect adjusted EBITDA significantly above $100 million. Our confidence about driving significantly above $100 million of adjusted EBITDA is driven by our results so far this quarter. This outlook does not anticipate any material one-time benefits or costs in Q1. For FY2024, we expect to grow retail units sold and adjusted EBITDA compared to FY2023. We are excited about the path we are on, and we look forward to making continued progress toward our goal of becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. Sure. I can take that one. The simple answer is we don't expect any material impacts from acquiring units in bulk from competitors. We did acquire a portfolio of about 2,800 units in January from industry player that was selling their units. And so those 2,800 units, I'd expect us to sell them over the next couple of quarters. We did acquire the units in full. So those will be retail units sold when they sell, there'll be gross revenue and generate retail gross profit when they sell. But given the small size of the portfolio that we acquired, would not expect it to have a material impact on either retail units sold over the combination of the next couple of quarters, including Q1 or on retail GPU and either those quarters. I can take that one. So I actually think there's opportunities in all of those areas. I don't think we feel like we're done with any of those. I think we've hit on these types of things at various points, but clear opportunities in inbound transport as we expand the number of sites where we're doing reconditioning, which brings down inbound cost of inbound days on the inbound transport side. I think in the reconditioning centers, they've made tremendous gains, implementing new technology, new processes, standardizing processes across locations, rolling out our proprietary CARLI system across our nationwide infrastructure. That team is not done. That team still sees meaningful opportunity to further develop our technology, refine our processes and standardize and drive execution across our nationwide set of locations. I think in outbound transport, just like the others. It's the same story, pairing technology with process excellence. That's the area where the teams have been focused up to this point, made tremendous gains, and I think they're also looking at their business today, and saying, yes, we still see further opportunity to make gains. And then on the sourcing side, just like every other area. We've got teams that are working to every day pull in more data sources, every day, refine our algorithms \u2013 for putting the optimal valuation on every single car that we look at. And that's, I think, millions of cars that we see and are collecting data on every single day. So I think the main takeaway there is we've made tremendous gains, but the teams that are working on each of those areas see opportunities for meaningful gains from here. Sure. Yes, I can take both of those. So let me start with retail GPU. So here I think the main idea is we have a unique business model that allows us to take cars that are reconditioned, acquired and stored around the country and make them available to customers in our 300 markets plus nationwide. And so for shorter distance shipments where customer finds a car that's perfect for them that's nearby to them. We have free shipping and in most of the markets we operate based on our data. We have the largest availability of free shipping inventory in those markets, the ones that we have looked at. However, for larger shipments, we've been \u2013 we do use the opportunity of making that selection available to also generate additional revenue, just from long distance, the shipping services provided to customers. And so I think that's where the additional revenue from additional services comes from. It's really from our ability to move cars long distances efficiently around the country and make much wider selection available to customers as a result of that. Now in terms of how it flows through to retail GPU, that's actually been fairly steady, I would say, over the last three or four quarters. It really hasn't been moving around much sequentially, maybe up or down a little bit, but nothing that's worth calling out. I think it's more when you compare to sort of our pre-pandemic model, we weren't generating as much revenue from having that nationwide logistics network as we are today. So that's the answer to question one. On question two, so in my prepared remarks, I mentioned the idea of being significantly above adjusted EBITDA per unit in Q1. And I think that my motivation for mentioning that was people for a long time they didn't believe just to say it candidly, that a vertically integrated e-commerce online sales model could work. And now we're sitting here in the first quarter of 2024. And I think we're very confidently saying we expect to drive significantly more than $100 million of adjusted EBITDA or significantly more than $1,200 per unit of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter. And we're also doing that in an environment where rates are at multi-decade highs, which I think makes it even a bit more impressive. We're doing it in an environment where the used vehicle industry as a whole is still notably down relative to pre-pandemic levels, which I think makes that adjusted EBITDA generation, even more impressive. Moreover, we're doing it while also carrying significant cost of excess capacity that we view as a huge benefit for us as we look forward because we're generating a lot of adjusted EBITDA now at a volume that is far below what our capacity can support from an overhead cost and fixed infrastructure perspective. And so I just think when you start layering all of those things on top of each other, it gets us very excited about where the model can go. I think it resoundingly answers the questions about whether or not this is a long-term profitable business model, whether or not this is a long-term sustainable business model. I think that's one of the things, as I mentioned, that I think we're just \u2013 we're feeling really good about and why I called out that one data point in my prepared remarks. Yes. So let's focus in on incremental costs associated with growth in retail cost of sales. So I do think there are some costs associated with higher growth rates and retail cost of sales. I think some of them take the form of just direct hiring and training expenses as you're building up staffing, you're spending money on hiring, training new employees. I think a little bit of it takes the form of newer employees typically take a little time to get up to speed and become as efficient as more tenured employees. And so I think that can have a small impact. I think another dynamic is you may outsource more services for a period of time as you're ramping up. Now in our case, looking forward, I would not expect outsourcing more services to take the form of full car reconditioning by partners, which is something we did in 2021. Don't anticipate that. But on smaller services, on a select basis, I see [indiscernible] you could do that. So I give that detailed list just so you have a clear view of what we view as the some of the incremental costs associated with ramping and it's really those three buckets. Now let's talk a little bit about sizing. Putting all those together, we do not view those as being a particularly significant part of the overall retail GPU story. There are some offsets, for example, getting leverage on fixed facilities expenses in inspection and reconditioning centers, other fixed expenses in those centers. So that's a partial offset to some of the things that I mentioned. And so I think the main takeaway is there are some frictions. However, we do not expect them to be of a particularly large size, just based on the progress that we've made in improving our technology, improving our processes, having a broad base of existing inspection and reconditioning centers from which to build. And so that would be my full set of thoughts on that specific question. So I'm not sure I caught that question. Got it. Yes. So I hit the point about the bulk part. We made a bulk purchase of vehicles from a competitor in January. We purchased about 2,800 units that we expect to sell the majority of over the next couple of quarters. We do not expect a material retail GPU impact from that. There could be some small impact. But just given the size of the portfolio, we do not expect a meaningful impact from that. On the question about metal margin more generally. I mean Ernie called this out early in the call, but with our outlook of being close to Q4 levels with upside or the potential for upside in Q1, that's going to be four consecutive quarters at a pretty substantial retail GPU level. So obviously, with four full quarters at a very strong level, we're feeling really good about the way that we're executing from a retail GPU perspective. We talked about a lot of the fundamentals that are driving that. We talked about \u2013 obviously, all the progress in the reconditioning centers. We're doing a great job sourcing cars for customers. We really normalize inventory turn times. We're generating revenue from additional services, taking advantage of our national logistics network. And so I think we obviously have established a very strong track record on retail GPU with our three final quarters of 2023 and our outlook for Q1. Thank you. I can hit that. Yes. So I think the \u2013 I would say the \u2013 what we called out in the outlook is us being significantly above $100 million of adjusted EBITDA that doesn't anticipate any loan sales above originations. I think it's possible that we could oversell originations. That's just not \u2013 it's not necessarily a baseline expectation. And it's also \u2013 I think the most important point is we don't need to feel really good about our significantly above $100 million adjusted EBITDA outlook. And then in terms of the \u2013 is Q4 the base level, the answer to that is no. I do think we'll transition back toward more normalized levels by overselling originations at various points from time-to-time over the course of the year would be my expectation. We did address this in our outlook. So our outlook does not anticipate any onetime benefits or costs. I think that \u2013 I think most likely what you're referencing is the bulk sale or bulk acquisition vehicles from a competitor \u2013 is most likely what you're referencing there in the data. There hasn't been a concerted effort. Sure. Yes. I can hit CARLI. So I think we're very excited about the progress that we've made, obviously, in the reconditioning centers. A lot of that was operational gains and a lot of that was technology gains led by the nationwide rollout of CARLI. And so we have seen \u2013 I think we've talked about more than $900 step-down non-vehicle retail cost of sales. Since our peak over a year ago, and I think that's been driven by many sources getting better at managing the process of reconditioning, getting better at parts procurement and efficiency and a number of other things. So I think that's been a big success story in the IRCs. And then you also looked in a question about AI more broadly. And that's certainly an area it's widely talked about, but it is something that we're very excited about. I think we have several what we see as significant advantages in our position to take advantage of the rapid development of AI. One is our large scale. So we have \u2013 are collecting enormous numbers of data points every year with all the cars that we're evaluating on a day-to-day basis, all of the customer interactions that we have every single day, whether it's on the website or in our communications with customers, and a number of other things. And we're able to do that at a very large scale. We're also highly vertically integrated, which we think makes AI even more powerful because various parts of the vertically integrated chain can be connecting and learning from one another, driving even further gains on AI. And obviously, we're also technology-centric, which I think along with having large scale and vertical integration is important to making the most use of AI as quickly as possible. We've seen all kinds of gains already in customer care, in particular, getting better at processing documents, automatically speeding up the time it takes to handle calls that come in to our customer care centers. And I think those are a couple of quick examples, but this is certainly something that we're very excited about. We think we're structurally positioned to significantly benefit from it, given our large scale, our vertical integration and our technology focus. And so definitely something that we are excited about. I could start by hitting the question on ad spend. So ad spend in the first quarter, we expect a slight tick down from where we were in Q4, more toward Q2, Q3 levels, maybe slightly lower, but roughly in the Q2 to Q3 range. So the overall story there is stable ad spend in Q1 relative to the past few quarters."

With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thanks, Meg, and thanks everyone for joining the call. The third quarter was another great quarter for Carvana that continued the clear momentum we've had since we rolled out our plan 18 months ago. Over that period of time we have cut $1.2 billion in annualized SG&A expenses out of the business, which has dramatically improved our efficiency, while also reducing annualized inbound transport and reconditioning COGs expenses by about $250 million annualized, which has driven up our GPU.  These efforts have combined to powerful effect. Over the last two quarters, we have generated $300 million of adjusted EBITDA, with about $200 million of that excluding non-recurring items. These are important numbers. They send a clear message that the plan our team laid out 18 months ago was the right one. They send a clear message that our team is executing at a very high level. And most importantly, they send a clear message about the long-term power of our business model.  Since we went public in 2017, we have been clear about our goals to sell millions of cars and to become the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. Two years ago, there was a general belief in our ability to become the largest, but the questions remained about our ability to be the most profitable. While those two questions won't be definitively answered until we actually cross both milestones, the last two quarters provide a lot of support for our belief that we will ultimately be the most profitable automotive retailer as well.  In today's shareholder letter, we are providing clear evidence of this with our breakouts of our overhead and operational expenses over time. The takeaways from the data are the following:  One, in Step 1, we successfully right-sized the operational components of the business and began making significant progress in reducing our operational expenses per unit.  Two, our efficiency gains are continuing in Step 2, with our unit economics rapidly becoming a significant competitive advantage.  And three, our current fixed-cost utilization is low, providing a very clear path to both significant scale and significant cost leverage when we turn to Step 3 of our plan.  Our plan is working, and we are going to see it through. While it is unquestionably tempting to turn our attention back to growth, we believe it is a better long-term decision to remain disciplined and continue harvesting the efficiency gains we see in front of us before shifting our organizational focus and moving on to Step 3.  In the fourth quarter, we expect to continue making fundamental gains through various projects that comprise Step 2. We also expect volumes to reduce relative to Q3 due to normal seasonality and potential industry softening observed over the last four weeks. Despite this, we continue to operate in our target unit range for Step 2. The sum of these dynamics leads us to expect to produce another great quarter, but as in past Q4s, we expect lower industry-wide volume, coupled with higher industry-wide depreciation rates to cause lower adjusted EBITDA than we have achieved in the past two quarters. Looking forward, we are excited. The difficulty of 2022 wasn't how we imagined our path in the beginning, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good for us. Through it, we have come together to do our best work. We have learned the power of focus. We have gained a new appreciation for discipline. We have learned an even greater sense of urgency. And now, as a result, we have competitively differentiated unit economics.  2022 has added to our arsenal. It has made us better. And while that is a change, there is a lot that remains exactly the same. We are still an ambitious group of people who care. We are still willing to roll up our sleeves and do the hard work to achieve our goals. We are still delivering new experiences to people buying and selling cars that they love.  We still have a business model that is incredibly difficult to replicate and that mechanically gets better as it gets bigger. We are still just a small player in the largest retail market in the world, and we are still on the path to selling millions of cars and becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer.  The march continues. Mark. \nMark Jenkins : Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our third quarter highlighted the significant and sustainable progress we have made on our path to profitability. We set third quarter company records for total GPU and adjusted EBITDA, both with and without nonrecurring benefits.  As part of our earnings materials, we provide a detailed look into our Q3 results, our three-step plan, and the components of our cost structure. I'll start by summarizing three key takeaways.  First, in the last two quarters, we have clearly demonstrated the profitability of our online business model. In Q2 and Q3, we generated more than $300 million of adjusted EBITDA, which includes approximately $110 million of non-recurring items. We did this despite carrying costs of an infrastructure that supports 3x retail unit growth, and despite a difficult used vehicle industry backdrop.  Second, our focus on driving fundamental operating efficiency in Step 2 is generating significant unit economics gains. Of particular note, we have reduced non-vehicle retail cost of sales and operations expenses by $1,000 per retail unit in just the last two quarters, and we see opportunities for further gains from here.  Third, we have significant excess capacity in our existing infrastructure to support multiples of profitable growth. We expect this growth to be paired with significant operating leverage as we leverage our underutilized overhead costs.  Moving to our third quarter results. In the third quarter, retail units sold totaled 80,987, a decrease of 21% year-over-year and an increase of 6% sequentially. Total revenue was $2.773 billion, a decrease of 18% year-over-year and a decrease of 7% sequentially.  As we've previously discussed, our long-term financial goal is to generate significant GAAP net income and free cash flow. In service of this goal, in the near term, our management team remains focused on driving progress on a set of key non-GAAP financial metrics that are inputs into this long-term goal, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP SG&A expense, and adjusted EBITDA.  Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our remaining remarks on sequential changes in these metrics.  In the third quarter, non-GAAP total GPU was $6,396, a sequential decrease of $634 driven primarily by smaller benefits from non-recurring items. Total GPU in Q3 was positively impacted by approximately $500 of non-recurring benefits, which we describe in more detail below, compared to approximately $900 of benefits in Q2.  Non-GAAP retail GPU was $2,877 versus $2,862 in Q2. Sequential changes in retail GPU were positively impacted by a $250 reduction in non-vehicle retail cost of sales and a 25 day reduction in retail average days of sale, both at the favorable end of our previous outlook range, as well as wider spreads between retail and wholesale market prices, partially offset by higher retail depreciation rates and a smaller inventory allowance adjustment benefit compared to Q2. Notably, our strengthened retail GPU continues to be driven by several fundamental improvements in our business compared to our previous high watermark of FY 2021, including lower reconditioning and inbound transport costs, a higher customer sourcing rate, and higher revenue from additional services.  Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $951, in line with our outlook, versus $1,228 in Q2. Sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by higher wholesale market depreciation rates in Q3 compared to Q2, which negatively impacted wholesale vehicle volume and gross profit for wholesale units sold, as well as seasonal changes in wholesale marketplace volume.  Non-GAAP other GPU was $2,568 versus $2,940 in Q2. We estimate that a higher than normalized volume of loans held and sold in Q3 increased other GPU by approximately $400, other things being equal, compared to a $650 benefit in Q2. In addition, other GPU in Q3 was primarily impacted by lower origination rates relative to benchmark interest rates, partially offset by lower credit spreads.  In Q3, we continue to make progress lowering SG&A expenses, reducing non-GAAP SG&A expense by $13 million sequentially. Notably, we reduced non-GAAP SG&A expense per retail unit by more than $400 sequentially, while growing retail units sold by 6%.  In our shareholder letter and accompanying materials, we provide additional details on the components of our SG&A expense, including a breakdown of operations expenses, which are more variable in nature, and overhead expenses, which are more fixed in nature.  Our significant sequential operating leverage in Q3 was driven by both continued improvement in operational expenses, as well as leverage in the fixed component of our cost structure. Adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was positive $148 million or 5.3% of revenue. The aggregate impact to adjusted EBITDA of the previously described nonrecurring items was approximately $40 million. On September 1, 2023, we closed the previously announced corporate debt exchange offer with 96.4% of note holders agreeing to exchange $5.52 billion of our unsecured notes for cash and new secured notes, reducing total debt by over $1.325 billion, extending maturities and decreasing required cash interest payments by more than $455 million per year for the next two years.  On September 30, we had approximately $3.2 billion in total liquidity resources, including $1.6 billion in cash and availability under revolving facilities and $1.6 billion in secured debt capacity and unpledged beneficial interests.  Turning now to our fourth quarter outlook. While the macroeconomic and industry environment continues to be uncertain, looking toward the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect the following as long as the environment remains stable. A sequential decline in retail units sold, driven primarily by industry and seasonal patterns, non-GAAP total GPU above $5,000 for the third consecutive quarter, and positive adjusted EBITDA for the third consecutive quarter. Looking toward 2024, we expect to drive significant total GPU and adjusted EBITDA for the second consecutive year. We are excited about the path we are on, and we look forward to making continued progress toward our goal of becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. \nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Chris Pierce with Needham. Please go ahead. \nChris Pierce: Hey, how you doing? Non-GAAP \u2013 hold on a sec. Non-GAAP SG&A per unit. Can it continue to go down in Q4 on the lower number of units you're guiding for? And if it can't, would that be a signal internally to turn on growth? \nErnie Garcia : Sure. I would say you can see that we've pushed down our dollar spend pretty consistently over the last several quarters. I think we're extremely happy with the dollar reduction this last quarter that we saw. It came in the form of basically a $200 operational expense saving per unit, and kind of that being offset by roughly 5,000 additional units quarter-over-quarter. So we're clearly making pretty significant gains there.  I think that we absolutely believe that through Step 2 we have additional gains to be made. We expect those gains to be across the board, both in our corporate expenses and in operational expenses. But I think as far as kind of that detail of disclosure, we're going to stick with the guidance that we've provided. \nChris Pierce : Okay. And then just broadly, what would turning on growth mean? Because you have to get the cars to sell the cars. So is that something \u2013 or would turning on growth be increasing advertising to sell more cars in different geographies at a higher rate or would it be sourcing a greater number of cars from consumers? I'm just kind of curious how you would go about it to the extent you've had those conversations. \nErnie Garcia : Sure. So let me start with \u2013 I think roughly a year and half since we kicked of with this plan. We internally called that Project Catapult. And basically everyone across the business had a series of goals in every operational group that they were aiming to hit, many of them with monthly targets and most of them with weekly targets that we were marching to basically through Q2 of this year.  We also then kicked off what we call Operation 100, which is the next series of our goals across every single one of our operational groups. That also has very clear targets, some of them monthly and most of them weekly, through Q2 of next year.  I think that has clearly led to tremendous gains. That level of focus the discipline that we've had, of making sure that we are maintaining operational excellence and that across all locations in the company we're performing at the best level of any locations across the company. I think it's clearly led to tremendous benefits and I think that focus has been very, very valuable.  So I think the most important thing that we will do is in time to turn to growth and Step 3 is basically to just reset the entire company focus on growth goals. So I think instead of everyone being focused on, how am I going to drive additional efficiency and all those targets, being focused on how are we going to get more efficient as a business, they'll instead be focused on how do we make customer experiences even better? How do we drive growth? How do we position the company to grow? And so I think that is the number one thing that we will switch when we move to Step 3 from Step 2.  I think the gains that we're seeing are still very significant and so we believe it makes sense to stick in Step 2 for a bit longer. I think when it is time to grow, I think advertising, inventory are absolutely two very big parts of that equation. I think we grew from 2018 Q1 through \u201821 Q1 at approximately a 70% CAGR.  During that entire time, we were clearly growing inventory pretty quickly. That was leading to increased conversion. We are growing advertising pretty quickly. I think that was partially because those customers converted even more efficiently as a result of that extra inventory and our brand was building. And so we benefited from positive feedback throughout that entire period.  Over the last 18 months, the opposite has been true. Over the last 12 months, we've shrunk inventory by 50% and we've shrunk advertising by 50% and that's clearly pushed a bit in the opposite direction. But when it's time to grow, we expect to again grow inventory. We expect to again grow advertising. I think there are other elements of positive feedback that we expect to kick off as well, and we think that that will drive a big part of that growth. \nChris Pierce : Okay, thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Baker with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. \nMichael Baker: Hi, thanks. So you said a lower cost structure is a competitive advantage. How does that show up? To me, that means you can get aggressive in price to win back shares. Is that the right way to think about it or is there another way we should interpret a lower cost structure being a competitive advantage? And maybe just as a second question, I'd like to call it a follow-up, but it's unrelated. I also heard you say the last four weeks have been weaker. If you could just talk about the trends through the quarter and early into the fourth quarter. Thanks. \nErnie Garcia: Sure, so let me start with that. I think unit economics we view as a competitive advantage. So I think I would extend that not just to cost structure, which we'll hit in a moment, but also to GPU.  I think a huge advantage of our business model across all of time has been our vertical integration. We're able to give customers a very high quality, very simple experience, and we're able to monetize much more of that experience than many others in the industry as a result of that vertical integration.  And I think those benefits are showing up very clearly in our GPU. We just had record Q3 GPU on the order of $6,000. We had record Q2 GPU as well. So I think unit economics start there and we're able to achieve those GPUs despite giving our customers significant discounts versus many of the largest players in this industry. So I think that's the starting point, I think, of the power of our model.  I think now if we kind of fold that into expenses, you can see the gains that we've made in operational expenses. We're extremely proud of that. That's obviously not a super easy thing to do, especially while holding volumes flat.  We've dropped our operational expenses by $200 from Q2 to Q3. We dropped them by $200 from Q1 to Q2 before that. And we're now at a place where those operational expenses are actually lower than where they were in Q1, \u201821, and lower by about $100, give or take, versus Q1, \u201821. That's good, but it doesn't sound like it's incredible progress, but I think it's much better when you take into account the fact that there's clearly been quite a bit of inflation over that time.  I think based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data, labor on average has been up by approximately 11% over that period. When we do the best job that we can to compare our progress to that of other automotive retailers, generally speaking, we're seeing several hundred dollars of increases in SG&A per unit over that time period. And so I think that the gains that we've made are pretty significant. And then the sum of those things, I think, ultimately adds up to our unit economics. And then we do think that puts us in an incredibly powerful position. That gives us a lot of options in the future. I'm not sure that we are exactly sure the ways in which we will express those options, but it undoubtedly gives us a lot of options. On your second question, I would just say, the last several years have been very unique. I think there's been a ton of distortions in the market that have made things a little bit harder to kind of precisely forecast. Last year we saw rates going up quite a bit. In \u201821 we saw in the fourth quarter in \u201821 we saw prices going up quite a bit.  So, I think it's a little bit hard to know exactly what to expect out of seasonality. I do think over the last four weeks, given all the data sources that we have, we can see kind of industry-wide data. It looks like things have probably been a bit softer, not to a degree that I think is unique or merits a ton of attention, but definitely that's been the direction.  And so we'll see where that goes. Like I said, I think it's a little bit hard to even figure out exactly what seasonality should be right now given all the changes we've seen over the last couple of years.\nMichael Baker: Great. Thank you. Fair enough. I appreciate the color. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot, and good afternoon. So my question is, when you pivot to growth for the first couple quarters that you do that, do you think that your leverage \u2013 your excess capacity will more than offset the cost to support that growth in terms of advertising, staffing, vehicle acquisition and operational inefficiencies that could result? \nErnie Garcia: So let me start with just pointing to history. Well, let me start with our expectations. Our expectations are that we expect our operational expenses to go down from here over time and we think they can go down despite growing over time and we expect our corporate expenses per unit to absolutely go down as we grow. So those are our expectations.  In the data we provided, we provided a chart that kind of breaks out our operational expenses per unit going back in time all the way to Q1, 2018. And I do think looking at the period from Q1, 2018 through Q1, 2021 is somewhat useful.  During that period, we were supporting 70% annualized growth continually. We were adding many, many markets. We were adding many, many inspection centers. We were building the machine of Carvana as we were going and we did not have excess capacity to grow into and we were able to hold those expenses roughly flat.  I think if you look at them, you'll see variation to the tune of a couple hundred dollars. There's kind of an outlier data point as COVID hit. But in general, they were relatively flat. And then you'll also see that there were even some gains as we headed into the better seasonal parts of the year as well.  So I think that's pretty clear evidence that we've done this before. We've supported very high rates of growth and we've grown in a way that is more difficult, because we weren't growing into existing infrastructure. We were building infrastructure as we went. So we don't think that it's obvious that there need to be meaningful expenses or expense increases in these line items as we turn to growth.  And overall, we absolutely expect there to be significant leverage. I think that's very clear in our GPUs and very clear in our operational expenses. When you look at the gap between those two things, there's a lot of room for growth to be extremely beneficial financially. \nSeth Basham: If that's the case, then I respect the decision to continue focusing on operational efficiency, but you're leaving a lot of opportunity on the table. So why not pivot to growth sooner rather than later? \nErnie Garcia: I think financially in the near term, that would likely be the right choice. I think the scale of the unit economic benefits that would come from growth, I think that likely would be the right choice over the next couple of quarters, however kind of long we're headed into that.  I think when you look at it over a longer period of time, there is a fixed cost to reorienting the entire business. I walked you through Project Catapult, which we kicked off 18 months ago, and Operation 100, which we kicked off approximately seven months ago.  Those are long-term projects with many underlying goals where the entire company is focused on driving different metrics in the right direction. And that focus has been tremendously beneficial, and we believe there are gains yet to be had. And so I think that points in this direction of discipline suggests let's keep getting those gains.  I don't mean to be defensive on this one, but I think if we go back in time even nine months ago, I think the average expectation consensus was on the order of $500 million of negative EBITDA this year. Well, it was kind of the expectation that people had for us, and over the last two quarters, it's been positive $300 million. That's obviously a tremendous difference, and I think that demonstrates the kind of value of that discipline, of setting clear goals and of marching toward them.  But again, I think basically on math, I think the answer is clear. We should turn to growth. We just think that on math over a longer period of time, we should harvest the gains that we're in position to get, and then we should turn to growth. And when we do, we'll be even more efficient than we would be today with even lower costs.\nSeth Basham: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Josey with Citi. Please go ahead. \nRon Josey : Thanks for taking the question, guys. Always good to hear from you. I wanted to ask too, please, Mark, in the presentation of the investor letter, the per unit insights were super helpful. As we think about, staying in Step 2 or when do we move to Step 3. I want to ask just about specifically I think we saw inbound transport costs declined $900 over the last 12 months on a per unit basis.  So we'd love to hear what drove those gains and how far away do you think we are to getting to that, like peak efficiency, maybe not just with just inbound transport costs, but just overall. I assume there's more ways to go. But we'd love your thoughts there.  And then, Ernie, as we think about, preparing ourselves for whenever the next step is, same day delivery is something that's super interesting. We'd love to hear just early results for now and I think two or three states and cities. We'd love to hear any insights on how that might be driving greater conversion rates and really just how the network is positioned to support same day delivery. Thank you. \nMark Jenkins: Sure. Ron, well, let me start with your first question. So I think what you're referring to is, in the last 12 months we have reduced our reconditioning plus inbound transport costs by about $900. I think that's a very significant win and one of the progress points that we're very excited about when we're thinking about the progress that we're making in Step 2.  I think what were some of the drivers of that? So I think if we start focusing on reconditioning, in-sourcing was probably the single biggest driver. So basically taking services that had previously been provided by third parties in the inspection and reconditioning centers and taking them in-house and doing them ourselves, and that obviously saves costs and allows to have better control of the process. So I think that's been a big win.  In addition, I think we've gotten better at standardizing processes, making sure we're properly normalized at our staffing levels. We've made some big gains in proprietary inspection and reconditioning center software, including fully in-sourcing our inventory management system. I think that's a big win and a big improvement that allows us much better control of the process and allows us to really have, again, clear standards and processes that are executed on every single car that's rolling through the facilities.  We've also made gains automating parts procurement. It used to be a highly manual process and a highly more variable process than it is today. So I think we've made big wins there in the proprietary software development department.  So those are a few of the places where we've made real gains in reconditioning. I would note that we do see opportunities for further gains in those areas that I just pointed to in recon. We don't think we're done. We do see opportunities for further gains in reconditioning costs per unit.  Moving to inbound transport, I think a couple of the sources of gains there are, getting better at logistics network utilization, as well as having lower inbound miles. And so both of those things I think have also led to declines in inbound transport costs.  Now, one thing I did want to call out is there's actually two $900 improvements that are of note. I just talked about, and I think your question was focused on the $900 gains in retail cost of sales. However, we also have an additional $900 of significant gains in our operational selling general and administrative expenses. And that's, we've broken out some detail on that in our shareholder letter as well as the accompanying materials. And so in total, that's $1,800 of total gains in those more variable cost components.  If I just say a few words about the gains. That second $900 of cost gains, I think, that has also been very broad based. So that would include cost improvements, for example, in our customer care centers. It would include cost improvements in our market operations, which is our last mile delivery network. It would include cost gains in our logistics and transportation departments, which house the logistics network that moves cars around for us.  And we've made very significant gains in some of those operational areas as well. Those have been driven by process automation, improved staffing and scheduling, better proprietary logistics route management, and activity pairing software. We've made some real improvements, both in terms of processes and technology, that have driven that second $900 of unit economics improvement, and that one being since Q4 2022.  So I think obviously we're very excited about all that. $1,800 in reductions on a per unit basis in the more variable components of the cost structure, I think is something we feel really great about and is part of the reason that we're so excited about what we're doing here in Step 2, before we transition to take advantage of our excess capacity and return to profitable growth. \nErnie Garcia: Yeah, and I'm going to jump on that for a second as well before heading to same-day delivery. What I would also say is, those gains are very high-quality gains. Those aren't cutting corner gains. During this period we've seen warranty claims, for example, go down. So we've seen frequency of warranty claims go down, while we've been driving down reconditioning expenses.  A lot of the cost savings that Mark is talking about are actually making the customer experience better. The scheduling benefits in logistics means that we're delivering cars faster, we have fewer pushes. When customers are calling advocates, calls per sale are down approximately a third year-over-year. We've seen calls per advocate \u2013 sorry, sales per advocate have doubled year-over-year.  We're seeing benefits across the board in title and registration. We've seen very significant changes as well. 75% increase in efficiency per hour of work in title registration. Year-over-year, 15% increase quarter-over-quarter. So a lot of these things are also just making the customer experience better. And during that period, we've seen NPS go up as a result. So I think these are deep, fundamental, real gains. They are not tradeoff gains and so we're extremely excited about them.  Heading to same-day delivery, I think same-day delivery is a very good example of one of these projects internally that we've been working on, that is sort of a little fuzzy in terms of what is the ultimate goal. Is it Step two or Step three? And clearly it can play a role in both.  The way that we've been executing that to-date, first of all, as you said it's in a small subset of markets. So I don't want to get everyone too excited about this one just yet. But the way we've been executing it to-date, has more been aimed at efficiency gains. There are times when customers change their delivery date or they cancel a spot that they've previously booked and were not able to book that for another customer.  By adding same-day delivery, we can kind of fill in those empty slots. And so we can offer faster delivery to our customers, and we also can do it more efficiently, because we fill in time that would have otherwise been wasted. And so that's generally how we've rolled that out.  We're also just beginning to test same-day purchasing from customers as well, where they can go to our website, they can get a value for their car, they can bring the car to us. We've actually had customers complete that process on the order of one hour from kind of being on the website to getting a check from us as they dropped off their car at one of our vending machines.  So we are working on those things. I think those are exciting things. Today they're aimed at efficiency. Tomorrow they certainly could be aimed at growth. In order to do that, I think it would just have some implications for our staffing models. I think whenever you're trying to offer very rapid delivery times, the fundamental tradeoff there is always just between sort of efficiency and kind of excess capacity and time. But we don't expect those costs to be super high, but they will require focus, and we'll decide again how to use those fundamental gains as we head into step three. \nRon Josey : Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Ernie. \nErnie Garcia: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Rajat Gupta with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. \nRajat Gupta: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. The third quarter units saw a bigger pickup than I guess what you had guided to, what you were expecting. It seems it was a little better than the normal seasonality the industry experiences.  So I'm curious, like, what drove the pickup there? Was it just aided by the industry or anything you were experimenting internally? As you think about moving from Step 2 to Step 3, and why is that a reversing here in the fourth quarter? Is it, again, like a refocus on the operations or is it just more purely just industry pressures that you're facing? And I have a quick follow-up. Thanks. \nErnie Garcia: I think the simplest way to think about Step 2 is that during Step 2 we're effectively setting up the company to be kind of neutral to industry volume changes, whether that's seasonality or otherwise. And so I think, Q3 was great from a unit perspective. I think that was largely driven by seasonality. I don't think there was a ton of specific stuff that we were doing that was aimed at growth. In the quarter there may have been some benefits from some of the other projects we had, but there weren't gains that were aimed at growth.  I think heading into Q4, we again expect to kind of roughly move with industry, because we are remaining in Step 2 and we're keeping the settings of the business fairly neutral. So I think normally there's seasonal decrease in Q4. We expect that to occur.  Again, I think most importantly, kind of the unit range that we expect is very much in line with what we've seen over the last several quarters. And we think that that's a reasonable unit range for us to continue to make gains as we power through step two and get ready for step three. \nRajat Gupta: Understood. That's helpful. And just a quick one on just the financing and the ABS markets. We have seen spreads widen a bit, benchmark rates have gone up. How does that change your thinking around monetization in the fourth quarter? I believe you still have a bit of a backlog, from earlier this year that needs to be cleared.  You talked about holding on to more residuals going forward. I mean, is that something, we should expect to start seeing this quarter already? And just maybe like just broader thoughts on how we should think about the finance or other GPU from Q3 to Q4. Thanks. \nErnie Garcia: Sure. I think there are \u2013 certainly all the changes you pointed to are reasonable. There's been some kind of choppiness, I think across all financial markets over the last many months, and I think that that's shown up in benchmarks, its shown up in spreads.  As we have in the past, we would expect others to be passing that on to the consumers, and we would expect to do the same. So generally speaking, I don't think that we have a tremendously different expectation there.  I think in terms of our general monetization plan, I think that first order, our plans remain the same. The plan that we've had in place has been very good for a very long period of time. Even in this last quarter we had four securitizations that we were pretty happy with. I think we still have room to improve our effective cost of funds, those securitizations, and I think if we were kind of achieving industry best cost of funds there, there would be another kind of area where we would have significant improvements in our unit economics, and over time we absolutely expect that to be the case.  I think we also are clearly in a different capital position than we've been in quite a while. Most importantly, the improvement in that capital position is led by the gains that we're seeing across the business that led to $300 million of EBIT dollars over the last two quarters. And then we're in a good liquidity position with the business operating the way that it is. So I think that we are now communicating that we will be more open to maintaining residuals in the future.  We'll see exactly what forms that takes over time. I think there are lots of forms that can take, but we view that as an opportunity as well.  In general, they are very high-quality assets, these auto loans we generate, and the residuals offer, pretty significant returns that are very robust to increases in expected losses. And I think it's a tried and true strategy for many in the industry to maintain those residuals and get paid pretty handsomely for it. So we think that's an interesting opportunity. We'll start to explore. We would like to maintain the right to do that flexibly over time, but that may be a change. \nRajat Gupta: Understood. Great. Thanks for the call, and good luck. \nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. \nChris Bottiglieri: Yes, thanks for taking the question. So I just want to \u2013 I kind of want to clarify the new disclosure on the auto overhead expense. So your supplemental deck shows its $141 million, excluding DNA its $45 million. Is this largely the same bucket expenses as the $172 of other expenses in the core P&L?  And I guess the way you're framing it, it sounds like the vast majority of this $141 million plus the DNA are fixed, and that you need growth to scale. Is that the correct \u2013 Is that the correct way to frame it? Like how much of that is actually fixed versus variable? Because when I look at the way you define other expenses in the queue and just commentary given the past, it's IT, it's corporate occupancy, its professional services, it's insurance, its limited warranty, its credit losses, customer swag. Like some of those stuff sounds variable, and some of it sounds like you could cut it if you were structured.  So kind of tell me the sense of how you're thinking about that bucket from a fixed versus variable perspective going forward. \nMark Jenkins: Sure. I'll take that one. So I think to hit the question very simply, the overhead expenses of $141 million are not the same as other SG&A expenses that we've historically reported. That new slide on overhead expenses per unit and also in dollar terms is intended to capture the more fixed components of both, compensation and benefits, as well as the more fixed components of other SG&A expenses.  And so just to give some sense of what that is in compensation and benefits, that would be your corporate teams, accounting, legal, some of the more general and administrative-oriented corporate teams. It would also be your technology teams. So I think there, product, engineering, data science, those compensation benefits expenses would be included in that new overhead slide that we provided.  When you move to the other SG&A component, some of the expenses that underlie our historical other SG&A expense that would then be included in this new overhead expense measure would include facilities expenses. It would include some technology expenses, and then it would also include some non-payroll, other general and administrative expenses. And so that's just to give a sense. And most importantly, with respect to the setup of your question, clarify that that is not \u2013 the new overhead expense measure is not a parallel or proxy for that other SG&A.  Now, in terms of the question, what component of overhead expenses are fixed and what component are variable? So those expenses we view as primarily fixed. There are some semi-variable components. For example, a few corporate departments may vary somewhat with units. Certain technology expenses may vary somewhat with units. But for the most part, those expenses are heavily fixed, and we think we have the ability to lever those expenses very significantly over time.  And just to give a little bit more color on that last point, one of the reasons why we are really excited about the leverage opportunity that we see in front of us is our existing capacity utilization. And so as you probably saw in the shareholder letter or the accompanying materials, we have built and currently own significantly more capacity, whether it's in our inspection and reconditioning centers or our logistics network, even our corporate office or not even corporate, but more sort of customer care center office space.  We own significantly more capacity than we are utilizing today. We think that gives us an opportunity to increase retail unit volume significantly, while levering those overhead expenses meaningfully in the process. \nChris Bottiglieri: I got you. Okay. So it sounds like its very much growth dependent. I mean, kind of leads to like a related follow-up. But I know you're not willing to give guidance at this point for growth, but from our shoes, how do we think about growth? I mean, the market's a little bit depressed, call it 10, 12 points. I think there's probably some supply scarcity that's caused you to lose market share that gets better over the next two, three, four years.  But beyond that, like what are the \u2013 you have your tangible growth drivers like prime now like delivery, but how do you get to this 40%, 50% to 200% unit growth that you need to lever these fixed costs? Like what gives you comfort that you can get there? And from our shoes, like how do we model that? Like what does that mean for an investor? \nErnie Garcia: So, let me throw you that one. Let me start with this. I mean, I think until we really start to grow, these are all conceptual arguments and everyone has to decide kind of what they believe and what their expectation is, but I'll start with ours.  We expect to sell millions of cars. That has been our goal since the beginning. That is our absolute expectation, and I think a question to ask across time is, what has really changed versus the first eight years of our life where we grew very, very quickly? Because I think that it's as hard to answer that question as it is or harder to answer that question than it is to answer how are we going to grow from here?  During the early parts of our life, we grew at triple digit rates for a very long time and that took many forms. It took \u2013 but I think the most exciting forms were basically a migration of people's preferences toward e-commerce. It was a building of the car model brand. It was the positive feedback inherent in our business model.  We are a business model that gets better as it gets bigger, and so it is true that when we grow inventory, selection goes up, conversion goes up. When conversion goes up, your advertising costs go down. You spend more on advertising, you sell more cars. That allows you to carry more inventory and there are several other examples of that as well.  So I think those persistent drivers of growth led us to grow by multiples over an eight-year period of time. And then I think over the last year and a half, we've clearly been in a highly distorted environment, and I think that makes it a little bit harder to kind of read through and take the current trend lines and figure out exactly how to extend them.  But we don't think anything fundamental has changed, and we think that we put a lot of pressure on ourselves over the last 18 months as we focused on getting more efficient. And just to use those same terms, the primary form that's taken is we've shrunk our inventory by 50%, meaning that our selection of customers has gone down, and we've pulled back on marketing spend by 50%, and those things have fed back negatively.  So, I think when it's time to restart the engine, we expect that our offering will be received the same way that it was before. We expect that positive feedback will once again show up, and we expect that some of those things will lead to us selling millions of cars again in the future.  I think we've spoken in the past about the distortions of the market that we're in today, and I think that can sound a bit conceptual and kind of unclear. But, I think, our statistic that I think is useful to think about as it relates to, how have things changed over the last 18 months, and is the last 18 months really the timeframe we should be looking at to extrapolate the long-term potential of Carvana, should we be looking at the earlier periods.  Pre-pandemic, the average car that we sold was approximately a three-year-old car, and that car was for sale for approximately $19,500. More recently, the average car that we've sold has been 5.7 years old, and it's been sold for $25,000. That's a dramatically different situation, and I think there's many, many reasons for that.  One is, there was obviously a huge supply chain disruption. Most fundamental is it was a huge supply chain disruption that led to car prices going up relative to other goods. It remains the case today that for consumers buying cars, they are spending approximately 50% more per month by the same car than they were pre-pandemic.  They are spending on the order of 10% more on everything else they are buying. So cars have gotten relatively less affordable, and that of course has a very large impact. Our expectation would be that at some point in the not-too-distant future as supply chains get resolved, cars will probably have a similar cost relative to other goods as they had for a very long period of time before, and that's a very big difference that we would expect.  I think it's also useful to note that one of the other reasons why the average car that we're selling today is 5.7 years old versus 3 years old is because an entire portion of supply that we used to have ready access to, which was maybe two portions of supply, off-lease and off-rental, that we used to have ready access to, have largely evaporated because of the distortions that are driven by the price increases over the last year and a half, give or take.  And the reason for that is that all the cars that are coming back off-lease today, those were leases that roughly, if we assume the average lease is 36 months, they were leases that were written three years ago. Three years ago, car prices were in a completely different spot, and so the expected value of cars being returned was in a completely different spot. And as those cars are being returned today, every dealer where those cars are landing is very smartly picking those cars up and benefiting handsomely to the tune of thousands of dollars per unit from all those cars that are showing up on their lot.  And so basically, off-lease cars are just not flowing through auction today. And because the OEMs have been constrained, there are very few rental cars that have been flowing through auction today.  So those are big, big distortions that lead to a meaningful change in the portion of the market that we are accessing, but I don't think that there are strong arguments that we should expect that to persist over any meaningful period of time. And I think there have already been early signs of some normalization. We've seen depreciation pick up a little bit more recently. We would love to see that continue.  I think there is nothing that will lead to the normalization of the market more quickly than car prices coming back into line with where they historically were or even close to where they historically were. And so I think we very much look forward to that. But as those distortions unwind, I think the more likely scenario, or at least our belief, and everyone can make up their own mind, is that we're back in the world that we were for eight years before. And in that world, we have in offering customers love. We have a highly differentiated model.  We have a ton of infrastructure that we can grow into. We have a business that gets better as it gets bigger. We have a team that is hustling fast and has always hustled fast and has changed the direction of that hustle over the last 18 months, but is ready to change it back, and we're going to go hit our goals.  So I think when we look forward, we don't know exactly what the growth rates are going to be. We're not ready yet to provide that. I think it's going to depend on all sorts of factors, macro factors, industry factors, our own execution. But we do expect it to be considerable, and our expectations for the future are absolutely unchanged versus what they were before. \nChris Bottiglieri: Got you. Very clever. Thank you, Ernie. \nErnie Garcia: Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nMichael Montani : Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask if I could, if you could discuss a little bit what you saw in terms of the wholesale market, both with respect to volumes, but then also I think some of the relatively wide spreads between wholesale and retail that you referenced and if there's any update into October on that front?\nMark Jenkins: I can take that one. So I do think we saw an increase in wholesale market depreciation in Q3 relative to what we were seeing in Q2. I do think the way that flows through our business, it certainly impacts wholesale GPU, where the cars that we're buying from customers that are wholesale eligible experience a little bit more depreciation.  That tends to push down margins, and then that can also flow through to volume, if we adjust in order to take into consideration updated depreciation expectations. And so I would say that's probably \u2013 that's the pattern that we saw in Q3 and then the most important impact that it had on our business.  I think if you move to the retail market, I guess I would also say the retail depreciation that we saw in Q3, based on our data, was actually the highest level of retail depreciation that we've seen in the third quarter going back at least through 2018. So it really was a somewhat unusual quarter for retail depreciation, and so that definitely had an impact on our retail GPU.  I think we feel particularly pleased with our retail GPU in light of the fact that we saw many year highs in retail depreciation in the quarter. And so that was just to add a little bit more color. Another dynamic that we saw in Q3 was elevated retail depreciation in addition to elevated wholesale depreciation. \nMichael Montani: That's great. And just to follow-up on some of the commentary about focusing on enhancing levels of profitability, how \u2013 I guess how urgent or how much opportunity do you see potentially, Mark, kind of over the next two years to potentially start eating into the debt stack to avoid some of the higher interest payments a couple years out? \nMark Jenkins: So I think our most important priority, and this has been the way we've thought about our most important priorities for many years running now, is improving the operations of the business. And obviously we've made tremendous gains there.  As we pointed out, the last couple of quarters generated over $300 million of adjusted EBITDA, of which on the order of 100 was one-time items. But that still leads to a very significant generation of adjusted EBITDA over just the last couple quarters, with we believe, opportunities for further improvement in unit economics as we continue on with our Step 2 initiatives.  And so I think our focus is going to be on continuing to improve the fundamental strength of the business, continuing to make progress on unit economics in Step 2, and then when it's time to return to Step 3, taking advantage of our significant excess capacity to efficiently grow, while also significantly levering overhead expenses. And we believe that combination leads to growth, being profitable growth that I think we're very excited about. \nMichael Montani: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please go ahead. \nDaniel Imbro : Hey, good evening everybody. Maybe I wanted to add two follow-ups on inventory. Maybe first just on inventory efficiencies. So retail GPU, I guess partially is benefiting from just carrying fewer cars, having less depreciation. Do you think Carvana can keep this near 66 days of inventory as we return to growth? Like, have we learned to be more efficient with days on hand or will we need to build that inventory back before we can return to that unit growth? \nMark Jenkins: So I would offer a couple of perspectives on that. One, I think during some very significant growth years prior to the pandemic, we operated in a low to mid-60s average day sales. In some quarters, it even ticked down to the high 50s. So I think we feel very comfortable operating in this range of average day sales, and indeed have done so for many years while executing very high growth rates. So I think that would be the most important point on that particular question. \nDaniel Imbro : Got it, okay. And then maybe a follow-up on inventory. As we think about off-lease availability, Ernie, you just talked about returning supply. But if the average lease is 36 months, we're about to come up on a period where fewer units were sold and fewer leases were generated. And so if we don't get back to pre-pandemic off-lease for a couple of years, I guess, what other sources can you lean into to support that growth? \nErnie Garcia: Sure. So yeah, first of all, I think you're right. So just to set the table, I think lease rates were relatively consistent through at least the beginning of 2021. And then I think as you headed through 2021, lease rates dropped to about half what they were prior as a percentage of new car sales by the end of 2021. And so as we head into 2024, the number of cars coming off-lease will decrease. That is correct.  We view that first and foremost as a positive, and the reason is because those off-lease cars have not been making it to us. So first order, the effective way to think about our access to off-lease cars over the last year and a half has been that it has been roughly zero. And so we have not benefited from the existence of those cars coming off-lease.  And I think as we head to a comp period, as we head into 2021, another thing that happens kind of in another dimension is we start to comp over periods where car prices were higher. So the expected value of those cars were higher, and so the expected residual value of those cars were higher. And therefore, they are kind of less valuable cars relative to expectation that are showing up on dealers' lots, and therefore most likely, less likely to be held by dealers and so they will probably start to flow downstream to us.  So, I think we view that as a definite positive, because it gives us access to additional inventory. We also think that that same dynamic has probably been something of a competitive headwind for us over time, because there's been a single channel of cars that was just materially better priced than all other channels of cars that were in a competitive market, which is either buying at auction or buying from customers, which is where we've been sourcing cars. And so we think with that kind of competitive headwind being pulled away from us, that's also positive. So, we look forward to that.  I think the point that lease rates going down may change some of the dynamics across the sum of the industry. If we move away from just kind of Carvana specific impacts or independent dealer-specific impacts to the entire industry, I think that point is correct, that fewer cars coming back will change things.  But what you have to keep in mind is, those cars were still sold in 2021. Just a larger proportion of them were sold with a loan or with cash. And so what ends up happening then is instead of having a scheduled return of that car to the used car market in three years, you instead have kind of a customer making a decision about when do they want to get their next car, and that will of course have a distribution over time. But in general, customers still desire to swap between cars. And so we do ultimately expect those cars to come back into the market at the industry level as well, maybe just with a little wider distribution of time.  So just to summarize that again, I think these points about the kind of impacts that may occur over the next couple years to the sum of the used retail market, because of reductions in new car sales or reductions in lease volumes, we believe those are correct for the sum of the market.  We believe that they are actually benefits to us and to other independent dealers, who have effectively been locked out of access to those cars over an extended period of time. So we look forward to that and we view it as the alleviation of a competitive headwind. \nDaniel Imbro : Understood. I appreciate the color.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ernie Garcia for any closing remarks. \nErnie Garcia: Great. Well, thanks everyone for joining the call. To the Carvana team, thank you. This is another incredible quarter. I said it in four or five different forums already, but I want to keep repeating it. I think it was incredibly hard for anybody to see us making the kind of progress that we've made over the last 12 months from the perspective of 12 months ago. And that's because we've stayed focused, it\u2019s because we've kept our heads down, it's because of the incredible work that you've done, and we couldn't be more grateful. Let's make sure we keep doing it. Let's make sure that we learn the lessons that we learned over the last 24 months and just become a better version of ourselves into perpetuity.  Thank you. We'll talk to you guys all again next quarter. \nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Meg, and thanks everyone for joining the call. The third quarter was another great quarter for Carvana that continued the clear momentum we've had since we rolled out our plan 18 months ago. Over that period of time we have cut $1.2 billion in annualized SG&A expenses out of the business, which has dramatically improved our efficiency, while also reducing annualized inbound transport and reconditioning COGs expenses by about $250 million annualized, which has driven up our GPU.  These efforts have combined to powerful effect. Over the last two quarters, we have generated $300 million of adjusted EBITDA, with about $200 million of that excluding non-recurring items. These are important numbers. They send a clear message that the plan our team laid out 18 months ago was the right one. They send a clear message that our team is executing at a very high level. And most importantly, they send a clear message about the long-term power of our business model.  Since we went public in 2017, we have been clear about our goals to sell millions of cars and to become the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. Two years ago, there was a general belief in our ability to become the largest, but the questions remained about our ability to be the most profitable. While those two questions won't be definitively answered until we actually cross both milestones, the last two quarters provide a lot of support for our belief that we will ultimately be the most profitable automotive retailer as well.  In today's shareholder letter, we are providing clear evidence of this with our breakouts of our overhead and operational expenses over time. The takeaways from the data are the following:  One, in Step 1, we successfully right-sized the operational components of the business and began making significant progress in reducing our operational expenses per unit.  Two, our efficiency gains are continuing in Step 2, with our unit economics rapidly becoming a significant competitive advantage.  And three, our current fixed-cost utilization is low, providing a very clear path to both significant scale and significant cost leverage when we turn to Step 3 of our plan.  Our plan is working, and we are going to see it through. While it is unquestionably tempting to turn our attention back to growth, we believe it is a better long-term decision to remain disciplined and continue harvesting the efficiency gains we see in front of us before shifting our organizational focus and moving on to Step 3.  In the fourth quarter, we expect to continue making fundamental gains through various projects that comprise Step 2. We also expect volumes to reduce relative to Q3 due to normal seasonality and potential industry softening observed over the last four weeks. Despite this, we continue to operate in our target unit range for Step 2. The sum of these dynamics leads us to expect to produce another great quarter, but as in past Q4s, we expect lower industry-wide volume, coupled with higher industry-wide depreciation rates to cause lower adjusted EBITDA than we have achieved in the past two quarters. Looking forward, we are excited. The difficulty of 2022 wasn't how we imagined our path in the beginning, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good for us. Through it, we have come together to do our best work. We have learned the power of focus. We have gained a new appreciation for discipline. We have learned an even greater sense of urgency. And now, as a result, we have competitively differentiated unit economics.  2022 has added to our arsenal. It has made us better. And while that is a change, there is a lot that remains exactly the same. We are still an ambitious group of people who care. We are still willing to roll up our sleeves and do the hard work to achieve our goals. We are still delivering new experiences to people buying and selling cars that they love.  We still have a business model that is incredibly difficult to replicate and that mechanically gets better as it gets bigger. We are still just a small player in the largest retail market in the world, and we are still on the path to selling millions of cars and becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer.  The march continues. Mark. Sure. I would say you can see that we've pushed down our dollar spend pretty consistently over the last several quarters. I think we're extremely happy with the dollar reduction this last quarter that we saw. It came in the form of basically a $200 operational expense saving per unit, and kind of that being offset by roughly 5,000 additional units quarter-over-quarter. So we're clearly making pretty significant gains there.  I think that we absolutely believe that through Step 2 we have additional gains to be made. We expect those gains to be across the board, both in our corporate expenses and in operational expenses. But I think as far as kind of that detail of disclosure, we're going to stick with the guidance that we've provided. Sure. So let me start with \u2013 I think roughly a year and half since we kicked of with this plan. We internally called that Project Catapult. And basically everyone across the business had a series of goals in every operational group that they were aiming to hit, many of them with monthly targets and most of them with weekly targets that we were marching to basically through Q2 of this year.  We also then kicked off what we call Operation 100, which is the next series of our goals across every single one of our operational groups. That also has very clear targets, some of them monthly and most of them weekly, through Q2 of next year.  I think that has clearly led to tremendous gains. That level of focus the discipline that we've had, of making sure that we are maintaining operational excellence and that across all locations in the company we're performing at the best level of any locations across the company. I think it's clearly led to tremendous benefits and I think that focus has been very, very valuable.  So I think the most important thing that we will do is in time to turn to growth and Step 3 is basically to just reset the entire company focus on growth goals. So I think instead of everyone being focused on, how am I going to drive additional efficiency and all those targets, being focused on how are we going to get more efficient as a business, they'll instead be focused on how do we make customer experiences even better? How do we drive growth? How do we position the company to grow? And so I think that is the number one thing that we will switch when we move to Step 3 from Step 2.  I think the gains that we're seeing are still very significant and so we believe it makes sense to stick in Step 2 for a bit longer. I think when it is time to grow, I think advertising, inventory are absolutely two very big parts of that equation. I think we grew from 2018 Q1 through \u201821 Q1 at approximately a 70% CAGR.  During that entire time, we were clearly growing inventory pretty quickly. That was leading to increased conversion. We are growing advertising pretty quickly. I think that was partially because those customers converted even more efficiently as a result of that extra inventory and our brand was building. And so we benefited from positive feedback throughout that entire period.  Over the last 18 months, the opposite has been true. Over the last 12 months, we've shrunk inventory by 50% and we've shrunk advertising by 50% and that's clearly pushed a bit in the opposite direction. But when it's time to grow, we expect to again grow inventory. We expect to again grow advertising. I think there are other elements of positive feedback that we expect to kick off as well, and we think that that will drive a big part of that growth. Sure, so let me start with that. I think unit economics we view as a competitive advantage. So I think I would extend that not just to cost structure, which we'll hit in a moment, but also to GPU.  I think a huge advantage of our business model across all of time has been our vertical integration. We're able to give customers a very high quality, very simple experience, and we're able to monetize much more of that experience than many others in the industry as a result of that vertical integration.  And I think those benefits are showing up very clearly in our GPU. We just had record Q3 GPU on the order of $6,000. We had record Q2 GPU as well. So I think unit economics start there and we're able to achieve those GPUs despite giving our customers significant discounts versus many of the largest players in this industry. So I think that's the starting point, I think, of the power of our model.  I think now if we kind of fold that into expenses, you can see the gains that we've made in operational expenses. We're extremely proud of that. That's obviously not a super easy thing to do, especially while holding volumes flat.  We've dropped our operational expenses by $200 from Q2 to Q3. We dropped them by $200 from Q1 to Q2 before that. And we're now at a place where those operational expenses are actually lower than where they were in Q1, \u201821, and lower by about $100, give or take, versus Q1, \u201821. That's good, but it doesn't sound like it's incredible progress, but I think it's much better when you take into account the fact that there's clearly been quite a bit of inflation over that time.  I think based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data, labor on average has been up by approximately 11% over that period. When we do the best job that we can to compare our progress to that of other automotive retailers, generally speaking, we're seeing several hundred dollars of increases in SG&A per unit over that time period. And so I think that the gains that we've made are pretty significant. And then the sum of those things, I think, ultimately adds up to our unit economics. And then we do think that puts us in an incredibly powerful position. That gives us a lot of options in the future. I'm not sure that we are exactly sure the ways in which we will express those options, but it undoubtedly gives us a lot of options. On your second question, I would just say, the last several years have been very unique. I think there's been a ton of distortions in the market that have made things a little bit harder to kind of precisely forecast. Last year we saw rates going up quite a bit. In \u201821 we saw in the fourth quarter in \u201821 we saw prices going up quite a bit.  So, I think it's a little bit hard to know exactly what to expect out of seasonality. I do think over the last four weeks, given all the data sources that we have, we can see kind of industry-wide data. It looks like things have probably been a bit softer, not to a degree that I think is unique or merits a ton of attention, but definitely that's been the direction.  And so we'll see where that goes. Like I said, I think it's a little bit hard to even figure out exactly what seasonality should be right now given all the changes we've seen over the last couple of years. So let me start with just pointing to history. Well, let me start with our expectations. Our expectations are that we expect our operational expenses to go down from here over time and we think they can go down despite growing over time and we expect our corporate expenses per unit to absolutely go down as we grow. So those are our expectations.  In the data we provided, we provided a chart that kind of breaks out our operational expenses per unit going back in time all the way to Q1, 2018. And I do think looking at the period from Q1, 2018 through Q1, 2021 is somewhat useful.  During that period, we were supporting 70% annualized growth continually. We were adding many, many markets. We were adding many, many inspection centers. We were building the machine of Carvana as we were going and we did not have excess capacity to grow into and we were able to hold those expenses roughly flat.  I think if you look at them, you'll see variation to the tune of a couple hundred dollars. There's kind of an outlier data point as COVID hit. But in general, they were relatively flat. And then you'll also see that there were even some gains as we headed into the better seasonal parts of the year as well.  So I think that's pretty clear evidence that we've done this before. We've supported very high rates of growth and we've grown in a way that is more difficult, because we weren't growing into existing infrastructure. We were building infrastructure as we went. So we don't think that it's obvious that there need to be meaningful expenses or expense increases in these line items as we turn to growth.  And overall, we absolutely expect there to be significant leverage. I think that's very clear in our GPUs and very clear in our operational expenses. When you look at the gap between those two things, there's a lot of room for growth to be extremely beneficial financially. I think financially in the near term, that would likely be the right choice. I think the scale of the unit economic benefits that would come from growth, I think that likely would be the right choice over the next couple of quarters, however kind of long we're headed into that.  I think when you look at it over a longer period of time, there is a fixed cost to reorienting the entire business. I walked you through Project Catapult, which we kicked off 18 months ago, and Operation 100, which we kicked off approximately seven months ago.  Those are long-term projects with many underlying goals where the entire company is focused on driving different metrics in the right direction. And that focus has been tremendously beneficial, and we believe there are gains yet to be had. And so I think that points in this direction of discipline suggests let's keep getting those gains.  I don't mean to be defensive on this one, but I think if we go back in time even nine months ago, I think the average expectation consensus was on the order of $500 million of negative EBITDA this year. Well, it was kind of the expectation that people had for us, and over the last two quarters, it's been positive $300 million. That's obviously a tremendous difference, and I think that demonstrates the kind of value of that discipline, of setting clear goals and of marching toward them.  But again, I think basically on math, I think the answer is clear. We should turn to growth. We just think that on math over a longer period of time, we should harvest the gains that we're in position to get, and then we should turn to growth. And when we do, we'll be even more efficient than we would be today with even lower costs. Yeah, and I'm going to jump on that for a second as well before heading to same-day delivery. What I would also say is, those gains are very high-quality gains. Those aren't cutting corner gains. During this period we've seen warranty claims, for example, go down. So we've seen frequency of warranty claims go down, while we've been driving down reconditioning expenses.  A lot of the cost savings that Mark is talking about are actually making the customer experience better. The scheduling benefits in logistics means that we're delivering cars faster, we have fewer pushes. When customers are calling advocates, calls per sale are down approximately a third year-over-year. We've seen calls per advocate \u2013 sorry, sales per advocate have doubled year-over-year.  We're seeing benefits across the board in title and registration. We've seen very significant changes as well. 75% increase in efficiency per hour of work in title registration. Year-over-year, 15% increase quarter-over-quarter. So a lot of these things are also just making the customer experience better. And during that period, we've seen NPS go up as a result. So I think these are deep, fundamental, real gains. They are not tradeoff gains and so we're extremely excited about them.  Heading to same-day delivery, I think same-day delivery is a very good example of one of these projects internally that we've been working on, that is sort of a little fuzzy in terms of what is the ultimate goal. Is it Step two or Step three? And clearly it can play a role in both.  The way that we've been executing that to-date, first of all, as you said it's in a small subset of markets. So I don't want to get everyone too excited about this one just yet. But the way we've been executing it to-date, has more been aimed at efficiency gains. There are times when customers change their delivery date or they cancel a spot that they've previously booked and were not able to book that for another customer.  By adding same-day delivery, we can kind of fill in those empty slots. And so we can offer faster delivery to our customers, and we also can do it more efficiently, because we fill in time that would have otherwise been wasted. And so that's generally how we've rolled that out.  We're also just beginning to test same-day purchasing from customers as well, where they can go to our website, they can get a value for their car, they can bring the car to us. We've actually had customers complete that process on the order of one hour from kind of being on the website to getting a check from us as they dropped off their car at one of our vending machines.  So we are working on those things. I think those are exciting things. Today they're aimed at efficiency. Tomorrow they certainly could be aimed at growth. In order to do that, I think it would just have some implications for our staffing models. I think whenever you're trying to offer very rapid delivery times, the fundamental tradeoff there is always just between sort of efficiency and kind of excess capacity and time. But we don't expect those costs to be super high, but they will require focus, and we'll decide again how to use those fundamental gains as we head into step three. Thank you. I think the simplest way to think about Step 2 is that during Step 2 we're effectively setting up the company to be kind of neutral to industry volume changes, whether that's seasonality or otherwise. And so I think, Q3 was great from a unit perspective. I think that was largely driven by seasonality. I don't think there was a ton of specific stuff that we were doing that was aimed at growth. In the quarter there may have been some benefits from some of the other projects we had, but there weren't gains that were aimed at growth.  I think heading into Q4, we again expect to kind of roughly move with industry, because we are remaining in Step 2 and we're keeping the settings of the business fairly neutral. So I think normally there's seasonal decrease in Q4. We expect that to occur.  Again, I think most importantly, kind of the unit range that we expect is very much in line with what we've seen over the last several quarters. And we think that that's a reasonable unit range for us to continue to make gains as we power through step two and get ready for step three. Sure. I think there are \u2013 certainly all the changes you pointed to are reasonable. There's been some kind of choppiness, I think across all financial markets over the last many months, and I think that that's shown up in benchmarks, its shown up in spreads.  As we have in the past, we would expect others to be passing that on to the consumers, and we would expect to do the same. So generally speaking, I don't think that we have a tremendously different expectation there.  I think in terms of our general monetization plan, I think that first order, our plans remain the same. The plan that we've had in place has been very good for a very long period of time. Even in this last quarter we had four securitizations that we were pretty happy with. I think we still have room to improve our effective cost of funds, those securitizations, and I think if we were kind of achieving industry best cost of funds there, there would be another kind of area where we would have significant improvements in our unit economics, and over time we absolutely expect that to be the case.  I think we also are clearly in a different capital position than we've been in quite a while. Most importantly, the improvement in that capital position is led by the gains that we're seeing across the business that led to $300 million of EBIT dollars over the last two quarters. And then we're in a good liquidity position with the business operating the way that it is. So I think that we are now communicating that we will be more open to maintaining residuals in the future.  We'll see exactly what forms that takes over time. I think there are lots of forms that can take, but we view that as an opportunity as well.  In general, they are very high-quality assets, these auto loans we generate, and the residuals offer, pretty significant returns that are very robust to increases in expected losses. And I think it's a tried and true strategy for many in the industry to maintain those residuals and get paid pretty handsomely for it. So we think that's an interesting opportunity. We'll start to explore. We would like to maintain the right to do that flexibly over time, but that may be a change. Thank you. So, let me throw you that one. Let me start with this. I mean, I think until we really start to grow, these are all conceptual arguments and everyone has to decide kind of what they believe and what their expectation is, but I'll start with ours.  We expect to sell millions of cars. That has been our goal since the beginning. That is our absolute expectation, and I think a question to ask across time is, what has really changed versus the first eight years of our life where we grew very, very quickly? Because I think that it's as hard to answer that question as it is or harder to answer that question than it is to answer how are we going to grow from here?  During the early parts of our life, we grew at triple digit rates for a very long time and that took many forms. It took \u2013 but I think the most exciting forms were basically a migration of people's preferences toward e-commerce. It was a building of the car model brand. It was the positive feedback inherent in our business model.  We are a business model that gets better as it gets bigger, and so it is true that when we grow inventory, selection goes up, conversion goes up. When conversion goes up, your advertising costs go down. You spend more on advertising, you sell more cars. That allows you to carry more inventory and there are several other examples of that as well.  So I think those persistent drivers of growth led us to grow by multiples over an eight-year period of time. And then I think over the last year and a half, we've clearly been in a highly distorted environment, and I think that makes it a little bit harder to kind of read through and take the current trend lines and figure out exactly how to extend them.  But we don't think anything fundamental has changed, and we think that we put a lot of pressure on ourselves over the last 18 months as we focused on getting more efficient. And just to use those same terms, the primary form that's taken is we've shrunk our inventory by 50%, meaning that our selection of customers has gone down, and we've pulled back on marketing spend by 50%, and those things have fed back negatively.  So, I think when it's time to restart the engine, we expect that our offering will be received the same way that it was before. We expect that positive feedback will once again show up, and we expect that some of those things will lead to us selling millions of cars again in the future.  I think we've spoken in the past about the distortions of the market that we're in today, and I think that can sound a bit conceptual and kind of unclear. But, I think, our statistic that I think is useful to think about as it relates to, how have things changed over the last 18 months, and is the last 18 months really the timeframe we should be looking at to extrapolate the long-term potential of Carvana, should we be looking at the earlier periods.  Pre-pandemic, the average car that we sold was approximately a three-year-old car, and that car was for sale for approximately $19,500. More recently, the average car that we've sold has been 5.7 years old, and it's been sold for $25,000. That's a dramatically different situation, and I think there's many, many reasons for that.  One is, there was obviously a huge supply chain disruption. Most fundamental is it was a huge supply chain disruption that led to car prices going up relative to other goods. It remains the case today that for consumers buying cars, they are spending approximately 50% more per month by the same car than they were pre-pandemic.  They are spending on the order of 10% more on everything else they are buying. So cars have gotten relatively less affordable, and that of course has a very large impact. Our expectation would be that at some point in the not-too-distant future as supply chains get resolved, cars will probably have a similar cost relative to other goods as they had for a very long period of time before, and that's a very big difference that we would expect.  I think it's also useful to note that one of the other reasons why the average car that we're selling today is 5.7 years old versus 3 years old is because an entire portion of supply that we used to have ready access to, which was maybe two portions of supply, off-lease and off-rental, that we used to have ready access to, have largely evaporated because of the distortions that are driven by the price increases over the last year and a half, give or take.  And the reason for that is that all the cars that are coming back off-lease today, those were leases that roughly, if we assume the average lease is 36 months, they were leases that were written three years ago. Three years ago, car prices were in a completely different spot, and so the expected value of cars being returned was in a completely different spot. And as those cars are being returned today, every dealer where those cars are landing is very smartly picking those cars up and benefiting handsomely to the tune of thousands of dollars per unit from all those cars that are showing up on their lot.  And so basically, off-lease cars are just not flowing through auction today. And because the OEMs have been constrained, there are very few rental cars that have been flowing through auction today.  So those are big, big distortions that lead to a meaningful change in the portion of the market that we are accessing, but I don't think that there are strong arguments that we should expect that to persist over any meaningful period of time. And I think there have already been early signs of some normalization. We've seen depreciation pick up a little bit more recently. We would love to see that continue.  I think there is nothing that will lead to the normalization of the market more quickly than car prices coming back into line with where they historically were or even close to where they historically were. And so I think we very much look forward to that. But as those distortions unwind, I think the more likely scenario, or at least our belief, and everyone can make up their own mind, is that we're back in the world that we were for eight years before. And in that world, we have in offering customers love. We have a highly differentiated model.  We have a ton of infrastructure that we can grow into. We have a business that gets better as it gets bigger. We have a team that is hustling fast and has always hustled fast and has changed the direction of that hustle over the last 18 months, but is ready to change it back, and we're going to go hit our goals.  So I think when we look forward, we don't know exactly what the growth rates are going to be. We're not ready yet to provide that. I think it's going to depend on all sorts of factors, macro factors, industry factors, our own execution. But we do expect it to be considerable, and our expectations for the future are absolutely unchanged versus what they were before. Thank you. Sure. So yeah, first of all, I think you're right. So just to set the table, I think lease rates were relatively consistent through at least the beginning of 2021. And then I think as you headed through 2021, lease rates dropped to about half what they were prior as a percentage of new car sales by the end of 2021. And so as we head into 2024, the number of cars coming off-lease will decrease. That is correct.  We view that first and foremost as a positive, and the reason is because those off-lease cars have not been making it to us. So first order, the effective way to think about our access to off-lease cars over the last year and a half has been that it has been roughly zero. And so we have not benefited from the existence of those cars coming off-lease.  And I think as we head to a comp period, as we head into 2021, another thing that happens kind of in another dimension is we start to comp over periods where car prices were higher. So the expected value of those cars were higher, and so the expected residual value of those cars were higher. And therefore, they are kind of less valuable cars relative to expectation that are showing up on dealers' lots, and therefore most likely, less likely to be held by dealers and so they will probably start to flow downstream to us.  So, I think we view that as a definite positive, because it gives us access to additional inventory. We also think that that same dynamic has probably been something of a competitive headwind for us over time, because there's been a single channel of cars that was just materially better priced than all other channels of cars that were in a competitive market, which is either buying at auction or buying from customers, which is where we've been sourcing cars. And so we think with that kind of competitive headwind being pulled away from us, that's also positive. So, we look forward to that.  I think the point that lease rates going down may change some of the dynamics across the sum of the industry. If we move away from just kind of Carvana specific impacts or independent dealer-specific impacts to the entire industry, I think that point is correct, that fewer cars coming back will change things.  But what you have to keep in mind is, those cars were still sold in 2021. Just a larger proportion of them were sold with a loan or with cash. And so what ends up happening then is instead of having a scheduled return of that car to the used car market in three years, you instead have kind of a customer making a decision about when do they want to get their next car, and that will of course have a distribution over time. But in general, customers still desire to swap between cars. And so we do ultimately expect those cars to come back into the market at the industry level as well, maybe just with a little wider distribution of time.  So just to summarize that again, I think these points about the kind of impacts that may occur over the next couple years to the sum of the used retail market, because of reductions in new car sales or reductions in lease volumes, we believe those are correct for the sum of the market.  We believe that they are actually benefits to us and to other independent dealers, who have effectively been locked out of access to those cars over an extended period of time. So we look forward to that and we view it as the alleviation of a competitive headwind. Thank you. Great. Well, thanks everyone for joining the call. To the Carvana team, thank you. This is another incredible quarter. I said it in four or five different forums already, but I want to keep repeating it. I think it was incredibly hard for anybody to see us making the kind of progress that we've made over the last 12 months from the perspective of 12 months ago. And that's because we've stayed focused, it's because we've kept our heads down, it's because of the incredible work that you've done, and we couldn't be more grateful. Let's make sure we keep doing it. Let's make sure that we learn the lessons that we learned over the last 24 months and just become a better version of ourselves into perpetuity.  Thank you. We'll talk to you guys all again next quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our third quarter highlighted the significant and sustainable progress we have made on our path to profitability. We set third quarter company records for total GPU and adjusted EBITDA, both with and without nonrecurring benefits.  As part of our earnings materials, we provide a detailed look into our Q3 results, our three-step plan, and the components of our cost structure. I'll start by summarizing three key takeaways.  First, in the last two quarters, we have clearly demonstrated the profitability of our online business model. In Q2 and Q3, we generated more than $300 million of adjusted EBITDA, which includes approximately $110 million of non-recurring items. We did this despite carrying costs of an infrastructure that supports 3x retail unit growth, and despite a difficult used vehicle industry backdrop.  Second, our focus on driving fundamental operating efficiency in Step 2 is generating significant unit economics gains. Of particular note, we have reduced non-vehicle retail cost of sales and operations expenses by $1,000 per retail unit in just the last two quarters, and we see opportunities for further gains from here.  Third, we have significant excess capacity in our existing infrastructure to support multiples of profitable growth. We expect this growth to be paired with significant operating leverage as we leverage our underutilized overhead costs.  Moving to our third quarter results. In the third quarter, retail units sold totaled 80,987, a decrease of 21% year-over-year and an increase of 6% sequentially. Total revenue was $2.773 billion, a decrease of 18% year-over-year and a decrease of 7% sequentially.  As we've previously discussed, our long-term financial goal is to generate significant GAAP net income and free cash flow. In service of this goal, in the near term, our management team remains focused on driving progress on a set of key non-GAAP financial metrics that are inputs into this long-term goal, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP SG&A expense, and adjusted EBITDA.  Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our remaining remarks on sequential changes in these metrics.  In the third quarter, non-GAAP total GPU was $6,396, a sequential decrease of $634 driven primarily by smaller benefits from non-recurring items. Total GPU in Q3 was positively impacted by approximately $500 of non-recurring benefits, which we describe in more detail below, compared to approximately $900 of benefits in Q2.  Non-GAAP retail GPU was $2,877 versus $2,862 in Q2. Sequential changes in retail GPU were positively impacted by a $250 reduction in non-vehicle retail cost of sales and a 25 day reduction in retail average days of sale, both at the favorable end of our previous outlook range, as well as wider spreads between retail and wholesale market prices, partially offset by higher retail depreciation rates and a smaller inventory allowance adjustment benefit compared to Q2. Notably, our strengthened retail GPU continues to be driven by several fundamental improvements in our business compared to our previous high watermark of FY 2021, including lower reconditioning and inbound transport costs, a higher customer sourcing rate, and higher revenue from additional services.  Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $951, in line with our outlook, versus $1,228 in Q2. Sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by higher wholesale market depreciation rates in Q3 compared to Q2, which negatively impacted wholesale vehicle volume and gross profit for wholesale units sold, as well as seasonal changes in wholesale marketplace volume.  Non-GAAP other GPU was $2,568 versus $2,940 in Q2. We estimate that a higher than normalized volume of loans held and sold in Q3 increased other GPU by approximately $400, other things being equal, compared to a $650 benefit in Q2. In addition, other GPU in Q3 was primarily impacted by lower origination rates relative to benchmark interest rates, partially offset by lower credit spreads.  In Q3, we continue to make progress lowering SG&A expenses, reducing non-GAAP SG&A expense by $13 million sequentially. Notably, we reduced non-GAAP SG&A expense per retail unit by more than $400 sequentially, while growing retail units sold by 6%.  In our shareholder letter and accompanying materials, we provide additional details on the components of our SG&A expense, including a breakdown of operations expenses, which are more variable in nature, and overhead expenses, which are more fixed in nature.  Our significant sequential operating leverage in Q3 was driven by both continued improvement in operational expenses, as well as leverage in the fixed component of our cost structure. Adjusted EBITDA in Q3 was positive $148 million or 5.3% of revenue. The aggregate impact to adjusted EBITDA of the previously described nonrecurring items was approximately $40 million. On September 1, 2023, we closed the previously announced corporate debt exchange offer with 96.4% of note holders agreeing to exchange $5.52 billion of our unsecured notes for cash and new secured notes, reducing total debt by over $1.325 billion, extending maturities and decreasing required cash interest payments by more than $455 million per year for the next two years.  On September 30, we had approximately $3.2 billion in total liquidity resources, including $1.6 billion in cash and availability under revolving facilities and $1.6 billion in secured debt capacity and unpledged beneficial interests.  Turning now to our fourth quarter outlook. While the macroeconomic and industry environment continues to be uncertain, looking toward the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect the following as long as the environment remains stable. A sequential decline in retail units sold, driven primarily by industry and seasonal patterns, non-GAAP total GPU above $5,000 for the third consecutive quarter, and positive adjusted EBITDA for the third consecutive quarter. Looking toward 2024, we expect to drive significant total GPU and adjusted EBITDA for the second consecutive year. We are excited about the path we are on, and we look forward to making continued progress toward our goal of becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. Sure. Ron, well, let me start with your first question. So I think what you're referring to is, in the last 12 months we have reduced our reconditioning plus inbound transport costs by about $900. I think that's a very significant win and one of the progress points that we're very excited about when we're thinking about the progress that we're making in Step 2.  I think what were some of the drivers of that? So I think if we start focusing on reconditioning, in-sourcing was probably the single biggest driver. So basically taking services that had previously been provided by third parties in the inspection and reconditioning centers and taking them in-house and doing them ourselves, and that obviously saves costs and allows to have better control of the process. So I think that's been a big win.  In addition, I think we've gotten better at standardizing processes, making sure we're properly normalized at our staffing levels. We've made some big gains in proprietary inspection and reconditioning center software, including fully in-sourcing our inventory management system. I think that's a big win and a big improvement that allows us much better control of the process and allows us to really have, again, clear standards and processes that are executed on every single car that's rolling through the facilities.  We've also made gains automating parts procurement. It used to be a highly manual process and a highly more variable process than it is today. So I think we've made big wins there in the proprietary software development department.  So those are a few of the places where we've made real gains in reconditioning. I would note that we do see opportunities for further gains in those areas that I just pointed to in recon. We don't think we're done. We do see opportunities for further gains in reconditioning costs per unit.  Moving to inbound transport, I think a couple of the sources of gains there are, getting better at logistics network utilization, as well as having lower inbound miles. And so both of those things I think have also led to declines in inbound transport costs.  Now, one thing I did want to call out is there's actually two $900 improvements that are of note. I just talked about, and I think your question was focused on the $900 gains in retail cost of sales. However, we also have an additional $900 of significant gains in our operational selling general and administrative expenses. And that's, we've broken out some detail on that in our shareholder letter as well as the accompanying materials. And so in total, that's $1,800 of total gains in those more variable cost components.  If I just say a few words about the gains. That second $900 of cost gains, I think, that has also been very broad based. So that would include cost improvements, for example, in our customer care centers. It would include cost improvements in our market operations, which is our last mile delivery network. It would include cost gains in our logistics and transportation departments, which house the logistics network that moves cars around for us.  And we've made very significant gains in some of those operational areas as well. Those have been driven by process automation, improved staffing and scheduling, better proprietary logistics route management, and activity pairing software. We've made some real improvements, both in terms of processes and technology, that have driven that second $900 of unit economics improvement, and that one being since Q4 2022.  So I think obviously we're very excited about all that. $1,800 in reductions on a per unit basis in the more variable components of the cost structure, I think is something we feel really great about and is part of the reason that we're so excited about what we're doing here in Step 2, before we transition to take advantage of our excess capacity and return to profitable growth. Sure. I'll take that one. So I think to hit the question very simply, the overhead expenses of $141 million are not the same as other SG&A expenses that we've historically reported. That new slide on overhead expenses per unit and also in dollar terms is intended to capture the more fixed components of both, compensation and benefits, as well as the more fixed components of other SG&A expenses.  And so just to give some sense of what that is in compensation and benefits, that would be your corporate teams, accounting, legal, some of the more general and administrative-oriented corporate teams. It would also be your technology teams. So I think there, product, engineering, data science, those compensation benefits expenses would be included in that new overhead slide that we provided.  When you move to the other SG&A component, some of the expenses that underlie our historical other SG&A expense that would then be included in this new overhead expense measure would include facilities expenses. It would include some technology expenses, and then it would also include some non-payroll, other general and administrative expenses. And so that's just to give a sense. And most importantly, with respect to the setup of your question, clarify that that is not \u2013 the new overhead expense measure is not a parallel or proxy for that other SG&A.  Now, in terms of the question, what component of overhead expenses are fixed and what component are variable? So those expenses we view as primarily fixed. There are some semi-variable components. For example, a few corporate departments may vary somewhat with units. Certain technology expenses may vary somewhat with units. But for the most part, those expenses are heavily fixed, and we think we have the ability to lever those expenses very significantly over time.  And just to give a little bit more color on that last point, one of the reasons why we are really excited about the leverage opportunity that we see in front of us is our existing capacity utilization. And so as you probably saw in the shareholder letter or the accompanying materials, we have built and currently own significantly more capacity, whether it's in our inspection and reconditioning centers or our logistics network, even our corporate office or not even corporate, but more sort of customer care center office space.  We own significantly more capacity than we are utilizing today. We think that gives us an opportunity to increase retail unit volume significantly, while levering those overhead expenses meaningfully in the process. I can take that one. So I do think we saw an increase in wholesale market depreciation in Q3 relative to what we were seeing in Q2. I do think the way that flows through our business, it certainly impacts wholesale GPU, where the cars that we're buying from customers that are wholesale eligible experience a little bit more depreciation.  That tends to push down margins, and then that can also flow through to volume, if we adjust in order to take into consideration updated depreciation expectations. And so I would say that's probably \u2013 that's the pattern that we saw in Q3 and then the most important impact that it had on our business.  I think if you move to the retail market, I guess I would also say the retail depreciation that we saw in Q3, based on our data, was actually the highest level of retail depreciation that we've seen in the third quarter going back at least through 2018. So it really was a somewhat unusual quarter for retail depreciation, and so that definitely had an impact on our retail GPU.  I think we feel particularly pleased with our retail GPU in light of the fact that we saw many year highs in retail depreciation in the quarter. And so that was just to add a little bit more color. Another dynamic that we saw in Q3 was elevated retail depreciation in addition to elevated wholesale depreciation. So I think our most important priority, and this has been the way we've thought about our most important priorities for many years running now, is improving the operations of the business. And obviously we've made tremendous gains there.  As we pointed out, the last couple of quarters generated over $300 million of adjusted EBITDA, of which on the order of 100 was one-time items. But that still leads to a very significant generation of adjusted EBITDA over just the last couple quarters, with we believe, opportunities for further improvement in unit economics as we continue on with our Step 2 initiatives.  And so I think our focus is going to be on continuing to improve the fundamental strength of the business, continuing to make progress on unit economics in Step 2, and then when it's time to return to Step 3, taking advantage of our significant excess capacity to efficiently grow, while also significantly levering overhead expenses. And we believe that combination leads to growth, being profitable growth that I think we're very excited about. So I would offer a couple of perspectives on that. One, I think during some very significant growth years prior to the pandemic, we operated in a low to mid-60s average day sales. In some quarters, it even ticked down to the high 50s. So I think we feel very comfortable operating in this range of average day sales, and indeed have done so for many years while executing very high growth rates. So I think that would be the most important point on that particular question."

Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial metrics for our reported results can be found in our shareholder letter issued today, a copy of which can be found on our IR website.  And now with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thanks, Meg. And thanks, everyone, for joining the call on such short notice. Let me start with the most important takeaways in this quarter. It was a great quarter for Carvana, and we're nowhere near the end. We are making rapid progress because of the power of our customer offering, the strength of our business model, and the quality of our people. The fundamentals are what is making it possible. We're going to sustain the intensity of the last 18 months by maintaining our operating focus for the foreseeable future and embedding it further into our culture. 18 months ago, we were positioned aggressively for growth. We were then hit with a combination of macroeconomic, industry, operational, and capital market impacts that when combined, put us under considerable pressure and demanded a reprioritization of our efforts. So that's what we did. We reoriented the business with a simple three-step plan. Number one, drive the business to positive adjusted EBITDA; number two, drive the business with significant positive unit economics. And number three, after completing steps one and two, return to growth.  In the second quarter, we completed the first step. We are extremely proud of the speed of this progress. In the last year, we've taken $1.1 billion of annualized expenses out of the business, and this quarter, we set records in GPU and adjusted EBITDA margin with total adjusted EBITDA dollars over $150 million. These numbers benefited from significant nonrecurring items that collectively added about $900 to GPU and $70 million to adjusted EBITDA. But even when controlling for these nonrecurring items, the results were exceptional. Today, the company is functioning better than it ever has. We're more efficient and we are improving at a faster pace than we ever have in the past.  This improvement spans the entire business, from customer-facing improvements, including the early testing of same-day delivery in a subset of markets that have inspection centers to product improvements that enable us to buy more cars from our customers more efficiently to process changes and developments that are making us more efficient across every operating group in the company, and we plan to keep up our pace. With the results and capital structure changes being discussed today, a natural question is how does this change the plan? The short answer is that it doesn't. We plan to continue operating in the same way with the same urgency to continue to drive efficiencies that we expect to result in sustainable significantly positive adjusted EBITDA. From there, we will once again turn our attention to growth as we did successfully for the first eight years of our history. Our opportunity is as great as it has ever been. Our customers love our offering and our business is efficient, highly differentiated, scalable, and extremely difficult to replicate. We remain firmly on the path to selling millions of cars per year and to becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. The march continues. Mark?\nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our second quarter results demonstrate significant progress on our path to profitability. We significantly exceeded our goal of driving positive adjusted EBITDA and we set a company record for total GPU. These second quarter milestones complete step one of our three-step plan to drive positive free cash flow, and we are now in step two. driving repeated and significant unit economics. In the second quarter, retail units sold totaled 76,530, a decrease of 35% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Similar to past quarters, our decline in retail units sold, which we expected, was driven by four primary factors: reduced inventory size, reduced advertising, increased benchmark interest rates and credit spreads, and a continued focus on executing our profitability initiatives. Total revenue was $2.968 billion, a decrease of 24% year-over-year and an increase of 14% sequentially. As we've previously discussed, our long-term financial goal is to generate significant GAAP net income and free cash flow. In service of this goal, in the near term, our management team remains focused on driving progress on a set of key non-GAAP financial metrics that are inputs into this long-term goal, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP SG&A expense, and adjusted EBITDA. Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our remaining remarks on sequential changes in these metrics. In the second quarter, non-GAAP total GPU was $7,030, a sequential increase of $2,234, driven by increases in retail and other GPU. The Total GPU in Q2 was positively impacted by approximately $900 nonrecurring benefits, which we described in more detail later in this remark. Non-GAAP retail GPU was $2,862 versus $1,591 [ph] in Q1. Retail GPU included an approximately $250 benefit due to an adjustment to our retail inventory allowance. In addition, sequential changes in retail GPU were primarily driven by lower average days of sale, lower retail market depreciation rates, wider spreads between wholesale and retail market prices, and lower reconditioning and inbound transport costs. This retail GPU in Q2 was driven by several fundamental improvements in our business as well as some seasonal end market tailwinds. On the fundamental gain side, retail GPU was driven by normalizing inventory size as well as several key areas of improvement compared to FY 2021, including a higher customer sourcing rate, higher revenue from additional services, and lower reconditioning and inbound transport costs. On the seasonal and market dynamics side, Q2 is on average, the strongest quarter of the year for retail GPU. In addition, this year saw a period of high spreads between wholesale and retail market prices followed by lower-than-expected retail depreciation, which benefited retail GPU in Q2, other things being equal. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $1,228 versus $1,236 in Q1. Sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by higher wholesale market depreciation rates in Q2 compared to Q1 and which negatively impacted wholesale vehicle gross profit per wholesale unit sold largely offset by operational improvements that allowed us to handle more wholesale units sold volume. Non-GAAP other GPU was $2,940 versus $1,969 in Q1. Sequential improvement in other GPU was primarily driven by a greater volume of loans sold in Q2 compared to Q1. We estimate that a higher-than-normalized volume of loans held and sold in Q2 increased other GPU by approximately $650, other things being equal. Sequential changes in other GPU were also driven by higher origination interest rates relative to benchmark interest rates and higher average loan size. In Q2, we continue to make progress lowering SG&A expenses, reducing non-GAAP SG&A expense by $21 million sequentially, primarily driven by continued reductions in non-advertising expenses. Advertising expenses in Q2 were approximately flat compared to Q1. We expect Q1 to be our near-term low point on quarterly advertising expense as we continue to seek to optimize our spend to balance unit volume and profitability. We believe the cost reductions we've achieved over the past year are long-lasting and sustainable, and we believe we have further efficiencies to realize in all areas. Looking forward, we see three primary drivers to reduce SG&A per retail unit sold. First, in step two of our three-step plan, which is drive significant unit economics, we continue to see opportunities to reduce operations expenses on a per retail unit sold basis by completing our pipeline of projects to automate manual work, optimize staffing and routing, increased deep funnel conversion among other initiatives. Second, also in step two of our three-step plan, we continue to see opportunities to reduce and optimize our corporate technology and facilities expenses on an absolute dollar basis through a continued focus on zero-based budgeting and other efficiency gains. Third, in step three of our three-step plan, which is returned to growth, we see a significant opportunity to leverage our corporate technology and facilities expense base, leading to significant leverage on a per retail unit sold basis at higher volumes. Adjusted EBITDA was positive $155 million in Q2 or 5.2% of revenue. The impact to adjusted EBITDA of the previously described nonrecurring items was approximately $70 million, including a $50 million benefit from selling and holding additional loans and a $20 million benefit from our retail inventory allowance. Moving now to our third quarter outlook. While the macroeconomic and industry environment continues to be uncertain, looking toward Q3, expect the following as long as the environment remains stable. On retail units, we currently expect similar retail units sold in Q3 compared to Q2. On GPU, we currently expect non-GAAP total GPU above $5,000. On SG&A, we expect similar non-GAAP SG&A expense in Q3 compared to Q2. We continue to see opportunities to further reduce non-GAAP SG&A expenses over time.  Finally, we expect to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in Q3 for the second consecutive quarter, further demonstrating the first step in our three-step plan toward positive free cash flow. We see upside to these total GPU and adjusted EBITDA numbers, but given the early date of this earnings call within the quarter, we are electing to provide a conservative outlook. On June 30, we had approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity resources including $1.5 billion in cash and revolving availability and $2 billion in unpledged real estate and other assets, including more than $1 billion of real estate acquired with ADESA. Today, we announced the transaction support agreement with over 90% of holders of our senior unsecured notes to exchange approximately $5.2 billion of those senior unsecured notes for new senior secured notes with maturities ranging from December 2028 through June 2031.  The strong performance of our business in 2023 presented an opportunity for a win-win transaction for Carvana and its senior unsecured noteholders. The transaction reduces our total debt by over $1.2 billion, reduces our cash interest expense by over $430 million per year over the next two years, and extends more than 83% of our 2025 and 2027 senior unsecured note maturities, giving us significant flexibility to execute our plan toward driving positive free cash flow.  Thank you for your attention. We will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from Ron Josey with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRonald Josey: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I want to talk just about demand trends overall, and I'm sure we'll get into the debt restructuring, but Ernie talk just about inventory that overall, I believe that was down in December, the [indiscernible] for most of the days inventory. I'm wondering how that compares to overall demand out there as you supply improving, I guess, is the question. And are you seeing any signs of -- I think that Mark energy companies with more stable environment, just to use car dynamics, any insights on the broader macro would be helpful. Thank you, guys.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, let's start with the inventory component of that question. I think inventory is down year-over-year by over 50%. I believe something in the over 55%. It was down again quarter-over-quarter. We've really been pushing that down in an effort to align our inventory size with sales volumes. And I think you can really see that flowing through the benefits of that into retail GPU. I think we had a pretty incredible by any measure, retail GPU quarter.  And I think there are a number of components of that, but one of the largest, certainly over the last six to nine months has been reducing inventory and kind of aligning our sales volumes with where inventory was. We could have faster turn times and therefore, less depreciation. I think the environment remains an environment of elevated prices and elevated interest rates and more difficult affordability for customers. I think there are certainly signs today of depreciation. I think depreciation right now looks very similar to depreciation last year, although it's probably been pulled forward maybe a month. It's happening a little faster than last year.  And so, I think we'll see how that unfolds through the rest of this year. I think our view on that is -- the probably best-case scenario for our business would be pretty significant depreciation that is foreseen. I think foreseen depreciation enables the market to organize kind of in the wholesale market to buy cars at sufficiently high margins to where you can absorb that depreciation, and it doesn't impact the business in a material way. But then that also leads to better affordability for customers. And I think that's what we would hope for and I think the signs that we're seeing right now are at least weekly aligned with that. From a broader demand perspective, I'm not sure we have a ton more to add.\nRonald Josey: Ernie, that's super helpful. And just a real quick one on inventory front users. I think you said you're back to above 2021 levels and process improvement has helped there. Speaking about inventory, any insights on that stock improvement.\nMark Jenkins: Yes. So, on inventory, we've reduced inventory size very significantly since the beginning of 2022. And I think what that has done is it has placed our inventory size now relative to sales volumes. That ratio is now back much more normalized levels. I think we call it in the shareholder letter. If you just compare the inventory that we had on hand at the end of the second quarter to the second quarter retails units sold that ratio is in implied term time about 62 days, which is in sort of a normal range that we've operated in, in the past.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMichael Montani : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Yes. I just wanted to ask, first off, if I could, just for some updates in terms of what you're seeing on the depreciation side. in the wholesale market. And basically, on the total GPU front, you had mentioned over $5,000 for the quarter, is that basically what you just produced is 7 [ph] less than roughly $900 of nonrecurring? Or could we see additional nonrecurring again this quarter.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So really quickly on the depreciation side. I think depreciation is clearly elevated as discussed before. I think so far, that's happened in an orderly way, and it seems like the wholesale market is positioned to kind of absorb that depreciation and then be able to pass that through to the retail market. So, we haven't yet seen that impacting retail spreads in a way that would be meaningful. And then I think the GPU number for this quarter is just a truly incredible number, and I think there are so many components that go into it. We did benefit first from about $900 of nonrecurring items that included the fact that we sold more receivables than we originated as a result of also holding those receivables we earned additional interest on those receivables and then we did have a release of inventory allowance as well that ended up being about $250 of retail GPU benefit. But when removing that, it was still $6,000 which is a number that I think was unimaginable for the vast majority of our history and completely unimaginable from the perspective of even three months ago, six months ago. And I think there's been so many incredible improvements across the business. We really have reoriented the business and we've got an operating cadence that has many different teams extremely focused on efficiency in every aspect of the business from the ways that we're acquiring cars, the ways that we're shipping cars, to the distances that we're shipping cars, to the way that we're managing how those cars get put on to trucks, the way that we're reconditioning cars in our finance program. We've made a number of additional enhancements. In the wholesale business, we've made a number of enhancements and improvements and are better utilizing ADESA. ADESA has also had a great quarter. They're on a great path, and that's flowing through to GPU as well. I think we've clearly seen market share in both the ADESA dealer business and the ADESA commercial business improve over the last many months. And the market, in general, is also just seeming at least like it's likely to start turning around as the market starts to normalize and we see more normal activity from rental fleets, and we're starting to get a sense that there could be off-lease volume starting to come back in the not-too distant future, even though we're not quite there yet. So, I just think across the business, there were a lot of improvements, and we think the majority of those improvements are sustainable. We called out that $900 nonrecurring items. There were some other benefits as well that flowed through -- Q2 is generally a good quarter for retail GPU in particular, based on seasonality. And then I do think that there was some unexpected appreciation early in the year. that wasn't at least in our plan, and so that benefited us a bit as well. But the vast majority of the gains that we're seeing, we believe are sustainable, and you can kind of see that expectation in our outlook.\nMark Jenkins: And then just to hit one additional point there. You asked about are there more nonrecurring items that we should expect. On that note, let me just talk for a moment about our finance receivables balance. So, on 3/31, we had about $1.6 billion of finance receivables on our balance sheet that we had built up over basically Q4 and Q1. As of 6/30 that was down to $1.1 billion. That $1.1 billion is certainly still higher than normalized. \u2013 so, we do have -- we continue to have additional loans that we can sell over the coming quarters that would sort of yield additional nonrecurring revenue in GPU.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham : Good morning. In your debt exchange, you're giving bondholders more security, including ADESA assets and higher interest rates tapping some value from the core business. Can you help us understand how you came to this agreement and how it's in the best interest of the company?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, first of all, I would say, I think we're extremely excited about the agreement we came to, and we believe it's great for both of us. And we believe that getting a win-win is never a trivially simple thing to do in life. But I think given the performance of the business, it created a lot of room for a win-win. And so, I think when we work there to try to achieve is years ago, when we took out our initial unsecured notes, we always had an option to either do unsecured debt or secured debt and we like it at the time to do unsecured debt and to preserve that collateral. Had with unsecured debt, our interest expense over the last several years would have been much lower. But we decided to preserve that collateral because we believe it could be valuable in certain circumstances. And I think this is a circumstance where that collateral is valuable. And so, what we were able to do is work together with our bondholders to find a solution that works well for them as we use that collateral to make their bonds stronger, and then we were able to take some of that benefit and extend our maturities and reduce our overall debt burden and also give us a lot of freedom financially, especially over the next several years from an interest perspective. So, I think overall, that was -- that's a great deal for us. We're extremely excited about it. And I think I would be remiss if I didn't also note that I think the group bondholders was very productive to work with. Someone that I respect once that the world is full of optimizers and not enough solution providers. And I will say that, of course, everyone wanted to make sure they got a fair deal there. And of course, you're dealing with incredibly intelligent people but what you read in the media is not correct. They were very much solution oriented. And I think we came to a solution that was great for everyone.\nSeth Basham : That's helpful. And just as a follow-up in terms of your plan to sell equity, how quickly could we see that? And are you aiming to do as much as $1 billion in the very short term?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, our plan is to do $350 million of equity, and that's kind of built into our plan. inside of that, the family would do approximately $125 million there'll be about $225 million going out into the market. We've also put out a larger ATM, which we believe is just kind of good corporate housekeeping in general -- and we think that's true for most companies. It's certainly true for a company as volatile as ours in terms of stock price. And for a company that has as high-quality use of proceeds built into the business as we do. Another aspect of the agreement we came to with noteholders is we have highly desirable prepayment capabilities built into those notes. And so, I think that gives us a lot of optionality to the extent we raise more over time, the family commitment decreases. But that's kind of the options that we've got in front of us.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Ben Johnson with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Johnson : Can you guys talk a little bit more about your ability to source vehicles from customers rather than wholesale? And what's kind of the main driver of that?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. And I think this is a fundamentally important element of our business. I think, first and foremost, we've built a transactional website that customers can go to that gets a tremendous amount of traffic and a tremendous amount of interest that enables us to get access to many, many customers. And then we built a process flow on the website that allows customers to get a value for their car in a minute that is extremely accurate and benefits from all of the data that we have on many different cars and all of our experience in valuing those cars.  And then we've got a process, I think, that is about as desirable as the process can be for a customer selling a car where they get the value on their computer or on their phone, they click a button and schedule a pick-up, and then we come to them, we pick it up. We've built a number of enhancements in that process that have made us much more efficient and enable us to also differentiate vehicle value better and then pass some of those benefits on to our customers. And then we buy those cars, we bring them back and then we take them to our inspection centers. We plan to retail them and we prepare them for retail. And if we plan to wholesale them, we now have the ADESA asset where we can go take those cars and dispose of those cars.  And so, I think that platform overall, I think, is an extremely valuable platform. I think it's fundamentally very hard to replicate. It benefits very much from basically reverse retail transactions. It benefits from the existence of the retail disposition channel, and it benefits from the existence of the ADESA disposition channel. So, what we think that we're incredibly well positioned to continue to grow that business. And I think that you're seeing the benefits of that business and the strength of that business in our retail GPU numbers and our wholesale numbers this quarter.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Mike Baker at D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Baker: Hi. Thanks, guys. So hopefully, you can hear me. I just wanted to ask about top line. How much of your decline do you think is based on the market? And how much is based on your internal initiatives to focus more on profitability? In other words, I guess, what I'm getting at is -- how do you think about your markets right now? How has that changed? And how do you think about it going forward?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Let me start with this. I think for the first 8 years of our company existence, we grew at approximately 100% per year, we at a time when the market was flat. And so, I think that, that was possible because our customer offering is very high quality. Our business is very scalable. And I think we have a lot of incredible people to do a great job across the business, making sure that the customer experience is great. And that enabled us to grow very, very quickly over a sustained period of time without tailwinds from the market itself. I think over the last 1.5 years, our situation change pretty dramatically, and we reprioritize pretty significantly. And we focus a lot on getting to significantly better unit economics. And you're seeing the benefits of that focus as well. You see that in the $155 million of EBITDA that we just printed this quarter that I think -- from the perspective of six months ago, I don't know if there was anyone out there that had that in their model at that time. And I think what -- one way to think about that is just that this business that has very high quality fundamentals shifted its goal from growth to unit economics and profitability. And as a result, kind of those fundamental benefits flowed through in a different line item, but they flow through very, very quickly. And I think when it's time to turn back to growth, I think this is a group of people that knows how to do that. I think this is a business model that lends itself to that, both through the quality of the customer experience and through the scalability of the business model as well as I think something else the last 1.5 years has taught us that this is a very, very hard business to replicate. It's capital intensive. It is complicated. It's hard to get everything lined up and to do it well. So, I think when it's time, we'll be very well positioned. Now I do think that the market has provided additional headwinds aside from our shift in focus. But I don't think that those are the biggest drivers over the last 1.5 years. Today, used car sales in some total are probably 10% below their baseline. It's probably a reasonable way to think about it. So, at some point, when the market normalizes, that should be a tailwind, which will be nice, but I don't know that it will be that significant relative to the benefits that we plan to go get ourselves. And then I think that there's strong arguments that the independent market has been more impacted than the franchise market over the last 1.5 years. And so, I think that there's an argument that kind of our direct market has actually been impacted more than that 10%. So, I think at some point, as car prices normalize and interest rates normalize and affordability comes back. I think that there likely will be a rebound in the broader market. But I think most importantly, when it's time to grow, we'll take control of that, and we'll control our own destiny as we did in the past, and we'll push growth on our own, like we have before.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Very helpful. If I could follow up, you talked about the GPU and you talked about the one-time items, but -- so this is not a one-time item, but how sustainable is it the spread that you're seeing right now between retail prices and wholesale prices, I think the demand high indexed pricing is lower than it's been in two years. Does that normalize at some point? Or is that spread expected to continue in your GPU outlook?\nMark Jenkins: I'll take that one. So obviously, we had a very strong quarter from retail GPU in Q2, for some of the reasons that we pointed out as well as reasons that you just alluded to. I do think there were some market tailwinds there, but I think there's also some real fundamental gains that we've made that are important. And we do expect to have another strong quarter of retail GPU in Q3. Obviously, we won't have the allowance benefit in Q3 that we had in Q2. But we do expect a strong quarter for retail GPU. I think some of those fundamental gains just to enumerate them again, I think we're having a lot of success sourcing cars from customers. Ernie touched on that earlier in this call. We are generating revenue from some of the additional services that we provide to our customers. And we've really had a lot of success on the cost side of retail GPU. So, our fulfillment teams have been working to make the logistics network more efficient. We're really improving our inbound transport costs. We've been -- the inventory teams and the reconditioning teams ever have been really focused on cost efficiency in the inspection centers, and we've really pushed down over the last year, the reconditioning cost per retail unit sold. So, all the way such that those are down below full year 2021 levels. Even work in the inspection and reconditioning centers we're probably only operating at, say, on the order of 25% capacity, maybe a little bit more than that, but right around that order of magnitude, and yet costs in those centers is down below what it was in full year '21. So, I think those are some real fundamental success stories that we believe will drive strength in retail GPU.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nChris Bottiglieri: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, I just want to kind of clarify the cap structure. Can you give us a summation, you have $1.2 billion of debt -- net debt retiring? You're raising $350 million of equity that leaves roughly $700 million, $800 million gap. You're going to do ATM in the future. I can't tell if that's being used to pay down the debt. But can you maybe just clarify kind of like the gap between the $1.2 million and $350 million, and obviously, you have some receivables to sell still, and there's some cash on the balance sheet. Just trying to think how we bridge the two.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes. So, let me break that into two pieces. One is just talking about the capital structure and then second is talking about liquidity resources. So first, as it relates to capital structure. So, I think the basic framework that you laid out is correct. So, with the committed noteholders exchanging in the transaction support agreement will reduce total face value of notes by just slightly over $1.2 billion. A component of that is there will be some cash consideration paid to retire certain of the notes. And that's where this $350 million of equity comes in. That's part of the transaction support agreement. Again, we have -- basically, we have committed to raise $350 million of equity of which the Garcia have committed to put in $125 million. And then we're committed to raising $225 million elsewhere.  And so that will form a cash consideration that is part of the exchange. And then the remainder of the exchange is basically just exchanging existing senior unsecured notes for the tranches of new senior secured notes. I think some of the benefits of those senior secured notes, we talked about a bit on this call, but I think one really valuable benefit from our perspective is the option to pay -- pick interest for two years and also to -- we're essentially largely eliminating 2025 and 2027 maturities. So, after completing this exchange, we don't have a meaningful note maturity until December 2028. And -- and I think that's really great from a flexibility standpoint. We've obviously had a tremendous amount of success so far executing our three-step plan. We completed step one of it. moving on to step two of it and then step three of it will be returned to growth. And we have a lot -- an awful lot of flexibility over a many year time horizon to be executing that plan and really driving the business to very significant positive unit economics and volume. Now turning to your question about liquidity. So, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in total liquidity resources -- that was a mix of just over $500 million of cash and just under $1 billion of availability on existing revolvers. I think one thing to note about that number is our total -- our committed liquidity resources actually stepped up quarter-over-quarter. So, we actually increased our liquidity in the second quarter. And so, I think we feel like we're in a very good liquidity position with a lot of flexibility to execute our plan over a many year time horizon.\nErnie Garcia: And Chris, just to make sure one thing is clear because I couldn't tell how you're interpreting it from the question. The majority of that $1.2 billion of debt reduction is basically just the exchange of collateral for reduction in face of debt. It's not a cash paydown. So, we don't need to kind of tie out the full $1.2 billion reduction with cash that's -- the majority of that is just kind of value that is created by providing collateral to the bond.\nChris Bottiglieri : That's what I was asking. And just a quick follow-up. You have this $1 billion of ATM that you could theoretically take advantage of volatility. It seems like you could probably generate reported positive FCF because of the Pick feature, depending on your EBITDA levels moving forward for the next year. How do you think about future debt paydown? Is there a wiggle room if you do raise this equity that they would allow you to retire more of debt? How do you think about that?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes. So, I think there are multiple aspects of the new senior secured notes that do facilitate decreasing leverage. I think one is the 2028 notes have only a one-year no-call period. And so those can be called at only par plus half a coupon after one year. I think the 2030 notes also have a slightly shorter than typical no-call period, but just a two-year no-call period, and then that debt could be paid at par plus half a coupon. And so, I think those are a couple of features. I think the notes; the 2028 and 2030 notes also do allow prepayments to be made with proceeds from equity. That's another feature that enables the deleveraging. And so, I think there's many aspects of this debt exchange that I think worked well from the standpoint of capital structure and financial flexibility. I've talked about some of the interest components. We also talked about overall reduction in debt and the elimination of near-term maturities. But another, I think, is the ability to reasonably efficiently reduce leverage if we so desire.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRajat Gupta : Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a clarification on one of the prior questions. The $5,000 retail GPU for 3Q that does not assume additional backlog of -- receivables and backlog clearance. Is that correct? And if you do choose to do that, that's further upside to that? Just wanted to clarify that comment.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes. So, with the greater than $5,000 total GPU outlook for Q3, we didn't specify a specific volume of loans sold associated with that, greater than $5,000 GPU outlook. However, we did note in the shareholder letter that we do see upside to that $5,000 GPU number. And I think we also noted at the same time, we see upside to the positive adjusted EBITDA outlook as well. But we're early in the quarter. So, we just gave those nice round figures that we believe we'll be above both of them. And so hopefully, that provides a little bit of color. Obviously, we feel really good about the strength of the business from a GPU perspective. We are operating at meaningfully higher GPU levels than we have at any point in the past, there's a lot of fundamental reasons why that's the case.\nRajat Gupta : Got it. That's helpful. Just on SG&A. The other SG&A was flattish sequentially. You talked about some more opportunities around like corporate cost and like other infrastructure-related reduction. Is that -- how should we think about the timing of those benefits? Is that something you expect to see on a per unit basis going forward? I was surprised to see it remain flat in the second quarter despite the volume reduction. So just curious how should we think about the opportunity there?\nErnie Garcia: Let me jump in first, and then Mark, please provide a better answer. Did you find the only not positive number in the entire report, Rajat, come on?\nRajat Gupta : I mean I was -- I had a lower number there. So, I just wanted to see if [indiscernible].\nErnie Garcia: Go ahead. Mark.\nMark Jenkins: Let me hit your question on other SG&A. So, I do think other SG&A was basically flat quarter-over-quarter. We do see meaningful opportunities to continue to reduce that over time. I do think on a quarter-by-quarter basis, there can be things that push it up a little on a recurring basis, push it down a little on a nonrecurring basis. But -- and so there -- it can bounce around a little bit, but we certainly see opportunities to further reduce that from where it was in Q1 and Q2.\nRajat Gupta : Got it. If I can ask like one more on the positive side, you've made tremendous progress on the recon logistics side of things. Curious, I think in the past, you've given us some numbers in terms of like how much opportunity there was left. I mean, are we on a good glide path there? How you feel about the recon and logistics expenses in the retail GPU or is there like more utilization opportunity there going forward?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes. So simple answer there is we continue to see opportunities throughout all areas of the business, and that would include retail reconditioning and inbound transport, we certainly see more opportunities there despite the very significant progress that we've made.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Brad Erickson with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrad Erickson : So ultimately, what's going to catalyze kind of a return to quarterly retail unit growth here? Is it just getting kind of through this restructuring process, saying kind of stabilizing the balance sheet, maybe returning to inventory growth at some point? Or is it just more a function of the market? Or I guess, between those two, which is more important to driving a rebound to your retail unit sales growth?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So, I would say, most importantly is we underwent a big reprioritization pivot inside of the business around 12, 18 months ago. And that takes time and effort to reorient everything. And we're making in our opinion, at least pretty incredible progress pretty quickly as a result of that. I think at this point, the math is pretty clear. If you put it in a spreadsheet, it's going to tell you that we're supposed to grow as quickly as possible, basically because the GPU is in a great spot and our variable costs are in a great spot. But I think we're also continuing to rapidly make progress. And I think we're benefiting from the simplicity in the business by holding units approximately flat and focusing on efficiencies. And so, we plan to maintain the plan that we had before. Step one was get to positive adjusted EBITDA. We completed that today. Step two, is basically maintaining the exact same operating cadence, but pushing that to significant and sustainable positive unit economics that puts us in a very good position to build an incredible business over time that is much, much larger than we are today. And then step three will be return to growth. I think there's a number of factors that will drive that transition. I think that you named several, I think, inside the business. The progress is clearly very helpful. I think capital structure changes are clearly helpful. But I think most importantly, the operational progress we're making is very, very fast. And so, we want to maintain discipline and be thoughtful about how we transition back to what has been the more comfortable and normal foot for Carvana over the majority of our life, which is a growth footing. So, we are not yet making that pivot, but in due time, we certainly plan to.\nBrad Erickson : Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up. You just mentioned kind of the efficiencies as you've kind of throttled run rates almost. Historically, when you guys are growing so fast, right, OpEx was kind of always running a little bit hot just because you were kind of struggling to catch up with demand to most degree. What -- like as you think about the rebound, what costs will have to be incurred when you start to increase that sales run rate? I think that's where people are maybe a little bit struggling with how to bridge the math, understand all the leverage and the efficiencies you and Mark have spoken to here this morning, but just how to think about that rebound and how we control costs as we ramp back up production capacity, all that stuff.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, I think the most important element to an increase in costs as a result of growth is basically preparation for that growth and positioning yourself forward ahead of time. And I think that's a function of the level of efficiency you have inside the company, right? If it costs you $1 dollar to sell the car, you're positioning for $2, you might spend an extra dollar if it costs you $0.50 to sell a car, you're positioning for $2, it cost you an extra $0.50 and so I think the efficiency gains that we've built into the business over the last year will make it that we can grow more efficiently. I would also say that we're in a spot now where disproportionate relative to our history, a portion of our expenses are fixed. And so, I think the math is pretty beneficial as it relates to growth. And so, when it's time to grow, I think our view is that will probably be helpful from an expense perspective because the fixed component of it is probably a larger and more mechanical component than the variable component. So, I think when that time, I think we look forward to it. There will undeniably be investments associated with some of that growth. But I think we're very well positioned for it. And I would also say is I think many of the other investments in growth are capital investments to prepare for that growth.  You have to build bigger inspection centers, you have to build more inspection centers. You have to build more logistics pathways. A lot of that is built. I think the ADESA acquisition is something that we remain just tremendously excited about, not just because of the core business, but also what it means to our infrastructure going forward and what it means to the decrease in investments that are necessary in order for us to build the company that we want to build, which remains a company that sells millions of cars and changes the way people buy cars. That remains our vision, our goal, and our opportunity and our belief -- so I think we think we're very well positioned for it. There will undeniably be some cost increases, but we think it is likely that they will be dwarfed by the improvements in the business otherwise due to the leveraging of fixed costs.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First off, congratulations. I mean the repositioning has been very swift and very effective, so congratulations.\nErnie Garcia: I believe that's about our third congratulations in our public life. So that means more to us than you know.\nBrian Nagel : So, my question is -- just a follow-up to that, congratulations.\nErnie Garcia: There. You said it again.\nBrian Nagel : That's the fourth. As we step back, we look at all that's been done here with Carvana, both from a, I guess, an operational repositioning as well as the efforts on the balance sheet. And are you again recognizing the environment is very fluid and you're still a young business. But -- is it done? Are you in a position now that you look at the model and this balance sheets, okay, we can grow from here? Or should we expect further type of repositioning, and again, either operationally or on the debt side?\nErnie Garcia: And I'm sorry, you say not operationally on the -- but on the debt side, that's how you finished the question?\nBrian Nagel : Yes. I'm sorry, both on operational and the debt, right, as we're looking forward to that debt side.\nErnie Garcia: Yes. So, I think operationally, I think we are in position to continue to make gains, and our plan is to continue to make gains. And so, I think we've -- we rolled out an internal program about a year ago that was aiming at this Q2 that was incredibly successful, where all the different groups of the business we're aiming for different targets. We've rolled out a similar plan over the next year that we're very excited about, and we think that there's significant gains that are yet to be had. So, we're going to continue to push there and we expect to make gains over time to continue to get more efficient operationally. From a balance sheet perspective, I think we're clearly in a much better spot today than we were yesterday. And I think that that's an exciting and quick development. And I think that in addition to just kind of the leverage being less, the flexibility is significantly higher in terms of longer maturities, more prepayment, and lower cash interest expense. So, I think the improvements there are sort of multi-dimensional I think going forward, we're also, I think, well positioned to further delever over time, although we'll be thoughtful about the pace at which that occurs. So, I think it depends on your time frame that you're looking at there, but I do not think that we are done with balance sheet changes in the grand scheme of things. I think the business is in a very good position. I think we're well positioned over time to generate significant positive cash. I think that gives us a lot of options. And then I think that we've also outlined a number of other options today that also give us flexibility.\nBrian Nagel : That's very helpful. And then a second question, also bigger picture, just kind of picking your brain as what you're seeing from a -- I guess, a sector standpoint. So, there's a lot of debate out there about as we think about affordability, affordability for used cars on the part of your core consumers, maybe we're starting to see some acceleration in depreciation maybe. But I guess as you think about affordability, what do you think is the bigger factor? Do you think it's still these elevated used car pricing? Or is it now a higher rate environment?\nErnie Garcia: I think our view would be it's the intersection. The vast majority of consumers in the U.S. buy a car with financing. And for most people, I think the decision to buy a car is a function of kind of the cash down payment upfront and then their monthly payment over time. And obviously, those two things are a function of both the car price and rates I think historically, we've seen many different rate environments, and I think you tend to see kind of car prices move in a way that would be expected in light of those rate environments. I think what's been very unique over the last year and half or so is we saw rates rising rapidly while we also saw car prices at a very high level and kind of they were depreciating in the back half of '22, but then they appreciated early this year, and now they're depreciating pretty quickly today. I think affordability is about just the sum of those two things, interest rates and car prices dropping over time. So, and average customers monthly payment is less. And I think that there are signs, at least on the car price side that, that is occurring. As I said, depreciation this year looks a lot like depreciation last year, although it started about a month earlier, give or take, in both the wholesale and retail markets. And so far, at least, it's a little more severe even than it was last year, which I think as long as that is foreseen by markets, that's probably great for us for the reasons discussed earlier.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nick Jones with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Jones : Great. Thank you for taking my question. I guess one, now that you're in Part two of your kind of three-part plan, is this step maybe incrementally more challenging than the first part of your plan as we all try to triangulate when you may return to growth. Any color there would be great.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. I think it's I think everything that matters is challenging, but I think it's more of the same of what we've set up. I think the most challenging thing that we probably went through at the company was the transition from growth to a focus on improving unit economics. I think that was a big reorientation that was made very, very quickly. and it required new processes and new focus and kind of new management patterns and all kinds of different things. But I think that we made that transition, and I think we're very happy about the outcomes that we're observing now as a result. I think that the next year looks a lot like the last year in terms of the way that we're aiming for different targets inside the business. And so, I don't know that the setup is particularly difficult. I think making progress is always difficult, but I think we've got very good plans and very capable people. And I think we feel very good about the trend lines that we're on and the targets that we've set. So, I think nothing is ever easy, but I think we're on as good a path as we can be to continue to achieve those goals. And then turning to growth, I think that will be another pivot when it's time. But again, that's a pivot that I think is a pretty comfortable one for us given our past and given our infrastructure setup and the scalability of our business as well as the efficiency gains that we've made over time that make that even more straightforward. So, none of that is going to be easy, but we think it's all achievable, and we plan to achieve it.\nNicholas Jones : Great. And then maybe a follow-up on driving reconditioning costs down. In this process, are you maybe not reconditioning items you would have reconditioned two years ago? Is there -- is it getting smarter than what you're buying? Is there any kind of feedback from your customers as you've driven those costs down?\nMark Jenkins: Yes. So, the simple answer there is the gains are process and technology driven, not quality driven. I think the inventory team has absolutely been investing in an enhanced inventory management system that makes us much better than we were before at managing parts to spend, for example, I think we've been in-sourcing various services that we've historically outsourced. That's something we've talked about before, but that generates opportunities for cost savings and efficiencies. I mean, I think we're definitely much more rightsized and efficient with the staffing and teams in the inspection and reconditioning centers. So, the gains in reconditioning have been very broad-based, but they're certainly process-driven and technology-driven and not quality driven.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks.\nErnie Garcia: Well, thanks, everyone. We really appreciate you taking the time. I know this was a short notice, and it's early in the morning, at least for many parts of the country. So, thank you for jumping on. To Carvana team. Thank you guys so much. I really cannot -- thank you just doesn't do it. The amount of work that's gone in over the last year to get to this spot is absolutely incredible, and the fact that everyone stood shoulder to shoulder with each other and never blinked and just kept pushing in light of a lot of doubt is something that is amazing, and I cannot fully express the gratitude that comes along with that. So, thank you all so much. We are nowhere near done, as we always say, and we're going to keep pushing. But this is a moment to be proud. And then later today is a moment to keep pushing that pedal down. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ernie Garcia",
            "content": "Thanks, Meg. And thanks, everyone, for joining the call on such short notice. Let me start with the most important takeaways in this quarter. It was a great quarter for Carvana, and we're nowhere near the end. We are making rapid progress because of the power of our customer offering, the strength of our business model, and the quality of our people. The fundamentals are what is making it possible. We're going to sustain the intensity of the last 18 months by maintaining our operating focus for the foreseeable future and embedding it further into our culture. 18 months ago, we were positioned aggressively for growth. We were then hit with a combination of macroeconomic, industry, operational, and capital market impacts that when combined, put us under considerable pressure and demanded a reprioritization of our efforts. So that's what we did. We reoriented the business with a simple three-step plan. Number one, drive the business to positive adjusted EBITDA; number two, drive the business with significant positive unit economics. And number three, after completing steps one and two, return to growth.  In the second quarter, we completed the first step. We are extremely proud of the speed of this progress. In the last year, we've taken $1.1 billion of annualized expenses out of the business, and this quarter, we set records in GPU and adjusted EBITDA margin with total adjusted EBITDA dollars over $150 million. These numbers benefited from significant nonrecurring items that collectively added about $900 to GPU and $70 million to adjusted EBITDA. But even when controlling for these nonrecurring items, the results were exceptional. Today, the company is functioning better than it ever has. We're more efficient and we are improving at a faster pace than we ever have in the past.  This improvement spans the entire business, from customer-facing improvements, including the early testing of same-day delivery in a subset of markets that have inspection centers to product improvements that enable us to buy more cars from our customers more efficiently to process changes and developments that are making us more efficient across every operating group in the company, and we plan to keep up our pace. With the results and capital structure changes being discussed today, a natural question is how does this change the plan? The short answer is that it doesn't. We plan to continue operating in the same way with the same urgency to continue to drive efficiencies that we expect to result in sustainable significantly positive adjusted EBITDA. From there, we will once again turn our attention to growth as we did successfully for the first eight years of our history. Our opportunity is as great as it has ever been. Our customers love our offering and our business is efficient, highly differentiated, scalable, and extremely difficult to replicate. We remain firmly on the path to selling millions of cars per year and to becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. The march continues. Mark? Sure. Well, let's start with the inventory component of that question. I think inventory is down year-over-year by over 50%. I believe something in the over 55%. It was down again quarter-over-quarter. We've really been pushing that down in an effort to align our inventory size with sales volumes. And I think you can really see that flowing through the benefits of that into retail GPU. I think we had a pretty incredible by any measure, retail GPU quarter.  And I think there are a number of components of that, but one of the largest, certainly over the last six to nine months has been reducing inventory and kind of aligning our sales volumes with where inventory was. We could have faster turn times and therefore, less depreciation. I think the environment remains an environment of elevated prices and elevated interest rates and more difficult affordability for customers. I think there are certainly signs today of depreciation. I think depreciation right now looks very similar to depreciation last year, although it's probably been pulled forward maybe a month. It's happening a little faster than last year.  And so, I think we'll see how that unfolds through the rest of this year. I think our view on that is -- the probably best-case scenario for our business would be pretty significant depreciation that is foreseen. I think foreseen depreciation enables the market to organize kind of in the wholesale market to buy cars at sufficiently high margins to where you can absorb that depreciation, and it doesn't impact the business in a material way. But then that also leads to better affordability for customers. And I think that's what we would hope for and I think the signs that we're seeing right now are at least weekly aligned with that. From a broader demand perspective, I'm not sure we have a ton more to add. Sure. So really quickly on the depreciation side. I think depreciation is clearly elevated as discussed before. I think so far, that's happened in an orderly way, and it seems like the wholesale market is positioned to kind of absorb that depreciation and then be able to pass that through to the retail market. So, we haven't yet seen that impacting retail spreads in a way that would be meaningful. And then I think the GPU number for this quarter is just a truly incredible number, and I think there are so many components that go into it. We did benefit first from about $900 of nonrecurring items that included the fact that we sold more receivables than we originated as a result of also holding those receivables we earned additional interest on those receivables and then we did have a release of inventory allowance as well that ended up being about $250 of retail GPU benefit. But when removing that, it was still $6,000 which is a number that I think was unimaginable for the vast majority of our history and completely unimaginable from the perspective of even three months ago, six months ago. And I think there's been so many incredible improvements across the business. We really have reoriented the business and we've got an operating cadence that has many different teams extremely focused on efficiency in every aspect of the business from the ways that we're acquiring cars, the ways that we're shipping cars, to the distances that we're shipping cars, to the way that we're managing how those cars get put on to trucks, the way that we're reconditioning cars in our finance program. We've made a number of additional enhancements. In the wholesale business, we've made a number of enhancements and improvements and are better utilizing ADESA. ADESA has also had a great quarter. They're on a great path, and that's flowing through to GPU as well. I think we've clearly seen market share in both the ADESA dealer business and the ADESA commercial business improve over the last many months. And the market, in general, is also just seeming at least like it's likely to start turning around as the market starts to normalize and we see more normal activity from rental fleets, and we're starting to get a sense that there could be off-lease volume starting to come back in the not-too distant future, even though we're not quite there yet. So, I just think across the business, there were a lot of improvements, and we think the majority of those improvements are sustainable. We called out that $900 nonrecurring items. There were some other benefits as well that flowed through -- Q2 is generally a good quarter for retail GPU in particular, based on seasonality. And then I do think that there was some unexpected appreciation early in the year. that wasn't at least in our plan, and so that benefited us a bit as well. But the vast majority of the gains that we're seeing, we believe are sustainable, and you can kind of see that expectation in our outlook. Sure. Well, first of all, I would say, I think we're extremely excited about the agreement we came to, and we believe it's great for both of us. And we believe that getting a win-win is never a trivially simple thing to do in life. But I think given the performance of the business, it created a lot of room for a win-win. And so, I think when we work there to try to achieve is years ago, when we took out our initial unsecured notes, we always had an option to either do unsecured debt or secured debt and we like it at the time to do unsecured debt and to preserve that collateral. Had with unsecured debt, our interest expense over the last several years would have been much lower. But we decided to preserve that collateral because we believe it could be valuable in certain circumstances. And I think this is a circumstance where that collateral is valuable. And so, what we were able to do is work together with our bondholders to find a solution that works well for them as we use that collateral to make their bonds stronger, and then we were able to take some of that benefit and extend our maturities and reduce our overall debt burden and also give us a lot of freedom financially, especially over the next several years from an interest perspective. So, I think overall, that was -- that's a great deal for us. We're extremely excited about it. And I think I would be remiss if I didn't also note that I think the group bondholders was very productive to work with. Someone that I respect once that the world is full of optimizers and not enough solution providers. And I will say that, of course, everyone wanted to make sure they got a fair deal there. And of course, you're dealing with incredibly intelligent people but what you read in the media is not correct. They were very much solution oriented. And I think we came to a solution that was great for everyone. Sure. So, our plan is to do $350 million of equity, and that's kind of built into our plan. inside of that, the family would do approximately $125 million there'll be about $225 million going out into the market. We've also put out a larger ATM, which we believe is just kind of good corporate housekeeping in general -- and we think that's true for most companies. It's certainly true for a company as volatile as ours in terms of stock price. And for a company that has as high-quality use of proceeds built into the business as we do. Another aspect of the agreement we came to with noteholders is we have highly desirable prepayment capabilities built into those notes. And so, I think that gives us a lot of optionality to the extent we raise more over time, the family commitment decreases. But that's kind of the options that we've got in front of us. Sure. And I think this is a fundamentally important element of our business. I think, first and foremost, we've built a transactional website that customers can go to that gets a tremendous amount of traffic and a tremendous amount of interest that enables us to get access to many, many customers. And then we built a process flow on the website that allows customers to get a value for their car in a minute that is extremely accurate and benefits from all of the data that we have on many different cars and all of our experience in valuing those cars.  And then we've got a process, I think, that is about as desirable as the process can be for a customer selling a car where they get the value on their computer or on their phone, they click a button and schedule a pick-up, and then we come to them, we pick it up. We've built a number of enhancements in that process that have made us much more efficient and enable us to also differentiate vehicle value better and then pass some of those benefits on to our customers. And then we buy those cars, we bring them back and then we take them to our inspection centers. We plan to retail them and we prepare them for retail. And if we plan to wholesale them, we now have the ADESA asset where we can go take those cars and dispose of those cars.  And so, I think that platform overall, I think, is an extremely valuable platform. I think it's fundamentally very hard to replicate. It benefits very much from basically reverse retail transactions. It benefits from the existence of the retail disposition channel, and it benefits from the existence of the ADESA disposition channel. So, what we think that we're incredibly well positioned to continue to grow that business. And I think that you're seeing the benefits of that business and the strength of that business in our retail GPU numbers and our wholesale numbers this quarter. Sure. Let me start with this. I think for the first 8 years of our company existence, we grew at approximately 100% per year, we at a time when the market was flat. And so, I think that, that was possible because our customer offering is very high quality. Our business is very scalable. And I think we have a lot of incredible people to do a great job across the business, making sure that the customer experience is great. And that enabled us to grow very, very quickly over a sustained period of time without tailwinds from the market itself. I think over the last 1.5 years, our situation change pretty dramatically, and we reprioritize pretty significantly. And we focus a lot on getting to significantly better unit economics. And you're seeing the benefits of that focus as well. You see that in the $155 million of EBITDA that we just printed this quarter that I think -- from the perspective of six months ago, I don't know if there was anyone out there that had that in their model at that time. And I think what -- one way to think about that is just that this business that has very high quality fundamentals shifted its goal from growth to unit economics and profitability. And as a result, kind of those fundamental benefits flowed through in a different line item, but they flow through very, very quickly. And I think when it's time to turn back to growth, I think this is a group of people that knows how to do that. I think this is a business model that lends itself to that, both through the quality of the customer experience and through the scalability of the business model as well as I think something else the last 1.5 years has taught us that this is a very, very hard business to replicate. It's capital intensive. It is complicated. It's hard to get everything lined up and to do it well. So, I think when it's time, we'll be very well positioned. Now I do think that the market has provided additional headwinds aside from our shift in focus. But I don't think that those are the biggest drivers over the last 1.5 years. Today, used car sales in some total are probably 10% below their baseline. It's probably a reasonable way to think about it. So, at some point, when the market normalizes, that should be a tailwind, which will be nice, but I don't know that it will be that significant relative to the benefits that we plan to go get ourselves. And then I think that there's strong arguments that the independent market has been more impacted than the franchise market over the last 1.5 years. And so, I think that there's an argument that kind of our direct market has actually been impacted more than that 10%. So, I think at some point, as car prices normalize and interest rates normalize and affordability comes back. I think that there likely will be a rebound in the broader market. But I think most importantly, when it's time to grow, we'll take control of that, and we'll control our own destiny as we did in the past, and we'll push growth on our own, like we have before. And Chris, just to make sure one thing is clear because I couldn't tell how you're interpreting it from the question. The majority of that $1.2 billion of debt reduction is basically just the exchange of collateral for reduction in face of debt. It's not a cash paydown. So, we don't need to kind of tie out the full $1.2 billion reduction with cash that's -- the majority of that is just kind of value that is created by providing collateral to the bond. Let me jump in first, and then Mark, please provide a better answer. Did you find the only not positive number in the entire report, Rajat, come on? Go ahead. Mark. Sure. So, I would say, most importantly is we underwent a big reprioritization pivot inside of the business around 12, 18 months ago. And that takes time and effort to reorient everything. And we're making in our opinion, at least pretty incredible progress pretty quickly as a result of that. I think at this point, the math is pretty clear. If you put it in a spreadsheet, it's going to tell you that we're supposed to grow as quickly as possible, basically because the GPU is in a great spot and our variable costs are in a great spot. But I think we're also continuing to rapidly make progress. And I think we're benefiting from the simplicity in the business by holding units approximately flat and focusing on efficiencies. And so, we plan to maintain the plan that we had before. Step one was get to positive adjusted EBITDA. We completed that today. Step two, is basically maintaining the exact same operating cadence, but pushing that to significant and sustainable positive unit economics that puts us in a very good position to build an incredible business over time that is much, much larger than we are today. And then step three will be return to growth. I think there's a number of factors that will drive that transition. I think that you named several, I think, inside the business. The progress is clearly very helpful. I think capital structure changes are clearly helpful. But I think most importantly, the operational progress we're making is very, very fast. And so, we want to maintain discipline and be thoughtful about how we transition back to what has been the more comfortable and normal foot for Carvana over the majority of our life, which is a growth footing. So, we are not yet making that pivot, but in due time, we certainly plan to. Sure. Well, I think the most important element to an increase in costs as a result of growth is basically preparation for that growth and positioning yourself forward ahead of time. And I think that's a function of the level of efficiency you have inside the company, right? If it costs you $1 dollar to sell the car, you're positioning for $2, you might spend an extra dollar if it costs you $0.50 to sell a car, you're positioning for $2, it cost you an extra $0.50 and so I think the efficiency gains that we've built into the business over the last year will make it that we can grow more efficiently. I would also say that we're in a spot now where disproportionate relative to our history, a portion of our expenses are fixed. And so, I think the math is pretty beneficial as it relates to growth. And so, when it's time to grow, I think our view is that will probably be helpful from an expense perspective because the fixed component of it is probably a larger and more mechanical component than the variable component. So, I think when that time, I think we look forward to it. There will undeniably be investments associated with some of that growth. But I think we're very well positioned for it. And I would also say is I think many of the other investments in growth are capital investments to prepare for that growth.  You have to build bigger inspection centers, you have to build more inspection centers. You have to build more logistics pathways. A lot of that is built. I think the ADESA acquisition is something that we remain just tremendously excited about, not just because of the core business, but also what it means to our infrastructure going forward and what it means to the decrease in investments that are necessary in order for us to build the company that we want to build, which remains a company that sells millions of cars and changes the way people buy cars. That remains our vision, our goal, and our opportunity and our belief -- so I think we think we're very well positioned for it. There will undeniably be some cost increases, but we think it is likely that they will be dwarfed by the improvements in the business otherwise due to the leveraging of fixed costs. I believe that's about our third congratulations in our public life. So that means more to us than you know. There. You said it again. And I'm sorry, you say not operationally on the -- but on the debt side, that's how you finished the question? Yes. So, I think operationally, I think we are in position to continue to make gains, and our plan is to continue to make gains. And so, I think we've -- we rolled out an internal program about a year ago that was aiming at this Q2 that was incredibly successful, where all the different groups of the business we're aiming for different targets. We've rolled out a similar plan over the next year that we're very excited about, and we think that there's significant gains that are yet to be had. So, we're going to continue to push there and we expect to make gains over time to continue to get more efficient operationally. From a balance sheet perspective, I think we're clearly in a much better spot today than we were yesterday. And I think that that's an exciting and quick development. And I think that in addition to just kind of the leverage being less, the flexibility is significantly higher in terms of longer maturities, more prepayment, and lower cash interest expense. So, I think the improvements there are sort of multi-dimensional I think going forward, we're also, I think, well positioned to further delever over time, although we'll be thoughtful about the pace at which that occurs. So, I think it depends on your time frame that you're looking at there, but I do not think that we are done with balance sheet changes in the grand scheme of things. I think the business is in a very good position. I think we're well positioned over time to generate significant positive cash. I think that gives us a lot of options. And then I think that we've also outlined a number of other options today that also give us flexibility. I think our view would be it's the intersection. The vast majority of consumers in the U.S. buy a car with financing. And for most people, I think the decision to buy a car is a function of kind of the cash down payment upfront and then their monthly payment over time. And obviously, those two things are a function of both the car price and rates I think historically, we've seen many different rate environments, and I think you tend to see kind of car prices move in a way that would be expected in light of those rate environments. I think what's been very unique over the last year and half or so is we saw rates rising rapidly while we also saw car prices at a very high level and kind of they were depreciating in the back half of '22, but then they appreciated early this year, and now they're depreciating pretty quickly today. I think affordability is about just the sum of those two things, interest rates and car prices dropping over time. So, and average customers monthly payment is less. And I think that there are signs, at least on the car price side that, that is occurring. As I said, depreciation this year looks a lot like depreciation last year, although it started about a month earlier, give or take, in both the wholesale and retail markets. And so far, at least, it's a little more severe even than it was last year, which I think as long as that is foreseen by markets, that's probably great for us for the reasons discussed earlier. Sure. I think it's I think everything that matters is challenging, but I think it's more of the same of what we've set up. I think the most challenging thing that we probably went through at the company was the transition from growth to a focus on improving unit economics. I think that was a big reorientation that was made very, very quickly. and it required new processes and new focus and kind of new management patterns and all kinds of different things. But I think that we made that transition, and I think we're very happy about the outcomes that we're observing now as a result. I think that the next year looks a lot like the last year in terms of the way that we're aiming for different targets inside the business. And so, I don't know that the setup is particularly difficult. I think making progress is always difficult, but I think we've got very good plans and very capable people. And I think we feel very good about the trend lines that we're on and the targets that we've set. So, I think nothing is ever easy, but I think we're on as good a path as we can be to continue to achieve those goals. And then turning to growth, I think that will be another pivot when it's time. But again, that's a pivot that I think is a pretty comfortable one for us given our past and given our infrastructure setup and the scalability of our business as well as the efficiency gains that we've made over time that make that even more straightforward. So, none of that is going to be easy, but we think it's all achievable, and we plan to achieve it. Well, thanks, everyone. We really appreciate you taking the time. I know this was a short notice, and it's early in the morning, at least for many parts of the country. So, thank you for jumping on. To Carvana team. Thank you guys so much. I really cannot -- thank you just doesn't do it. The amount of work that's gone in over the last year to get to this spot is absolutely incredible, and the fact that everyone stood shoulder to shoulder with each other and never blinked and just kept pushing in light of a lot of doubt is something that is amazing, and I cannot fully express the gratitude that comes along with that. So, thank you all so much. We are nowhere near done, as we always say, and we're going to keep pushing. But this is a moment to be proud. And then later today is a moment to keep pushing that pedal down. Thank you, guys."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our second quarter results demonstrate significant progress on our path to profitability. We significantly exceeded our goal of driving positive adjusted EBITDA and we set a company record for total GPU. These second quarter milestones complete step one of our three-step plan to drive positive free cash flow, and we are now in step two. driving repeated and significant unit economics. In the second quarter, retail units sold totaled 76,530, a decrease of 35% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Similar to past quarters, our decline in retail units sold, which we expected, was driven by four primary factors: reduced inventory size, reduced advertising, increased benchmark interest rates and credit spreads, and a continued focus on executing our profitability initiatives. Total revenue was $2.968 billion, a decrease of 24% year-over-year and an increase of 14% sequentially. As we've previously discussed, our long-term financial goal is to generate significant GAAP net income and free cash flow. In service of this goal, in the near term, our management team remains focused on driving progress on a set of key non-GAAP financial metrics that are inputs into this long-term goal, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP SG&A expense, and adjusted EBITDA. Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our remaining remarks on sequential changes in these metrics. In the second quarter, non-GAAP total GPU was $7,030, a sequential increase of $2,234, driven by increases in retail and other GPU. The Total GPU in Q2 was positively impacted by approximately $900 nonrecurring benefits, which we described in more detail later in this remark. Non-GAAP retail GPU was $2,862 versus $1,591 [ph] in Q1. Retail GPU included an approximately $250 benefit due to an adjustment to our retail inventory allowance. In addition, sequential changes in retail GPU were primarily driven by lower average days of sale, lower retail market depreciation rates, wider spreads between wholesale and retail market prices, and lower reconditioning and inbound transport costs. This retail GPU in Q2 was driven by several fundamental improvements in our business as well as some seasonal end market tailwinds. On the fundamental gain side, retail GPU was driven by normalizing inventory size as well as several key areas of improvement compared to FY 2021, including a higher customer sourcing rate, higher revenue from additional services, and lower reconditioning and inbound transport costs. On the seasonal and market dynamics side, Q2 is on average, the strongest quarter of the year for retail GPU. In addition, this year saw a period of high spreads between wholesale and retail market prices followed by lower-than-expected retail depreciation, which benefited retail GPU in Q2, other things being equal. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $1,228 versus $1,236 in Q1. Sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by higher wholesale market depreciation rates in Q2 compared to Q1 and which negatively impacted wholesale vehicle gross profit per wholesale unit sold largely offset by operational improvements that allowed us to handle more wholesale units sold volume. Non-GAAP other GPU was $2,940 versus $1,969 in Q1. Sequential improvement in other GPU was primarily driven by a greater volume of loans sold in Q2 compared to Q1. We estimate that a higher-than-normalized volume of loans held and sold in Q2 increased other GPU by approximately $650, other things being equal. Sequential changes in other GPU were also driven by higher origination interest rates relative to benchmark interest rates and higher average loan size. In Q2, we continue to make progress lowering SG&A expenses, reducing non-GAAP SG&A expense by $21 million sequentially, primarily driven by continued reductions in non-advertising expenses. Advertising expenses in Q2 were approximately flat compared to Q1. We expect Q1 to be our near-term low point on quarterly advertising expense as we continue to seek to optimize our spend to balance unit volume and profitability. We believe the cost reductions we've achieved over the past year are long-lasting and sustainable, and we believe we have further efficiencies to realize in all areas. Looking forward, we see three primary drivers to reduce SG&A per retail unit sold. First, in step two of our three-step plan, which is drive significant unit economics, we continue to see opportunities to reduce operations expenses on a per retail unit sold basis by completing our pipeline of projects to automate manual work, optimize staffing and routing, increased deep funnel conversion among other initiatives. Second, also in step two of our three-step plan, we continue to see opportunities to reduce and optimize our corporate technology and facilities expenses on an absolute dollar basis through a continued focus on zero-based budgeting and other efficiency gains. Third, in step three of our three-step plan, which is returned to growth, we see a significant opportunity to leverage our corporate technology and facilities expense base, leading to significant leverage on a per retail unit sold basis at higher volumes. Adjusted EBITDA was positive $155 million in Q2 or 5.2% of revenue. The impact to adjusted EBITDA of the previously described nonrecurring items was approximately $70 million, including a $50 million benefit from selling and holding additional loans and a $20 million benefit from our retail inventory allowance. Moving now to our third quarter outlook. While the macroeconomic and industry environment continues to be uncertain, looking toward Q3, expect the following as long as the environment remains stable. On retail units, we currently expect similar retail units sold in Q3 compared to Q2. On GPU, we currently expect non-GAAP total GPU above $5,000. On SG&A, we expect similar non-GAAP SG&A expense in Q3 compared to Q2. We continue to see opportunities to further reduce non-GAAP SG&A expenses over time.  Finally, we expect to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in Q3 for the second consecutive quarter, further demonstrating the first step in our three-step plan toward positive free cash flow. We see upside to these total GPU and adjusted EBITDA numbers, but given the early date of this earnings call within the quarter, we are electing to provide a conservative outlook. On June 30, we had approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity resources including $1.5 billion in cash and revolving availability and $2 billion in unpledged real estate and other assets, including more than $1 billion of real estate acquired with ADESA. Today, we announced the transaction support agreement with over 90% of holders of our senior unsecured notes to exchange approximately $5.2 billion of those senior unsecured notes for new senior secured notes with maturities ranging from December 2028 through June 2031.  The strong performance of our business in 2023 presented an opportunity for a win-win transaction for Carvana and its senior unsecured noteholders. The transaction reduces our total debt by over $1.2 billion, reduces our cash interest expense by over $430 million per year over the next two years, and extends more than 83% of our 2025 and 2027 senior unsecured note maturities, giving us significant flexibility to execute our plan toward driving positive free cash flow.  Thank you for your attention. We will now take questions. Yes. So, on inventory, we've reduced inventory size very significantly since the beginning of 2022. And I think what that has done is it has placed our inventory size now relative to sales volumes. That ratio is now back much more normalized levels. I think we call it in the shareholder letter. If you just compare the inventory that we had on hand at the end of the second quarter to the second quarter retails units sold that ratio is in implied term time about 62 days, which is in sort of a normal range that we've operated in, in the past. And then just to hit one additional point there. You asked about are there more nonrecurring items that we should expect. On that note, let me just talk for a moment about our finance receivables balance. So, on 3/31, we had about $1.6 billion of finance receivables on our balance sheet that we had built up over basically Q4 and Q1. As of 6/30 that was down to $1.1 billion. That $1.1 billion is certainly still higher than normalized. \u2013 so, we do have -- we continue to have additional loans that we can sell over the coming quarters that would sort of yield additional nonrecurring revenue in GPU. I'll take that one. So obviously, we had a very strong quarter from retail GPU in Q2, for some of the reasons that we pointed out as well as reasons that you just alluded to. I do think there were some market tailwinds there, but I think there's also some real fundamental gains that we've made that are important. And we do expect to have another strong quarter of retail GPU in Q3. Obviously, we won't have the allowance benefit in Q3 that we had in Q2. But we do expect a strong quarter for retail GPU. I think some of those fundamental gains just to enumerate them again, I think we're having a lot of success sourcing cars from customers. Ernie touched on that earlier in this call. We are generating revenue from some of the additional services that we provide to our customers. And we've really had a lot of success on the cost side of retail GPU. So, our fulfillment teams have been working to make the logistics network more efficient. We're really improving our inbound transport costs. We've been -- the inventory teams and the reconditioning teams ever have been really focused on cost efficiency in the inspection centers, and we've really pushed down over the last year, the reconditioning cost per retail unit sold. So, all the way such that those are down below full year 2021 levels. Even work in the inspection and reconditioning centers we're probably only operating at, say, on the order of 25% capacity, maybe a little bit more than that, but right around that order of magnitude, and yet costs in those centers is down below what it was in full year '21. So, I think those are some real fundamental success stories that we believe will drive strength in retail GPU. Sure. Yes. So, let me break that into two pieces. One is just talking about the capital structure and then second is talking about liquidity resources. So first, as it relates to capital structure. So, I think the basic framework that you laid out is correct. So, with the committed noteholders exchanging in the transaction support agreement will reduce total face value of notes by just slightly over $1.2 billion. A component of that is there will be some cash consideration paid to retire certain of the notes. And that's where this $350 million of equity comes in. That's part of the transaction support agreement. Again, we have -- basically, we have committed to raise $350 million of equity of which the Garcia have committed to put in $125 million. And then we're committed to raising $225 million elsewhere.  And so that will form a cash consideration that is part of the exchange. And then the remainder of the exchange is basically just exchanging existing senior unsecured notes for the tranches of new senior secured notes. I think some of the benefits of those senior secured notes, we talked about a bit on this call, but I think one really valuable benefit from our perspective is the option to pay -- pick interest for two years and also to -- we're essentially largely eliminating 2025 and 2027 maturities. So, after completing this exchange, we don't have a meaningful note maturity until December 2028. And -- and I think that's really great from a flexibility standpoint. We've obviously had a tremendous amount of success so far executing our three-step plan. We completed step one of it. moving on to step two of it and then step three of it will be returned to growth. And we have a lot -- an awful lot of flexibility over a many year time horizon to be executing that plan and really driving the business to very significant positive unit economics and volume. Now turning to your question about liquidity. So, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in total liquidity resources -- that was a mix of just over $500 million of cash and just under $1 billion of availability on existing revolvers. I think one thing to note about that number is our total -- our committed liquidity resources actually stepped up quarter-over-quarter. So, we actually increased our liquidity in the second quarter. And so, I think we feel like we're in a very good liquidity position with a lot of flexibility to execute our plan over a many year time horizon. Sure. Yes. So, I think there are multiple aspects of the new senior secured notes that do facilitate decreasing leverage. I think one is the 2028 notes have only a one-year no-call period. And so those can be called at only par plus half a coupon after one year. I think the 2030 notes also have a slightly shorter than typical no-call period, but just a two-year no-call period, and then that debt could be paid at par plus half a coupon. And so, I think those are a couple of features. I think the notes; the 2028 and 2030 notes also do allow prepayments to be made with proceeds from equity. That's another feature that enables the deleveraging. And so, I think there's many aspects of this debt exchange that I think worked well from the standpoint of capital structure and financial flexibility. I've talked about some of the interest components. We also talked about overall reduction in debt and the elimination of near-term maturities. But another, I think, is the ability to reasonably efficiently reduce leverage if we so desire. Sure. Yes. So, with the greater than $5,000 total GPU outlook for Q3, we didn't specify a specific volume of loans sold associated with that, greater than $5,000 GPU outlook. However, we did note in the shareholder letter that we do see upside to that $5,000 GPU number. And I think we also noted at the same time, we see upside to the positive adjusted EBITDA outlook as well. But we're early in the quarter. So, we just gave those nice round figures that we believe we'll be above both of them. And so hopefully, that provides a little bit of color. Obviously, we feel really good about the strength of the business from a GPU perspective. We are operating at meaningfully higher GPU levels than we have at any point in the past, there's a lot of fundamental reasons why that's the case. Let me hit your question on other SG&A. So, I do think other SG&A was basically flat quarter-over-quarter. We do see meaningful opportunities to continue to reduce that over time. I do think on a quarter-by-quarter basis, there can be things that push it up a little on a recurring basis, push it down a little on a nonrecurring basis. But -- and so there -- it can bounce around a little bit, but we certainly see opportunities to further reduce that from where it was in Q1 and Q2. Sure. Yes. So simple answer there is we continue to see opportunities throughout all areas of the business, and that would include retail reconditioning and inbound transport, we certainly see more opportunities there despite the very significant progress that we've made. Yes. So, the simple answer there is the gains are process and technology driven, not quality driven. I think the inventory team has absolutely been investing in an enhanced inventory management system that makes us much better than we were before at managing parts to spend, for example, I think we've been in-sourcing various services that we've historically outsourced. That's something we've talked about before, but that generates opportunities for cost savings and efficiencies. I mean, I think we're definitely much more rightsized and efficient with the staffing and teams in the inspection and reconditioning centers. So, the gains in reconditioning have been very broad-based, but they're certainly process-driven and technology-driven and not quality driven."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Meg Kehan, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMeg Kehan: Thank you, MJ. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on Carvana's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that this call will be simultaneously webcast on the Investor Relations section of the company's corporate website at investors.carvana.com. The first quarter Shareholder Letter is also posted to the IR website. Additionally, we posted a set of supplemental financial tables for Q1, which can be found on the Events and Presentations page of our IR website. Joining me on the call today are Ernie Garcia, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Jenkins, Chief Financial Officer. Before we start, I would like to remind you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, Carvana's market opportunities and future financial results that involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those disclosed here. A detailed discussion of the material factors that cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements can be found in the Risk Factors section of Carvana's most recent Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements and risks in this conference call are based on current expectations as of today, and Carvana assumes no obligation to update or revise them, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Our commentary today will include non-GAAP financial metrics. Unless otherwise specified, all references to GPU and SG&A will be to the non-GAAP metrics, and all references to EBITDA will be to adjusted EBITDA. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for all reported results can be found in our Shareholder Letter issued today, a copy of which can be found on our IR website. And now with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia : Thanks, Meg, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. The first quarter was a quarter of significant progress for Carvana. A year ago, the automotive industry as well as the macroeconomic and market environment changed pretty dramatically, resulting in us significantly shifting our near-term priorities away from growth and toward profitability. This shift has impacted everything we do. It has impacted what we are focused on, it has impacted how much we are focused on, and it impacted the way we are managing the business day to day. And all these adjustments take time. First, we made a narrow set of operating goals inside the company that we knew would be necessary to hit our financial targets. Second, we tightened the connections between our technology and operating teams through shared goals, shared meetings and even shared office spaces. These changes first have to show up in the projects the teams are undertaking. They move to operating metrics, and finally, they show up in financial results. And that is exactly how the progress has been unfolding. In the second quarter of 2022, we outlined our plan and discuss how we are organizing internally to tackle our goals. In the third quarter, we shared a number of operating metrics that we're beginning to rapidly move in the right direction. In the fourth quarter, we began to see some of the earliest signs of meaningful financial progress. And now in the first quarter of 2023, the direction speed of the financial progress is undeniable. We reduced SG&A by over $100 million quarter-over-quarter and completed our year-long effort to cut $1 billion of annualized costs out of the business. In addition, in the first quarter, we returned to our historical GPU and adjusted EBITDA margin trend lines and reported company best results for the first quarter in both metrics. We still have a long way to go to achieve our broader goals, but we are on the right path, and we are moving quickly. As we've discussed before, there are 3 steps in our plan to achieve positive cash flow and get Carvana back on track to becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. Number one, drive the business to positive adjusted EBITDA; number two, drive the business to significantly positive unit economics; number three, after achieving objective number one and two, return to growth. As outlined in the letter, we expect to complete the first step in this plan in the second quarter. The completion of this step is a milestone, not a change of direction. We'll be using the same processes and focus we have benefited from over the last year to continue to see the plan through. We remain firmly on the path to fulfilling our mission of changing the way people buy cars and to becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. The march continues. Mark?\nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our first quarter results demonstrated significant progress on our path to profitability. We exceeded our goal of driving $100 million of non-GAAP SG&A reductions one quarter early, and we surpassed our previously communicated goal of greater than 4,000 GPU. In the first quarter, retail units sold totaled 79,240, a decrease of 25% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Our decline in retail units sold, which we expected, was driven by four primary factors: one, reduced inventory size; two, reduced advertising; three, increased benchmark interest rates and credit spreads; and four, a continued focus on executing our profitability initiatives. Total revenue was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 25% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our remaining remarks on sequential changes. As we've previously discussed, our long-term financial goal is to generate significant GAAP net income and free cash flow. In service of that goal, in the near term, our management team is focused on driving progress on a set of key non-GAAP financial metrics that are inputs into this long-term goal, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP SG&A expense and adjusted EBITDA. In the first quarter, non-GAAP total GPU was $4,796, a sequential increase of $2,129 driven by increases across all components. Non-GAAP retail GPU was $1,591 versus $632 in Q4. Retail GPU included a $593 benefit due to an adjustment to our retail inventory allowance. In addition, sequential changes in retail GPU were primarily driven by higher average days of sale, partially offset by wider spreads between wholesale and retail market prices, higher shipping revenue and lower reconditioning and inbound transport costs. Notably, we achieved our Q1 retail GPU despite selling vehicles that were, on average, more than 120 days old. Vehicles sold in Q1 that were less than 90 days old had retail GPU over 2,000, illustrating the benefit of normalizing inventory size and turning vehicles more quickly. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $1,236 versus $551 in Q4. Wholesale GPU included a $50 benefit due to an adjustment to our wholesale inventory allowance. In addition, we estimate that wholesale GPU benefited by $150 due to abnormal wholesale market appreciation in the quarter. Beyond those factors, sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by higher wholesale marketplace volume. Non-GAAP other GPU was $1,969 versus $1,483 in Q4. Sequential improvement in other GPU was primarily driven by a greater volume of loans sold in the quarter compared to Q4. In Q1, we sold slightly less than a normalized volume of loans as a result of uncertainty in the securitization market in March. The GPU impact of this less-than-normalized sales volume was largely offset by higher interest income and other improvements, leading to an approximately normalized other GPU in Q1. In Q1, we made significant progress reducing SG&A expenses for the third consecutive quarter, reducing non-GAAP SG&A expense by $119 million sequentially, following a $60 million sequential reduction in Q4. These expense reductions were broad-based, including advertising, compensation and benefits, logistics and other SG&A. Non-GAAP SG&A expense per retail unit sold decreased by more than $900 sequentially in Q1, demonstrating significant operating leverage. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $24 million in Q1 or 0.9% of revenue. We expect to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA in Q2. After a strong quarter in Q1, we expect to drive greater than $5,000 of non-GAAP total GPU in Q2 as long as the macroeconomic and industry environment remains similar to Q1. Our strong GPU performance is powered by 3 fundamental drivers: driver number one, a more robust retail GPU model. We expect greater than $2,000 of non-GAAP retail GPU in Q2 driven primarily by our efforts to normalize inventory size, accelerate turn times and generate additional revenue from additional services. In FY '21, we generated approximately $1,700 of non-GAAP retail GPU. Since then, we've made fundamental improvements that we believe will drive higher retail GPU on a sustainable basis. First, we have continued to improve our customer vehicle sourcing with a higher share of retail units sourced from customers in Q1 2023 than in FY 2021. Second, we are generating more revenue from the unique services we offer our customers, including nationwide shipping and home delivery. Third, over time, we expect per unit reconditioning and inbound transport costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, to be below FY 2021 due to our continued focus on operating efficiency. Moving on to driver number two, expanded wholesale platform. We expect greater than $1,000 of non-GAAP wholesale GPU in Q2, split between Carvana's first-party wholesale vehicle sales and ADESA's third-party wholesale marketplace. In FY '21, we generated approximately $450 of non-GAAP wholesale GPU. Since then, we've made several fundamental improvements that we believe will drive higher wholesale GPU on a sustainable basis. First, in May 2022, we acquired ADESA, the second largest U.S. wholesale used vehicle auction marketplace. ADESA's wholesale marketplace generated significant gross profit in Q1 and will be a long-term addition to our total gross profit. Second, our acquisition of ADESA has improved the efficiency of our offering of buying cars from customers and selling them in the wholesale market. For example, since Q1 2022, we have reduced inbound transport costs on wholesale vehicles by approximately $200 per wholesale unit sold or approximately $90 per retail unit sold, supported by ADESA locations. Third, we continue to invest in our wholesale platform through product and process improvements with a continued goal of growing these businesses over time. Moving on to driver number three, strong finance and ancillary product execution. We expect greater than $2,000 non-GAAP other GPU in Q2, primarily driven by a normalization of loan sales volume. Since the beginning of Q2, we have sold or securitized approximately $1.3 billion of loan principal, an increase compared to Q1. In FY '21, we generated approximately $2,450 of non-GAAP other GPU. While we have not yet regained this level, in the medium term, we see a significant opportunity to increase other GPU by improving our cost of fund spread relative to mature securitization market participants and by continuing to expand our ancillary product platform. To summarize, our first quarter results and second quarter outlook reflect the return to our multitrack -- multiyear track record of driving GPU improvements. We believe the gains we are demonstrating in 2023 are sustainable and reflect the significant fundamental improvements we have made in the last 12 months. We also see further opportunities for more improvements in GPU in the future. Moving on to our second quarter outlook. While the macroeconomic and industry environment continues to be uncertain, looking toward Q2 '23 more broadly, we expect the following as long as the environment remains stable. On retail units, we currently expect a sequential reduction in retail units sold in Q2 compared to Q1 as we continue to normalize our inventory size, optimize marketing spend, make progress on our profitability initiatives -- and make progress on our profitability initiatives. On SG&A, we expect similar non-GAAP SG&A expense in Q2 compared to Q1. We continue to see significant opportunities to further reduce non-GAAP SG&A expenses over time. Finally, we expect to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in Q2, achieving the first step in our 3-step plan to generate positive free cash flow. On March 31, we had approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity resources, including $1.5 billion in cash and revolving availability and $2 billion in unpledged real estate and other assets, including more than $1 billion of real estate acquired with ADESA. Our strong liquidity position, significant production capacity runway and our clear and focused operating plan positions us well on our path to achieve our goal of driving positive free cash flow and becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer in the future. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair.\nSharon Zackfia : I guess two maybe pretty quick questions. It sounded as if from the press release, you might have made really significant progress on the kind of percent of inventory that's under 90 days. So hoping you can maybe talk to us about what percent of the inventory today is under 90 days versus what you had in the first quarter.  And then secondarily, ad spend was really low. I'm wondering if that's a low watermark for the year, if we should expect that to start to go higher?\nErnie Garcia : Thanks for the question. So I think on inventory, we've definitely made a lot of progress. We rapidly moved through a pretty significant portion of our aged inventory in Q1. And so we started with a much larger inventory than was sized to sales, and we made a lot of progress of the quarter. Our inventory is down year-over-year about 55% and was down 20% in just Q1 alone. I think a useful metric for thinking about our inventory size and what that means for profitability is just thinking about how large our inventory is compared to the cars that we're selling at any given day. And if you kind of do that simple math and take inventory size divided by daily sales, in the quarter, we had about 65 days of implied turn time. That contrasts with the actual turn time of 120 days that Mark talked about in his prepared remarks, that's obviously a really big difference. And that leads to a pretty significant impact to retail GPU. In the letter, we provided a number where for the cars that were less than 90 days aged, which for that subset of cars, the average turn time is approximately 65 days. So it's a useful number compared to our implied turn time. We had retail GPU of over $2,000. And so I think we're heading into Q2 in a much better from an inventory perspective. I think that's been a year-long effort to kind of get sales to catch up to our relative size and inventory. And I think we're really pleased with the progress. We still have probably 1.5 quarters to go, maybe two quarters to go to get that all the way into alignment, but the size of the inventory relative to sales is now in alignment. So I think we're excited about that. On ad spend, that's another area where there has been a tremendous amount of pressure on units in the business. We're down approximately 64% year-over-year in ad spend. Quarter-over-quarter, we were down approximately 35%. So that was a big move as well. I think what we found is in this environment, cars are expensive, and consumers are a little bit less responsive to advertising. And so we've been retesting all of our various advertising channels. And I think the optimal that we are finding today are different from the optimal that we found in a more normalized environment, and that's led us to pull back pretty dramatically on marketing. That's exciting because I think we were able to show a customer acquisition cost of approximately $700 in the quarter, which is the lowest we've ever shown as a company by a pretty long way. And I think if you look in deeper, we had our oldest cohort, we were in the low 300s. So I think there's just a lot of progress that we're seeing there, and I think we're learning a lot about what the business model is capable of achieving. I think we continue to learn as we shrink our inventory and reduce our marketing spend, and I think we'll continue to make adjustments over the next couple of quarters as we learn more. I think it is more likely there will not be large reductions in marketing spend from here. I think it's also unlikely that it will shoot back up super dramatically, but we will continue to test it and evaluate what we learn from those tests, and then we'll go from there.\nOperator: The next question is from Ron Josey with Citi.\nRonald Josey : I want to maybe do a quick follow-up, Mark and Ernie, on just the inventory question from Sharon. But specifically, Mark, you mentioned higher incurred -- an increase in vehicle sourcing from customers. And I think last quarter, we talked about perhaps, or maybe two quarters ago, overpaying for that. So talk to us a little bit more just about the sourcing of vehicles from customers. We are seeing more ads actually on social sites for Carvana on that. And so I wanted to hear just the sourcing of vehicles as overall inventory, call it, normalizes.\nMark Jenkins : Sure. Yes, happy to answer that. So yes, the comparison that we talked about in prepared remarks was Q1 2023 compared to 2021. So we certainly have continued to make progress on sourcing cars directly from customers over that time period. I think we feel great about that. I think we've talked about it before, but sourcing cars from customers is a great source of inventory because it's a great selection of cars, very broad array of different makes, models, years, mileages. And then also, those cars tend to be more profitable than cars that you acquire at auction. So I think that's an area of the business where we've had great success over the years. I think we feel like we've got access to a lot of cars, and we have a lot of customers coming to the site appraising vehicles with us. And so I think that's obviously been a success story in the business over the last couple of years, and we're looking to continue that success as we move forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Jonas : So the company is getting more profitable the smaller it gets. At some point, this will need to change. I hear you on the guidance that -- I was going to ask is 80,000 units a quarter the right size for the company? You're telling us it's going to get -- continue to get a little smaller, I would imagine, with the lower levels of merchandising and then the lower ad spend, too, are remaining there. So I guess I'm wondering, are we there yet? What is the right size for the company? And then I have a follow-up.\nErnie Garcia : Sure. So I mean to jump to the end, I think the right size for the company is much, much larger eventually. And I think the path there through profitability has just included some of these moves that we've made to shrink inventory and shrink marketing and get back in balance. I think where we found ourselves after 2021 was expecting another similar year and just being pretty dramatically out of balance with where sales actually were. And I think as we were growing from when we launched in 2013, all the way through 2021, we benefited a lot from the positive feedback in the business. As we got bigger, we got better. As we grew our inventory, conversion rates went up. As we spent more on marketing, it was easier to open new markets. And I think when we kind of found ourselves out of balance and we needed to rebalance the business, we knew that we were going to face the other side of that feedback. We knew that as we shrunk, we see conversion rates go down. We knew that was going to be a difficult transition. But in light of the environment, we also thought it was the fastest path to meaningful positive cash flow. And so we took that path, and I think we remain on it. I think we believe that we are probably pretty close to where sales will bottom out. I think we'll learn more on that over the coming quarters. We've obviously made dramatic moves. I gave the numbers to Sharon a moment ago about how quickly we've lowered advertising inventory just in the last quarter. And so I think some of those things can have some lag effects that will show up over the next couple of quarters. So I don't want to act overconfident that we know exactly what will happen there. But I think the major headwinds that have faced the business over the year are largely subsiding. There's clearly been some industry and macroeconomic headwinds in the form of cost. There's been macroeconomic headwinds in the form of interest rates. And then there's been a lot of carve-on and post headwinds in the form of inventory reduction and marketing reduction and focusing on profitability and pulling away from sales that were less profitable and implementing different product changes that we think make the business more efficient. And so I think that's undoubtedly been a difficult transition. It's hard to know exactly what the impact of all of those things are on volume. But doing the best job that we can and trying to control for all those, we do believe that the business is performing better than we might have imagined once we've made those moves. We have estimates for the elasticity of sales to inventory size and the marketing dollars and to many of our different product changes. And I think based on what we're seeing, we're actually pretty happy with where volumes are. I think the third step of our plan, when we get there, is going to be to turn back to growth. And that's something that we clearly know how to do. It's something we're clearly incredibly well positioned for. I think we'll be better positioned for it than ever before. When we're a more efficient business, it means that growth comes easier. When we're -- when we've got the infrastructure, we've been able to acquire over the last 1.5 years, we're going to be in a better position to grow, but I think that's step 3 in our plan. So we're looking forward to Q2. Where we plan to hit step 1, we'll stay focused in that same direction. We've already got our plans for the next 9 to 12 months to keep the pedal down and keep making a lot of progress in unit economics. We plan to do that at somewhat similar volumes to where we are today. And then when we get there, hit that goal, we're going to definitely turn our attention back to growth because we're still incredibly small compared to this huge opportunity. It is still a 40 million unit market. We still have an incredibly unique offering and, it's still an offering that customers love.\nAdam Jonas : Just a follow-up. I'm curious where you -- where your team sees the lowest-hanging fruit from here on the SG&A. And has your team given consideration to charging a delivery fee or somehow incentivizing the customer either paying or avoiding a delivery cost to you?\nErnie Garcia : Sure. Yes. So let me start with, I think where we've made the most progress in costs over the last year, we've made a lot of progress, and so I apologize for filling these numbers around over and over again, but we're proud of them. We've cut $1 billion of cost out of the business and over $100 million quarter-over-quarter. I think there are many areas of costs. There's kind of fixed costs. There's variable costs. There's semi-fixed costs, and then there's customer acquisition costs. In the variable costs, I think we are currently operating across virtually all of our operating groups at all-time best efficiencies. In the variable costs themselves, I think we're generally at or near all-time lows across all groups. And I think that's happening despite input costs being higher. Generally, the efficiency for all of our groups is better than it's ever been. And then in some groups, the costs are still in a similar place where they've been in the past because the input costs are higher, whether that's gas or there's been inflation just across the economy. So there are some areas where they're somewhat similar. But I think we've made a tremendous amount of progress, and I think there's more progress to be made in those variable costs. In kind of the semi-fixed costs, I think that's actually been the biggest bucket over the last year. That's when we were just built for a different level of volume than we saw. And I think we've made a ton of progress there, and that's been extremely helpful. I think there's still some room for us to make progress and get all the way in balance there, but I think most of that has been achieved. In customer acquisition costs, we are all-time lows. I gave the stat. At the company level, it's about $700 oldest cohort. It's in the low 300s. We have four cohorts that are better than company average. Those are pretty great numbers. Those are numbers that are -- in alignment, the low 300 numbers in alignment with best-in-class peers in the industry, and it's in line with our long-term financial model. So I think over time, there's room there, but I think that we've clearly proven that we can do much better than we ever have in the past, and I think that, that's exciting. Fixed costs today per unit are probably higher than they've ever been or at least near all-time highs. And that's because volumes are lower, and we've got a fixed cost business, and we feel like we're going to returns on those investments. I think that's -- once you've got costs, you'd rather than be fixed than anything else. So I think that, that's good news, but certainly our fixed costs are high relative to our sales today. And we do think we're getting a return on that investment. We continue to -- we plan to reduce those costs over time. We plan to reduce the dollars of those fixed costs. We've been making progress on that, but we can make more progress. And then the remainder of them on a per unit basis go away with scale. And some of them go away just with the passage of time. Today, we still have many facilities that we're massively underutilizing, in the case of some of our office space, that office space that will probably go away over time. In the case of our inspection centers, for example, that's something that we expect to live with scale. So I think we've clearly got a path to significant additional gains in expenses across all types of expenses. I think the biggest gains are behind us, and they took the form of that kind of semi-variable form where just getting the business back in balance was really valuable. And then you also asked a question about delivery fees. So something that we have done over the last year is we've changed our offerings such that when customers elect to buy a car that is further away from them, especially in case when there's a car that's closer to them, we will charge a delivery fee. And so that is flowing through our gross profit. I think Mark spoke about that as being something that's different from the gross profit that we've had in years past. For our customers, we still have thousands and thousands of options available to them that are free. But if there's some specific feature option or unique component of a car that they're interested in, that's further away. They can still buy those cars that are further away, and we will charge a delivery fee. And I think when we go back to our previous best GPU year, which was 2021, we were at $4,500 for that year, that was a year where we didn't have that approximately $500 line item. That was a year where we didn't have ADESA. And so I think that's where Mark was talking about GPU being in a place where we think the future looks very bright relative to the past, and we're pretty excited about that as well.\nOperator: Next question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI.\nMichael Montani : I had one on the cost side and then a separate one on the customer base. But just on the cost side, if I could, just wanted to dig into a few of the buckets, in particular, the compensation and benefit, other SG&A and then market occupancy and just kind of get a handle around if you think of comp and ben right now, do you basically have the right team in place, the right size team? And any further improvements from here are basically going to be about process and efficiencies that you might gain? Or is there still some work to do there? And just kind of the same question then for other SG&A as well as market occupancy.\nMark Jenkins : Yes. Sure. So let me start with market. I can say that's the shortest answer. Market occupancy, if you think of more or less of fixed expense, I think we -- it's largely facilities out in our markets and including betting machines. And that's an expense where we think we have significant opportunities to scale into the fixed cost base that we have, but that is more or less fixed expense. So we think we can lever meaningfully with volume over time. . Moving on to comp and benefits, we certainly see opportunity to continue to drive down compensation and benefits. I think we've made tremendous progress there. Ernie talked a lot about that progress. I think the future gains are spread across different areas. We definitely see an opportunity to continue to become more efficient in operations. We see opportunities to continue to get leverage through our logistics network. We see opportunities to continue to identify, I'd say, savings in our corporate expenses as well. So I think we see opportunities across the board in compensation and benefits, but we've obviously made a lot of gains there recently. In other SG&A, other SG&A, we've talked about before, it's really -- it's kind of three major categories of expenses in there. There's transaction expenses. There's corporate expenses, and there's technology expenses. I think as Ernie sort of alluded to, we see opportunities in all three of those areas. We see an opportunity to bring down per unit transaction expenses over time with further efficiency initiatives. We've made some gains in limited warranty, bring that down on a per unit basis recently and see opportunities in some of the other expenses like title of registration. In corporate and technology, definitely, I think Ernie covered a lot of this ground, but see, a lot of opportunity for leverage with increased volume, but also see an opportunity to bring down dollar expenses over time as we continue to focus on efficiency. So that -- in touching on a lot of the same points that Ernie touched on, but we clearly see opportunity throughout the cost structure from where we sit today.\nMichael Montani : That's helpful. And just to follow up on the consumer side for a second. I don't know if there's any color that you could share in terms of the 25% decline that you saw. How would that shake out based on household income levels? And then also, I know you all have been working to improve profitability, and there is some metering involved. So can you give us a sense for how maybe the coastal markets were able to perform relative to those in the central part of the country?\nErnie Garcia : Sure. I don't think we have anything particularly interesting to say there. I think the trends that we've seen over the last year or so have remained. And I think as it relates to Carvana-specific trends, I think we continue to see middle of the country performing a little bit better than the coast for the same reasons discussed. And then I think as affordability has continued to kind of move away from most consumers, I mean, the trends that you'd expect where I think across the entire auto industry, there's generally been a shift toward higher incomes and higher FICOs. And I think that's really just more of a distribution shift that we would expect and hope will revert when either interest rates start to back up or car prices start to back up or both. And I think we saw -- through most of 2022, we saw car prices depreciate, but it was offset by increasing interest rates. I think early this year, we saw volatility in interest rates. We saw car prices start going back up. And I think more recently, we've seen wholesale prices going down for the last several weeks. Retail price has still been barely appreciating, but it looked like they will probably start to depreciate shortly. And so hopefully, we're headed down to a more sustainable path of sort of orderly depreciation that will bring more customers back into the market.\nOperator: Next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.\nSeth Basham : My first question is just on your first quarter results that were meaningfully higher than the updated guidance you provided on March 22nd driven by gross profit. Can you give us some more insight as to what drove the major improvement in the last days of the quarter?\nMark Jenkins : Sure. Yes. So with respect to our outlook, for Q1, I think we're very close to the top end of the range on units, revenue, SG&A, expense, loan originations, all those metrics. We beat on GPU. And in our outlook, we called out a couple of major points of uncertainty that wouldn't be known until after quarter end, those being the P&L from our loan hedging as well as our retail inventory allowance, which, in part, depends on what we see in the market. It's kind of around the time of quarter end or shortly thereafter. And so both of those uncertain items resolved favorably. That was the big driver on GPU. We had a couple of other beats -- small beats across other areas of the business in the last couple of weeks of the quarter, but those are the big 2.\nSeth Basham : Got it. That's helpful. So you've indicated that the retail inventory allowance is likely not sustainable. You've also talked to other GPU likely being over 2,000 in the second quarter, primarily driven by normalization of loan sale volumes. What do you consider normalized volumes? You've already sold 1.3 billion this quarter. I presume that's in line to above what I'd say normal based on historical trend.\nMark Jenkins : So I think the easiest way to think about normalized loan sale volume is you approximately sell what you originate. That's what we've done over the first many, many years of our life as a company. And so I think normalize is you sell what you originate. Obviously, there can be some timing shifts from quarter-to-quarter depending on market and other dynamics. As mentioned, we -- for example, so less than we originated in Q4 as one example of that. So I think the -- I think that's the easy way to think about normalized loan sale volume. Some quarters will be below normalized, some will be above. But on average, that's the right way to think about normalized. I think so far this quarter obviously have success selling and securitizing loans. So I think feel good about that. I think other GPUs we view as one of the areas of strength in the business, along with some of the other areas that we pointed out on the rest of this call. So I think we're feeling good about where we are.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nick Jones with JMP Securities.\nNicholas Jones : Maybe just a follow-up on the cost reductions and maybe the impact on the logistics network. As you start to turn the corner and maybe starting to build inventory and ramping volume, have kind of the cost reduction efforts you've made potentially impacted your ability to kind of scale volume in logistics? Or how should we think about maybe incremental investment out the other side as you do start to build inventory down the road? And maybe what changes you've made in logistics today?\nErnie Garcia : Sure. So I'm going to answer it with respect to most of the operating groups, and I think logistics will fit in this framework as well. I think there's efficiency and focus. There may be two different things. And I think we've clearly increased efficiency just because you asked about the logistics network. In the case of the logistics network, we've recently increased utilization of our logistics network, meaning the trucks are driving around with more cars on their back. We've decreased the miles. They're traveling over time by something like 40%. I think even quarter-over-quarter, it was down by 12%. That's taking many different forms that are driving those miles down. But -- so it is just more efficient. And therefore, there is kind of less work done per sale. And therefore, when it is time to grow. it will be less work to achieve the same level of growth. And I think that's true across all of our different operating groups. And I also think that a huge part of that efficiency has been gained because we sort of removed the variable from the equation. We've aimed for lower volumes that we are confident we could hit. And by doing that, we were able to just really focus on costs and expenses and keep everyone focused on all the projects that were necessary to complete to drive down those costs and expenses. And I think as a result, we are not focused on growth. And growth is its own focus, and it has a lot of associated projects, and it requires time and effort and attention. And we're not currently positioned to grow as quickly. So I think if we decided to press the button and turn around tomorrow, we certainly know how, but there would be a lag time associated with that to be able to really grow the way that we have in the past, and that is not our plan. Our plan is to hit the first step of our plan next quarter to then move through that to significantly positive unit economics and then to move to growth. And I think between here and there, we hope to make more gains and efficiency across all of our operating groups and then to shift our focus to growth when it's time. And that's something that we clearly feel like we know how to do. We clearly feel like we've got consumer demand for our offering that we'll be able to go satisfy when it's time.\nOperator: Next question is from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan.\nRajat Gupta : Just wanted to follow up on the receivables question from Seth earlier. So if I look at the reported financials, I mean, I think in the first quarter -- in the fourth quarter, you sell roughly $800 million lower than what you originated. In the first quarter, it looks like it was close to $300 million to $400 million versus what's originated. So there's like $1.2 billion of backlog receivables that need to be sold before you can go back to, like, an origination -- to a similar origination versus sales run rate or a normalized run rate. How long do we -- should we expect for that $1.2 billion backlog to get clear? Like is it going to be as soon as 2Q? Or will it take multiple quarters? And I have a follow-up.\nErnie Garcia : Sure. So I think you're approximately right in the size of the backlog. And I think that the way that, that works in the business is we've got a couple of billion dollars of warehouses we can kind of house those loans prior to selling them. That does tie up capital. So that extra on the order of $1.2 billion of loans is tying up a pretty meaningful portion of liquidity when we relieve that or unlock quite a bit of cash. We probably have about $0.15 discount on average in our warehouses. And so that means with using your number of $1.2 billion, that would unlock about $180 million of cash by selling those receivables down. I think we plan to sell those down in the coming quarters in an orderly way. I think the benefit of carrying them is we actually do earn additional finance GPU because those are very yieldy assets. And prior to sale, we are the ones benefiting from that yield. As Mark called out in Q1, we had some benefits there in finance GPU, but we do plan to catch up and sell them. I think the financial markets at least recently have been in a better spot. At the end of the first quarter, we had some elements of the regional banking crisis that caused the securitization market to be a bit choppy, and that caused us to push the securitization back that had been planned. We recently completed that securitization. It was our largest subprime securitization that we've done to date, and that actually went extremely well. We were many, many times oversubscribed across all classes, and we're extremely pleased with the way that went. I think a big part of what has driven that is, I think, we do attract the customer. We give them an experience that end up leading to very high-quality loan performance. I think the securitization market has recognized that. And so I think that, that's something that has -- we've been able to take advantage of as we've gone through this period. And so I think over the coming quarters, assuming that the financial markets were made open in the way they have been over the last several weeks, we will likely sell down those excess receivables, and that would be a onetime tailwind to other GPU when we do complete those sales.\nRajat Gupta : Understood. That's helpful. And then maybe just a broader question on the liquidity profile. You mentioned in the past that your next avenue to shore up liquidity would be to leverage the ADESA real estate. Curious like if that view has changed at all over the last couple of months. And would you be open to considering alternate options outside of the exchange offer, which is ongoing, to reduce the current level of interest burden versus taking on more debt, maybe restructuring the existing unsecured bonds or perhaps even considering a debt for equity swap?\nMark Jenkins : I can take that one. So no changes to the way that we've historically thought about that. I think typically, when we think about financing sources, generally speaking, we favor asset-based or sort of -- asset-based or secured financing, of which I think the biggest asset that we have today is real estate, have nearly $2 billion of total unpledged real estate assets. A little more than half of that is ADESA real estate locations and no change to our overall thought process there. I think we generally prefer asset-based on secured financing.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler.\nAlexander Potter : Great. Just one question from me, and it's about the competitive landscape in auto loans. I know that historically, you had mentioned you were a little bit quicker to hike interest rates than some of your peers who had bigger balance sheets. Wondering if there's been any rationalization in that regard or any other comments you'd be willing to make on the competitive landscape and auto lending would be helpful.\nErnie Garcia : Sure. Well, I think it's been a dynamic environment. So I think the primary dynamic that we probably have spoken most about as it relates to our loans over the last year or so was kind of the spread between the 2-year Treasury and Fed funds, which the 2-year Treasury is a good proxy for our cost of funds when we sell our receivables because they have approximately a 2-year duration, and they're generally sold into capital markets that use those sorts of rates as a reference point. And approximately half of the market for auto loans is provided by banks that oftentimes are using some combination of that and the Fed funds as their frame of reference. I think since the end of the first quarter when kind of the regional banking crisis hit or started, I think there's also been some dramatic moves in spreads that I think are other impacts that are somewhat unique right now and I think are a little bit harder to forecast over the medium term. I think probably there's been some spread widening in different areas. I think undoubtedly, Carvana itself has seen spread widening over the last year. I think that's too bad, but it shows up in our results. And so once you've got the results, you know what they are, I think that's actually good news for the future. So I think there's room for our spreads to come down over time as we approach the cost of funds of more mature issuers. So I think that, that's a dynamic that will play out. And then I just think that from here to the next couple of years from now when things are normal again, I think there will probably, at some point, be a normalization in 2-year Treasury versus Fed funds, and that will -- that should normalize. There will probably be something of a normalization in spreads. And then there should be a normalization in Carvana spreads relative to other issuers. And I think that all of those things leave room, I think, to be optimistic, but the timing on all of them is also uncertain.\nOperator: The next question is from Winnie Dong with Deutsche Bank.\nWinnie Dong : I just have one. On the commentary that you expect similar SG&A expense on a quarter-over-quarter basis, can you maybe clarify whether this is on a per unit basis or absolute dollar? And then I know you've discussed all of the various buckets to sort of go after on a longer-term basis. But near term, what's sort of driving that pause? And then when might that longer-term sort of reduction come back?\nMark Jenkins : Sure. Yes. Absolutely. So on the first part of the question, so we were talking about SG&A expense on a dollar basis. And I think the -- to put that in context a little bit, I think last quarter, we outlined a goal to achieve approximately $420 million of non-GAAP SG&A expenses by Q2. We obviously did that a quarter early, and not only to be in a quarter early, we'd also beat that goal by more than $15 million. So I think we're obviously feeling really great about the overall progress in moving SG&A expenses from the business and becoming more operationally efficient. So in Q2, our expectations similar SG&A expense to Q1, but I think that, in part, reflects just the very, very significant gains that we were able to make in Q1. Looking forward beyond that, we certainly -- we've made tremendous progress, but we certainly do not believe we're done. I think we have significant opportunities across the business, as I alluded to earlier, to continue to become more efficient in our operations. And that happens through all of the technology projects that we have going on throughout the operational efficiency groups to automate manual tasks, to make our routing and scheduling more efficient, to, as we alluded to earlier, incentivize customers to choose the cars that are close to them or to incentivizing them to do -- being pickups versus delivery, all kinds of things that help -- that we still have in progress to help drive operational efficiencies we're working on. And they're not -- we made great progress, but they're not done yet. So I think that's a little bit more color on the opportunities that we see ahead.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Exane BNP Paribas.\nChris Bottiglieri : I wanted to ask about -- I guess, first about the financing market. I saw you said a nonprime deal, which is pretty impressive to get that price in this liquidity environment. But like conceptually, how do you think about owning that residual versus selling it off just given where discount rates and risk spreads are and all that? Like is it still, like, capital efficient to do get on sale for these nonprime type deals? Or would you ultimately look to sell the residual?\nErnie Garcia : I think in general, we've looked to sell the residual. I think you point to something that is correct, which is the yields that residual buyers today are getting are very high compared to the past. And those yield profiles are very robust. They can take very large multiples of expected losses and still do quite well. And so I think that dynamic is correct, and that makes those desirable assets. But I think in this environment with our current goals, we still intend to sell those residuals over time.\nChris Bottiglieri : Got you. Okay. And then one, I guess, conceptual question as well on inventory. So it sounds like you just make more money on retail GPU when you sell the cars under 90 days. And I get the world just shifted dramatically in a dime, like no one can move that quickly, but have you rethought how you priced cars to their algorithms? Like is there a way to get more proactive with taking markdowns and setting up through wholesale, just to, like, put a rule in place to sell cars above a certain number of days? Like how do you learn from this experience and realizing how much better the model runs with quicker inventory days and kind of prevent this from happening in the future?\nMark Jenkins : Sure. I could take that one. So I think we have a multiyear period, I would say, honestly, 2018, '19, I think, late '20 and 2021, where we operate pretty tight inventory. Average sale, call it, as low as the high 50s, up through the mid- to high 60s, and we're -- and that's on average. We're pretty consistently operating in that range. I think that we probably experienced a little blip with COVID in early '20 and then certainly moved materially off of that normalized range in 2022 because we just overbuild inventory for the interest rate environment that ultimately came about and the sales that we ultimately ended up executing in 2022, we meaningfully overbuilt inventory for that. And so I think the -- what we're seeing with these cars above 90 days, I do think is really a function of us overbuilding into relative to sales and sort of maintaining that for most of 2022. Now we've clearly adjusted, clearly marched out inventory. The cars that we hold relative to the cars that we're selling are in a much more normalized range. As everything sort of works through, we think that'll lead to a much more normalized average sale, a much more normalized share of cars sold in less than 90 days. And so I think really the name of the game is returning to our historical norms after a pretty significant outlier year in 2020 that really kind of culminated in Q1.\nOperator: The next question is from Zachary Fadem with Wells Fargo.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Sam Reed] pitch-hitting for Zach. Wanted to bucket advertising savings in a bit more detail. Can you break out how much you might be saving from shifting to different ad spend channels like more digital versus just absolute reductions in ad spend? And then separately, a more broader one on market share. As you right-size the business, who do you think is picking up some of the market share you might be giving up?\nErnie Garcia : Sure. So I think at a very high level, I think what we've tried to do in marketing is kind of manage or uncertainty as best we can. And so what that basically meant was pulling more away from digital channels than brand channels. And what I mean by managing our uncertainty is I think brand channels tend to have a long and difficult to measure payoff, but we think that payoff is significant. Building a brand is an incredibly difficult thing to do. It's an incredibly valuable thing to do. Direct channels and various advertising channels vary in their level of directness, but direct channels tend to have a shorter, faster payoff that is much more measurable. And so as we've gone through this environment, we've tested many different channels. Some of those tests take kind of a global form where we do large A/B tests of using a channel or not using a channel. Many of those tests take kind of a market level forum where we pick a subset of markets that look similar to other subset of markets and we run one marketing channel in one set of markets and a different marketing channel and a different subset of markets, and we try to get a sense for how those are going. And those sorts of tests are a little bit less susceptible to errors and attribution. And I think we've just tried to kind of continually learn because this environment has to be different. It's been an environment where car prices are higher. It's been an environment where our inventory is smaller. Both those things mean lower conversion. It's been an environment where there's been less competition for various marketing channels, which means clicks are less expensive. And that varies by the marketing channel, even by the kind of sub-channel and side of any given channel. If we think about [SEM], for example, there are many sub keywords and sub kind of campaigns that you can run. So we try to be thoughtful about running many different tests and learning. I think that we feel like we've been pretty successful in cutting a lot of expense out. And I think we're excited by that. I think we're also starting to see that with GPU climbing up pretty significantly and our variable costs dropping pretty significantly, our contribution margins are starting to look better. And so I think some of those trades could change a little bit in terms of what marketing channels we're supposed to be utilizing. So we'll keep learning. And I think over time, we will most likely grow marketing spend from here, and I think there's a reasonable chance that it could even go up at the per unit level just given what's most efficient given our higher level of GPU and our lower levels of variable costs. And then as it relates to kind of market share, what I would say there is I really think the most important point here is this market is enormous. And so we're probably right now on the order of about 1% market share. We're down from where we were, let's say, two years ago, but we're down a similar amount to the market overall. I think quarter-to-quarter and kind of year-to-year that there can be some variability in those numbers. But if you look back kind of to a more normalized environment, we're probably down at a similar level to where the market was overall. And so we're probably about 1%. If you look at it over the last 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, we've certainly give up some. We were probably a little higher than 1%, and we're probably back down to 1% now. But then where that is going is to a mix of the other 99%. And I think the most important dynamic there is just that this is a very, very large market. And now is not a time when everyone is focused on growth here and we get appropriate not to be focused on growth. But I do think that if we allow ourselves the intelligence, it's worth thinking about what that will feel like again because we do have a differentiated customer offering that customers love. Our NPS is high. As we get more efficient, we're seeing benefits to NPS there. There will be a time when it's time to grow inventory again, it's time to turn up marketing because our GPU is high and our variable costs are low, and it will be very difficult to replicate the machine that we've built, and we're incredibly well positioned for that time. So I think when that time comes, we'll look to kind of take that volume from that -- the entirety of that market again, that very, very large market. And the great news of being in the market that big is very few players will be able to identify exactly where it's coming from because it is just such an enormous pool that we are drawing from. So I think it's hard for us to say where the very small amount of market share that we've given up is gone, but I think we're very well positioned to take it back when it's time.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Ernie Garcia, for any closing remarks.\nErnie Garcia : Thank you. Listen, everyone on the Carvana team, I cannot thank you enough. I think -- I hope you're proud looking at this quarter. I hope you feel that. I hope -- I know the last year has been a tough year. I know it is not a year that we anticipated walking into. I know that everyone's put in a ton of work. I know there were times when it felt like the payoff network was slow and it was hard. I hope you see this quarter as evidence that it is paying off, and it's paying off pretty quickly. I hope you also know that we still got a ton of work left to do, and all the focus that we've put in over the last year is paying off, but we've got a lot more effort to put in from here. So I think heads up, be proud, but also let's keep the pedal down. Let's keep going. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ernie Garcia",
            "content": "Thanks, Meg, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. The first quarter was a quarter of significant progress for Carvana. A year ago, the automotive industry as well as the macroeconomic and market environment changed pretty dramatically, resulting in us significantly shifting our near-term priorities away from growth and toward profitability. This shift has impacted everything we do. It has impacted what we are focused on, it has impacted how much we are focused on, and it impacted the way we are managing the business day to day. And all these adjustments take time. First, we made a narrow set of operating goals inside the company that we knew would be necessary to hit our financial targets. Second, we tightened the connections between our technology and operating teams through shared goals, shared meetings and even shared office spaces. These changes first have to show up in the projects the teams are undertaking. They move to operating metrics, and finally, they show up in financial results. And that is exactly how the progress has been unfolding. In the second quarter of 2022, we outlined our plan and discuss how we are organizing internally to tackle our goals. In the third quarter, we shared a number of operating metrics that we're beginning to rapidly move in the right direction. In the fourth quarter, we began to see some of the earliest signs of meaningful financial progress. And now in the first quarter of 2023, the direction speed of the financial progress is undeniable. We reduced SG&A by over $100 million quarter-over-quarter and completed our year-long effort to cut $1 billion of annualized costs out of the business. In addition, in the first quarter, we returned to our historical GPU and adjusted EBITDA margin trend lines and reported company best results for the first quarter in both metrics. We still have a long way to go to achieve our broader goals, but we are on the right path, and we are moving quickly. As we've discussed before, there are 3 steps in our plan to achieve positive cash flow and get Carvana back on track to becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. Number one, drive the business to positive adjusted EBITDA; number two, drive the business to significantly positive unit economics; number three, after achieving objective number one and two, return to growth. As outlined in the letter, we expect to complete the first step in this plan in the second quarter. The completion of this step is a milestone, not a change of direction. We'll be using the same processes and focus we have benefited from over the last year to continue to see the plan through. We remain firmly on the path to fulfilling our mission of changing the way people buy cars and to becoming the largest and most profitable automotive retailer. The march continues. Mark? Thanks for the question. So I think on inventory, we've definitely made a lot of progress. We rapidly moved through a pretty significant portion of our aged inventory in Q1. And so we started with a much larger inventory than was sized to sales, and we made a lot of progress of the quarter. Our inventory is down year-over-year about 55% and was down 20% in just Q1 alone. I think a useful metric for thinking about our inventory size and what that means for profitability is just thinking about how large our inventory is compared to the cars that we're selling at any given day. And if you kind of do that simple math and take inventory size divided by daily sales, in the quarter, we had about 65 days of implied turn time. That contrasts with the actual turn time of 120 days that Mark talked about in his prepared remarks, that's obviously a really big difference. And that leads to a pretty significant impact to retail GPU. In the letter, we provided a number where for the cars that were less than 90 days aged, which for that subset of cars, the average turn time is approximately 65 days. So it's a useful number compared to our implied turn time. We had retail GPU of over $2,000. And so I think we're heading into Q2 in a much better from an inventory perspective. I think that's been a year-long effort to kind of get sales to catch up to our relative size and inventory. And I think we're really pleased with the progress. We still have probably 1.5 quarters to go, maybe two quarters to go to get that all the way into alignment, but the size of the inventory relative to sales is now in alignment. So I think we're excited about that. On ad spend, that's another area where there has been a tremendous amount of pressure on units in the business. We're down approximately 64% year-over-year in ad spend. Quarter-over-quarter, we were down approximately 35%. So that was a big move as well. I think what we found is in this environment, cars are expensive, and consumers are a little bit less responsive to advertising. And so we've been retesting all of our various advertising channels. And I think the optimal that we are finding today are different from the optimal that we found in a more normalized environment, and that's led us to pull back pretty dramatically on marketing. That's exciting because I think we were able to show a customer acquisition cost of approximately $700 in the quarter, which is the lowest we've ever shown as a company by a pretty long way. And I think if you look in deeper, we had our oldest cohort, we were in the low 300s. So I think there's just a lot of progress that we're seeing there, and I think we're learning a lot about what the business model is capable of achieving. I think we continue to learn as we shrink our inventory and reduce our marketing spend, and I think we'll continue to make adjustments over the next couple of quarters as we learn more. I think it is more likely there will not be large reductions in marketing spend from here. I think it's also unlikely that it will shoot back up super dramatically, but we will continue to test it and evaluate what we learn from those tests, and then we'll go from there. Sure. So I mean to jump to the end, I think the right size for the company is much, much larger eventually. And I think the path there through profitability has just included some of these moves that we've made to shrink inventory and shrink marketing and get back in balance. I think where we found ourselves after 2021 was expecting another similar year and just being pretty dramatically out of balance with where sales actually were. And I think as we were growing from when we launched in 2013, all the way through 2021, we benefited a lot from the positive feedback in the business. As we got bigger, we got better. As we grew our inventory, conversion rates went up. As we spent more on marketing, it was easier to open new markets. And I think when we kind of found ourselves out of balance and we needed to rebalance the business, we knew that we were going to face the other side of that feedback. We knew that as we shrunk, we see conversion rates go down. We knew that was going to be a difficult transition. But in light of the environment, we also thought it was the fastest path to meaningful positive cash flow. And so we took that path, and I think we remain on it. I think we believe that we are probably pretty close to where sales will bottom out. I think we'll learn more on that over the coming quarters. We've obviously made dramatic moves. I gave the numbers to Sharon a moment ago about how quickly we've lowered advertising inventory just in the last quarter. And so I think some of those things can have some lag effects that will show up over the next couple of quarters. So I don't want to act overconfident that we know exactly what will happen there. But I think the major headwinds that have faced the business over the year are largely subsiding. There's clearly been some industry and macroeconomic headwinds in the form of cost. There's been macroeconomic headwinds in the form of interest rates. And then there's been a lot of carve-on and post headwinds in the form of inventory reduction and marketing reduction and focusing on profitability and pulling away from sales that were less profitable and implementing different product changes that we think make the business more efficient. And so I think that's undoubtedly been a difficult transition. It's hard to know exactly what the impact of all of those things are on volume. But doing the best job that we can and trying to control for all those, we do believe that the business is performing better than we might have imagined once we've made those moves. We have estimates for the elasticity of sales to inventory size and the marketing dollars and to many of our different product changes. And I think based on what we're seeing, we're actually pretty happy with where volumes are. I think the third step of our plan, when we get there, is going to be to turn back to growth. And that's something that we clearly know how to do. It's something we're clearly incredibly well positioned for. I think we'll be better positioned for it than ever before. When we're a more efficient business, it means that growth comes easier. When we're -- when we've got the infrastructure, we've been able to acquire over the last 1.5 years, we're going to be in a better position to grow, but I think that's step 3 in our plan. So we're looking forward to Q2. Where we plan to hit step 1, we'll stay focused in that same direction. We've already got our plans for the next 9 to 12 months to keep the pedal down and keep making a lot of progress in unit economics. We plan to do that at somewhat similar volumes to where we are today. And then when we get there, hit that goal, we're going to definitely turn our attention back to growth because we're still incredibly small compared to this huge opportunity. It is still a 40 million unit market. We still have an incredibly unique offering and, it's still an offering that customers love. Sure. Yes. So let me start with, I think where we've made the most progress in costs over the last year, we've made a lot of progress, and so I apologize for filling these numbers around over and over again, but we're proud of them. We've cut $1 billion of cost out of the business and over $100 million quarter-over-quarter. I think there are many areas of costs. There's kind of fixed costs. There's variable costs. There's semi-fixed costs, and then there's customer acquisition costs. In the variable costs, I think we are currently operating across virtually all of our operating groups at all-time best efficiencies. In the variable costs themselves, I think we're generally at or near all-time lows across all groups. And I think that's happening despite input costs being higher. Generally, the efficiency for all of our groups is better than it's ever been. And then in some groups, the costs are still in a similar place where they've been in the past because the input costs are higher, whether that's gas or there's been inflation just across the economy. So there are some areas where they're somewhat similar. But I think we've made a tremendous amount of progress, and I think there's more progress to be made in those variable costs. In kind of the semi-fixed costs, I think that's actually been the biggest bucket over the last year. That's when we were just built for a different level of volume than we saw. And I think we've made a ton of progress there, and that's been extremely helpful. I think there's still some room for us to make progress and get all the way in balance there, but I think most of that has been achieved. In customer acquisition costs, we are all-time lows. I gave the stat. At the company level, it's about $700 oldest cohort. It's in the low 300s. We have four cohorts that are better than company average. Those are pretty great numbers. Those are numbers that are -- in alignment, the low 300 numbers in alignment with best-in-class peers in the industry, and it's in line with our long-term financial model. So I think over time, there's room there, but I think that we've clearly proven that we can do much better than we ever have in the past, and I think that, that's exciting. Fixed costs today per unit are probably higher than they've ever been or at least near all-time highs. And that's because volumes are lower, and we've got a fixed cost business, and we feel like we're going to returns on those investments. I think that's -- once you've got costs, you'd rather than be fixed than anything else. So I think that, that's good news, but certainly our fixed costs are high relative to our sales today. And we do think we're getting a return on that investment. We continue to -- we plan to reduce those costs over time. We plan to reduce the dollars of those fixed costs. We've been making progress on that, but we can make more progress. And then the remainder of them on a per unit basis go away with scale. And some of them go away just with the passage of time. Today, we still have many facilities that we're massively underutilizing, in the case of some of our office space, that office space that will probably go away over time. In the case of our inspection centers, for example, that's something that we expect to live with scale. So I think we've clearly got a path to significant additional gains in expenses across all types of expenses. I think the biggest gains are behind us, and they took the form of that kind of semi-variable form where just getting the business back in balance was really valuable. And then you also asked a question about delivery fees. So something that we have done over the last year is we've changed our offerings such that when customers elect to buy a car that is further away from them, especially in case when there's a car that's closer to them, we will charge a delivery fee. And so that is flowing through our gross profit. I think Mark spoke about that as being something that's different from the gross profit that we've had in years past. For our customers, we still have thousands and thousands of options available to them that are free. But if there's some specific feature option or unique component of a car that they're interested in, that's further away. They can still buy those cars that are further away, and we will charge a delivery fee. And I think when we go back to our previous best GPU year, which was 2021, we were at $4,500 for that year, that was a year where we didn't have that approximately $500 line item. That was a year where we didn't have ADESA. And so I think that's where Mark was talking about GPU being in a place where we think the future looks very bright relative to the past, and we're pretty excited about that as well. Sure. I don't think we have anything particularly interesting to say there. I think the trends that we've seen over the last year or so have remained. And I think as it relates to Carvana-specific trends, I think we continue to see middle of the country performing a little bit better than the coast for the same reasons discussed. And then I think as affordability has continued to kind of move away from most consumers, I mean, the trends that you'd expect where I think across the entire auto industry, there's generally been a shift toward higher incomes and higher FICOs. And I think that's really just more of a distribution shift that we would expect and hope will revert when either interest rates start to back up or car prices start to back up or both. And I think we saw -- through most of 2022, we saw car prices depreciate, but it was offset by increasing interest rates. I think early this year, we saw volatility in interest rates. We saw car prices start going back up. And I think more recently, we've seen wholesale prices going down for the last several weeks. Retail price has still been barely appreciating, but it looked like they will probably start to depreciate shortly. And so hopefully, we're headed down to a more sustainable path of sort of orderly depreciation that will bring more customers back into the market. Sure. So I'm going to answer it with respect to most of the operating groups, and I think logistics will fit in this framework as well. I think there's efficiency and focus. There may be two different things. And I think we've clearly increased efficiency just because you asked about the logistics network. In the case of the logistics network, we've recently increased utilization of our logistics network, meaning the trucks are driving around with more cars on their back. We've decreased the miles. They're traveling over time by something like 40%. I think even quarter-over-quarter, it was down by 12%. That's taking many different forms that are driving those miles down. But -- so it is just more efficient. And therefore, there is kind of less work done per sale. And therefore, when it is time to grow. it will be less work to achieve the same level of growth. And I think that's true across all of our different operating groups. And I also think that a huge part of that efficiency has been gained because we sort of removed the variable from the equation. We've aimed for lower volumes that we are confident we could hit. And by doing that, we were able to just really focus on costs and expenses and keep everyone focused on all the projects that were necessary to complete to drive down those costs and expenses. And I think as a result, we are not focused on growth. And growth is its own focus, and it has a lot of associated projects, and it requires time and effort and attention. And we're not currently positioned to grow as quickly. So I think if we decided to press the button and turn around tomorrow, we certainly know how, but there would be a lag time associated with that to be able to really grow the way that we have in the past, and that is not our plan. Our plan is to hit the first step of our plan next quarter to then move through that to significantly positive unit economics and then to move to growth. And I think between here and there, we hope to make more gains and efficiency across all of our operating groups and then to shift our focus to growth when it's time. And that's something that we clearly feel like we know how to do. We clearly feel like we've got consumer demand for our offering that we'll be able to go satisfy when it's time. Sure. So I think you're approximately right in the size of the backlog. And I think that the way that, that works in the business is we've got a couple of billion dollars of warehouses we can kind of house those loans prior to selling them. That does tie up capital. So that extra on the order of $1.2 billion of loans is tying up a pretty meaningful portion of liquidity when we relieve that or unlock quite a bit of cash. We probably have about $0.15 discount on average in our warehouses. And so that means with using your number of $1.2 billion, that would unlock about $180 million of cash by selling those receivables down. I think we plan to sell those down in the coming quarters in an orderly way. I think the benefit of carrying them is we actually do earn additional finance GPU because those are very yieldy assets. And prior to sale, we are the ones benefiting from that yield. As Mark called out in Q1, we had some benefits there in finance GPU, but we do plan to catch up and sell them. I think the financial markets at least recently have been in a better spot. At the end of the first quarter, we had some elements of the regional banking crisis that caused the securitization market to be a bit choppy, and that caused us to push the securitization back that had been planned. We recently completed that securitization. It was our largest subprime securitization that we've done to date, and that actually went extremely well. We were many, many times oversubscribed across all classes, and we're extremely pleased with the way that went. I think a big part of what has driven that is, I think, we do attract the customer. We give them an experience that end up leading to very high-quality loan performance. I think the securitization market has recognized that. And so I think that, that's something that has -- we've been able to take advantage of as we've gone through this period. And so I think over the coming quarters, assuming that the financial markets were made open in the way they have been over the last several weeks, we will likely sell down those excess receivables, and that would be a onetime tailwind to other GPU when we do complete those sales. Sure. Well, I think it's been a dynamic environment. So I think the primary dynamic that we probably have spoken most about as it relates to our loans over the last year or so was kind of the spread between the 2-year Treasury and Fed funds, which the 2-year Treasury is a good proxy for our cost of funds when we sell our receivables because they have approximately a 2-year duration, and they're generally sold into capital markets that use those sorts of rates as a reference point. And approximately half of the market for auto loans is provided by banks that oftentimes are using some combination of that and the Fed funds as their frame of reference. I think since the end of the first quarter when kind of the regional banking crisis hit or started, I think there's also been some dramatic moves in spreads that I think are other impacts that are somewhat unique right now and I think are a little bit harder to forecast over the medium term. I think probably there's been some spread widening in different areas. I think undoubtedly, Carvana itself has seen spread widening over the last year. I think that's too bad, but it shows up in our results. And so once you've got the results, you know what they are, I think that's actually good news for the future. So I think there's room for our spreads to come down over time as we approach the cost of funds of more mature issuers. So I think that, that's a dynamic that will play out. And then I just think that from here to the next couple of years from now when things are normal again, I think there will probably, at some point, be a normalization in 2-year Treasury versus Fed funds, and that will -- that should normalize. There will probably be something of a normalization in spreads. And then there should be a normalization in Carvana spreads relative to other issuers. And I think that all of those things leave room, I think, to be optimistic, but the timing on all of them is also uncertain. I think in general, we've looked to sell the residual. I think you point to something that is correct, which is the yields that residual buyers today are getting are very high compared to the past. And those yield profiles are very robust. They can take very large multiples of expected losses and still do quite well. And so I think that dynamic is correct, and that makes those desirable assets. But I think in this environment with our current goals, we still intend to sell those residuals over time. Sure. So I think at a very high level, I think what we've tried to do in marketing is kind of manage or uncertainty as best we can. And so what that basically meant was pulling more away from digital channels than brand channels. And what I mean by managing our uncertainty is I think brand channels tend to have a long and difficult to measure payoff, but we think that payoff is significant. Building a brand is an incredibly difficult thing to do. It's an incredibly valuable thing to do. Direct channels and various advertising channels vary in their level of directness, but direct channels tend to have a shorter, faster payoff that is much more measurable. And so as we've gone through this environment, we've tested many different channels. Some of those tests take kind of a global form where we do large A/B tests of using a channel or not using a channel. Many of those tests take kind of a market level forum where we pick a subset of markets that look similar to other subset of markets and we run one marketing channel in one set of markets and a different marketing channel and a different subset of markets, and we try to get a sense for how those are going. And those sorts of tests are a little bit less susceptible to errors and attribution. And I think we've just tried to kind of continually learn because this environment has to be different. It's been an environment where car prices are higher. It's been an environment where our inventory is smaller. Both those things mean lower conversion. It's been an environment where there's been less competition for various marketing channels, which means clicks are less expensive. And that varies by the marketing channel, even by the kind of sub-channel and side of any given channel. If we think about [SEM], for example, there are many sub keywords and sub kind of campaigns that you can run. So we try to be thoughtful about running many different tests and learning. I think that we feel like we've been pretty successful in cutting a lot of expense out. And I think we're excited by that. I think we're also starting to see that with GPU climbing up pretty significantly and our variable costs dropping pretty significantly, our contribution margins are starting to look better. And so I think some of those trades could change a little bit in terms of what marketing channels we're supposed to be utilizing. So we'll keep learning. And I think over time, we will most likely grow marketing spend from here, and I think there's a reasonable chance that it could even go up at the per unit level just given what's most efficient given our higher level of GPU and our lower levels of variable costs. And then as it relates to kind of market share, what I would say there is I really think the most important point here is this market is enormous. And so we're probably right now on the order of about 1% market share. We're down from where we were, let's say, two years ago, but we're down a similar amount to the market overall. I think quarter-to-quarter and kind of year-to-year that there can be some variability in those numbers. But if you look back kind of to a more normalized environment, we're probably down at a similar level to where the market was overall. And so we're probably about 1%. If you look at it over the last 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, we've certainly give up some. We were probably a little higher than 1%, and we're probably back down to 1% now. But then where that is going is to a mix of the other 99%. And I think the most important dynamic there is just that this is a very, very large market. And now is not a time when everyone is focused on growth here and we get appropriate not to be focused on growth. But I do think that if we allow ourselves the intelligence, it's worth thinking about what that will feel like again because we do have a differentiated customer offering that customers love. Our NPS is high. As we get more efficient, we're seeing benefits to NPS there. There will be a time when it's time to grow inventory again, it's time to turn up marketing because our GPU is high and our variable costs are low, and it will be very difficult to replicate the machine that we've built, and we're incredibly well positioned for that time. So I think when that time comes, we'll look to kind of take that volume from that -- the entirety of that market again, that very, very large market. And the great news of being in the market that big is very few players will be able to identify exactly where it's coming from because it is just such an enormous pool that we are drawing from. So I think it's hard for us to say where the very small amount of market share that we've given up is gone, but I think we're very well positioned to take it back when it's time. Thank you. Listen, everyone on the Carvana team, I cannot thank you enough. I think -- I hope you're proud looking at this quarter. I hope you feel that. I hope -- I know the last year has been a tough year. I know it is not a year that we anticipated walking into. I know that everyone's put in a ton of work. I know there were times when it felt like the payoff network was slow and it was hard. I hope you see this quarter as evidence that it is paying off, and it's paying off pretty quickly. I hope you also know that we still got a ton of work left to do, and all the focus that we've put in over the last year is paying off, but we've got a lot more effort to put in from here. So I think heads up, be proud, but also let's keep the pedal down. Let's keep going. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. Our first quarter results demonstrated significant progress on our path to profitability. We exceeded our goal of driving $100 million of non-GAAP SG&A reductions one quarter early, and we surpassed our previously communicated goal of greater than 4,000 GPU. In the first quarter, retail units sold totaled 79,240, a decrease of 25% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. Our decline in retail units sold, which we expected, was driven by four primary factors: one, reduced inventory size; two, reduced advertising; three, increased benchmark interest rates and credit spreads; and four, a continued focus on executing our profitability initiatives. Total revenue was $2.6 billion, a decrease of 25% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Due to the dynamic nature of the current environment, we will focus our remaining remarks on sequential changes. As we've previously discussed, our long-term financial goal is to generate significant GAAP net income and free cash flow. In service of that goal, in the near term, our management team is focused on driving progress on a set of key non-GAAP financial metrics that are inputs into this long-term goal, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP SG&A expense and adjusted EBITDA. In the first quarter, non-GAAP total GPU was $4,796, a sequential increase of $2,129 driven by increases across all components. Non-GAAP retail GPU was $1,591 versus $632 in Q4. Retail GPU included a $593 benefit due to an adjustment to our retail inventory allowance. In addition, sequential changes in retail GPU were primarily driven by higher average days of sale, partially offset by wider spreads between wholesale and retail market prices, higher shipping revenue and lower reconditioning and inbound transport costs. Notably, we achieved our Q1 retail GPU despite selling vehicles that were, on average, more than 120 days old. Vehicles sold in Q1 that were less than 90 days old had retail GPU over 2,000, illustrating the benefit of normalizing inventory size and turning vehicles more quickly. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $1,236 versus $551 in Q4. Wholesale GPU included a $50 benefit due to an adjustment to our wholesale inventory allowance. In addition, we estimate that wholesale GPU benefited by $150 due to abnormal wholesale market appreciation in the quarter. Beyond those factors, sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by higher wholesale marketplace volume. Non-GAAP other GPU was $1,969 versus $1,483 in Q4. Sequential improvement in other GPU was primarily driven by a greater volume of loans sold in the quarter compared to Q4. In Q1, we sold slightly less than a normalized volume of loans as a result of uncertainty in the securitization market in March. The GPU impact of this less-than-normalized sales volume was largely offset by higher interest income and other improvements, leading to an approximately normalized other GPU in Q1. In Q1, we made significant progress reducing SG&A expenses for the third consecutive quarter, reducing non-GAAP SG&A expense by $119 million sequentially, following a $60 million sequential reduction in Q4. These expense reductions were broad-based, including advertising, compensation and benefits, logistics and other SG&A. Non-GAAP SG&A expense per retail unit sold decreased by more than $900 sequentially in Q1, demonstrating significant operating leverage. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $24 million in Q1 or 0.9% of revenue. We expect to achieve positive adjusted EBITDA in Q2. After a strong quarter in Q1, we expect to drive greater than $5,000 of non-GAAP total GPU in Q2 as long as the macroeconomic and industry environment remains similar to Q1. Our strong GPU performance is powered by 3 fundamental drivers: driver number one, a more robust retail GPU model. We expect greater than $2,000 of non-GAAP retail GPU in Q2 driven primarily by our efforts to normalize inventory size, accelerate turn times and generate additional revenue from additional services. In FY '21, we generated approximately $1,700 of non-GAAP retail GPU. Since then, we've made fundamental improvements that we believe will drive higher retail GPU on a sustainable basis. First, we have continued to improve our customer vehicle sourcing with a higher share of retail units sourced from customers in Q1 2023 than in FY 2021. Second, we are generating more revenue from the unique services we offer our customers, including nationwide shipping and home delivery. Third, over time, we expect per unit reconditioning and inbound transport costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, to be below FY 2021 due to our continued focus on operating efficiency. Moving on to driver number two, expanded wholesale platform. We expect greater than $1,000 of non-GAAP wholesale GPU in Q2, split between Carvana's first-party wholesale vehicle sales and ADESA's third-party wholesale marketplace. In FY '21, we generated approximately $450 of non-GAAP wholesale GPU. Since then, we've made several fundamental improvements that we believe will drive higher wholesale GPU on a sustainable basis. First, in May 2022, we acquired ADESA, the second largest U.S. wholesale used vehicle auction marketplace. ADESA's wholesale marketplace generated significant gross profit in Q1 and will be a long-term addition to our total gross profit. Second, our acquisition of ADESA has improved the efficiency of our offering of buying cars from customers and selling them in the wholesale market. For example, since Q1 2022, we have reduced inbound transport costs on wholesale vehicles by approximately $200 per wholesale unit sold or approximately $90 per retail unit sold, supported by ADESA locations. Third, we continue to invest in our wholesale platform through product and process improvements with a continued goal of growing these businesses over time. Moving on to driver number three, strong finance and ancillary product execution. We expect greater than $2,000 non-GAAP other GPU in Q2, primarily driven by a normalization of loan sales volume. Since the beginning of Q2, we have sold or securitized approximately $1.3 billion of loan principal, an increase compared to Q1. In FY '21, we generated approximately $2,450 of non-GAAP other GPU. While we have not yet regained this level, in the medium term, we see a significant opportunity to increase other GPU by improving our cost of fund spread relative to mature securitization market participants and by continuing to expand our ancillary product platform. To summarize, our first quarter results and second quarter outlook reflect the return to our multitrack -- multiyear track record of driving GPU improvements. We believe the gains we are demonstrating in 2023 are sustainable and reflect the significant fundamental improvements we have made in the last 12 months. We also see further opportunities for more improvements in GPU in the future. Moving on to our second quarter outlook. While the macroeconomic and industry environment continues to be uncertain, looking toward Q2 '23 more broadly, we expect the following as long as the environment remains stable. On retail units, we currently expect a sequential reduction in retail units sold in Q2 compared to Q1 as we continue to normalize our inventory size, optimize marketing spend, make progress on our profitability initiatives -- and make progress on our profitability initiatives. On SG&A, we expect similar non-GAAP SG&A expense in Q2 compared to Q1. We continue to see significant opportunities to further reduce non-GAAP SG&A expenses over time. Finally, we expect to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in Q2, achieving the first step in our 3-step plan to generate positive free cash flow. On March 31, we had approximately $3.5 billion in total liquidity resources, including $1.5 billion in cash and revolving availability and $2 billion in unpledged real estate and other assets, including more than $1 billion of real estate acquired with ADESA. Our strong liquidity position, significant production capacity runway and our clear and focused operating plan positions us well on our path to achieve our goal of driving positive free cash flow and becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer in the future. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. Sure. Yes, happy to answer that. So yes, the comparison that we talked about in prepared remarks was Q1 2023 compared to 2021. So we certainly have continued to make progress on sourcing cars directly from customers over that time period. I think we feel great about that. I think we've talked about it before, but sourcing cars from customers is a great source of inventory because it's a great selection of cars, very broad array of different makes, models, years, mileages. And then also, those cars tend to be more profitable than cars that you acquire at auction. So I think that's an area of the business where we've had great success over the years. I think we feel like we've got access to a lot of cars, and we have a lot of customers coming to the site appraising vehicles with us. And so I think that's obviously been a success story in the business over the last couple of years, and we're looking to continue that success as we move forward. Yes. Sure. So let me start with market. I can say that's the shortest answer. Market occupancy, if you think of more or less of fixed expense, I think we -- it's largely facilities out in our markets and including betting machines. And that's an expense where we think we have significant opportunities to scale into the fixed cost base that we have, but that is more or less fixed expense. So we think we can lever meaningfully with volume over time. . Moving on to comp and benefits, we certainly see opportunity to continue to drive down compensation and benefits. I think we've made tremendous progress there. Ernie talked a lot about that progress. I think the future gains are spread across different areas. We definitely see an opportunity to continue to become more efficient in operations. We see opportunities to continue to get leverage through our logistics network. We see opportunities to continue to identify, I'd say, savings in our corporate expenses as well. So I think we see opportunities across the board in compensation and benefits, but we've obviously made a lot of gains there recently. In other SG&A, other SG&A, we've talked about before, it's really -- it's kind of three major categories of expenses in there. There's transaction expenses. There's corporate expenses, and there's technology expenses. I think as Ernie sort of alluded to, we see opportunities in all three of those areas. We see an opportunity to bring down per unit transaction expenses over time with further efficiency initiatives. We've made some gains in limited warranty, bring that down on a per unit basis recently and see opportunities in some of the other expenses like title of registration. In corporate and technology, definitely, I think Ernie covered a lot of this ground, but see, a lot of opportunity for leverage with increased volume, but also see an opportunity to bring down dollar expenses over time as we continue to focus on efficiency. So that -- in touching on a lot of the same points that Ernie touched on, but we clearly see opportunity throughout the cost structure from where we sit today. Sure. Yes. So with respect to our outlook, for Q1, I think we're very close to the top end of the range on units, revenue, SG&A, expense, loan originations, all those metrics. We beat on GPU. And in our outlook, we called out a couple of major points of uncertainty that wouldn't be known until after quarter end, those being the P&L from our loan hedging as well as our retail inventory allowance, which, in part, depends on what we see in the market. It's kind of around the time of quarter end or shortly thereafter. And so both of those uncertain items resolved favorably. That was the big driver on GPU. We had a couple of other beats -- small beats across other areas of the business in the last couple of weeks of the quarter, but those are the big 2. So I think the easiest way to think about normalized loan sale volume is you approximately sell what you originate. That's what we've done over the first many, many years of our life as a company. And so I think normalize is you sell what you originate. Obviously, there can be some timing shifts from quarter-to-quarter depending on market and other dynamics. As mentioned, we -- for example, so less than we originated in Q4 as one example of that. So I think the -- I think that's the easy way to think about normalized loan sale volume. Some quarters will be below normalized, some will be above. But on average, that's the right way to think about normalized. I think so far this quarter obviously have success selling and securitizing loans. So I think feel good about that. I think other GPUs we view as one of the areas of strength in the business, along with some of the other areas that we pointed out on the rest of this call. So I think we're feeling good about where we are. I can take that one. So no changes to the way that we've historically thought about that. I think typically, when we think about financing sources, generally speaking, we favor asset-based or sort of -- asset-based or secured financing, of which I think the biggest asset that we have today is real estate, have nearly $2 billion of total unpledged real estate assets. A little more than half of that is ADESA real estate locations and no change to our overall thought process there. I think we generally prefer asset-based on secured financing. Sure. Yes. Absolutely. So on the first part of the question, so we were talking about SG&A expense on a dollar basis. And I think the -- to put that in context a little bit, I think last quarter, we outlined a goal to achieve approximately $420 million of non-GAAP SG&A expenses by Q2. We obviously did that a quarter early, and not only to be in a quarter early, we'd also beat that goal by more than $15 million. So I think we're obviously feeling really great about the overall progress in moving SG&A expenses from the business and becoming more operationally efficient. So in Q2, our expectations similar SG&A expense to Q1, but I think that, in part, reflects just the very, very significant gains that we were able to make in Q1. Looking forward beyond that, we certainly -- we've made tremendous progress, but we certainly do not believe we're done. I think we have significant opportunities across the business, as I alluded to earlier, to continue to become more efficient in our operations. And that happens through all of the technology projects that we have going on throughout the operational efficiency groups to automate manual tasks, to make our routing and scheduling more efficient, to, as we alluded to earlier, incentivize customers to choose the cars that are close to them or to incentivizing them to do -- being pickups versus delivery, all kinds of things that help -- that we still have in progress to help drive operational efficiencies we're working on. And they're not -- we made great progress, but they're not done yet. So I think that's a little bit more color on the opportunities that we see ahead. Sure. I could take that one. So I think we have a multiyear period, I would say, honestly, 2018, '19, I think, late '20 and 2021, where we operate pretty tight inventory. Average sale, call it, as low as the high 50s, up through the mid- to high 60s, and we're -- and that's on average. We're pretty consistently operating in that range. I think that we probably experienced a little blip with COVID in early '20 and then certainly moved materially off of that normalized range in 2022 because we just overbuild inventory for the interest rate environment that ultimately came about and the sales that we ultimately ended up executing in 2022, we meaningfully overbuilt inventory for that. And so I think the -- what we're seeing with these cars above 90 days, I do think is really a function of us overbuilding into relative to sales and sort of maintaining that for most of 2022. Now we've clearly adjusted, clearly marched out inventory. The cars that we hold relative to the cars that we're selling are in a much more normalized range. As everything sort of works through, we think that'll lead to a much more normalized average sale, a much more normalized share of cars sold in less than 90 days. And so I think really the name of the game is returning to our historical norms after a pretty significant outlier year in 2020 that really kind of culminated in Q1."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Meg Kehan, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMeg Kehan: Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on Carvana\u2019s third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Please note that this call will be simultaneously webcast on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s corporate website at investors.carvana.com. The third quarter Shareholder Letter is also posted on the IR website. Additionally, we posted a set of supplemental financial tables for Q3, which can be found on the Events and Presentations page of our IR website. Joining me on the call today are Ernie Garcia, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Jenkins, Chief Financial Officer. Before we start, I would like to remind you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, Carvana\u2019s market opportunities and future financial results that involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed here. A detailed discussion of the material factors that cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements can be found in the Risk Factors section of Carvana\u2019s most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements and risks in this conference call are based on current expectations as of today, and Carvana assumes no obligation to update or revise them whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Our commentary today will include non-GAAP financial metrics. Unless otherwise specified, all references to GPU and SG&A will be to the non-GAAP metrics, and all references to EBITDA will be to adjusted EBITDA. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our Shareholder Letter issued today, a copy of which can be found on our IR website. And with that said, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thanks Meg and thanks everyone for joining the call. The third quarter was another exceptional quarter for Carvana. We had record performance in virtually every key financial measure. Our net income in the third quarter was $148 million, our operating income was $337 million and our adjusted EBITDA was $429 million for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.7%. Excitingly, when putting those numbers into broader context in the third quarter we also broke last quarter\u2019s record for the most profitable quarter among automotive public retailers ever. And this is being achieved in what most are describing as a challenging environment in the industry. Over the last 11 years and $10 billion, we laid the foundations of a highly differentiated model that delivers highly differentiated customer experiences at scale. Over the last two and a half years, we have learned hard fought lessons that led to rapidly driving operational and financial efficiencies across the business. And over the last nine months, we have paired our highly differentiated customer experiences and highly differentiated financial model to simultaneously become the fastest growing and most profitable automotive retailer. A simple way to think about this is the gap between Carvana and our competitors in growth and financial performance is equal to the gap between Carvana and our competitors in customer experience and business model quality. If you take a moment to reflect on that framework, what does it imply for our ultimate market share? We find our answer to that question to be very exciting, especially because we aren\u2019t done digging our moat. We continue to see significant opportunities for further improvement in every part of the business. With the creativity and ambition of our team, we don\u2019t expect this to end anytime soon. In addition, we have already invested in and built the most difficult to obtain and expensive infrastructure required to enable scaling, and that infrastructure unlocks efficient growth to a significant multiple of our current size. We currently have built out reconditioning infrastructure to support over 1 million retail units per year. Beyond that, we have enough physical real estate to support over 3 million retail units per year. And our path to unlocking it is being illuminated as we have built and executed our integration playbook at five of the 56 Odessa sites already. Underscoring the value of these investments as well as the efficiency of our operations completing each of these integrations required minimal CapEx and approximately 90 days of lead time. In the past, building reconditioning centers was generally a one to three year process requiring significant CapEx. Continuing this rollout over time will drive positive feedback in our business by reconditioning more cars closer to our customers. This will improve unit economics through more efficient access to large pools of inventory as well as lower inbound and outbound shipping distances and costs, and will provide customer experiences that are even better through greater selection and faster delivery. All of this is happening in the context of an industry with 40 million used vehicle transactions per year. The opportunity is very big and largely untapped. As a 1% market shareholder, the opportunity in front of us is still 99% as large as it was on day one. Accordingly, we are continuing to apply day one intensity to tackling our opportunity. Building Carvana was always going to be hard. Our business is complex, demands many different functional capabilities and is capital intensive. Doing hard and valuable things is the ultimate competitive moat and we have done many hard things over the last 11 years. As a result, we\u2019re in a stronger competitive position than we have ever been. From here, the degree of our success will be driven by our ability to maintain our intensity, our ambition and our focus, and will be governed by the quality of our execution. These are all things we are in control of and that\u2019s an exciting place to be. We are energized and remain firmly on the path to buying and selling millions of cars, to becoming the largest, most profitable automotive retailer and fulfilling our mission of changing the way people buy and sell cars. The march continues. Mark?\nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. The third quarter was an extraordinary quarter for Carvana that was enabled by our team\u2019s continued focus on driving operational excellence by identifying further fundamental gains and operating efficiencies while also pursuing growth. For the third consecutive quarter, we earned positive net income and we again set new company records for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, GAAP operating income and GAAP operating margin. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.7% surpassed the midpoint of our long-term financial model EBITDA margin range of 8% to 13.5% and we continue to see meaningful opportunities for fundamental gains to continue driving toward the higher end of that range over time. Moving to our third quarter results, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis. Q3 again demonstrated the strength of our differentiated business model and our ability to achieve both strong unit growth and profitability. The strong demand experienced in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter. Retail units sold totaled 108,651 in Q3, an increase of 34%. Revenue was $3.655 billion, an increase of 32%. Our strong results in the third quarter and expectation of accelerating year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter is being driven by our three long-term growth drivers. One, continuously improving our customer offering. While we continue to focus our people, process and product efforts on driving fundamental gains in unit economics, these efforts are also leading to meaningful improvements in the customer experience through more seamless shopping, transaction and delivery experiences. Two, increasing awareness, understanding and trust. Our growth through the first three quarters of the year has benefited from increasing brand awareness and consumer shifts toward e-commerce on approximately flat advertising spend. In Q4, along with our accelerating growth, we expect to invest between $5 million and $10 million more in advertising compared to Q3 to further raise awareness of our offer. Three, increasing inventory selection and other benefits of scale. Inventory selection and more inventory pools in more locations are two key sources of positive feedback in our business model leading to better selection and faster delivery times. Throughout the year, our inventory teams have been focused on increasing production output to better match demand and we made progress doing so in the third quarter. However, we still remain below our target available website inventory levels and returning to more optimal levels remains a key near term focus. Our strong profitability results in Q3 were again driven by sustained and fundamental improvements across all GPU components and operations expenses as well as levering our overhead expenses. Non-GAAP retail GPU was $3,617, an increase of $740, marking our sixth sequential quarter with a new company record. Strength in retail GPU continues to be driven by fundamental gains and consistent performance across several areas including non-vehicle cost of sales, customer sourcing, inventory turn times and revenues from additional services. Year-over-year changes were also driven by higher spreads between wholesale and retail market prices and lower retail depreciation rates. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect seasonality in retail GPU to be more similar to our average seasonality in 2018 through 2021 than our seasonality in 2022 and 2023, with the latter two years both impacted by unique internal factors. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $1,123, an increase of $172. Year-over-year changes were primarily driven by growth in both wholesale vehicle and wholesale marketplace gross profit. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect seasonality in wholesale gross profit dollars to be similar to our average seasonality in 2018 through 2023. Non-GAAP other GPU was $2,945, an increase of $377. The increase in other GPU was primarily driven by higher spreads between origination, interest rates and benchmark rates, partially offset by the impacts of hedging benchmark rate, interest rate changes and selling a smaller amount of loans relative to originations in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023. We estimate that selling a greater volume of loans than we originated generated approximately $150 per unit of incremental other GPU in Q3 and that a decline in benchmark interest rates between loan origination and sale generated approximately $100 per unit of incremental other GPU in Q3. Other things being equal. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $406 million, an increase of 10%. Q3 was another strong quarter for demonstrating the power of our model to lever SG&A expenses. Our 34% growth in retail units sold led to an $832 reduction in non-GAAP SG&A expense per retail units sold. The Carvana operations portion of SG&A expense totaled $1,731 per retail unit sold, a decrease of $220 primarily driven by our operational efficiency initiatives. The overhead portion of SG&A expense totaled $147 million in Q3, an increase of $6 million primarily driven by $4 million of non-recurring benefits in Q3 last year, leading to a reduction of $388 per retail unit sold. 2024 has been an incredible year for Carvana. To say thank you to our team members that helped make this a reality, we have announced a thank you cash bonus to thousands of employees across Carvana that will impact adjusted EBITDA by approximately $10 million in Q4. We continue to see opportunities for significant SG&A expense leverage over time and as we scale driven by both continued improvements in operational expenses as well as leverage in the fixed components of our cost structure. Adjusted EBITDA was $429 million in Q3, an increase of $281 million and a new company record. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.7% in Q3, a 6.4 percentage point increase and a new company record. It is worth noting that our adjusted EBITDA is very high quality compared to many rapidly growing companies due to relatively low non-cash expenses. Our GAAP operating income was $337 million in Q3 leading to GAAP operating margin of 9.2%, leading the public auto retail industry. As previously noted, we are currently carrying many expenses for over one million retail unit sales capacity and expect our GAAP operating income to grow faster than adjusted EBITDA over time. As discussed in prior quarters, we believe that pairing our strong financial results with the measured actions we have taken thus far position us well to continue delevering our balance sheet over time. In the third quarter we repurchased an additional $100 million of our 2028 senior secured notes which when coupled with our adjusted EBITDA generation and our strong liquidity position further improves our leverage ratios. Our results through Q3 position us well for a strong finish to 2024. Looking toward the fourth quarter, we expect the following as long as the environment remains stable. First, a sequential increase in our year-over-year growth rate of retail units sold; and second, adjusted EBITDA significantly above the high end of our previously communicated range of $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion for the full year 2024. Looking forward, as we generate profit, we expect an effective cash tax rate, including income tax and tax receivable agreement payments of approximately 22% in the near-term and approximately 25% in the longer term on Carvana Co.\u2019s income, assuming current U.S. corporate income tax rates. In conclusion, Q3 was an exceptional quarter for Carvana. We remain very excited about progressing in our long-term phase of driving profitable growth and pursuing our goal of becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer and buying and selling millions of cars. Thank you for your attention. We\u2019ll now take questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to talk about the ADESA integration. So I remember when you bought it, as I think the CapEx for integrating IRCs was like roughly a little under $20 million per site. It sounds like maybe that\u2019s coming in less than that. And then as a corollary, I know you guys have been excited about same-day delivery kind of growing to address a greater part of the population. What percent of your sales right now are same-day delivery? Could you kind of contrast that maybe relative to a year ago? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Yes, perfect. So I think we\u2019re extremely excited about these integrations. They\u2019ve been going very well. The integration basically means that we unlock reconditioning \u2013 Carvana reconditioning capabilities at ADESA sites. That means that we use our systems and our processes to recondition cars. And that\u2019s been going exceptionally well. We\u2019ve seen gains kind of across the board by making those conversions. And then I think what we\u2019re generally doing today is we\u2019re doing kind of a lighter CapEx version of it to unlock a portion of the ultimate capacity that can be unlocked at each of those sites. That allows us to get many of the benefits in a very capital-light and quick way. We can have inventory closer to customers. We can get delivery times down. We can get more routes. We can have inbound costs drop. So there\u2019s a lot of benefits that we can get up to a certain scale. And then over time, we\u2019ll probably circle back around the sites and do a little more CapEx to unlock additional lines. So that\u2019s how that will unfold. Right now, we\u2019re trying to make sure that we fill in our footprint and we maximize our capabilities. And importantly, I think make sure that we have the joint capability of reconditioning and auction at these sites. We think that, that unlocks a number of important capabilities for us that we think are pretty exciting and a number of important capabilities for ADESA that we think are exciting for that business as well. As it relates to same-day delivery, it\u2019s still a small fraction of our sites. We\u2019re now up to 35% of the population of the U.S. has access to or in a market where they could get same-day delivery, but there are all kinds of limitations inside our system based on which cars can be same-day delivered, which customer credits can be same-day delivered, et cetera. So it\u2019s still a relatively small fraction. I think Phase 1 is about rolling out the capability across all of our geographies. And then Phase 1 will be \u2013 or sorry, Phase 2 will be diving into that and unlocking more cars and more customers and then ultimately, the more car customer combinations to have more same-day delivery available. So I think we\u2019re very early in unlocking that. That\u2019s obviously a very exciting consumer-facing capability that we think is incredibly hard to replicate, and we think reflects the value of vertical integration as much as any of our other capabilities. So we\u2019re extremely excited about unlocking that over time.\nMark Jenkins: And then Sharon to reiterate the CapEx point, all of the integrations that we\u2019re discussing utilize ADESA land and buildings. So it\u2019s a very limited amount of CapEx that\u2019s required for these integrations. We are using the existing infrastructure and structures at the ADESA sites.\nSharon Zackfia: Perfect, thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: Well, I am going to break my rule and say congrats. It\u2019s outstanding execution. So well done to the team. So other than the reasons that you mentioned, including the employee bonuses and others, is there any other reason why EBITDA margin doesn\u2019t hold or grow from 3Q to 4Q? Because just calculating the contribution from 2Q to 3Q it was looked like over a 60% contribution EBITDA margin. I know that can vary quarter-by-quarter, but just wanted to give you a chance to point anything out because your guidance of above $1.2 million is kind of obvious. Thanks.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. I can hit that one. So I do think there is seasonality in our business and the industry as a whole. I think you\u2019re well aware with some of the dynamics there. But I think some of the fundamental drivers of seasonality are used car demand is typically lowest in Q4. Now we did point to accelerating year-over-year growth. So I think that\u2019s a positive trend. But in general, used car volume seasonality, it\u2019s lowest in Q4 when consumer demand for used cars is lowest. In addition, we typically see the highest depreciation rates in Q4. So that has an impact on both retail and wholesale GPU. So I think there are some seasonal factors. We called out \u2013 or I called out in my prepared remarks, some of the ways that we\u2019re thinking about seasonality this year. I think in retail, 2022 and 2023 were a bit unusual. So at a high level, we\u2019re thinking seasonality that\u2019s more along the lines of what we saw in 2018 through 2021 on average. And then in wholesale gross profit and there in terms of what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing wholesale gross profit dollar seasonality that\u2019s more similar to the average of 2018 to 2023. So really pretty typical wholesale gross profit dollar seasonality. So those are a couple of things that I\u2019d call out. In addition, I think we talked a little bit in the letter and in my prepared remarks, I think there were a couple of things that benefited other GPU in the third quarter. We did sell more loans than we originated. We sized that at approximately $150 other GPU impact in the third quarter. And in addition, we had a pretty rapid rate move in the third quarter where we did receive what we estimated about $100 per unit benefit from rates moving down between the time when we originated loans and when we sold them. And we hedged a lot of that. And so we didn\u2019t get sort of a full benefit from that, but the net benefit that we estimated was about $100. So those are some things to keep in mind. This is a seasonal industry, and so those are some of the seasonal patterns that we\u2019re pointing to in Q4, but then obviously we\u2019re very pleased with the progress and expect a strong Q4.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, Mark. Just as a follow-up on the integration of the ADESA assets into the IRCs, you mentioned in the letter, you\u2019re able to reduce the shipping distances by about 300 miles in the markets versus from before you had the IRC. How much does that save and what other savings would you call out like-for-like in the same market from pre to post-IRC ADESA converted center? Would you highlight just to kind of gauge the pace of your productive capacity going forward?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think those stats were in there to try to give very tangible examples of the benefits of getting inventory pools closer to customers. And I think that that\u2019s one of many, I think like maybe to put some higher level full company stats on it. I think year-over-year our average time to delivery is down about 25%. And we\u2019re simultaneously driving down costs while we do that. That\u2019s done partially by getting cars closer to customers and partially by just running our system materially more efficiently. And I think as we continue to unlock more of these ADESA sites and get cars closer to customers, I think that there\u2019s a lot of room for continued improvement in both time and cost. So I think we\u2019re excited about that. It requires a lot of work. We\u2019ve got to keep turning the wheel, but the foundations are laid and we\u2019ll continue to work hard to unlock it quickly.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, Ernie.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Jeff Lick with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nJeff Lick: Good evening, guys. Congrats on a fantastic quarter.\nErnie Garcia: Thanks, Jeff.\nJeff Lick: I was wondering, as we track the site, we can see that you\u2019ve gone over the 40,000 units on the site. And I was just curious if you could comment as you \u2013 we start to get that marginal customer, maybe beyond say the 30,000 a month \u2013 units per month customer, is there any difference in the behavior of this incremental customer in terms of the offers, the pricing and whatnot that you have to offer them to entice a sale or is it still \u2013 are we still the part of the demand curve where things are similar?\nErnie Garcia: Let me start with this. I think we are beginning to grow inventory a little bit right now, which is driven by our reconditioning teams doing a great job, scaling up their capabilities and doing it in a very cost effective way, which is it\u2019s hard to do both those things at the same time, but they\u2019re doing a great job. So I think we\u2019re extremely excited about that. We remain below our target inventory levels. We would like to be higher, but we think that that\u2019s exciting as well. We\u2019re working hard to get our inventory levels up, so our customers have more selection. And that obviously bodes well for ultimate sales. And then I think as we continually grow to higher and higher scales, I think there will probably always be a little difference in the customers that we\u2019re seeing. But I don\u2019t think we see those differences expressed meaningfully in any demographics. I mean, I think we generally see very similar customers coming to us. And I think we put out a press release a couple weeks back that we\u2019ve now sold 2 million cars and some total. We\u2019ve now bought 2 million plus cars from customers. These are starting to be pretty big numbers. And I think that we are moving away from just kind of like what people may have perceived as early adopters to what is kind of necessarily a big part of the consuming public. And I think as we continue to deliver great customer experiences, we continue to make it more efficient, simpler, faster, with more selection and more customers continue to hear from friends and family that they had a great experience and that this is the new way to buy a car. We think that we\u2019ll be able to continually penetrate deeper into different customer segments. So we think it\u2019s extremely early. This market\u2019s huge. We made the point that we\u2019re 1% market shareholder today. We think that\u2019s extremely unique. It\u2019s unique to be lucky enough to be in an industry of this scale where there\u2019s 40 million used car transactions per year. It\u2019s approximately $1 trillion industry to build a business of the scale that we\u2019ve been able to build over the last 11 years, but still just be at 1%. So we think our headroom is very, very large. We think the fundamentals that enable us to unlock that headroom are very, very clear. Those fundamentals are the growth that is basically customers demonstrating that they have a preference for our customer experiences and I think the financial performance demonstrating that our business model is able to create real separation from the pack. We think that that just means the opportunity is big and we\u2019re excited to go get it as fast as we can, but also as responsibly as we can. And we\u2019ll be \u2013 we\u2019ll work hard to try to manage that balance as best we\u2019re able.\nJeff Lick: And just a quick follow-up on operations per unit was 1730, which was a little sequential uptick from Q2. I was just curious any read into that and how you feel about sequential or year-over-year movements down in any way in that metric?\nMark Jenkins: Sure, I can take that one. So I think operations expense per unit, which is the more variable component of our cost structure, it was down just over $200 year-over-year. And that\u2019s a reflection of all the efficiency initiatives that we\u2019ve taken on. It ticked up as you said, by $30 or so sequentially, quarter-over-quarter, nothing really to call out there, just a number of small items. I think most importantly, we still see opportunity to drive that number down over time. I think the \u2013 all the teams that are focused on that operational metric, they\u2019ve made great gains over the past couple of years, but we all see opportunities to continue to move that down over time.\nJeff Lick: Awesome. Well, congrats, and congrats to the team on the cash bonus as well that\u2019s pretty fantastic.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nChris Bottiglieri: Hey, thank you for taking the questions. It\u2019s been a couple of years since I\u2019ve asked this topic 3P marketplace seems like you\u2019re really turning corner there. So I decided to kind of like two questions related to it. I guess one of the accounting, are the \u2013 is the fee income showing in used revenue in GP or other with the first clinical question? And then second, can you just kind of elaborate, I think you\u2019re probably doing maybe single digits today, penetration of units it sounds like you expected to step up in Q4. Just curious kind of is this expanding with Hertz or other partners? Like are you expanding to other large partners? Or is it a combination of smaller partners? Like what can you tell us about this growing 3P marketplace?\nMark Jenkins: Yes, sure. I can take that one. So the retail marketplace offering is an offering where we sell cars on behalf of commercial sellers on the site. And then I think there\u2019s \u2013 first and foremost, the way we view it is as another acquisition source. It\u2019s very similar to acquiring cars at auction or via another wholesale channel. But there are some revenue recognition differences and in particular, when we have a retail marketplace transaction, we don\u2019t record the gross sales price of the car as revenue. And so I think that\u2019s the most notable thing about that acquisition channel as it does have an impact on revenue because we don\u2019t record the gross sales price. In terms of your other sort of reporting question. The most of the fee revenue to the extent we earn fee revenue from commercial sellers there shows up in retail revenue. There\u2019s a small portion in other, but most of it is in retail revenue. And then I think \u2013 yes, in terms of the scaling of that program, it\u2019s been a relatively small share of sales historically. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve had active for at least three years now, and it\u2019s tended to be a pretty small overall share of sales. We do expect it to increase in Q4 as we called out in the shareholder letter. And I think some of the genesis of that is we are making really great progress, incorporating Carvana reconditioning into ADESA centers. We\u2019re also making really great progress making our inspection and reconditioning centers highly efficient at reconditioning. And I think that has opened up opportunities to make more opportunities available to commercial sellers to have access to both the wholesale platform and a retail platform simultaneously. So I think that\u2019s something that, yes, we expect to grow in Q4. I think some of the gains that come from that and the reason that we\u2019re doing it. We think there\u2019s opportunities for fundamental gains by deepening our connections with commercial sales of cars. We think there\u2019s opportunities to cut a lot of speed or improve speed significantly in the process as well as lower intermediation and other costs associated with auctions and vehicle transport and things like that. So those are some of the mechanics, like I said, it\u2019s historically been a pretty small percentage of total units, but we expect it to increase in Q4.\nChris Bottiglieri: Thanks, Mark. Really helpful.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Michael McGovern with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael McGovern: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. I was just wondering if we could get your thoughts on kind of where inventory selection stands today in your view? And what impact does that have on your marketing strategy or willingness to spend marketing dollars if inventory is where you want it to be or it isn\u2019t. Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So we are starting to grow inventory just a bit. We would like for it to be higher. We think that marketing or inventory growth is you can think of as similar to marketing, and it\u2019s a very efficient channel for marketing because it basically has the effect of making your marketing dollars more efficient by driving additional conversion as customers are more likely to see the car they\u2019re looking for. So we think that, that\u2019s a great place for investment. It\u2019s an investment that requires scaling the entire operational chain. So it\u2019s an investment that takes a little bit of time. But the team has been doing a great job keeping up with our growth in sales. We\u2019ve obviously begun growing sales starting in Q1 of this year and accelerated a bit, and we expect it to accelerate a bit in Q4. But despite that, the recognition team has been able to also get us to a spot, we\u2019re building inventory a little bit right now. So we think that, that\u2019s exciting, and we would like to be carrying a bigger inventory than we are today. We\u2019re working hard to get there fast.\nMichael McGovern: Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Chris Pierce with Needham. Please go ahead.\nChris Pierce: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. On other GPU it\u2019s $29.45 and you call it, $250 in tailwinds this quarter. $2,700, that\u2019s on a regular I guess I just want to get the sense of how to model this line going forward because that would be well above kind of where you kind of guys were multiple years ago. I just want to get a sense of has something changed here? Or what\u2019s happened beside the onetime benefit you guys call out?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. I can take a swing at that one. So I do think \u2013 that\u2019s one of the areas of the business, not unlike the other areas of the business, like retail GPU or the wholesale GPU line items or anything else, where we are constantly working to make fundamental gains. And I think those fundamental gains in the finance platform take the form of just more streamlined customer experiences, better data, better scoring all kinds of \u2013 whether it\u2019s data algorithms, technology for customer experience, all sorts of places to make gains in driving, other GPU, which includes financing and ancillary products. And so I think that\u2019s an area where we\u2019ve made good progress. We\u2019ll continue to look to make progress over time. And do you see opportunities for more fundamental gains over time from here? But that would be my high level commentary on it.\nChris Pierce: Okay, perfect. And then on the marketplace in the past, I believe you guys had other dealers are in the marketplace selling cars as well or listing inventory. Can you remind me, was that a thing that an avenue you went down and is that an avenue you would go down again in the future?\nErnie Garcia: That was an avenue that we went down briefly. That that is not our focus today. Today our focus is on large commercial sellers where we think it\u2019s easier to scale and where it benefits more from the combination of Carvana and ADESA capabilities together and where both Carvana and ADESA can benefit from those relationships. So we think that that\u2019s more efficient, it\u2019s simpler. Every partnership requires some special specific integrations and capabilities. And so the more we can have kind of larger relationships and fewer of them, the more quickly we can move. And then, very importantly, I believe Mark said this earlier, but we are reconditioning the majority of these cars that are flowing through retail marketplace as well. And that\u2019s also different than it was in the past, especially with dealers.\nChris Pierce: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. And my congrats as well. My first question is just on your advertising comment. Planning on increasing advertising in the fourth quarter despite the fact that demand is still exceeding supply? Just help us think through why it\u2019s the right time to lean into advertising despite that fact?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. I think first of all, the business is performing incredibly well. And I think it\u2019s time that we start to get a nice practical understanding of the various levers that we\u2019ve got to drive growth. The investments that we plan to make in advertising are relatively small, especially on a per unit basis. And it\u2019s at a time when traditionally there\u2019s a little bit less demand overall in the fourth quarter. And so we think it\u2019s also a natural time to do it and start to flex that and kind of understand what the sensitivity is, those different channels. We\u2019ve also got some fun and interesting and potentially powerful advertising investments that we\u2019ve made. We\u2019re bringing back Dax and Kristen again this year, which we\u2019re excited about. So we\u2019ll be playing that out and we\u2019ll see how that does. But we think it\u2019s a good time for us to start to understand exactly how powerful those levers are. And we think the fourth quarter is uniquely good time for us to make some of those investments because of the fact that it is traditionally a time when sales slow. And so it\u2019s operationally simpler to understand the power of those levers in a time like this. So we\u2019ll be doing a little testing around the edges. I think we\u2019re optimistic about what we\u2019re going to see. I think there\u2019s no doubt that given where the contribution margins are of incremental sales relative to customer acquisition costs through various customer acquisition channels, whether it\u2019s things like inventory growth that we discussed earlier in marketing, there\u2019s likely meaningful gaps there. And the thing that\u2019s standing between us and unlocking that benefit is just expanding the operational chain and continue to execute. And as we\u2019ve said over and over in this call, I think we\u2019ve got a good plan and we just got to keep marching.\nSeth Basham: That\u2019s helpful color. And then as it relates to inventory sourcing, can you remind us where you are from a self sufficiency standpoint? And it\u2019s one of your key objectives with the retail marketplace to be able to source more vehicles and support growth in the business when it\u2019s getting more difficult to do that by sourcing directly from retail customers?\nErnie Garcia: Yes. So I would say we\u2019re still at a place where the significant, significant majority of our acquisitions are coming from customers, which we think is great. We think that that\u2019s a deep, fundamental capability. It\u2019s very hard to replicate. They just kind of reverses our entire retail capability. And so basically to do that and offer the same customer experience that we do, you\u2019d have to build out everything we\u2019ve built for the retail side of the business. So it\u2019s something that benefits from very large moats. So that\u2019s definitely an area of focus. I think undoubtedly that is probably a relatively stronger channel in times when vehicles are appreciating. It\u2019s probably a relatively weaker channel in times when cars are depreciating. I think the great news on that is, we\u2019ve been in on average depreciating environment for the last year and a half, two years, give or take. And also cars are probably now at a spot where they\u2019re very, very similar kind of vehicle CPI is at a very similar place to other good CPI. So I think it\u2019s less obvious which direction, depreciation will go versus just normal seasonal depreciation from here. But we think it\u2019s important to have access to all the various channels. And then, I think, Mark, you made the point that retail marketplace can be thought of as a substitute for auction purchase. I think that is the right way to think about it. And then I think that he also made the point that the place where we are most focused is benefiting from the joint capabilities of us plus ADESA. I think in much the same way that in years past we talked about the reason that or one of the reasons why we think that we\u2019re a differentiated buyer for consumers is that we\u2019ve got a great retail disposition channel and we\u2019ve got a great wholesale disposition channel and consumers don\u2019t really know if their car is retail or wholesale by our standards. And it\u2019s important that we\u2019re able to put a great bid in front of them regardless. I think in similar ways, I think big commercial sellers have a mix of cars that we will deem wholesale and that we will deem retail. And when we\u2019re able to absorb more of those cars in a very seamless way that minimizes the movement of those cars and the costs associated with getting those cars to a place where they can be disposed of and does it more quickly, we generate fundamental gains that can be split up between us and our partners. And we think that, that\u2019s exciting. And we think that, that\u2019s \u2013 going forward in order to unlock the kind of market share that we want to unlock in the long run, we need to continue to deliver great differentiated customer experiences and drive demand, and we need to continue to have highly differentiated sources of supply so we can get a lot of supply to satisfy that demand. And I think these programs are ways that we\u2019re looking to leverage the advantages inherent in the machine that we\u2019ve built to be even better on the supply side.\nSeth Basham: Thank you very much, Ernie.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good evening. Great quarter. Congratulations.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nBrian Nagel: So I\u2019ve got a couple of questions. First, as we look at the business, it\u2019s clearly re-ramping nicely here. You talked in the prepared comments about the still significantly underutilized capacity you have as far as reconditioning centers. But as the business continues to ramp, are there other expenses from a labor standpoint or elsewhere they\u2019re going to come in to support that growth?\nMark Jenkins: Yes, I can take that. So I think the easiest way to think about labor expenses, there\u2019s some in cost of sales associated with reconditioning. There\u2019s some in that operations expense line item. And then there\u2019s some of that \u2013 our overhead expense line item as well. Those are sort of the big categories. And I think what we\u2019ve seen is even at today\u2019s growth rates, we\u2019re seeing those come down. We continue to make progress in reconditioning and amount of transport costs. We continue to make progress in operational expenses. We had a very small tick up this quarter sequentially. But overall, that\u2019s on a meaningful downward trend. And then our overhead expenses have been very, very steady with very little movement over the past many quarters despite very significant growth. So I think the simple answer there is we\u2019ve actually been improving across some of our labor efficiency metrics while growing. And as I alluded to in a previous answer, we still see opportunities to continue to improve efficiency. Obviously, operational expenses grow in dollar terms, but our goal is to continue to drive them down in per unit [ph] terms.\nBrian Nagel: Thanks, Mark. That\u2019s very helpful. And then I guess the second question I have, just with regard to the kind of the retail GPU, again, it continues to climb nicely. But what are the \u2013 as you look at it, what are the sort of say, the building blocks from here to drive it higher?\nErnie Garcia: I think there are many. But I think the goal of our entire machine in many ways, used car transaction is basically some consumer that has a car somewhere that\u2019s going to trade with some consumer somewhere else. And it\u2019s about building a system that kind of minimizes the cost associated with moving that car from one customer to another reconditioning that car, so it\u2019s ready for the new customer and then providing an experience to a customer that they love that is very efficient. I think that\u2019s like the goal of the entire system. And so I think getting smarter about which cars we bid on at which point in time from which location is important. I think minimizing the costs associated with moving those cars around is important, building out additional reconditioning centers so that we have more efficient access to more consumer and commercial facing cars with lower cost to get them to our reconditioning centers is important, being intelligent about merchandising our cars really well. So we get credit for the interesting features that various cars have is important, being intelligent about pricing different cars differently. So it reflects customers\u2019 understanding and willingness to pay on those various cars is important. I think it can feel like it\u2019s simpler. You\u2019re just buying a car for a price and then you\u2019re selling it for a price, but there are tens of thousands of SKUs and those tens of thousands of SKUs distributed across enormous geography, enormous distance, I think, creates a lot of opportunities to get better. So we\u2019ve got various teams, that touches multiple teams. That touches our fulfillment teams and touches our inventory teams that have very specific projects with ambitious goals that are very credible in our opinion, that suggests that there\u2019s additional room for improvement. But like anything, I think sizing and opportunity is one exercise and then going and collapsing the distance between what you\u2019re doing today and what you want to do tomorrow is another activity. And so we\u2019ve been executing very well for the last seven quarters. And I think it would have been very hard to foresee where retail GPU is today while still giving our customers a great deal. I think it would have been hard to see that from seven quarters ago, but it\u2019s been unlocked by the same sort of projects that we still have in the hopper. And so I think we got to keep executing at that same level, and we think that there\u2019s still opportunity.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. Well, I appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRajat Gupta: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I have a follow-up question on the marketplace economics. You understand the accounting around the revenue reporting. But just curious, is the retail GPU, the other GPU like SG&A per unit? Like how should we think about the different buckets of the economics for a marketplace sale versus the traditional retail sale? I know you mentioned like these are similar to auction source units down, so in the past I think you\u2019ve said those are lower GPUs than consumer source units. So just curious like how those trickle through \u2013 through the different line items and would you be like calling that out going forward? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Yes. Sure. I think \u2013 I think thinking about it as a substitute for auction purchase is probably the best way to think about it. And then it obviously has different accounting. But I think the way that we\u2019re thinking about it is we\u2019re still aiming for the same per vehicle dollar economy across the sum of all transactions as we would have been without this. We think that like fundamentally what is occurring, the operations are the same. Well, let me start with the seller. The seller is the same. The cars are the same. The operations to get the cars between us and the seller are the same. The operations to get cars to customers are the same. They\u2019re merchandising the same way. Everything the customer sees is the same. The difference is the transaction that we wrap around that on a subset of cars. And the reasons that these different structures are interesting is because if we do them in bulk and take advantage of the combination of capabilities we have at these ADESA sites, in particular, as we roll out reconditioning capabilities there, we think that we can move cars more quickly with fewer moves and kind of just in general be more efficient between us and those sellers. And so I think this structure is a structure that is one of many possible structures that you could kind of wrap around those fundamentals. We think various structures don\u2019t really change the underlying economics of the transaction. And so we think that probably the best way to think about it, we\u2019ve put out this long-term financial model. We think the best way to think about is still think about our goals as being the same as they were through long-term financial model. If all units were accounted for as if they were normal core retail units, and then the major change here is for whatever portion of units we have that are marketplace units we will have less revenue because that\u2019s how the accounting kind of works.\nRajat Gupta: Got it. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And just in terms of the impact this has on the standalone ADESA business, is it essentially like using like sourcing from those customers directly or new customers? I know you\u2019ve talked about Hertz in the past. I\u2019m trying to understand what this means for just the ADESA standalone EBITDA. I know it\u2019s like pretty small in context of your overall EBITDA today, but just curious how that interplay would work between the supply base at ADESA, which is what you are using for your marketplace business? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: I think a bit of an abstract, but I think hopefully a helpful conceptual way to think about it. A lot of the cost that exists in the market between commercial sellers and ultimate dealers that are going to sell those to consumers exist because the dealers have a subset of cars that they\u2019re interested in and the sellers want to maximize proceeds across a varied group of cars that they\u2019re trying to sell. The goals of these structures is to make that simpler because we are a scaled retailer and a scaled wholesaler and so we can \u2013 we can kind of fundamentally reduce costs that exist in discovering which car is which because it\u2019s less important to our scaled system. We need to make sure that we get the average right. And then at our locations, we sort them properly. But we need to get the average right, not every individual car right, and that unlocks speed and cost reductions. And so that\u2019s fundamentally what we\u2019re seeking to do with some these new structures.\nRajat Gupta: Got it. It makes complete sense. Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nJohn Healy: Thank you. Ernie, wanted to get your kind of thoughts big picture. Obviously the growth this year has been amazing. The turnaround has been just even more amazing than the growth. But as you look at the growth rate of the business, like what do you want to allow this business to grow? Because I feel like there\u2019s an interplay here obviously with the value you offer the consumer, how you source inventory, how much inventory you have. So, like, as you look at the model is a growth rate like we saw this year. Can you replicate that in another year or two? Or do you look at it in terms of the amount of units you want to add kind of on a year-over-year basis, so I was just really hoping you could help us thinking about how you\u2019re going to govern growth in the business? And then ultimately next year or two, just put your economist hat on and let\u2019s just say interest rates are 100 basis points or lower year-over-year next year. How much does that actually help the business and your performance next year? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. I think those are big questions. I think, importantly we think that we\u2019re very small compared to the scale that we will ultimately be capable of reaching. I think that we would like to get to much bigger scales quickly. We think the entire business gets better. There\u2019s positive feedback, as we\u2019ve discussed at nauseam [ph]. And I think it helps every part of the business and helps customer experiences as well. So it just makes us a better, stronger business. And then I think that the ability of any group of people to do work is limited. You can only focus on so many things. And I think what, this last year has been about has been about kind of exploring different rates of growth, understanding how much focus that requires, and then understanding how much focus is left to make sure that we go take advantage of the big fundamental gains that still exist in the business. And I think that we\u2019re continuing to try to find that balance today because we do think that we\u2019re very small compared to what we can be. And we do think that there are very significant fundamental gains. And then, I think, what we\u2019re seeing right now in many different forms is I think the fundamental gains that we\u2019ve unlocked over the last couple of years. They\u2019re showing up clearly in our financials. You see them in our EBITDA margin and our operating income and net income and everywhere else. But they\u2019re also showing up in terms of the ease with which we\u2019ve been able to scale. And so that makes fundamental gains sort of doubly valuable. Right. They show up in the bottom line and they make it easier to go get more top line. And so I think we\u2019ve got to find balance between those things. We\u2019re a very ambitious group. I think the struggle that we have internally is trying to narrow our focus, trying to keep it at the right level to where we don\u2019t have too many things on our plate and we don\u2019t get as much done as we should. And so I think, we\u2019re trying to find that balance today. That\u2019s inactive discovery as we speak. And then you asked about our economist hat \u2013 we think our economist hats are broken. So we would suggest you go check other people\u2019s. I think rates being lower, all Wisconsin is helpful. I think it\u2019s helpful in kind of a second order way. First order, what matters is our offering relative to the offering of others that we compete with and we both benefit from rates. So I think first order, it\u2019s not really a huge change. Second order, it means that cars are more affordable and that can bring more people into the market. And so we think that\u2019s beneficial, but we wouldn\u2019t call it like a central driver of our performance.\nJohn Healy: Thank you, guys.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Nick Jones with Citizens JMP. Please go ahead.\nNick Jones: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, I\u2019d like to ask a bit more about the growth algorithm, maybe a little bit differently. I mean, the average age of cars on the road is higher. The industry still isn\u2019t quite normalized. Carvana is gaining share, outperforming large competitors. I guess the question becomes if things do start normalizing and potentially at a rapid pace, maybe as rates come down, is the business prepared to kind of handle the volume that could come? And then I guess that\u2019s the first question. And the second question is, you\u2019re going to do some advertising, testing and seeing how you can maybe drive growth further. I guess how much is the business potentially a coiled spring over the next few years to the extent that things normalize and you\u2019ve been able to perform quite well in a tough backdrop? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Love the coiled spring analogy. That carries a lot of deep meaning for a lot of people inside Carvana that we\u2019re here for catapult. But I think that it seems that is likely the case. We certainly hope it\u2019s the case and we\u2019re going to work hard to demonstrate the results that prove out that that\u2019s the case. I think, we\u2019re more efficient than we\u2019ve ever been. That means growth is easier than it\u2019s ever been. I think, the sum of the way the customers are responding to our offering and the quality of our financial performance means that we\u2019ve got a big spread versus the competition. I think that creates one that just suggests that I think very large market shares are attainable and I think it creates a lot of flexibility. We think that there\u2019s significant fundamental gains yet to be had. We feel like we have visibility to better financial performance than we\u2019ve been able to deliver so far. We have this enormous latent opportunity of unlocking additional capacity at these ADESA sites and ramping up reconditioning centers that we already have, that we think the sum of that can get us up to 3 million units per year, which is approximately, eight times our current run rate. So, I mean, I think it\u2019s all very exciting. And what\u2019s missing from that is just that it\u2019s an enormous market. Right. I mean, that eight times our current scale can sound daunting. And then it\u2019s worth remembering that, that would be 7.5% market share, which feels very achievable for a leader in a space. And so I think we\u2019re excited. I think our team is executing unbelievably well. I think our team learned a completely new gear of execution and a new set of tricks and a new level of discipline that we\u2019re going to work hard to maintain. And I think that the results of the last year and a half, two years are a result of us learning those new lessons. And so I think we just got to keep the pedal down and stay focused because the opportunity is big and we\u2019re excited. And I think we don\u2019t want to be too specific in our promises along the way, but I promise you, our eyes are big.\nNick Jones: Thanks, Ernie.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ernie Garcia for any closing remarks.\nErnie Garcia: Great. Well, thanks, everyone. We really appreciate you joining the call Team Carvana. Another just incredible job this is now, the people on this call that are listening to it outside of you are very smart people whose entire job it is, is to figure out how we\u2019re going to perform. And for seven quarters in a row, you\u2019ve outperformed what they could have reasonably expected. And that\u2019s just because you\u2019ve absolutely been crushing it. Thank you so much for all that work. Please be forever proud of it, but never let it go to your head. And let\u2019s keep going because we still got a lot of work to do and a lot of fun to have. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ernie Garcia",
            "content": "Thanks Meg and thanks everyone for joining the call. The third quarter was another exceptional quarter for Carvana. We had record performance in virtually every key financial measure. Our net income in the third quarter was $148 million, our operating income was $337 million and our adjusted EBITDA was $429 million for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.7%. Excitingly, when putting those numbers into broader context in the third quarter we also broke last quarter's record for the most profitable quarter among automotive public retailers ever. And this is being achieved in what most are describing as a challenging environment in the industry. Over the last 11 years and $10 billion, we laid the foundations of a highly differentiated model that delivers highly differentiated customer experiences at scale. Over the last two and a half years, we have learned hard fought lessons that led to rapidly driving operational and financial efficiencies across the business. And over the last nine months, we have paired our highly differentiated customer experiences and highly differentiated financial model to simultaneously become the fastest growing and most profitable automotive retailer. A simple way to think about this is the gap between Carvana and our competitors in growth and financial performance is equal to the gap between Carvana and our competitors in customer experience and business model quality. If you take a moment to reflect on that framework, what does it imply for our ultimate market share? We find our answer to that question to be very exciting, especially because we aren't done digging our moat. We continue to see significant opportunities for further improvement in every part of the business. With the creativity and ambition of our team, we don't expect this to end anytime soon. In addition, we have already invested in and built the most difficult to obtain and expensive infrastructure required to enable scaling, and that infrastructure unlocks efficient growth to a significant multiple of our current size. We currently have built out reconditioning infrastructure to support over 1 million retail units per year. Beyond that, we have enough physical real estate to support over 3 million retail units per year. And our path to unlocking it is being illuminated as we have built and executed our integration playbook at five of the 56 Odessa sites already. Underscoring the value of these investments as well as the efficiency of our operations completing each of these integrations required minimal CapEx and approximately 90 days of lead time. In the past, building reconditioning centers was generally a one to three year process requiring significant CapEx. Continuing this rollout over time will drive positive feedback in our business by reconditioning more cars closer to our customers. This will improve unit economics through more efficient access to large pools of inventory as well as lower inbound and outbound shipping distances and costs, and will provide customer experiences that are even better through greater selection and faster delivery. All of this is happening in the context of an industry with 40 million used vehicle transactions per year. The opportunity is very big and largely untapped. As a 1% market shareholder, the opportunity in front of us is still 99% as large as it was on day one. Accordingly, we are continuing to apply day one intensity to tackling our opportunity. Building Carvana was always going to be hard. Our business is complex, demands many different functional capabilities and is capital intensive. Doing hard and valuable things is the ultimate competitive moat and we have done many hard things over the last 11 years. As a result, we're in a stronger competitive position than we have ever been. From here, the degree of our success will be driven by our ability to maintain our intensity, our ambition and our focus, and will be governed by the quality of our execution. These are all things we are in control of and that's an exciting place to be. We are energized and remain firmly on the path to buying and selling millions of cars, to becoming the largest, most profitable automotive retailer and fulfilling our mission of changing the way people buy and sell cars. The march continues. Mark? Yes, perfect. So I think we're extremely excited about these integrations. They've been going very well. The integration basically means that we unlock reconditioning \u2013 Carvana reconditioning capabilities at ADESA sites. That means that we use our systems and our processes to recondition cars. And that's been going exceptionally well. We've seen gains kind of across the board by making those conversions. And then I think what we're generally doing today is we're doing kind of a lighter CapEx version of it to unlock a portion of the ultimate capacity that can be unlocked at each of those sites. That allows us to get many of the benefits in a very capital-light and quick way. We can have inventory closer to customers. We can get delivery times down. We can get more routes. We can have inbound costs drop. So there's a lot of benefits that we can get up to a certain scale. And then over time, we'll probably circle back around the sites and do a little more CapEx to unlock additional lines. So that's how that will unfold. Right now, we're trying to make sure that we fill in our footprint and we maximize our capabilities. And importantly, I think make sure that we have the joint capability of reconditioning and auction at these sites. We think that, that unlocks a number of important capabilities for us that we think are pretty exciting and a number of important capabilities for ADESA that we think are exciting for that business as well. As it relates to same-day delivery, it's still a small fraction of our sites. We're now up to 35% of the population of the U.S. has access to or in a market where they could get same-day delivery, but there are all kinds of limitations inside our system based on which cars can be same-day delivered, which customer credits can be same-day delivered, et cetera. So it's still a relatively small fraction. I think Phase 1 is about rolling out the capability across all of our geographies. And then Phase 1 will be \u2013 or sorry, Phase 2 will be diving into that and unlocking more cars and more customers and then ultimately, the more car customer combinations to have more same-day delivery available. So I think we're very early in unlocking that. That's obviously a very exciting consumer-facing capability that we think is incredibly hard to replicate, and we think reflects the value of vertical integration as much as any of our other capabilities. So we're extremely excited about unlocking that over time. Sure. So I think those stats were in there to try to give very tangible examples of the benefits of getting inventory pools closer to customers. And I think that that's one of many, I think like maybe to put some higher level full company stats on it. I think year-over-year our average time to delivery is down about 25%. And we're simultaneously driving down costs while we do that. That's done partially by getting cars closer to customers and partially by just running our system materially more efficiently. And I think as we continue to unlock more of these ADESA sites and get cars closer to customers, I think that there's a lot of room for continued improvement in both time and cost. So I think we're excited about that. It requires a lot of work. We've got to keep turning the wheel, but the foundations are laid and we'll continue to work hard to unlock it quickly. Thank you. Thanks, Jeff. Let me start with this. I think we are beginning to grow inventory a little bit right now, which is driven by our reconditioning teams doing a great job, scaling up their capabilities and doing it in a very cost effective way, which is it's hard to do both those things at the same time, but they're doing a great job. So I think we're extremely excited about that. We remain below our target inventory levels. We would like to be higher, but we think that that's exciting as well. We're working hard to get our inventory levels up, so our customers have more selection. And that obviously bodes well for ultimate sales. And then I think as we continually grow to higher and higher scales, I think there will probably always be a little difference in the customers that we're seeing. But I don't think we see those differences expressed meaningfully in any demographics. I mean, I think we generally see very similar customers coming to us. And I think we put out a press release a couple weeks back that we've now sold 2 million cars and some total. We've now bought 2 million plus cars from customers. These are starting to be pretty big numbers. And I think that we are moving away from just kind of like what people may have perceived as early adopters to what is kind of necessarily a big part of the consuming public. And I think as we continue to deliver great customer experiences, we continue to make it more efficient, simpler, faster, with more selection and more customers continue to hear from friends and family that they had a great experience and that this is the new way to buy a car. We think that we'll be able to continually penetrate deeper into different customer segments. So we think it's extremely early. This market's huge. We made the point that we're 1% market shareholder today. We think that's extremely unique. It's unique to be lucky enough to be in an industry of this scale where there's 40 million used car transactions per year. It's approximately $1 trillion industry to build a business of the scale that we've been able to build over the last 11 years, but still just be at 1%. So we think our headroom is very, very large. We think the fundamentals that enable us to unlock that headroom are very, very clear. Those fundamentals are the growth that is basically customers demonstrating that they have a preference for our customer experiences and I think the financial performance demonstrating that our business model is able to create real separation from the pack. We think that that just means the opportunity is big and we're excited to go get it as fast as we can, but also as responsibly as we can. And we'll be \u2013 we'll work hard to try to manage that balance as best we're able. Thank you. Sure. So we are starting to grow inventory just a bit. We would like for it to be higher. We think that marketing or inventory growth is you can think of as similar to marketing, and it's a very efficient channel for marketing because it basically has the effect of making your marketing dollars more efficient by driving additional conversion as customers are more likely to see the car they're looking for. So we think that, that's a great place for investment. It's an investment that requires scaling the entire operational chain. So it's an investment that takes a little bit of time. But the team has been doing a great job keeping up with our growth in sales. We've obviously begun growing sales starting in Q1 of this year and accelerated a bit, and we expect it to accelerate a bit in Q4. But despite that, the recognition team has been able to also get us to a spot, we're building inventory a little bit right now. So we think that, that's exciting, and we would like to be carrying a bigger inventory than we are today. We're working hard to get there fast. Thank you. That was an avenue that we went down briefly. That that is not our focus today. Today our focus is on large commercial sellers where we think it's easier to scale and where it benefits more from the combination of Carvana and ADESA capabilities together and where both Carvana and ADESA can benefit from those relationships. So we think that that's more efficient, it's simpler. Every partnership requires some special specific integrations and capabilities. And so the more we can have kind of larger relationships and fewer of them, the more quickly we can move. And then, very importantly, I believe Mark said this earlier, but we are reconditioning the majority of these cars that are flowing through retail marketplace as well. And that's also different than it was in the past, especially with dealers. Thank you. Sure. I think first of all, the business is performing incredibly well. And I think it's time that we start to get a nice practical understanding of the various levers that we've got to drive growth. The investments that we plan to make in advertising are relatively small, especially on a per unit basis. And it's at a time when traditionally there's a little bit less demand overall in the fourth quarter. And so we think it's also a natural time to do it and start to flex that and kind of understand what the sensitivity is, those different channels. We've also got some fun and interesting and potentially powerful advertising investments that we've made. We're bringing back Dax and Kristen again this year, which we're excited about. So we'll be playing that out and we'll see how that does. But we think it's a good time for us to start to understand exactly how powerful those levers are. And we think the fourth quarter is uniquely good time for us to make some of those investments because of the fact that it is traditionally a time when sales slow. And so it's operationally simpler to understand the power of those levers in a time like this. So we'll be doing a little testing around the edges. I think we're optimistic about what we're going to see. I think there's no doubt that given where the contribution margins are of incremental sales relative to customer acquisition costs through various customer acquisition channels, whether it's things like inventory growth that we discussed earlier in marketing, there's likely meaningful gaps there. And the thing that's standing between us and unlocking that benefit is just expanding the operational chain and continue to execute. And as we've said over and over in this call, I think we've got a good plan and we just got to keep marching. Yes. So I would say we're still at a place where the significant, significant majority of our acquisitions are coming from customers, which we think is great. We think that that's a deep, fundamental capability. It's very hard to replicate. They just kind of reverses our entire retail capability. And so basically to do that and offer the same customer experience that we do, you'd have to build out everything we've built for the retail side of the business. So it's something that benefits from very large moats. So that's definitely an area of focus. I think undoubtedly that is probably a relatively stronger channel in times when vehicles are appreciating. It's probably a relatively weaker channel in times when cars are depreciating. I think the great news on that is, we've been in on average depreciating environment for the last year and a half, two years, give or take. And also cars are probably now at a spot where they're very, very similar kind of vehicle CPI is at a very similar place to other good CPI. So I think it's less obvious which direction, depreciation will go versus just normal seasonal depreciation from here. But we think it's important to have access to all the various channels. And then, I think, Mark, you made the point that retail marketplace can be thought of as a substitute for auction purchase. I think that is the right way to think about it. And then I think that he also made the point that the place where we are most focused is benefiting from the joint capabilities of us plus ADESA. I think in much the same way that in years past we talked about the reason that or one of the reasons why we think that we're a differentiated buyer for consumers is that we've got a great retail disposition channel and we've got a great wholesale disposition channel and consumers don't really know if their car is retail or wholesale by our standards. And it's important that we're able to put a great bid in front of them regardless. I think in similar ways, I think big commercial sellers have a mix of cars that we will deem wholesale and that we will deem retail. And when we're able to absorb more of those cars in a very seamless way that minimizes the movement of those cars and the costs associated with getting those cars to a place where they can be disposed of and does it more quickly, we generate fundamental gains that can be split up between us and our partners. And we think that, that's exciting. And we think that, that's \u2013 going forward in order to unlock the kind of market share that we want to unlock in the long run, we need to continue to deliver great differentiated customer experiences and drive demand, and we need to continue to have highly differentiated sources of supply so we can get a lot of supply to satisfy that demand. And I think these programs are ways that we're looking to leverage the advantages inherent in the machine that we've built to be even better on the supply side. Thank you. Thank you. I think there are many. But I think the goal of our entire machine in many ways, used car transaction is basically some consumer that has a car somewhere that's going to trade with some consumer somewhere else. And it's about building a system that kind of minimizes the cost associated with moving that car from one customer to another reconditioning that car, so it's ready for the new customer and then providing an experience to a customer that they love that is very efficient. I think that's like the goal of the entire system. And so I think getting smarter about which cars we bid on at which point in time from which location is important. I think minimizing the costs associated with moving those cars around is important, building out additional reconditioning centers so that we have more efficient access to more consumer and commercial facing cars with lower cost to get them to our reconditioning centers is important, being intelligent about merchandising our cars really well. So we get credit for the interesting features that various cars have is important, being intelligent about pricing different cars differently. So it reflects customers' understanding and willingness to pay on those various cars is important. I think it can feel like it's simpler. You're just buying a car for a price and then you're selling it for a price, but there are tens of thousands of SKUs and those tens of thousands of SKUs distributed across enormous geography, enormous distance, I think, creates a lot of opportunities to get better. So we've got various teams, that touches multiple teams. That touches our fulfillment teams and touches our inventory teams that have very specific projects with ambitious goals that are very credible in our opinion, that suggests that there's additional room for improvement. But like anything, I think sizing and opportunity is one exercise and then going and collapsing the distance between what you're doing today and what you want to do tomorrow is another activity. And so we've been executing very well for the last seven quarters. And I think it would have been very hard to foresee where retail GPU is today while still giving our customers a great deal. I think it would have been hard to see that from seven quarters ago, but it's been unlocked by the same sort of projects that we still have in the hopper. And so I think we got to keep executing at that same level, and we think that there's still opportunity. Thank you. Yes. Sure. I think \u2013 I think thinking about it as a substitute for auction purchase is probably the best way to think about it. And then it obviously has different accounting. But I think the way that we're thinking about it is we're still aiming for the same per vehicle dollar economy across the sum of all transactions as we would have been without this. We think that like fundamentally what is occurring, the operations are the same. Well, let me start with the seller. The seller is the same. The cars are the same. The operations to get the cars between us and the seller are the same. The operations to get cars to customers are the same. They're merchandising the same way. Everything the customer sees is the same. The difference is the transaction that we wrap around that on a subset of cars. And the reasons that these different structures are interesting is because if we do them in bulk and take advantage of the combination of capabilities we have at these ADESA sites, in particular, as we roll out reconditioning capabilities there, we think that we can move cars more quickly with fewer moves and kind of just in general be more efficient between us and those sellers. And so I think this structure is a structure that is one of many possible structures that you could kind of wrap around those fundamentals. We think various structures don't really change the underlying economics of the transaction. And so we think that probably the best way to think about it, we've put out this long-term financial model. We think the best way to think about is still think about our goals as being the same as they were through long-term financial model. If all units were accounted for as if they were normal core retail units, and then the major change here is for whatever portion of units we have that are marketplace units we will have less revenue because that's how the accounting kind of works. I think a bit of an abstract, but I think hopefully a helpful conceptual way to think about it. A lot of the cost that exists in the market between commercial sellers and ultimate dealers that are going to sell those to consumers exist because the dealers have a subset of cars that they're interested in and the sellers want to maximize proceeds across a varied group of cars that they're trying to sell. The goals of these structures is to make that simpler because we are a scaled retailer and a scaled wholesaler and so we can \u2013 we can kind of fundamentally reduce costs that exist in discovering which car is which because it's less important to our scaled system. We need to make sure that we get the average right. And then at our locations, we sort them properly. But we need to get the average right, not every individual car right, and that unlocks speed and cost reductions. And so that's fundamentally what we're seeking to do with some these new structures. Thank you. Sure. I think those are big questions. I think, importantly we think that we're very small compared to the scale that we will ultimately be capable of reaching. I think that we would like to get to much bigger scales quickly. We think the entire business gets better. There's positive feedback, as we've discussed at nauseam [ph]. And I think it helps every part of the business and helps customer experiences as well. So it just makes us a better, stronger business. And then I think that the ability of any group of people to do work is limited. You can only focus on so many things. And I think what, this last year has been about has been about kind of exploring different rates of growth, understanding how much focus that requires, and then understanding how much focus is left to make sure that we go take advantage of the big fundamental gains that still exist in the business. And I think that we're continuing to try to find that balance today because we do think that we're very small compared to what we can be. And we do think that there are very significant fundamental gains. And then, I think, what we're seeing right now in many different forms is I think the fundamental gains that we've unlocked over the last couple of years. They're showing up clearly in our financials. You see them in our EBITDA margin and our operating income and net income and everywhere else. But they're also showing up in terms of the ease with which we've been able to scale. And so that makes fundamental gains sort of doubly valuable. Right. They show up in the bottom line and they make it easier to go get more top line. And so I think we've got to find balance between those things. We're a very ambitious group. I think the struggle that we have internally is trying to narrow our focus, trying to keep it at the right level to where we don't have too many things on our plate and we don't get as much done as we should. And so I think, we're trying to find that balance today. That's inactive discovery as we speak. And then you asked about our economist hat \u2013 we think our economist hats are broken. So we would suggest you go check other people's. I think rates being lower, all Wisconsin is helpful. I think it's helpful in kind of a second order way. First order, what matters is our offering relative to the offering of others that we compete with and we both benefit from rates. So I think first order, it's not really a huge change. Second order, it means that cars are more affordable and that can bring more people into the market. And so we think that's beneficial, but we wouldn't call it like a central driver of our performance. Thank you. Love the coiled spring analogy. That carries a lot of deep meaning for a lot of people inside Carvana that we're here for catapult. But I think that it seems that is likely the case. We certainly hope it's the case and we're going to work hard to demonstrate the results that prove out that that's the case. I think, we're more efficient than we've ever been. That means growth is easier than it's ever been. I think, the sum of the way the customers are responding to our offering and the quality of our financial performance means that we've got a big spread versus the competition. I think that creates one that just suggests that I think very large market shares are attainable and I think it creates a lot of flexibility. We think that there's significant fundamental gains yet to be had. We feel like we have visibility to better financial performance than we've been able to deliver so far. We have this enormous latent opportunity of unlocking additional capacity at these ADESA sites and ramping up reconditioning centers that we already have, that we think the sum of that can get us up to 3 million units per year, which is approximately, eight times our current run rate. So, I mean, I think it's all very exciting. And what's missing from that is just that it's an enormous market. Right. I mean, that eight times our current scale can sound daunting. And then it's worth remembering that, that would be 7.5% market share, which feels very achievable for a leader in a space. And so I think we're excited. I think our team is executing unbelievably well. I think our team learned a completely new gear of execution and a new set of tricks and a new level of discipline that we're going to work hard to maintain. And I think that the results of the last year and a half, two years are a result of us learning those new lessons. And so I think we just got to keep the pedal down and stay focused because the opportunity is big and we're excited. And I think we don't want to be too specific in our promises along the way, but I promise you, our eyes are big. Thank you. Great. Well, thanks, everyone. We really appreciate you joining the call Team Carvana. Another just incredible job this is now, the people on this call that are listening to it outside of you are very smart people whose entire job it is, is to figure out how we're going to perform. And for seven quarters in a row, you've outperformed what they could have reasonably expected. And that's just because you've absolutely been crushing it. Thank you so much for all that work. Please be forever proud of it, but never let it go to your head. And let's keep going because we still got a lot of work to do and a lot of fun to have. Thanks, everyone."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. The third quarter was an extraordinary quarter for Carvana that was enabled by our team's continued focus on driving operational excellence by identifying further fundamental gains and operating efficiencies while also pursuing growth. For the third consecutive quarter, we earned positive net income and we again set new company records for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, GAAP operating income and GAAP operating margin. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.7% surpassed the midpoint of our long-term financial model EBITDA margin range of 8% to 13.5% and we continue to see meaningful opportunities for fundamental gains to continue driving toward the higher end of that range over time. Moving to our third quarter results, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis. Q3 again demonstrated the strength of our differentiated business model and our ability to achieve both strong unit growth and profitability. The strong demand experienced in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter. Retail units sold totaled 108,651 in Q3, an increase of 34%. Revenue was $3.655 billion, an increase of 32%. Our strong results in the third quarter and expectation of accelerating year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter is being driven by our three long-term growth drivers. One, continuously improving our customer offering. While we continue to focus our people, process and product efforts on driving fundamental gains in unit economics, these efforts are also leading to meaningful improvements in the customer experience through more seamless shopping, transaction and delivery experiences. Two, increasing awareness, understanding and trust. Our growth through the first three quarters of the year has benefited from increasing brand awareness and consumer shifts toward e-commerce on approximately flat advertising spend. In Q4, along with our accelerating growth, we expect to invest between $5 million and $10 million more in advertising compared to Q3 to further raise awareness of our offer. Three, increasing inventory selection and other benefits of scale. Inventory selection and more inventory pools in more locations are two key sources of positive feedback in our business model leading to better selection and faster delivery times. Throughout the year, our inventory teams have been focused on increasing production output to better match demand and we made progress doing so in the third quarter. However, we still remain below our target available website inventory levels and returning to more optimal levels remains a key near term focus. Our strong profitability results in Q3 were again driven by sustained and fundamental improvements across all GPU components and operations expenses as well as levering our overhead expenses. Non-GAAP retail GPU was $3,617, an increase of $740, marking our sixth sequential quarter with a new company record. Strength in retail GPU continues to be driven by fundamental gains and consistent performance across several areas including non-vehicle cost of sales, customer sourcing, inventory turn times and revenues from additional services. Year-over-year changes were also driven by higher spreads between wholesale and retail market prices and lower retail depreciation rates. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect seasonality in retail GPU to be more similar to our average seasonality in 2018 through 2021 than our seasonality in 2022 and 2023, with the latter two years both impacted by unique internal factors. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $1,123, an increase of $172. Year-over-year changes were primarily driven by growth in both wholesale vehicle and wholesale marketplace gross profit. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect seasonality in wholesale gross profit dollars to be similar to our average seasonality in 2018 through 2023. Non-GAAP other GPU was $2,945, an increase of $377. The increase in other GPU was primarily driven by higher spreads between origination, interest rates and benchmark rates, partially offset by the impacts of hedging benchmark rate, interest rate changes and selling a smaller amount of loans relative to originations in Q3 2024 compared to Q3 2023. We estimate that selling a greater volume of loans than we originated generated approximately $150 per unit of incremental other GPU in Q3 and that a decline in benchmark interest rates between loan origination and sale generated approximately $100 per unit of incremental other GPU in Q3. Other things being equal. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $406 million, an increase of 10%. Q3 was another strong quarter for demonstrating the power of our model to lever SG&A expenses. Our 34% growth in retail units sold led to an $832 reduction in non-GAAP SG&A expense per retail units sold. The Carvana operations portion of SG&A expense totaled $1,731 per retail unit sold, a decrease of $220 primarily driven by our operational efficiency initiatives. The overhead portion of SG&A expense totaled $147 million in Q3, an increase of $6 million primarily driven by $4 million of non-recurring benefits in Q3 last year, leading to a reduction of $388 per retail unit sold. 2024 has been an incredible year for Carvana. To say thank you to our team members that helped make this a reality, we have announced a thank you cash bonus to thousands of employees across Carvana that will impact adjusted EBITDA by approximately $10 million in Q4. We continue to see opportunities for significant SG&A expense leverage over time and as we scale driven by both continued improvements in operational expenses as well as leverage in the fixed components of our cost structure. Adjusted EBITDA was $429 million in Q3, an increase of $281 million and a new company record. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.7% in Q3, a 6.4 percentage point increase and a new company record. It is worth noting that our adjusted EBITDA is very high quality compared to many rapidly growing companies due to relatively low non-cash expenses. Our GAAP operating income was $337 million in Q3 leading to GAAP operating margin of 9.2%, leading the public auto retail industry. As previously noted, we are currently carrying many expenses for over one million retail unit sales capacity and expect our GAAP operating income to grow faster than adjusted EBITDA over time. As discussed in prior quarters, we believe that pairing our strong financial results with the measured actions we have taken thus far position us well to continue delevering our balance sheet over time. In the third quarter we repurchased an additional $100 million of our 2028 senior secured notes which when coupled with our adjusted EBITDA generation and our strong liquidity position further improves our leverage ratios. Our results through Q3 position us well for a strong finish to 2024. Looking toward the fourth quarter, we expect the following as long as the environment remains stable. First, a sequential increase in our year-over-year growth rate of retail units sold; and second, adjusted EBITDA significantly above the high end of our previously communicated range of $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion for the full year 2024. Looking forward, as we generate profit, we expect an effective cash tax rate, including income tax and tax receivable agreement payments of approximately 22% in the near-term and approximately 25% in the longer term on Carvana Co.'s income, assuming current U.S. corporate income tax rates. In conclusion, Q3 was an exceptional quarter for Carvana. We remain very excited about progressing in our long-term phase of driving profitable growth and pursuing our goal of becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer and buying and selling millions of cars. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. And then Sharon to reiterate the CapEx point, all of the integrations that we're discussing utilize ADESA land and buildings. So it's a very limited amount of CapEx that's required for these integrations. We are using the existing infrastructure and structures at the ADESA sites. Sure. I can hit that one. So I do think there is seasonality in our business and the industry as a whole. I think you're well aware with some of the dynamics there. But I think some of the fundamental drivers of seasonality are used car demand is typically lowest in Q4. Now we did point to accelerating year-over-year growth. So I think that's a positive trend. But in general, used car volume seasonality, it's lowest in Q4 when consumer demand for used cars is lowest. In addition, we typically see the highest depreciation rates in Q4. So that has an impact on both retail and wholesale GPU. So I think there are some seasonal factors. We called out \u2013 or I called out in my prepared remarks, some of the ways that we're thinking about seasonality this year. I think in retail, 2022 and 2023 were a bit unusual. So at a high level, we're thinking seasonality that's more along the lines of what we saw in 2018 through 2021 on average. And then in wholesale gross profit and there in terms of what we're seeing, we're seeing wholesale gross profit dollar seasonality that's more similar to the average of 2018 to 2023. So really pretty typical wholesale gross profit dollar seasonality. So those are a couple of things that I'd call out. In addition, I think we talked a little bit in the letter and in my prepared remarks, I think there were a couple of things that benefited other GPU in the third quarter. We did sell more loans than we originated. We sized that at approximately $150 other GPU impact in the third quarter. And in addition, we had a pretty rapid rate move in the third quarter where we did receive what we estimated about $100 per unit benefit from rates moving down between the time when we originated loans and when we sold them. And we hedged a lot of that. And so we didn't get sort of a full benefit from that, but the net benefit that we estimated was about $100. So those are some things to keep in mind. This is a seasonal industry, and so those are some of the seasonal patterns that we're pointing to in Q4, but then obviously we're very pleased with the progress and expect a strong Q4. Sure, I can take that one. So I think operations expense per unit, which is the more variable component of our cost structure, it was down just over $200 year-over-year. And that's a reflection of all the efficiency initiatives that we've taken on. It ticked up as you said, by $30 or so sequentially, quarter-over-quarter, nothing really to call out there, just a number of small items. I think most importantly, we still see opportunity to drive that number down over time. I think the \u2013 all the teams that are focused on that operational metric, they've made great gains over the past couple of years, but we all see opportunities to continue to move that down over time. Yes, sure. I can take that one. So the retail marketplace offering is an offering where we sell cars on behalf of commercial sellers on the site. And then I think there's \u2013 first and foremost, the way we view it is as another acquisition source. It's very similar to acquiring cars at auction or via another wholesale channel. But there are some revenue recognition differences and in particular, when we have a retail marketplace transaction, we don't record the gross sales price of the car as revenue. And so I think that's the most notable thing about that acquisition channel as it does have an impact on revenue because we don't record the gross sales price. In terms of your other sort of reporting question. The most of the fee revenue to the extent we earn fee revenue from commercial sellers there shows up in retail revenue. There's a small portion in other, but most of it is in retail revenue. And then I think \u2013 yes, in terms of the scaling of that program, it's been a relatively small share of sales historically. It's something we've had active for at least three years now, and it's tended to be a pretty small overall share of sales. We do expect it to increase in Q4 as we called out in the shareholder letter. And I think some of the genesis of that is we are making really great progress, incorporating Carvana reconditioning into ADESA centers. We're also making really great progress making our inspection and reconditioning centers highly efficient at reconditioning. And I think that has opened up opportunities to make more opportunities available to commercial sellers to have access to both the wholesale platform and a retail platform simultaneously. So I think that's something that, yes, we expect to grow in Q4. I think some of the gains that come from that and the reason that we're doing it. We think there's opportunities for fundamental gains by deepening our connections with commercial sales of cars. We think there's opportunities to cut a lot of speed or improve speed significantly in the process as well as lower intermediation and other costs associated with auctions and vehicle transport and things like that. So those are some of the mechanics, like I said, it's historically been a pretty small percentage of total units, but we expect it to increase in Q4. Sure. I can take a swing at that one. So I do think \u2013 that's one of the areas of the business, not unlike the other areas of the business, like retail GPU or the wholesale GPU line items or anything else, where we are constantly working to make fundamental gains. And I think those fundamental gains in the finance platform take the form of just more streamlined customer experiences, better data, better scoring all kinds of \u2013 whether it's data algorithms, technology for customer experience, all sorts of places to make gains in driving, other GPU, which includes financing and ancillary products. And so I think that's an area where we've made good progress. We'll continue to look to make progress over time. And do you see opportunities for more fundamental gains over time from here? But that would be my high level commentary on it. Yes, I can take that. So I think the easiest way to think about labor expenses, there's some in cost of sales associated with reconditioning. There's some in that operations expense line item. And then there's some of that \u2013 our overhead expense line item as well. Those are sort of the big categories. And I think what we've seen is even at today's growth rates, we're seeing those come down. We continue to make progress in reconditioning and amount of transport costs. We continue to make progress in operational expenses. We had a very small tick up this quarter sequentially. But overall, that's on a meaningful downward trend. And then our overhead expenses have been very, very steady with very little movement over the past many quarters despite very significant growth. So I think the simple answer there is we've actually been improving across some of our labor efficiency metrics while growing. And as I alluded to in a previous answer, we still see opportunities to continue to improve efficiency. Obviously, operational expenses grow in dollar terms, but our goal is to continue to drive them down in per unit [ph] terms."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Meg Kehan, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMeg Kehan: Thank you, Brenda. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us on Carvana's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Please note that this call will be simultaneously webcast on the Investor Relations section of the company's corporate website at investors.carvana.com. The second quarter Shareholder Letter is also posted on the IR website. Additionally, we posted a set of supplemental financial tables for Q2, which can be found on the Events and Presentations page of our IR website. Joining me on the call today are Ernie Garcia, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Jenkins, Chief Financial Officer. Before we start, I would like to remind you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, Carvana's market opportunities and future financial results that involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed here. A detailed discussion of the material factors that cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements can be found in the Risk Factors section of Carvana's most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements and risks in this conference call are based on current expectations as of today, and Carvana assumes no obligation to update or revise them whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Our commentary today will include non-GAAP financial metrics. Unless otherwise specified, all references to GPU and SG&A will be to non-GAAP metrics, and all references to EBITDA will be to adjusted EBITDA. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics for our reported results can be found in our Shareholder Letter issued today, a copy of which can be found on our IR website. And with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie?\nErnie Garcia: Thanks, Meg, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. The second quarter was another landmark quarter for Carvana. In the first quarter of this year, we were both the fastest-growing and most profitable public automotive retailer for the first time. In the second quarter, we did it again. And this time, we extended our separation in each category. Historically, when those two things are true at the same time, it bodes very well for an extremely successful future. We have every intention of working hard to validate that pattern. And in this case, a promising pattern is paired with tremendous room to run. We are a company with just a 1% market share in a $1 trillion industry with highly fragmented competition and barriers to entry that have recently been proven to be extremely hard to overcome. Our position is unique. And it is important to remember why. We are in this position today because 10 years and $10 billion ago, we set out to build an entirely new way to buy and sell cars. We thought through everything from scratch, starting with what our customers wanted, and then pairing that with what we believe was possible with new technology and new operations. We also discarded what others told us was impossible and all the reasons they provided us. We were stubborn and ambitious. I'm grateful for both. And I'm also grateful that we had no idea how hard it would be to get to this point. Being right about outcome and wrong about the path may be the most productive combination there is. From here, we believe the outcome is clear and exciting. And we are weather-worn enough to know the path will be harder than we think, but we are still ambitious and stubborn enough to keep pushing and to never accept anything is good enough. We are a team of fighters, and we're going to keep fighting on the good days and on the hard days just as we have in the past. As a result, our visibility into additional scale and further improvements in unit economics is also very clear. We are currently carrying the physical capacity and associated fixed expense of being built for approximately three times our current volume. In addition, through our ADESA acquisition, we have the real estate to handle vehicle reconditioning at a scale approximately eight times our current run rate. Importantly, we also have very clear plans and high confidence in achieving further fundamental gains across each area of variable costs and gross profit. In the last year, we improved in these areas to the tune of approximately $2,000 per unit. Given that we improved that much that fast, it is obvious that significant gains remain. Our team is using the same operational processes we have for the last two years and is currently working on a very clear set of well-defined specific enhancements to each part of our offering that we believe have potential to materially impact the customer offering and the business as a whole. We will work hard to unlock them as quickly as we can, and we will do the same each year thereafter. As we unlock these gains over time, we anticipate passing more and more of the value we create back to our customers, further differentiating our offering and driving additional growth. The combined benefits of constantly improving customer experiences, incremental sales with our strong unit economics, additional fundamental gains, and the leverage that comes with filling in our footprint paint a clear picture of the company we aim to become, a company that is the largest and most profitable automotive retailer, and a company that achieves its mission of changing the way people buy and sell cars. Now we have to keep our heads down and keep doing the hard work that will turn this picture into reality. We are up to the challenge. The march continues. Mark.\nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. The second quarter was an exceptional quarter for Carvana and reinforce the significant and sustainable progress we have made and continue to make in our current multiyear phase of driving profitable growth. For the second consecutive quarter, we generated positive net income and we set new company records for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and GAAP operating income. For the first time, quarterly adjusted EBITDA margin approached the midpoint of our long-term financial model EBITDA margin range of 8% to 13.5%, and we see meaningful opportunities for fundamental gains to drive towards the higher end of that range over time. Moving to our second quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis. Q2 again demonstrated the strength of our differentiated business model. Retail units sold increased 33% despite continued focus on unit economics and profitability initiatives as the strong demand we experienced in Q1 continued into Q2. Revenue increased by 15%. Revenue grew less than retail units, primarily due to industry-wide declines in retail and wholesale vehicle average selling prices. In Q2, our operational teams focused on increasing production capacity to increase selection to more optimal levels for our customers. The teams met their production targets in the quarter, but we still remain below our target available website inventory due to continued strong demand. In the near term, we will continue to increase production across the country. Our strong profitability results in Q2 were driven by meaningful fundamental improvements in GPU and SG&A expenses. In the second quarter, non-GAAP total GPU was $7,344, an increase of $314 and a new company record. Non-GAAP retail GPU was $3,539, an increase of $677 and a new company record. Our strength in retail GPU continues to be driven by fundamental gains and consistent performance in several areas, including uveal cost of sales, customer sourcing, inventory turn times and revenues from additional sources. Year-over-year changes were also driven by higher spreads between wholesale and retail market prices, partially offset by higher retail depreciation rates and a lower retail inventory allowance adjustment. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $1,104, a decrease of $124. Year-over-year changes were primarily driven by growth in both wholesale vehicle and wholesale marketplace gross profit, offset by growth in retail units sold. Non-GAAP other GPU was $2,701, a decrease of $239. Year-over-year changes in other GPU were primarily driven by holding and selling a greater volume of loans relative to originations in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2024, which increased Q2 2023 other GPU by approximately $650, partially offset by the continued impact of credit storing improvements, pricing optimizations and credit tightening begun in Q4 2023. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $390 million, an increase of 2%. Q2 was an exceptional quarter for demonstrating the power of our model to leverage SG&A expenses. Retail units sold increased by 33%, leading to an $1,160 reduction in SG&A expense per retail units sold. Sequentially, SG&A expense per retail units sold declined $400, of which $150 was driven by continued improvement in Carvana operations expense, demonstrating that we continue to drive operating cost efficiencies while growing. We continue to see opportunities for significant SG&A expense leverage over time and as we scale, driven by both continued improvement in operational expenses as well as leverage in the fixed component of our cost structure. Adjusted EBITDA was $355 million in Q2, an increase of $200 million and a new company record. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.4% in Q2, a 5.2 percentage point increase and a new company record. It is worth noting that our adjusted EBITDA is very high quality compared to many rapidly growing companies due to our relatively low noncash expenses. Our GAAP operating income was $259 million in Q2, leading to GAAP operating margin of 7.6%, leading the public auto retail industry. As previously noted, we are currently carrying capacity for approximately 3x retail unit sales and expect our GAAP operating income to grow faster than adjusted EBITDA over time. Our results in Q1 and Q2 position us well for a strong Q3 and Q4. Looking forward, we expect the following as long as the environment remains stable. First, a sequential increase in retail units sold in Q3 compared to Q2. And second, adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion to $1.2 billion for the full year 2024, an increase from $339 million last year. We are pairing our continued strong financial results with a disciplined financial policy that positions us well to thoughtfully delever over time. This includes, first, in May, we announced our intention to pay cash interest on our 2028 and 2030 senior secured notes beginning in 2025 to reduce long-term cash interest expense. Second, we repurchased $250 million of our 2028 senior secured notes in Q2 and, over the same time period, raised $350 million of equity capital. Third, we intend to further delever over time, with our primary focus on adjusted EBITDA growth, which both generates cash and reduces leverage ratios. In conclusion, Q2 was an exceptional quarter for Carvana. We're excited about progressing in our long-term phase of driving profitable growth and pursuing our goal of becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer and buying and selling millions of cars. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Chris Pierce from Needham. Please go ahead.\nErnie Garcia: Chris, you there?\nOperator: Sorry. The next question comes from Michael Montani from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMichael Montani: Hi. Congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask if I could. Can you discuss a little bit the trends that you're seeing for the 100K plus income consumer versus those who are below? And then also, Ernie, can you give us some insight into thoughts around credit tightening from here? Or do you feel like you're at an appropriate level now?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. I think from a demographics perspective, I think, clearly, affordability was impacted pretty heavily over the last couple of years. I think there's good news there, though. We have seen kind of higher levels of depreciation over the last 1.5 years. I think relative to CPI, car prices are now only probably about 3% higher than they were pre-pandemic. So I think we've closed a lot of that gap. Rates are obviously higher. So if you look at payments, payments are still about 10% higher than they were pre-pandemic for a similar car. So there's probably a little bit of room for that to continue to improve. And that, of course, is impacting the lower end of the demographic spectrum probably more than the higher income end. But I don't think there's anything too notable to call out there. I think we're just focused on continuing to buy the cars that our customers are demanding on our site, getting those up, getting those reconditioned, delivering them to customers and giving them great experiences. And I think that's what's driving our success right now without too much focus on one group or another. From a credit perspective, I think credit clearly was kind of slowly moving back toward pre-pandemic normal after being very good in '20 and '21, and then probably crossover was a little bit worse in '22 and parts of '23. And I think many lenders ourselves included, started to tighten credit in the fourth quarter of '23. What we've seen so far from that is performance that's definitely in line with what we would have hoped to see. So I think at this time, it doesn't feel like there are other moves that would be super material. But obviously, we're paying attention and we may adjust that over time.\nMichael Montani: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, Ernie, I never say congratulations on a quarterly call. And believe me, you don't want me to. But I mean...\nErnie Garcia: I think we do want you to actually if we...\nAdam Jonas: No. Believe me, you don't. Wow, dude. It's a hard wow. All right. So Carvana grew retail units 33%, with mostly flat SG&A, right?\nErnie Garcia: Correct.\nAdam Jonas: CarMax units fell 3% and had SG&A rise 13% year-on-year. Again, I don't want schadenfreude aside, what's the forward view on SG&A dollars on a per unit basis or either gross dollars or per unit, like how much longer can Carvana [technical difficulty] while keeping SG&A flat? Because the facts that you're mentioning, the capacity that you're burdened with, it might give the impression that you can keep SG&A really relatively unchanged to the dollar amount, but I don't think you want us to actually believe that. Or do you? That's my first question.\nErnie Garcia: We've broken down SG&A in the past into three categories: overhead, marketing and operations expense. And I think it's probably useful to hit them all separately. On overhead, we've held that pretty flat for the last five or six quarters. And I think that that's largely our plan for the immediate future, is to continue to hold that flat. On marketing expense, we've moved down from a kind of long-term average just over $1,000 to 542 this quarter. That's something that we're extremely excited about, obviously, and that reflects a lot of gains across, I think, many different parts of the system. I think from a long-term fundamental perspective, I think debatably the most exciting part of that is what's going on with operations expense. We, this quarter, we're at $1,696 that's a number that we're extremely excited about. It's a number that's several hundred dollars less than our kind of pre-pandemic numbers that were pretty good at the time. But that's happened at a time when the average of other automotive retailers have probably seen their SG&A go up by about $1,000 with inflation and everything else. So I think the gains look like a couple of hundred dollars there, but I think inflation-adjusted and, most importantly, I think, relative to what else is out there, I think those gains are likely over $1,000. And then further, I think that inside of that operation expense, there's a warranty line item that today is around 350 and was kind of closer to 150 to 200 pre-pandemic when inflation rates were quite a bit lower. And so I think when you look at kind of the operations expense ex warranty, the gains versus pre-pandemic are more like $400 per unit, again, at a time when costs across the industry have gone up very significantly. So we're really excited about that because that's a deep fundamental - I think the deep fundamentals are basically how does your customer experience stack up relative to what's available elsewhere. And I think the most objective measure of that is the growth that you see at any point in time, especially relative to your offering at a time like this when we've got inventory flat and marketing dollars flat. I think that it's clear that customers are responding very well to our offering. I think number two is how are you able to monetize the transaction, and I think through our vertical integration and building everything that we've built from scratch to serve an e-commerce experience, I think that we're faring very well there. And then the third is, what are your variable expenses? And just kind of walk through that, but I think that that's a number that we're extremely excited about. And we think relative to what else is out there, we've made a lot of gains. So overall, we're excited. We use this term fundamental gains. We said we made about $2,000 of fundamental gains over the last year. Largely what we mean by that is either gains that we believe are sustainable in gross profit or variable expenses per unit, which would be in that operation expense. We think there are still significant gains left to be had. We're working hard at going in unlocking them. But we think the business model is not done being fully flexed. And I think we're excited about going and attacking that and also what that means for the future.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, Ernie. Just a follow-up. If I take the midpoint of your guide, that would imply the second half quarterly run rate EBITDA of maybe $100 million, I'm rounding here, Ernie, bear with me, about $100 million less than what you did, kind of a mid-200 number rather than a 355 number. So what would you say is kind of baked in there, including seasonality and then other stuff beyond seasonality that might have maybe made the 355 a little on -- and again, maybe I'm stupid for using the midpoint of your guide, and you're being very conservative. But just if it was a genuine guide, what's embedded and why is $100 million lower run rate? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Yes, sir. So I think first and most importantly, we see gains in front of us, in growth and in the various fundamental areas we just discussed, and we're going to go out and try to get them. And I think that that's going to be something that we're going to continually do over the next several years. So I think that's probably the most important thing. I think as it relates to the guide, I think you're bringing up all the appropriate points and doing all the math correctly. We did sell a little bit more in loan production this quarter than we originated. So we provided a bridge in the Shareholder Letter that that was probably about 0.4%. So probably a more normalized number would have been about 10%, in dollars that would have been about $12 million give or take. So that positively impacted the quarter. And then there is seasonality heading into the back half of the year. But obviously, we're extremely excited with the results we just had. We're extremely excited about the outlook for the rest of this year. And I think most importantly, we're just extremely excited about the opportunity that we've got, because I think part of the goal of building out this dream is to take something that was very nonobvious and slowly but surely turn into something that's obvious. And we think this quarter is probably the biggest discontinuous step in making what we're trying to achieve, obviously, we've ever taken. So we're very excited about it.\nAdam Jonas: Thanks, Ernie. It's impressive.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Pierce is with Needham. Please go ahead.\nChris Pierce: Hi. Can you guys hear me this time?\nErnie Garcia: We can.\nChris Pierce: All right. Perfect. I just wanted to kind of - can you talk about where the upper bound of retail GPU might be? And can you kind of touch-base on the standalone reconditioning? I guess, CarMax was just mentioned the previous question. We were kind of told that $2,200 in retail GPU was the efficient frontier as far as units. But that was in a, hey, the conditioning centers in the store type of model. So like what's the right way to think about where retail GP can go? And how excited are you as far as pushing retail GPU even higher from here?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, so first, I would say we believe there are significant fundamental gains to be had in every GPU line item, retail GPU included. And so we think that we can deliver to customers the same quality of offering and cause retail GPU to go up. I think it's important to reevaluate what GPU might mean in this environment versus pre-pandemic. And I think a lot of heuristics over time have been established pre-pandemic that maybe warrant some revisiting now. And so for perspective on that, I spoke in the last question about how most dealers have seen SG&A per unit go up by about $1,000. I think the right kind of first order mental model for how the automotive industry works is that, generally speaking, it's cost plus. Many dealers share a cost structure and they kind of -- they're at auction, holding up their hand to buy a car at a certain price, and they're pricing it with a profit in mind, and many are acting in similar ways. So if you look at the average retail GPU across many automotive retailers now versus pre-pandemic, it's also up around $1,000, as like a good first order estimate. And so I think debatably, kind of all the heuristics from before, you could kind of move up by $1,000. And I think that that's also buttressed by just looking at wholesale retail spreads today, which is basically kind of you're just looking at the aggregate market that is impacted by the sum of dealers. It probably is supporting about $1,000 more in retail GPU than it was pre-pandemic. So I think all the heuristics -- first order, I think you kind of moved them by roughly $1,000. And I think that's helpful in explaining the significant changes that you've seen from us. Now I think a lot of the gains that we've made have been fundamental, they've been in every part of the business - every part of the kind of business of acquiring cars and getting cars to our inspection centers and doing that inexpensively and reconditioning them as efficiently as we possibly can. And we believe we have gains in all those same areas. So all the same teams are largely they've got new projects, but they're all pointing at the same areas and they're all running in the same directions to continue making gains from here. So we do think it can go up. We also think that as we kind of stated in the Shareholder Letter and in prepared remarks, we think that we're likely now getting to a place where it's more likely than not that it will make more sense to pass additional gains back to customers, or more of the additional gains that we make from here back to customers. And we're excited about what that means as well, because we've got a business model now that is capable of turning out quite a bit of cash and also responds very well to scale. So we're going to keep trying to make those gains. We'll try to invest them intelligently. But I think overall, we're pretty excited. We think there's room everywhere.\nChris Pierce: Okay. And then on adding production, Mark's comments. Should we think about that as adding a second shift in facilities? Or based on kind of what you talked about in Rocklin, you have production capacity that can increase as you increase the vehicles flowing through the one shift that you have now? Or like what's the right way to think about what could happen to the IRC staffing?\nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes. I think there -- I think we have a lot of flexibility to increase production. I think that takes three primary forms. So first, adding -- continue to add lines in existing Carvana facilities that have excess capacity to add lines. I would say it's category number one, and we definitely have capacity to continue to do that. Category number two would be more what you suggested, which is also a slightly different form of adding lines, which is adding shifts to IRCs where all the production lines during the day shift are full, you can add a second shift to increase production capacity. And then the third that I would layer in is increasing production at ADESA locations. So we've had a lot of success adding Carvana reconditioning software and processes, in two locations so far, in Buffalo and Portland. We plan to integrate Carvana auto production into a third location in Kansas City that we call the Megasite, which is a site where we are continuing to serve very effectively physical auction customers at the site, while also implementing Carvana reconditioning processes and systems. And so integrating more ADESA sites with the ongoing physical auction services, combined with Carvana reconditioning, is the third avenue for production growth that we're excited about. So all of those together give us a lot of flexibility. I think one of the things we're excited about in this next phase of growth is we do have more flexibility than we've ever had before for growing production efficiently, at the right cost, at the right level of quality over time.\nChris Pierce: Okay. Thank you, both.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Nagel do from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nagel: Hi. Good afternoon. I want to add my congratulations. Nice quarter here.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nBrian Nagel: So the question I have, just to understand better, I guess my first question, maybe to understand better the demand dynamic and the sales trajectory for Carvana. You've talked about still, I guess, a lack of a reconditioned -- a limited supply of reconditioned cars holding back sales. So the question I have, as you look at the business, I mean - how much is that number? If your reconditioning were operating where you wanted to, what would sales be running at?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think we talked last quarter about kind of moving into this transition to growth. And I think that that's where we remain. I think in the first quarter we sold more cars than we anticipated. That caused our inventory to be a little lighter than we expected. We turned up our production plans, and the operating teams did a great job, and we're able to achieve that. That enabled us to sell more cars than we expected again in the second quarter. But we did build our inventory much less than we would have liked to. So I think we're continuing to lean in that direction. We haven't invested in marketing yet. There's -- our marketing expense relative to our gross profits leaves a lot of room. And so I think we kind of put this outline in the Shareholder Letter of the things that we believe have driven our growth since the beginning, which we think have been consistent but have just shown up in kind of different weights across time. And that's continuously improving customer experience, that's highly differentiated, increasing awareness, understanding and trust. I think those are three different steps to brand, but every step matters there. And then increasing inventory selection and other scale benefits. And I think that so far, we've kind of gotten to a place where we've gone from negative effects in the second and third area over the last couple of years as we were shrinking inventory and as we were investing less in marketing and as we were getting beat up a little bit in the press, to more like still wins, but those still wins still have enabled pretty exciting levels of growth. So I think this transition period is about figuring out where exactly that healthy balance of growth is where we can grow significantly and get all the clear benefits that come with that, but also continue to make fundamental gains because we do still believe there are significant fundamental gains to be had. And we've been saying that for the last year, and I think the way the team's executed has really proven that to be extremely true. And so I think we're still feeling that out as we go. But I think if we take a step a little further back, I just think the position that we're in relative to this industry is very, very exciting, right? We've gone from a company that grew at 85% compounded for the five years prior to 2021, we grew very, very fast, to a company that went through a difficult time, and during that difficult time found a way to get a lot more efficient and, frankly, to serve our customers better and to just be a better business. And I think now we're in a position where we're starting to kind of turn the engines back on and we're moving in that direction. We're a 1% market shareholder. We see a lot of room to run. And the most important thing is that we make good decisions, we prioritize, we stay focused and we just keep marching because there's a big prize in front of us. And so we're going to go out and try to be as intelligent as we can be as we go tackle it.\nBrian Nagel: That's very helpful. My follow-up question, just with respect to ADESA, I mean one of the questions we get a lot is you talk to clients about carbon, just how should we think about the timing of the conversion or the, I guess, reconfigurations, if you will, some of these ADESA facilities to be reconditioning type centers for you?\nErnie Garcia: So I think that that's also something that we're figuring out in this transition period. I think Mark spoke about our next site in Kansas City, which is going to be a site where we're calling it a Megasite. It's going to have all the capabilities at once. We've done it very efficiently so far with almost no CapEx. I think the more of these sites that we choose to open, there are many more that we could integrate and not have a huge CapEx investment. But I think the more of them that we choose to open, the more that that will lean a little bit in the direction of CapEx. But a lot of other offsetting benefits. You get access to a lot more inventory pools, you get closer to your customers, your inbound transport costs are less, your outbound transport costs are less, your transport times are faster, which leads to higher conversion. And so, I think we're trying to find the balance right now between adding inventory pools and logistics capabilities to those sites and being really efficient. And so far, that's led to of adding reconditioning capabilities in Buffalo and Portland and Kansas City. I think over time, we will certainly do more. And I think the speed at which we do that is something that we're figuring out as we go right now.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. Right. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Baker from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Thanks. Two questions. One, you talked about giving back to customers, giving some of the profit back to customers. That show up in sharper pricing, more choice, faster speed of service, all of the above? And then second question, do you think you gained any share this quarter from the - from some of your competitors being impacted by CDK global cyberattack? And if so, how much? And does that mean share gain would be a little bit less going forward? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. I think that - so I think - we provided in the bridge and we put in the Shareholder Letter, it gives you a walk from kind of where we are to where we expect leverage to be and how we're doing from a marketing perspective in some of our more mature markets. And I think that gives a pretty clear walk, to the very high end of our long-term financial model from an EBITDA perspective without the need for fundamental gains. And then we do believe there are very significant fundamental gains to be had. And I think the areas where we could invest them were all of the areas that you suggested, and a couple more. And I think as we move forward, we will try to do that as intelligently as we can. I'm not sure we want to tip our hat too much on that, because I think we've got some creative ideas. And I think there's also some lessons that we've got to learn between here and there as we start to give that back to see where it's most efficient. But we - as long as we execute, we anticipate having gains to give back. And then, we'll try to do that very intelligently. As it relates to CDK, I think there's no question that that was an impact the industry broadly. I think there were significant impacts on many automotive retailers. The impact to us, I think our best guess at that is that it was pretty muted. We didn't see huge impacts either when it started, when it was ongoing or as it was alleviated. Maybe there were a little directional things that you could have picked out, but nothing that I think warrants mentioned. So I'm not sure there was a huge impact there.\nMichael Baker: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the color.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nSharon Zackfia: Hi, good afternoon.\nErnie Garcia: Hi Sharon.\nSharon Zackfia: I think, hi, I think one of the underlying questions as you're kind of balancing profitability with growth, is just kind of how much unmet demand you're leaving on the table. So when we think about kind of inventory and being under-inventoried, obviously, when you're selling non-commodity items, that's constraining sales, right? So I'd assume conversion is a bit below, where you would like it to be. It sounds like there's going to be investments in things like recon. And at some point, I expect marketing to kick up again. Can you talk about kind of where underlying demand is relative to your sales? And it does feel like you are in growth mode now, just given the sales metrics that you're putting up, what kind of testing and iteration are you doing to think about things like turning back on marketing to a greater extent?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think - I'm not sure my answer is going to be as satisfying as you would like. I think all of your observations are correct. I think we're in this transition period and I think we're moving in that direction. As discussed, we're trying to balance growth and its benefits with the benefits of being able to keep things a little more stable and continue to make gains. I think there's no question that we are very, very small compared to what we want to be, at any point in time, measuring the exact amount of latent demand is complicated because I think you even have to frame what that means kind of carefully. If you believe you have a business model with positive feedback, then as you unlock more demand, kind of that more demand showing up leads to things like faster delivery time and broader selection and unlocks more demand again. So I think our eyes are on selling millions of cars and being the largest, most profitable automotive retailer, and doing it as quickly and intelligently as we possibly can. We think things look very, very good right now, and it's very, very exciting. But we always remain aware that there's always bumps along the way as well. And so, I don't know. Things feel very good. They feel very good, and I think we just got to keep moving forward, and we'll see where it takes us.\nSharon Zackfia: You're right, Ernie, it was unsatisfying as an answer. So I will ask something maybe...\nErnie Garcia: Nice that you call me out on that.\nSharon Zackfia: Maybe for Mark instead. Seasonality was mentioned earlier, and I just want to level set kind of GPU expectations. I mean typically, we would expect lower sequential GPU in the third quarter. Is that in keeping with what you're thinking? Thanks.\nMark Jenkins: So on the question about seasonality, I think where we typically think of seasonality as being most prominent is really in the fourth quarter, first and foremost, and then maybe to an extent in the early first quarter as well. I think the form that that seasonality takes is typically softer overall used car market demand as well as higher depreciation rates. And so that's industry seasonality that we see year-after-year. And I think where we see that most acutely is in the fourth quarter. and sort of the early part of the first quarter.\nSharon Zackfia: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Basham: Thanks a lot and good afternoon. My question is around other GPU. If you could give us some sense of where you are today but also where do you think it could be in a couple of years, and the key drivers to get there, that would be helpful.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. I can take that one. So I do think we've had a strong quarter -- we've had a strong first half on other GPU. I think there are many drivers of that, including all the work that the teams do internally to optimize our platform, scoring, pricing, monetization, as well as we've -- I think, over time, had some nice gains in the ancillary products part of that as well. I think as we look forward for opportunities, we do see opportunities to make fundamental gains in other GPU. I think some of the areas where we see opportunities are really the areas that I just listed. So we're always seeking to take in more data and improve our scoring and pricing algorithms. We're always seeking to prove and streamline the customer experience, to make using Carvana financing as easy as possible. We're always working to develop the most efficient funding sources for our loans. We're always looking to continue to improve attach rates on our ancillary products. And so, those are areas where we've made gains historically, but absolutely areas where the teams are focused on continuing to make fundamental gains over time.\nSeth Basham: That's helpful. Direction from here, could we see a step back, because of some of the timing elements associated with the strength you recently experienced, before you get to this much higher level that you expect in a couple of years?\nMark Jenkins: The callout that we had on Q2, I think Ernie mentioned as well, we saw about a $12 million favorable impact just due to timing effect - loan sale timing effects that rounded up to 0.4% of revenue. So that would be the primary thing that I would call out as it relates to Q2.\nSeth Basham: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nick Jones from Citizens JMP. Please go ahead.\nNicholas Jones: Thanks for taking the questions. You've delivered a lot of efficiency gains over the last year. You're still talking a lot about a bunch more to be made as you try to deliver a much larger number of units than you're doing today. How are you balancing kind of this relentless focus on efficiency gains given the progress you've made versus, I guess, potentially new revenue opportunities that it sounds like you maybe had ambitions if we go back to the Analyst Day years ago? As Carvana gets bigger, delivers this kind of new consumer experience that's differentiated, are consumers going to kind of increasingly look to Carvana for additional services or solutions? And is that a factor to unlock kind of the volume you aim to get long term? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I mean I think one of the lessons that we learned over the last couple of years is that focus is very valuable. And I think one of the things we learned about ourselves, I think we've assembled a team that is very ambitious and seeks to take on a lot of things. And I think that one of the battles that we constantly face internally, I think, is trying to make sure that we tackle the right number of things and we prioritize them properly. I think given the creativity that we have inside of the walls of Carvana, I think we're never short ideas. That's never the case. And I think just trying to make sure that we're focusing on the right things in the right order to make the most progress that we can as quickly as possible is what we focus on. I think that that extends to efficiencies, growth and other opportunities where we believe they are exciting areas, all three of those are very exciting areas. So, I think we're trying to be as smart as we can there. Half of saying this out loud is a reminder to ourselves to try to stay focused, because I think we remain in a place where there are more opportunities than we should intelligently take on, and we're trying to be as thoughtful as we can about which we take on and how.\nNicholas Jones: And maybe a follow-up, thanks for that. And I guess on CarMax, has come up a couple of times on the call, I think historically, competitors have maybe not been believers in Carvana's capabilities, do you say there might be a different urgency and a competitive reaction given your kind of recent sustainable results? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I mean I'll respond to that maybe just generally. I mean I think the view that we've always had and we've tried to continually share is that, as it relates to ourselves, we try to not be too focused on competition. We try to be focused on our customers. I think it gets very easy for companies to follow each other in circles and believe that what the other company is doing is smart. And then just kind of continually chase each other instead of listening to their customers. So what we try to do is listen to our customers. That's our continual goal, and we will continue to do that. I think that there's no question that whenever results are being put up that are high quality, people are going to take notice. And I think that will be true of probably many in the industry. And that's fine. I think we never expected to be alone or be handed anything. We expected to come out here and compete for it and try to build something differentiated for our customers. And I think that's what we intend to continue to do. I think something that - putting on our very biased Carvana hats, something that we're just extremely excited about is we think that the things that we've built are really differentiated and take a long time and a lot of effort and are associated with a lot of risk. I think there are many examples, 10 to a dozen international examples of companies that have sought to do something very similar to us and put big dollars behind it. And I think it's pretty clear at this point that we are, by far and away, the most successful of those big swings, and success in the middle looked like down 99%. And so I think it's - this takes a lot to build. And I think that you're never competitively alone. But I think the degree to which you are competitively differentiated is a function of time, money, effort and difficulty. And we think there's a lot that separates us there. And so we're excited by that. But we will, in no way, shape or form be complacent. We're going to keep trying to put more space between us and everyone else, and keep delivering for our customers.\nNicholas Jones: Thanks Ernie\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Colantuoni from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to go back to Ernie's comment about passing additional gains on to the consumer. Can you just detail what you mean by that comment? I'm probably thinking about this wrong, but it sounded to me like you might - maybe you expect GPUs to be more consistent with what they are today, and over time, and then you can use any additional efficiency gains to drive faster growth. But please help clarify that for me. And then second question, the comment about the industry supporting, I think it was - the comment was the industry can now support 1,000 higher GPU. Can you just talk about what specifically is driving that and whether those underlying drivers are transitory or sustainable? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think on your first question, I think you interpreted it correctly. I think what we define as a fundamental gain is getting $1 more efficient in any given function. And that means then you have this question of do you keep profitability the same and pass the dollar back to customers in the form of lower price or lower rate, or higher bids on their car, or more investment in their experience in whatever form you want to do? And I think - or you can obviously have that to show up as higher profits. We anticipate in light of the scale of the additional fundamental gains that we see opportunity for from here, we anticipate that a significant portion of that will be passed back to customers. And we'll seek to do that as intelligently as we can. On the GPU comment, I think the point that we're just simply trying to make there is. I think the mental model that would have predicted the way things have turned out over the last four or five very volatile years the best would have been that automotive retail is largely a cost-plus business. And the costs are what do cars cost at wholesale plus what are all the operating cost to deliver to a customer an experience where they get a car at the end of it? And given that we've seen a lot of inflation in many areas of automotive retail, and many of the different automotive retailers out there have expenses that are on the order of $1,000 higher today, it would stand to reason with that mental model that you would expect $1,000 higher retail GPUs. And that is approximately what we observed, if you look at the average of many public retailers or if you look at the wholesale retail spreads. And so, it seems as if there has been inflating costs over the last several years, and then those inflating costs are being passed through to higher gross margins that are leading to somewhat similar EBITDA or operating or like EPS margins. And so I think that was the point that we're trying to make there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Marvin Fong from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nMarvin Fong: Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations on the results. So apologies if this was asked before, I joined the call late. But in talking to some investors, I think last quarter, you highlighted how quickly vehicles were selling on the site, and that kind of limited depreciation and helped GPUs that way. And I just thought I'd ask about do cars continue to sell ahead of the low 60-day kind of days to sale that you're targeting? Or has that normalized? And then second question, just thinking about your ability to grow volumes, well aware that you have the capacity. But are there any gating factors, whether it's hiring personnel or just getting the reconditioning throughput that would limit you from kind of achieving sequential unit growth better than what you achieved in the second quarter? I mean could we see unit sales go up? Or is there any limiting factor that's preventing you from selling 15,000 units a quarter, or more quarter-over-quarter or along those lines? Thanks.\nMark Jenkins: Sure. I can take the first one. So average days sale was again below sort of our typical target range in Q2. It was also below that range in Q1. I do think we'll - over time, as we onboard production capacity, I think our goal continues to be in our target range versus tracking below that. And I think the reason for that is we prefer to make a bit more selection available to customers on the site than what we had in Q1 and Q2.\nErnie Garcia: And then on your second question, I mean, I think you listed many of the gating factors. I think we buy cars from customers from auction, from partners. We transport them to our reconditioning centers. We recondition them through our reconditioning process there. Customers go on our website. We answer the questions that they've got. That means that we're answering phone calls. We're handling different digital tools to resolve their questions. We attach financing. That means we have a verification function that we go through, to make sure that everything associated with the loan is taken care of. We've got title and registration. We've got a delivery long leg and last mile. Those are the various operating groups. And I think every one of those groups, we scale up together as we grow. I think I made the point earlier that, in Q1, we grew more than we anticipated. That means that all of the groups were not positioned for the level of sales that we saw, but we started to see the demand and we started leaning in that direction. And all those groups simultaneously scaled up. And they did so in a way that was very efficient, and allowed not only our fixed expenses delever, but also our variable expenses to go down. The same thing was true again in the second quarter. We sold more cars than we expected. That means that all those same operating teams were given higher targets, and they went out and they got that done. So, I think that that's exciting. I think that, that's the continual march of building a complex machine that has lots of people and moving pieces and physical space associated with it. But I think that's something that we've demonstrated that we know how to do over a pretty long period of time. Took a little break there for 18 months. But I think for most of our company's life, that's something that we've really demonstrated we know how to do. So, I think, we'll continue to do that as we continue this transition period.\nMarvin Fong: That's great color. Thanks guys.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Doug Arthur with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nDoug Arthur: Yes, thanks. I just wanted to go back to the really strong retail GPU number. You list 4 or 5 factors that are pushing that up. And I would assume that the -- I guess, question 1 is, how significant are the higher spreads between wholesale and retail market prices currently in that equation? And I know you're buying a lot from your customers, how much can you determine that over time as the market moves around price-wise?\nErnie Garcia: Sure. So I think I would start with kind of the same figure that we discussed earlier, which is I do think that the market is supporting today approximately $1,000 more spread between wholesale and retail. And that's defined specifically as auction prices relative to average prices offered at -- across many dealers. So I think our explanation for that is that dealer costs have gone up, and it's a cost-plus business. Now I think as we grow our business, I think we have many different avenues that we buy cars from a channel perspective. We buy them directly from customers; that's the majority. We buy many from auction. And then we do have partner inventory as well with partners like Hertz where we're getting inventory. And I think then we also kind of, in geography, we buy those cars in different places. And we try to be intelligent about the way that we mix across channel and across location, to go buy those cars as efficiently as possible. That's another area where we think that there are gains to be had. We think there are many benefits that are sort of inherent, to our business model of having a very large nationally available inventory. And we think those show up in many ways. They show up in the breadth of cars that we can buy. They show up in the ways that we can intelligently price those cars given the data that we see. They show up in the ways that we can buy those cars across channel and space. And so I think we're trying to continually get better in all those different areas. But I think our - as far as prediction goes. We think that, generally speaking, the idea that automotive retailers cost' plus has been very predictive over a very long period of time with a lot of volatility, it also just kind of makes sense. And so absent big changes in average dealer expenses, I think our expectation would be that profit margins available on vehicles would be pretty similar over time.\nDoug Arthur: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRajat Gupta: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just had one question and one follow-up. Firstly, on seasonality, there have been a couple of questions earlier. If you look at the business from here, excluding 2022, 2023 when you were going through a period of restructuring, you've always grown units, 2Q to 3Q, 3Q to 4Q. And so I'm curious, like, given you're adding production now, you're hiring a lot of technicians, you're hiring market ops, fulfillment standard employees, why would the business, and given where your share is in the market, why should we still expect seasonality, at least on the units, I mean we understand the GPU seasonality, but why should there be seasonality in the units from here for Carvana. And I have a follow-up? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: Sure. Well, I think we provide our outlook, so we're going to stick with that. I think seasonality, is definitely an industry-wide thing. And then I think we're obviously focused on continually leaning through this transition to growth into more growth, and I think we'll try to be thoughtful on how we do that and the speed at which we do it. But I think we have to stick with our guidance on that one. So apologies for not being more helpful on that question.\nRajat Gupta: No worries. And another one, just on the long-term target. Obviously, a lot of discussion around the cost-plus nature around the GPUs, the $1,000. We fully understand that. But curious with the experience over the last two years within the business, are there other areas where you think the inflation of pre-pandemic that informed your long-term targets are no longer relevant? Maybe areas within SG&A, like advertising, or other areas that you might want to call out that might have changed? Thanks.\nErnie Garcia: I think first order - I think the simplest thing is just that I think the whole business model is kind of inflated, with inflation, is like a reasonable way to think about it. I think we've put out that long-term model five or six years ago, the reason that we were able to put that out and it's been fairly accurate is, because this is a very mature industry and so there's a lot of data that we could look at to see where, were the various pockets of profitability. And we were able to reasonably accurately build up what we thought expenses would be. And so I think from a long-term perspective, I'm not sure that the model has changed all that much. It's certainly inflated and I think, most specifically, it's inflated in retail GPU. I think the next thing that I would say is we acquired ADESA. And we vertically integrated versus what was anticipated at that time. So that's another change. But otherwise, I think the fundamentals of the market are pretty similar, right? Competitive dynamics are still pretty similar. Consumer options are still pretty similar. So we think that that remains a reasonable way to think about it. I think in terms of our own execution, I think this last year has been - well, the last two years really, have just been very, I think, exciting in terms of the speed at which we've been able to execute. And I think also the additional opportunities you see every time you take a step forward, you tend to see a couple of more opportunities. And so, I think that there's a lot of exciting opportunities in front of us, but I'm not sure that we're at a place where that should change our view on kind of like what we think is an attainable long-term EBITDA margin too much for the future. We'll keep you updated if that changes. But I think high level, we remain in a similar spot, and we expect now to be at the high end of our long-term model. But I think we don't have a ton more updates than that to provide.\nRajat Gupta: Understood. Great. Thanks for the color and good luck.\nErnie Garcia: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes your question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ernie Garcia for any closing remarks.\nErnie Garcia: Great. Well, thanks, everyone, for taking the time to be on the call. Thank you to all of our shareholders out there. This is - you don't get to have that many quarters that are this fun and meaningful. And I think this is a pretty fun one for the team internally, and I hope it's a fun one for many of the shareholders that have stuck with us over the last couple of years. I know there's been some ups and downs. But we're excited from here. We hope that you're excited about these results and about the prospects that we have going forward. To everyone inside Carvana, I just cannot thank you guys enough. I hope that you are incredibly proud of the results that we've been able to put forward here. I think it's the coolest thing that I've ever been associated with, is getting beat up that bad by the whole world and then just coming together and fighting all the way back to this spot. And I hope we always remember that. I hope we always stay in that fighting stance. And I hope we keep proving people wrong, because it's been really fun, and I think that we can and I think that we should. So thank you to all of you. Take a moment to be proud. We'll see you tomorrow, we'll be back at it. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Meg, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. The second quarter was another landmark quarter for Carvana. In the first quarter of this year, we were both the fastest-growing and most profitable public automotive retailer for the first time. In the second quarter, we did it again. And this time, we extended our separation in each category. Historically, when those two things are true at the same time, it bodes very well for an extremely successful future. We have every intention of working hard to validate that pattern. And in this case, a promising pattern is paired with tremendous room to run. We are a company with just a 1% market share in a $1 trillion industry with highly fragmented competition and barriers to entry that have recently been proven to be extremely hard to overcome. Our position is unique. And it is important to remember why. We are in this position today because 10 years and $10 billion ago, we set out to build an entirely new way to buy and sell cars. We thought through everything from scratch, starting with what our customers wanted, and then pairing that with what we believe was possible with new technology and new operations. We also discarded what others told us was impossible and all the reasons they provided us. We were stubborn and ambitious. I'm grateful for both. And I'm also grateful that we had no idea how hard it would be to get to this point. Being right about outcome and wrong about the path may be the most productive combination there is. From here, we believe the outcome is clear and exciting. And we are weather-worn enough to know the path will be harder than we think, but we are still ambitious and stubborn enough to keep pushing and to never accept anything is good enough. We are a team of fighters, and we're going to keep fighting on the good days and on the hard days just as we have in the past. As a result, our visibility into additional scale and further improvements in unit economics is also very clear. We are currently carrying the physical capacity and associated fixed expense of being built for approximately three times our current volume. In addition, through our ADESA acquisition, we have the real estate to handle vehicle reconditioning at a scale approximately eight times our current run rate. Importantly, we also have very clear plans and high confidence in achieving further fundamental gains across each area of variable costs and gross profit. In the last year, we improved in these areas to the tune of approximately $2,000 per unit. Given that we improved that much that fast, it is obvious that significant gains remain. Our team is using the same operational processes we have for the last two years and is currently working on a very clear set of well-defined specific enhancements to each part of our offering that we believe have potential to materially impact the customer offering and the business as a whole. We will work hard to unlock them as quickly as we can, and we will do the same each year thereafter. As we unlock these gains over time, we anticipate passing more and more of the value we create back to our customers, further differentiating our offering and driving additional growth. The combined benefits of constantly improving customer experiences, incremental sales with our strong unit economics, additional fundamental gains, and the leverage that comes with filling in our footprint paint a clear picture of the company we aim to become, a company that is the largest and most profitable automotive retailer, and a company that achieves its mission of changing the way people buy and sell cars. Now we have to keep our heads down and keep doing the hard work that will turn this picture into reality. We are up to the challenge. The march continues. Mark. Chris, you there? Sure. I think from a demographics perspective, I think, clearly, affordability was impacted pretty heavily over the last couple of years. I think there's good news there, though. We have seen kind of higher levels of depreciation over the last 1.5 years. I think relative to CPI, car prices are now only probably about 3% higher than they were pre-pandemic. So I think we've closed a lot of that gap. Rates are obviously higher. So if you look at payments, payments are still about 10% higher than they were pre-pandemic for a similar car. So there's probably a little bit of room for that to continue to improve. And that, of course, is impacting the lower end of the demographic spectrum probably more than the higher income end. But I don't think there's anything too notable to call out there. I think we're just focused on continuing to buy the cars that our customers are demanding on our site, getting those up, getting those reconditioned, delivering them to customers and giving them great experiences. And I think that's what's driving our success right now without too much focus on one group or another. From a credit perspective, I think credit clearly was kind of slowly moving back toward pre-pandemic normal after being very good in '20 and '21, and then probably crossover was a little bit worse in '22 and parts of '23. And I think many lenders ourselves included, started to tighten credit in the fourth quarter of '23. What we've seen so far from that is performance that's definitely in line with what we would have hoped to see. So I think at this time, it doesn't feel like there are other moves that would be super material. But obviously, we're paying attention and we may adjust that over time. I think we do want you to actually if we... Correct. We've broken down SG&A in the past into three categories: overhead, marketing and operations expense. And I think it's probably useful to hit them all separately. On overhead, we've held that pretty flat for the last five or six quarters. And I think that that's largely our plan for the immediate future, is to continue to hold that flat. On marketing expense, we've moved down from a kind of long-term average just over $1,000 to 542 this quarter. That's something that we're extremely excited about, obviously, and that reflects a lot of gains across, I think, many different parts of the system. I think from a long-term fundamental perspective, I think debatably the most exciting part of that is what's going on with operations expense. We, this quarter, we're at $1,696 that's a number that we're extremely excited about. It's a number that's several hundred dollars less than our kind of pre-pandemic numbers that were pretty good at the time. But that's happened at a time when the average of other automotive retailers have probably seen their SG&A go up by about $1,000 with inflation and everything else. So I think the gains look like a couple of hundred dollars there, but I think inflation-adjusted and, most importantly, I think, relative to what else is out there, I think those gains are likely over $1,000. And then further, I think that inside of that operation expense, there's a warranty line item that today is around 350 and was kind of closer to 150 to 200 pre-pandemic when inflation rates were quite a bit lower. And so I think when you look at kind of the operations expense ex warranty, the gains versus pre-pandemic are more like $400 per unit, again, at a time when costs across the industry have gone up very significantly. So we're really excited about that because that's a deep fundamental - I think the deep fundamentals are basically how does your customer experience stack up relative to what's available elsewhere. And I think the most objective measure of that is the growth that you see at any point in time, especially relative to your offering at a time like this when we've got inventory flat and marketing dollars flat. I think that it's clear that customers are responding very well to our offering. I think number two is how are you able to monetize the transaction, and I think through our vertical integration and building everything that we've built from scratch to serve an e-commerce experience, I think that we're faring very well there. And then the third is, what are your variable expenses? And just kind of walk through that, but I think that that's a number that we're extremely excited about. And we think relative to what else is out there, we've made a lot of gains. So overall, we're excited. We use this term fundamental gains. We said we made about $2,000 of fundamental gains over the last year. Largely what we mean by that is either gains that we believe are sustainable in gross profit or variable expenses per unit, which would be in that operation expense. We think there are still significant gains left to be had. We're working hard at going in unlocking them. But we think the business model is not done being fully flexed. And I think we're excited about going and attacking that and also what that means for the future. Yes, sir. So I think first and most importantly, we see gains in front of us, in growth and in the various fundamental areas we just discussed, and we're going to go out and try to get them. And I think that that's going to be something that we're going to continually do over the next several years. So I think that's probably the most important thing. I think as it relates to the guide, I think you're bringing up all the appropriate points and doing all the math correctly. We did sell a little bit more in loan production this quarter than we originated. So we provided a bridge in the Shareholder Letter that that was probably about 0.4%. So probably a more normalized number would have been about 10%, in dollars that would have been about $12 million give or take. So that positively impacted the quarter. And then there is seasonality heading into the back half of the year. But obviously, we're extremely excited with the results we just had. We're extremely excited about the outlook for the rest of this year. And I think most importantly, we're just extremely excited about the opportunity that we've got, because I think part of the goal of building out this dream is to take something that was very nonobvious and slowly but surely turn into something that's obvious. And we think this quarter is probably the biggest discontinuous step in making what we're trying to achieve, obviously, we've ever taken. So we're very excited about it. Thank you. We can. Sure. Well, so first, I would say we believe there are significant fundamental gains to be had in every GPU line item, retail GPU included. And so we think that we can deliver to customers the same quality of offering and cause retail GPU to go up. I think it's important to reevaluate what GPU might mean in this environment versus pre-pandemic. And I think a lot of heuristics over time have been established pre-pandemic that maybe warrant some revisiting now. And so for perspective on that, I spoke in the last question about how most dealers have seen SG&A per unit go up by about $1,000. I think the right kind of first order mental model for how the automotive industry works is that, generally speaking, it's cost plus. Many dealers share a cost structure and they kind of -- they're at auction, holding up their hand to buy a car at a certain price, and they're pricing it with a profit in mind, and many are acting in similar ways. So if you look at the average retail GPU across many automotive retailers now versus pre-pandemic, it's also up around $1,000, as like a good first order estimate. And so I think debatably, kind of all the heuristics from before, you could kind of move up by $1,000. And I think that that's also buttressed by just looking at wholesale retail spreads today, which is basically kind of you're just looking at the aggregate market that is impacted by the sum of dealers. It probably is supporting about $1,000 more in retail GPU than it was pre-pandemic. So I think all the heuristics -- first order, I think you kind of moved them by roughly $1,000. And I think that's helpful in explaining the significant changes that you've seen from us. Now I think a lot of the gains that we've made have been fundamental, they've been in every part of the business - every part of the kind of business of acquiring cars and getting cars to our inspection centers and doing that inexpensively and reconditioning them as efficiently as we possibly can. And we believe we have gains in all those same areas. So all the same teams are largely they've got new projects, but they're all pointing at the same areas and they're all running in the same directions to continue making gains from here. So we do think it can go up. We also think that as we kind of stated in the Shareholder Letter and in prepared remarks, we think that we're likely now getting to a place where it's more likely than not that it will make more sense to pass additional gains back to customers, or more of the additional gains that we make from here back to customers. And we're excited about what that means as well, because we've got a business model now that is capable of turning out quite a bit of cash and also responds very well to scale. So we're going to keep trying to make those gains. We'll try to invest them intelligently. But I think overall, we're pretty excited. We think there's room everywhere. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Sure. So I think we talked last quarter about kind of moving into this transition to growth. And I think that that's where we remain. I think in the first quarter we sold more cars than we anticipated. That caused our inventory to be a little lighter than we expected. We turned up our production plans, and the operating teams did a great job, and we're able to achieve that. That enabled us to sell more cars than we expected again in the second quarter. But we did build our inventory much less than we would have liked to. So I think we're continuing to lean in that direction. We haven't invested in marketing yet. There's -- our marketing expense relative to our gross profits leaves a lot of room. And so I think we kind of put this outline in the Shareholder Letter of the things that we believe have driven our growth since the beginning, which we think have been consistent but have just shown up in kind of different weights across time. And that's continuously improving customer experience, that's highly differentiated, increasing awareness, understanding and trust. I think those are three different steps to brand, but every step matters there. And then increasing inventory selection and other scale benefits. And I think that so far, we've kind of gotten to a place where we've gone from negative effects in the second and third area over the last couple of years as we were shrinking inventory and as we were investing less in marketing and as we were getting beat up a little bit in the press, to more like still wins, but those still wins still have enabled pretty exciting levels of growth. So I think this transition period is about figuring out where exactly that healthy balance of growth is where we can grow significantly and get all the clear benefits that come with that, but also continue to make fundamental gains because we do still believe there are significant fundamental gains to be had. And we've been saying that for the last year, and I think the way the team's executed has really proven that to be extremely true. And so I think we're still feeling that out as we go. But I think if we take a step a little further back, I just think the position that we're in relative to this industry is very, very exciting, right? We've gone from a company that grew at 85% compounded for the five years prior to 2021, we grew very, very fast, to a company that went through a difficult time, and during that difficult time found a way to get a lot more efficient and, frankly, to serve our customers better and to just be a better business. And I think now we're in a position where we're starting to kind of turn the engines back on and we're moving in that direction. We're a 1% market shareholder. We see a lot of room to run. And the most important thing is that we make good decisions, we prioritize, we stay focused and we just keep marching because there's a big prize in front of us. And so we're going to go out and try to be as intelligent as we can be as we go tackle it. So I think that that's also something that we're figuring out in this transition period. I think Mark spoke about our next site in Kansas City, which is going to be a site where we're calling it a Megasite. It's going to have all the capabilities at once. We've done it very efficiently so far with almost no CapEx. I think the more of these sites that we choose to open, there are many more that we could integrate and not have a huge CapEx investment. But I think the more of them that we choose to open, the more that that will lean a little bit in the direction of CapEx. But a lot of other offsetting benefits. You get access to a lot more inventory pools, you get closer to your customers, your inbound transport costs are less, your outbound transport costs are less, your transport times are faster, which leads to higher conversion. And so, I think we're trying to find the balance right now between adding inventory pools and logistics capabilities to those sites and being really efficient. And so far, that's led to of adding reconditioning capabilities in Buffalo and Portland and Kansas City. I think over time, we will certainly do more. And I think the speed at which we do that is something that we're figuring out as we go right now. Thank you. Sure. I think that - so I think - we provided in the bridge and we put in the Shareholder Letter, it gives you a walk from kind of where we are to where we expect leverage to be and how we're doing from a marketing perspective in some of our more mature markets. And I think that gives a pretty clear walk, to the very high end of our long-term financial model from an EBITDA perspective without the need for fundamental gains. And then we do believe there are very significant fundamental gains to be had. And I think the areas where we could invest them were all of the areas that you suggested, and a couple more. And I think as we move forward, we will try to do that as intelligently as we can. I'm not sure we want to tip our hat too much on that, because I think we've got some creative ideas. And I think there's also some lessons that we've got to learn between here and there as we start to give that back to see where it's most efficient. But we - as long as we execute, we anticipate having gains to give back. And then, we'll try to do that very intelligently. As it relates to CDK, I think there's no question that that was an impact the industry broadly. I think there were significant impacts on many automotive retailers. The impact to us, I think our best guess at that is that it was pretty muted. We didn't see huge impacts either when it started, when it was ongoing or as it was alleviated. Maybe there were a little directional things that you could have picked out, but nothing that I think warrants mentioned. So I'm not sure there was a huge impact there. Thank you. Hi Sharon. Sure. So I think - I'm not sure my answer is going to be as satisfying as you would like. I think all of your observations are correct. I think we're in this transition period and I think we're moving in that direction. As discussed, we're trying to balance growth and its benefits with the benefits of being able to keep things a little more stable and continue to make gains. I think there's no question that we are very, very small compared to what we want to be, at any point in time, measuring the exact amount of latent demand is complicated because I think you even have to frame what that means kind of carefully. If you believe you have a business model with positive feedback, then as you unlock more demand, kind of that more demand showing up leads to things like faster delivery time and broader selection and unlocks more demand again. So I think our eyes are on selling millions of cars and being the largest, most profitable automotive retailer, and doing it as quickly and intelligently as we possibly can. We think things look very, very good right now, and it's very, very exciting. But we always remain aware that there's always bumps along the way as well. And so, I don't know. Things feel very good. They feel very good, and I think we just got to keep moving forward, and we'll see where it takes us. Nice that you call me out on that. Sure. So I mean I think one of the lessons that we learned over the last couple of years is that focus is very valuable. And I think one of the things we learned about ourselves, I think we've assembled a team that is very ambitious and seeks to take on a lot of things. And I think that one of the battles that we constantly face internally, I think, is trying to make sure that we tackle the right number of things and we prioritize them properly. I think given the creativity that we have inside of the walls of Carvana, I think we're never short ideas. That's never the case. And I think just trying to make sure that we're focusing on the right things in the right order to make the most progress that we can as quickly as possible is what we focus on. I think that that extends to efficiencies, growth and other opportunities where we believe they are exciting areas, all three of those are very exciting areas. So, I think we're trying to be as smart as we can there. Half of saying this out loud is a reminder to ourselves to try to stay focused, because I think we remain in a place where there are more opportunities than we should intelligently take on, and we're trying to be as thoughtful as we can about which we take on and how. Sure. So I mean I'll respond to that maybe just generally. I mean I think the view that we've always had and we've tried to continually share is that, as it relates to ourselves, we try to not be too focused on competition. We try to be focused on our customers. I think it gets very easy for companies to follow each other in circles and believe that what the other company is doing is smart. And then just kind of continually chase each other instead of listening to their customers. So what we try to do is listen to our customers. That's our continual goal, and we will continue to do that. I think that there's no question that whenever results are being put up that are high quality, people are going to take notice. And I think that will be true of probably many in the industry. And that's fine. I think we never expected to be alone or be handed anything. We expected to come out here and compete for it and try to build something differentiated for our customers. And I think that's what we intend to continue to do. I think something that - putting on our very biased Carvana hats, something that we're just extremely excited about is we think that the things that we've built are really differentiated and take a long time and a lot of effort and are associated with a lot of risk. I think there are many examples, 10 to a dozen international examples of companies that have sought to do something very similar to us and put big dollars behind it. And I think it's pretty clear at this point that we are, by far and away, the most successful of those big swings, and success in the middle looked like down 99%. And so I think it's - this takes a lot to build. And I think that you're never competitively alone. But I think the degree to which you are competitively differentiated is a function of time, money, effort and difficulty. And we think there's a lot that separates us there. And so we're excited by that. But we will, in no way, shape or form be complacent. We're going to keep trying to put more space between us and everyone else, and keep delivering for our customers. Thank you. Sure. So I think on your first question, I think you interpreted it correctly. I think what we define as a fundamental gain is getting $1 more efficient in any given function. And that means then you have this question of do you keep profitability the same and pass the dollar back to customers in the form of lower price or lower rate, or higher bids on their car, or more investment in their experience in whatever form you want to do? And I think - or you can obviously have that to show up as higher profits. We anticipate in light of the scale of the additional fundamental gains that we see opportunity for from here, we anticipate that a significant portion of that will be passed back to customers. And we'll seek to do that as intelligently as we can. On the GPU comment, I think the point that we're just simply trying to make there is. I think the mental model that would have predicted the way things have turned out over the last four or five very volatile years the best would have been that automotive retail is largely a cost-plus business. And the costs are what do cars cost at wholesale plus what are all the operating cost to deliver to a customer an experience where they get a car at the end of it? And given that we've seen a lot of inflation in many areas of automotive retail, and many of the different automotive retailers out there have expenses that are on the order of $1,000 higher today, it would stand to reason with that mental model that you would expect $1,000 higher retail GPUs. And that is approximately what we observed, if you look at the average of many public retailers or if you look at the wholesale retail spreads. And so, it seems as if there has been inflating costs over the last several years, and then those inflating costs are being passed through to higher gross margins that are leading to somewhat similar EBITDA or operating or like EPS margins. And so I think that was the point that we're trying to make there. And then on your second question, I mean, I think you listed many of the gating factors. I think we buy cars from customers from auction, from partners. We transport them to our reconditioning centers. We recondition them through our reconditioning process there. Customers go on our website. We answer the questions that they've got. That means that we're answering phone calls. We're handling different digital tools to resolve their questions. We attach financing. That means we have a verification function that we go through, to make sure that everything associated with the loan is taken care of. We've got title and registration. We've got a delivery long leg and last mile. Those are the various operating groups. And I think every one of those groups, we scale up together as we grow. I think I made the point earlier that, in Q1, we grew more than we anticipated. That means that all of the groups were not positioned for the level of sales that we saw, but we started to see the demand and we started leaning in that direction. And all those groups simultaneously scaled up. And they did so in a way that was very efficient, and allowed not only our fixed expenses delever, but also our variable expenses to go down. The same thing was true again in the second quarter. We sold more cars than we expected. That means that all those same operating teams were given higher targets, and they went out and they got that done. So, I think that that's exciting. I think that, that's the continual march of building a complex machine that has lots of people and moving pieces and physical space associated with it. But I think that's something that we've demonstrated that we know how to do over a pretty long period of time. Took a little break there for 18 months. But I think for most of our company's life, that's something that we've really demonstrated we know how to do. So, I think, we'll continue to do that as we continue this transition period. Thank you. Sure. So I think I would start with kind of the same figure that we discussed earlier, which is I do think that the market is supporting today approximately $1,000 more spread between wholesale and retail. And that's defined specifically as auction prices relative to average prices offered at -- across many dealers. So I think our explanation for that is that dealer costs have gone up, and it's a cost-plus business. Now I think as we grow our business, I think we have many different avenues that we buy cars from a channel perspective. We buy them directly from customers; that's the majority. We buy many from auction. And then we do have partner inventory as well with partners like Hertz where we're getting inventory. And I think then we also kind of, in geography, we buy those cars in different places. And we try to be intelligent about the way that we mix across channel and across location, to go buy those cars as efficiently as possible. That's another area where we think that there are gains to be had. We think there are many benefits that are sort of inherent, to our business model of having a very large nationally available inventory. And we think those show up in many ways. They show up in the breadth of cars that we can buy. They show up in the ways that we can intelligently price those cars given the data that we see. They show up in the ways that we can buy those cars across channel and space. And so I think we're trying to continually get better in all those different areas. But I think our - as far as prediction goes. We think that, generally speaking, the idea that automotive retailers cost' plus has been very predictive over a very long period of time with a lot of volatility, it also just kind of makes sense. And so absent big changes in average dealer expenses, I think our expectation would be that profit margins available on vehicles would be pretty similar over time. Thank you. Sure. Well, I think we provide our outlook, so we're going to stick with that. I think seasonality, is definitely an industry-wide thing. And then I think we're obviously focused on continually leaning through this transition to growth into more growth, and I think we'll try to be thoughtful on how we do that and the speed at which we do it. But I think we have to stick with our guidance on that one. So apologies for not being more helpful on that question. I think first order - I think the simplest thing is just that I think the whole business model is kind of inflated, with inflation, is like a reasonable way to think about it. I think we've put out that long-term model five or six years ago, the reason that we were able to put that out and it's been fairly accurate is, because this is a very mature industry and so there's a lot of data that we could look at to see where, were the various pockets of profitability. And we were able to reasonably accurately build up what we thought expenses would be. And so I think from a long-term perspective, I'm not sure that the model has changed all that much. It's certainly inflated and I think, most specifically, it's inflated in retail GPU. I think the next thing that I would say is we acquired ADESA. And we vertically integrated versus what was anticipated at that time. So that's another change. But otherwise, I think the fundamentals of the market are pretty similar, right? Competitive dynamics are still pretty similar. Consumer options are still pretty similar. So we think that that remains a reasonable way to think about it. I think in terms of our own execution, I think this last year has been - well, the last two years really, have just been very, I think, exciting in terms of the speed at which we've been able to execute. And I think also the additional opportunities you see every time you take a step forward, you tend to see a couple of more opportunities. And so, I think that there's a lot of exciting opportunities in front of us, but I'm not sure that we're at a place where that should change our view on kind of like what we think is an attainable long-term EBITDA margin too much for the future. We'll keep you updated if that changes. But I think high level, we remain in a similar spot, and we expect now to be at the high end of our long-term model. But I think we don't have a ton more updates than that to provide. Thank you. Great. Well, thanks, everyone, for taking the time to be on the call. Thank you to all of our shareholders out there. This is - you don't get to have that many quarters that are this fun and meaningful. And I think this is a pretty fun one for the team internally, and I hope it's a fun one for many of the shareholders that have stuck with us over the last couple of years. I know there's been some ups and downs. But we're excited from here. We hope that you're excited about these results and about the prospects that we have going forward. To everyone inside Carvana, I just cannot thank you guys enough. I hope that you are incredibly proud of the results that we've been able to put forward here. I think it's the coolest thing that I've ever been associated with, is getting beat up that bad by the whole world and then just coming together and fighting all the way back to this spot. And I hope we always remember that. I hope we always stay in that fighting stance. And I hope we keep proving people wrong, because it's been really fun, and I think that we can and I think that we should. So thank you to all of you. Take a moment to be proud. We'll see you tomorrow, we'll be back at it. Thanks, everyone."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. The second quarter was an exceptional quarter for Carvana and reinforce the significant and sustainable progress we have made and continue to make in our current multiyear phase of driving profitable growth. For the second consecutive quarter, we generated positive net income and we set new company records for adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and GAAP operating income. For the first time, quarterly adjusted EBITDA margin approached the midpoint of our long-term financial model EBITDA margin range of 8% to 13.5%, and we see meaningful opportunities for fundamental gains to drive towards the higher end of that range over time. Moving to our second quarter results. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis. Q2 again demonstrated the strength of our differentiated business model. Retail units sold increased 33% despite continued focus on unit economics and profitability initiatives as the strong demand we experienced in Q1 continued into Q2. Revenue increased by 15%. Revenue grew less than retail units, primarily due to industry-wide declines in retail and wholesale vehicle average selling prices. In Q2, our operational teams focused on increasing production capacity to increase selection to more optimal levels for our customers. The teams met their production targets in the quarter, but we still remain below our target available website inventory due to continued strong demand. In the near term, we will continue to increase production across the country. Our strong profitability results in Q2 were driven by meaningful fundamental improvements in GPU and SG&A expenses. In the second quarter, non-GAAP total GPU was $7,344, an increase of $314 and a new company record. Non-GAAP retail GPU was $3,539, an increase of $677 and a new company record. Our strength in retail GPU continues to be driven by fundamental gains and consistent performance in several areas, including uveal cost of sales, customer sourcing, inventory turn times and revenues from additional sources. Year-over-year changes were also driven by higher spreads between wholesale and retail market prices, partially offset by higher retail depreciation rates and a lower retail inventory allowance adjustment. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $1,104, a decrease of $124. Year-over-year changes were primarily driven by growth in both wholesale vehicle and wholesale marketplace gross profit, offset by growth in retail units sold. Non-GAAP other GPU was $2,701, a decrease of $239. Year-over-year changes in other GPU were primarily driven by holding and selling a greater volume of loans relative to originations in Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2024, which increased Q2 2023 other GPU by approximately $650, partially offset by the continued impact of credit storing improvements, pricing optimizations and credit tightening begun in Q4 2023. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $390 million, an increase of 2%. Q2 was an exceptional quarter for demonstrating the power of our model to leverage SG&A expenses. Retail units sold increased by 33%, leading to an $1,160 reduction in SG&A expense per retail units sold. Sequentially, SG&A expense per retail units sold declined $400, of which $150 was driven by continued improvement in Carvana operations expense, demonstrating that we continue to drive operating cost efficiencies while growing. We continue to see opportunities for significant SG&A expense leverage over time and as we scale, driven by both continued improvement in operational expenses as well as leverage in the fixed component of our cost structure. Adjusted EBITDA was $355 million in Q2, an increase of $200 million and a new company record. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.4% in Q2, a 5.2 percentage point increase and a new company record. It is worth noting that our adjusted EBITDA is very high quality compared to many rapidly growing companies due to our relatively low noncash expenses. Our GAAP operating income was $259 million in Q2, leading to GAAP operating margin of 7.6%, leading the public auto retail industry. As previously noted, we are currently carrying capacity for approximately 3x retail unit sales and expect our GAAP operating income to grow faster than adjusted EBITDA over time. Our results in Q1 and Q2 position us well for a strong Q3 and Q4. Looking forward, we expect the following as long as the environment remains stable. First, a sequential increase in retail units sold in Q3 compared to Q2. And second, adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion to $1.2 billion for the full year 2024, an increase from $339 million last year. We are pairing our continued strong financial results with a disciplined financial policy that positions us well to thoughtfully delever over time. This includes, first, in May, we announced our intention to pay cash interest on our 2028 and 2030 senior secured notes beginning in 2025 to reduce long-term cash interest expense. Second, we repurchased $250 million of our 2028 senior secured notes in Q2 and, over the same time period, raised $350 million of equity capital. Third, we intend to further delever over time, with our primary focus on adjusted EBITDA growth, which both generates cash and reduces leverage ratios. In conclusion, Q2 was an exceptional quarter for Carvana. We're excited about progressing in our long-term phase of driving profitable growth and pursuing our goal of becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer and buying and selling millions of cars. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. Sure. Yes. I think there -- I think we have a lot of flexibility to increase production. I think that takes three primary forms. So first, adding -- continue to add lines in existing Carvana facilities that have excess capacity to add lines. I would say it's category number one, and we definitely have capacity to continue to do that. Category number two would be more what you suggested, which is also a slightly different form of adding lines, which is adding shifts to IRCs where all the production lines during the day shift are full, you can add a second shift to increase production capacity. And then the third that I would layer in is increasing production at ADESA locations. So we've had a lot of success adding Carvana reconditioning software and processes, in two locations so far, in Buffalo and Portland. We plan to integrate Carvana auto production into a third location in Kansas City that we call the Megasite, which is a site where we are continuing to serve very effectively physical auction customers at the site, while also implementing Carvana reconditioning processes and systems. And so integrating more ADESA sites with the ongoing physical auction services, combined with Carvana reconditioning, is the third avenue for production growth that we're excited about. So all of those together give us a lot of flexibility. I think one of the things we're excited about in this next phase of growth is we do have more flexibility than we've ever had before for growing production efficiently, at the right cost, at the right level of quality over time. So on the question about seasonality, I think where we typically think of seasonality as being most prominent is really in the fourth quarter, first and foremost, and then maybe to an extent in the early first quarter as well. I think the form that that seasonality takes is typically softer overall used car market demand as well as higher depreciation rates. And so that's industry seasonality that we see year-after-year. And I think where we see that most acutely is in the fourth quarter. and sort of the early part of the first quarter. Sure. I can take that one. So I do think we've had a strong quarter -- we've had a strong first half on other GPU. I think there are many drivers of that, including all the work that the teams do internally to optimize our platform, scoring, pricing, monetization, as well as we've -- I think, over time, had some nice gains in the ancillary products part of that as well. I think as we look forward for opportunities, we do see opportunities to make fundamental gains in other GPU. I think some of the areas where we see opportunities are really the areas that I just listed. So we're always seeking to take in more data and improve our scoring and pricing algorithms. We're always seeking to prove and streamline the customer experience, to make using Carvana financing as easy as possible. We're always working to develop the most efficient funding sources for our loans. We're always looking to continue to improve attach rates on our ancillary products. And so, those are areas where we've made gains historically, but absolutely areas where the teams are focused on continuing to make fundamental gains over time. The callout that we had on Q2, I think Ernie mentioned as well, we saw about a $12 million favorable impact just due to timing effect - loan sale timing effects that rounded up to 0.4% of revenue. So that would be the primary thing that I would call out as it relates to Q2. Sure. I can take the first one. So average days sale was again below sort of our typical target range in Q2. It was also below that range in Q1. I do think we'll - over time, as we onboard production capacity, I think our goal continues to be in our target range versus tracking below that. And I think the reason for that is we prefer to make a bit more selection available to customers on the site than what we had in Q1 and Q2."

I would now like to hand the call to Meg Kehan, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nMeg Kehan: Thank you, MJ. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us on Carvana's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that this call will be simultaneously webcast on the Investor Relations section of the company's corporate website at investors.carvana.com. The first quarter shareholder letter is also posted to the IR website. Additionally, we posted a set of supplemental financial tables for Q1, which can be found on the Events & Presentations page of our IR website. \n Joining me on the call today are Ernie Garcia, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Jenkins, Chief Financial Officer. \n Before we start, I would like to remind you that the following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, including, but not limited to, Carvana's market opportunities and future financial results that involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed here.  \n A detailed discussion of the material factors that cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements can be found in the Risk Factors section of Carvana's most recent Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q. The forward-looking statements and risks in this conference call are based on current expectations as of today, and Carvana assumes no obligation to update or revise them, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise.  \n Our commentary today will include non-GAAP financial metrics. Unless otherwise specified, all references to GPU and SG&A will be to the non-GAAP metrics and all references to EBITDA will be to adjusted EBITDA. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial metrics for our reported results can be found in our shareholder letter issued today, a copy of which can be found on our IR website.  \n And with that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Ernie Garcia. Ernie? \nErnest Garcia: Thanks, Meg, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. Q1 was an incredible quarter for Carvana and one that is worthy of reflection. My plan is to first share some of the highlights from the quarter and then to discuss the long-term implications of our recent performance. First, the highlights in the quarter. \n In the quarter, we achieved adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.7%. By this measure, in Q1, we not only set new all-time company records, but we also became the most profitable public automotive retailer in the U.S. for the first time. We returned to growth, growing retail units 16% year-over-year despite decreasing marketing dollars by 4% and having constrained inventory. We completed our first quarter with adjusted EBITDA exceeding CapEx and interest expense, achieving this milestone by a significant margin.  \n We achieved GPU that exceeds our previous record from Q2 2023 after normalizing for last Q2's excess loan sale volume, achieving a GAAP gross profit margin of 19.3% above the high end of our long-term financial model. We significantly levered marketing spend, operations expenses and overhead expenses, the last of which were held flat in absolute dollars despite 21% sequential growth.  \n In combining our GPU and expense leverage, we also validated our long-term financial model that we put out 6 years ago and clearly lit a path to significant additional financial gains from here. These gains will be driven by both leverage on our fixed overhead costs and additional fundamental gains in both operational expenses and GPU. We see opportunity for large improvements in our adjusted EBITDA margin from here.  \n We achieved all of this in a difficult automotive environment at a time when most in the industry are moving backward on both unit economics and volume. The long-term implications of this quarter are significant. We continue to deliver experiences that our customers love. The strength of our customer offering has always been apparent in our growth, which even with the last 2-year hiatus, has earned us the honor of being the fastest-growing automotive retailer in U.S. history.  \n As we get bigger and more efficient, the experiences we deliver get even better and simpler. Constantly improving customer experiences has always been centrally important to us, and it will remain centrally important to us in the future. It is one of our most important feedback loops. We are positioned to grow significantly from here. The part of our business that is most difficult to scale is reconditioning because it requires significant physical space, construction and zoning approvals.  \n Across our current inspection and reconditioning center infrastructure, we have capacity for 1.3 million units per year, over 3x our current volume. Beyond that, our ADESA locations, we have the ability to increase our production capacity to a total of approximately 3 million units annually. To unlock this opportunity, we are developing a playbook to bring our full suite of retail reconditioning and logistics technology and processes to ADESA locations.  \n We recently completed our first conversion of an ADESA site in Buffalo, New York to a Carvana Reconditioning Center, and now this site is leveraging Carli, our proprietary reconditioning software and our proprietary processes to recondition retail units. We believe we have a model that gets better as it gets bigger, and ADESA is a key part of that story.  Reconditioning cars at more ADESA locations over time reduces inbound transportation, which positively impacts cost of sales and retail GPU and decreases outbound transportation, reducing SG&A per unit and decreasing delivery times for our customers, increasing conversion and decreasing marketing costs.  \n This is also a good feedback loop. Competitively, we sit in a better position than we have at any point in our history. Through our own experiences and those of the various companies who have sought to do something similar to us, the last few years have resoundingly proven just how difficult it is to build a business this complex to drive it to scale, to achieve strong unit economics and to deliver high-quality customer experiences.  \n Building a business like Carvana is very hard and hard is the ultimate competitive moat. Our addressable market remains an enormous opportunity. 40 million used cars are bought and sold on average each year. There are tens of thousands of car dealers offering customers similar experiences to one another with similar business models. Carvana offers a differentiated experience, supported by a differentiated cost structure and driving a differentiated business model. That differentiated model just delivered approximately $1 billion in annualized adjusted EBITDA, and we are still a long way from the full financial potential of our business model and its scale.  \n With just 1% market share in this enormous, fragmented market, we are extremely well positioned. Today is an exciting day for Carvana. The size of our opportunity and the strength of our positioning are clear. Now it's our job to make sure we make the most of it. Our team is ready, the march continues. Mark? \nMark Jenkins: Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. The first quarter was a milestone quarter for proving the long-term earnings power of our online retail model. We set company records on adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. We achieved industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin for the first time. We drove significant GAAP operating income, and we generated adjusted EBITDA that significantly exceeded capital expenditures and interest expense. \n Our results in Q1 were exceptional, but we also see significant opportunities to improve margins with scale and continued efficiency gains over time. We provide additional details on these opportunities in our shareholder letter. \n Turning to our first quarter results. We entered Q1 squarely focused on unit economics and profitability initiatives. Despite this focus, we saw strong customer demand in part due to several fundamental gains in conversion and customer experience that we made over the preceding quarters.  \n Retail units sold increased by 16% year-over-year and 21% sequentially, reflecting significant market share gains on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Revenue increased by 17% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. This unit and revenue growth was more than we targeted, given our continued focus on profitability initiatives entering the year. That said, our teams have handled it well and responded to increased sales while also demonstrating leverage on operations expenses.  \n We are excited by this and believe there is more to come. Our growth in Q1 has had multiple impacts on our inventory. First, our results in Q1 demonstrated how efficient our nationally pooled inventory can be. In March, the average car we sold was only visible to customers on our website for 13 days before being purchased, nearing our all-time monthly low on this metric. Second, our inventory is currently smaller than we would like, resulting in less selection available to our customers.  \n All else constant, we believe this is negatively impacting our sales volumes today. To respond, our teams have begun increasing production across the country. In the near term, our focus will remain on growing production to increase selection to more optimal levels for our customers. Our strong profitability results in Q1 were driven by meaningful fundamental improvements in GPU and SG&A expenses.  \n In the first quarter, non-GAAP total GPU was $6,802, a sequential increase of $1,072 and a new first quarter record. Non-GAAP retail GPU was $3,211 versus $2,970 in Q4, a new company record. Our strength in retail GPU continues to be driven by fundamental gains and consistent performance in several areas, including nonvehicle cost of sales, customer sourcing, inventory turn times and revenues from additional services. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $1,153 versus $881 in Q4.  \n Sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by more favorable depreciation rates and first quarter seasonality. Non-GAAP other GPU was $2,438 versus $1,879 in Q4. Sequential changes in other GPU were primarily driven by more normalized loan sale volume relative to originations, lower securitization credit spreads and credit scoring and pricing optimizations, including credit tightening in Q4.  \n Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $390 million versus $376 million in Q4. Q1 was an exceptional quarter for demonstrating the power of our model to leverage SG&A expenses. Retail units sold increased by 21% sequentially while non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased by less than 4%, leading to a nearly $700 reduction in SG&A expense per retail units sold. We continue to see opportunities for significant SG&A expense leverage over time and as we scale.  \n Adjusted EBITDA was $235 million in Q1, a new company record. This result included small, onetime headwinds that were larger than any onetime tailwinds. It is important to note that the change in fair value of our Root Warrants does not impact adjusted EBITDA. Demonstrating the quality of our adjusted EBITDA, we also generated $134 million of GAAP operating income in Q1, a new company record. As mentioned previously, in Q1, we generated adjusted EBITDA that significantly exceeded capital expenditures and interest expense.  \n This milestone means that in Q1, we officially achieved the goal we set out in May 2022 to drive significant positive cash flow after interest expense. Moreover, we achieved this goal at 360,000 units of annualized volume, in line with our expectations. Given our strong liquidity position and operating results, we currently plan to pay cash interest on our 2028 and 2030 senior secured notes on both semiannual payment dates in 2025, reducing long-term cash interest expense and supporting our plan to delever over time.  \n Turning now to our second quarter outlook. We expect the following as long as the environment remains stable, a sequential increase in our year-over-year growth rate of retail units sold and a sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA. This outlook does not anticipate any material onetime benefits or costs. With our strong results in Q1 and outlook for Q2, we expect to comfortably deliver on our outlook of year-over-year growth in retail units sold and adjusted EBITDA for full year 2024.  \n To conclude, our team's strong execution has positioned us well to pursue our financial goals. When we focused our growth, we joined Amazon, Google and Meta as one of the 4 fastest companies to join the Fortune 500. When we focused on profitability, we increased quarterly adjusted EBITDA by more than $500 million in under 2 years and catapulted to industry-leading margins. We are now focused on our long-term phase of driving profitable growth and pursuing our goal of becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer and selling and buying millions of cars.  \n We are excited about what's ahead. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Rajat Gupta with JPMorgan. \nRajat Gupta: Congrats on a great quarter and improving a lot of [indiscernible] so kudos on that. So I had one question, just looking at the first quarter results and comparing it to the fourth quarter. Unit, almost like 15% sequential growth -- or 20% sequential growth. \n I'm curious, was that all primarily driven by just better selection, faster deliveries? Was there anything that you saw changing in the used car market itself that supported that greater-than-seasonal pickup? I mean, just curious if you can characterize that growth in the first quarter a little more relative to what you're seeing in industry trends. And I have a quick follow-up. \nErnest Garcia: Sure. So let me start with this. I mean, I think we're still moving down in marketing dollars. Our inventory is clearly constrained. We put a stat in our shareholder letter that for cars to make it up on our website, they're being picked up by a customer in 13 days on average right now. So we're definitely constrained. And so I don't believe the best explanation of growth is one of these levers that's being pulled.  \n I think potentially, a better explanation of growth is that it's a return back to the kinds of things that drove our growth for many years prior. We grew extremely fast from 2013 to 2021. There were probably many things going on there, but I think the 2 most important because they're most sustainable were, one, we deliver to customers the experience they love. It's highly differentiated and hard to replicate and one for which I think consumer preferences are constantly migrating toward.  \n And I think, two, there's positive feedback in our business inherently. And I think over the last 2 years, through '22 and '23, that positive feedback was going the wrong way on us because we were shrinking inventory, and we were shrinking marketing dollars, and we are pulling in, and we are really focusing on profitability. And I think over the last several quarters, that's -- at least kind of the wins have gotten still. \n And so I think that's probably our best explanation. In addition to that, there have been countless improvements across the business. You're seeing many of those in the financial numbers. You can see our operating expenses going down, you can see our GPU going up. That's the result of a lot of work from a lot of teams where they focus on customer experiences and efficiency gains and just made little improvements over and over again for the last several years. And I think that drives better customer experience, it drives higher conversion and it drives better economics. And we think all of that is playing into what we're seeing today. \nRajat Gupta: Got it. Got it. That's clear. And then I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you plan to grow EBITDA margins from here. So is it fair to assume the 7.7% is the whole point even on a quarterly basis? Or was that more of like an annualized comment? \n I mean, just curious how should we think about -- you've obviously given us like some guidance in the second quarter. But curious, does that also mean margins are also naturally up sequentially, and it's just not EBITDA that's up. \nErnest Garcia: Sure. Well, so I think we're going to stick with the guidance we provided. The guidance we provided for Q2 is in EBITDA dollars, and we expect it to go up. But then I think we can also provide some color. We provided a table in the shareholder letter that we hope is useful that quantifies 3 relatively straightforward extrapolations, we believe, relatively straightforward extrapolations, from our Q1 results to give kind of some visibility into where we think things can go.\n And so those 3 changes were, one, we started with 7.7% adjusted EBITDA margin. We did actually undersell loans in the quarter versus what we originated. And if we assume that we would have sold those loans at a similar premium, which would be our expectation to loans we sold in the quarter that would have gotten us up to 8%. And then number two, we kind of provided a data point where our average marketing dollars divided by revenue was 1.8% in the quarter. That's -- that already compares pretty great to our long-term model that we put out 6 years ago where we expected to be between 1% and 1.5%.  \n But if we look at our 4 oldest cohorts where we tend to have higher market shares and lower marketing spend, it was down to 1%. And we think that clearly lights the way to getting down to the low end of our financial model over time. And so that's 0.8%. And then you also saw in the quarter that we held our overhead expenses flat in dollar terms at approximately $150 million. And that led to significant leverage on a per unit basis, given the 21% sequential growth.  \n And so if we assume that we grow into the infrastructure that we have across the business, we have inspection centers that we're ready to grow into. We have excess multicar haulers as a result of our path over the last couple of years. We've got the market operations hubs to support significantly more growth. We think there's over 3 points of possible leverage there. \n And then that also leaves out the fundamental gains that we're continuing to work very hard on across the business in driving down operations expenses and driving up GPU where all the teams that have done all this incredible work over the last 2 years to make all these gains have exciting projects that they're still working on today. So I think we look at all that, and we're extremely optimistic and extremely excited, frankly, about the medium term. I think we got a lot of work to do to make sure that we unlock all that value, but we're working hard to do it. \nOperator: The next question is from Chris Bottiglieri with BNP Paribas. \nChristopher Bottiglieri: So obviously, really impressive unit economics, I think amongst the highest in retail that we've ever seen. Curious how you think about sustaining this versus reinvestment. Is there a level -- like when you have this 3,000-plus retail GPU, why is that the right level versus, say, taking it lower? And have you looked at elasticity and what it could mean if you sacrifice some of the GPU to drive higher units? Curious how you think of that balance. \nErnest Garcia: Sure. Well, first, this is our 29th call that we've done as a company after being public. And I think now after Rajat, we've got 5 great quarters. Your first comment was ambiguous. So would we qualify that as a great quarter or no? \nChristopher Bottiglieri: You could add me on that list. \nErnest Garcia: Thank you. Appreciate it. Okay. I think is -- what I would say, I think we're very excited. We're in a great spot. I do think that today, we are a bit constrained, most notably in inventory, but also as we've spoken about for the last several quarters, we have not been positioning for growth just yet, right? We've been focused on driving the economic gains that we're seeing today.  \n And that's been part of a plan that kind of has an annual cycle that is up in June. So most of our operating teams really have not been focused on growth at all. They've been focused on kind of staying in a similar spot and then basically responding to the demand that has kind of been -- has just been showing up kind of absent us pulling it forward from customers. And so I think where we are today is we have to start to position the business for growth over time. We've been working on trying to catch up on inventory. \n I think an interesting somewhat hidden stat in the business is because we were shrinking inventory so much a year ago, even though our inventory is roughly flat and our sales were up year-over-year 16%, the cars that we have reconditioned year-over-year are up closer to 50%, and that's because last year, we were really pulling down on that capability because we were trying to shrink our inventory and get back in line. So that part of the business has begun to flex that muscle and you're seeing the results in retail GPU that you see today, that's happening while they're working hard to grow and support that 50% growth year-over-year.  \n The rest of the business has a little bit of work to do, and we're also behind on inventory. I think until we catch up, I think it's pretty clear what our move is supposed to be. We're supposed to work hard to catch up, and we're supposed to kind of make normal adjustments with the market as we go. I think once we catch up, there may be other moves that we can make, but we'll have to make that call at that time. We clearly think we're constrained, and we clearly think that if we had more cars to sell and we're -- build more capacity, we would be selling more cars than it would be leading to additional EBITDA. \nOperator: The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. \nSharon Zackfia: I'm not going to keep showering you with complements, so that's going to just end here. So I guess, 2 questions. On the GPU, it's obviously very, very good. And I know you've done a lot of work on reconditioning, you mentioned Carli, in your prepared comments. Can you give us kind of any insight on where recon per car is all in today relative to maybe several years ago and how much more you think you can harvest in terms of efficiencies there? And then I have a follow-up. \nMark Jenkins: Yes. I can hit that. So I think recon is one of the places where we've made very significant gains. I think we've talked a bit before about some of the gains relative to 2021. And there, we are down hundreds of dollars relative to where we were in full year 2021. So there's been some meaningful gains there. That is -- I would note, that's a significant reduction in per unit cost, while overall cost inflation and wage inflation around the industry and economy has generally led to higher costs.  \n And so that's really just a technology-driven efficiency gains, process-driven efficiency gains and the result of a lot of the efforts that we've made over the last couple of years. So I think we feel really great about that, and that's absolutely part of the strength in retail GPU. Ernie also hit on, I think, a stat that we're feeling really good about, which is we are ramping production now to respond to demand. And we're not seeing those costs tick up.  \n And so I think that's something that also speaks to the quality of the technology, the quality of the management and the teams out in those inspection and reconditioning centers. And so I think that some commentary on where we are and where we've been. In terms of where we can go, we absolutely see opportunities to further drive down per unit reconditioning costs. I think that takes a couple of forms.  \n One is simply continue to pursue further efficiencies through technology and process improvements. And I think we see opportunities there. I think we also see some opportunities as we start to scale into this infrastructure to get some fixed cost leverage on the cost of sales side as well. That's not nearly as large as the fixed cost leverage that we hope to achieve in the SG&A part of the business, but we see some opportunities there as well as it relates to recon. \nSharon Zackfia: I guess the follow-up is in the shareholder letter, there was a lot of commentary around ADESA and your original vision there, which obviously was maybe deferred a bit, just given the cash reality that you faced for the last 18 to 24 months. So how do we think about kind of that vision coming to fruition in terms of timing? I mean when will we start to see ADESA sites start to convert to something more meaningful where you can harvest efficiencies from them? \nErnest Garcia: Sure. Well, let me take that one. And I want to start with this. I think something that's very important to the success of the business today and to us achieving kind of best-in-industry EBITDA margins this quarter is that we do have a large network kind of underneath all the things that we do. That's the network of reconditioning centers, it's a network of long-haul logistics, it's a network of last mile logistics to deliver cars to customers and pick them up.  \n And so ADESA is already playing a very important role there. We've got 30 of the 56 ADESA locations where we have last-mile logistics, including buying cars from customers going and picking them up. Sometimes customers dropping them off, delivering cars to customers. And then we've got 9 of these locations where we have multicar haulers that are able to kind of run their logistics routes through those locations, making us more efficient across the country as a business.  \n And then we've also now begun to develop this playbook of adding Carvana reconditioning at the Buffalo site, which we're very excited about because that's something that we think unlocks approximately 2 million units of reconditioning capacity across those ADESA sites as we roll that out nationwide. And so I think that's very foundational, right? It is very difficult to get many sites that are large enough to run our business at scale and to get them zoned and appropriately located across the country. That maybe doesn't sound from a distance like it's hard, but it's something that's very hard and takes a lot of time.  \n And so I think it's already showing up in the Carvana results. And then I think the ADESA team is also doing a great job. And that core business of ADESA, the wholesale business is also going very well. And then I think we're also mutually benefiting from kind of the vertical integration of us being able to buy more cars from customers and then sell them at their locations which has positive feedback for the auction business and removes auction fees for us.  \n So I think there's a lot of great stuff that's happening there. And I do think it's a big part of our story as we move forward in time because it is very hard to build a business like this that delivers this kind of financial results without a very large network underneath it that powers it. \nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Pierce with Needham. \nChristopher Pierce: Just following up on that. Is there anything specific about the ADESA Buffalo site that allowed you to pick that one first? Like how repeatable is that playbook with the other 56 sites that are out there? Like how many of these mini IRCs could you pop up to kind of strengthen the network that you spoke to? \nErnest Garcia: There's a number of reasons we picked that side. I don't know if we want to dive into all those in detail. But I think the absolute belief is that it is repeatable across the majority of ADESA sites. And we felt like that was a good place to start for a number of reasons relating to both ADESA and to Carvana's needs. \nChristopher Pierce: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, what does growth look like from here? I know you're talking about increasing production, which means you're buying more cars from customers to get more cars on the site. But like do you need more technicians? Do you need more -- like, is there anything you need more of? Or like what kind of -- or you're just literally just using excess capacity that you already have or adding a second shift? Like what does growth really look like from here? \nErnest Garcia: Well, I think growth -- so I think maybe it's helpful to make that as concrete as possible, let's kind of overlay it with the growth that we have from 2013 to 2021. during that period, we were growing very, very quickly, even in kind of like the last normal year, we grew at 100% in units year-over-year in 2019. Obviously, as you get to a large and larger scale, that gets very hard but we were able to grow very quickly.\n And what we were doing that entire time is, we were building each of our operational capabilities and scaling them out. And so at that time, that meant that we were going out and we were finding reconditioning centers, we are purchasing the land, we were getting it zoned, we are doing construction on the land, we're getting all the improvements done. And then we were going out and we were hiring teams. We were training teams, and we're doing the reconditioning. We're doing the same logistics and customer care to answer customer questions and verifications and registration. All these different operating groups, we had to do all this work, and we were able to grow at pretty fast rates doing all that. \n I think where we sit today, to first speak kind of medium and long term, and then we'll speak in the near term. I think there's reasons to be pretty optimistic about what's possible. I think from an effort per sale perspective, the business is just materially more efficient than it was when we were driving that growth back through 2021. A couple of stats that are useful. And this also speaks to the fundamental gains we made as a business. In market operations, we now have 50% roughly of our activities are paired, which means when a customer advocate loads up a car to drive to a customer, before they come back, they stop somewhere else, they pick up a car that we bought from a customer and drive it back. That's a relatively complicated capability to build out that requires a bunch of different teams, but it's a valuable capability. \n And even a year ago, that was less than 30%. So that gives you a sense of each of these people in market ops are more efficient than they've been in the past. If we look at total miles driven in our logistics network for a number of reasons, we're down about 30% versus a year ago. So that's less logistics work to drive a transaction. Our sales per advocate are up 61% year-over-year. That's a big number. That means that we're more efficient there as a business. In title registration, we're more than twice as efficient as we were per person a year ago. \n So I think from just a work required to grow perspective, we're in the best place we've ever been. From an infrastructure perspective, we're clearly in the best place we've ever been. In the past, we had to build infrastructure as we went. Today, we have infrastructure sitting on the shelf. So that's great. I think the financial impacts of growth are better than they've ever been. We're sitting here with more overhead expense per unit than we had back in the growth years by a significant margin. \n And with larger GPUs and very low variable costs, that means contribution margins are high and leverage into fixed cost is also high. So I think from a finance perspective, it's good. And then I think risk is sort of a combination of all of those things. I think we all together saw very clearly the risk of growth at fast rates at large scale when 2022 showed up and car prices went up and interest rates went up, and we were not well positioned and that was tough. That put us in a tough spot, but I think when all is said and done is going to end up being a great part of our story, and it's going to be a positive part of our story. \n And so I think we're extremely proud of the team for making the most of it, but we saw what risk looks like there. Given where we are in the kind of financial position of the business and our unit economics, it's likely the risk is less. So I think growth from here, like I said, there's reasons to be optimistic. We also kind of coined this term of a transition period. I think we've had a lot of success over the last 2 years, focusing on driving efficiency. And when we go through each part of the business with every operating group and talk about what can we do in the next year, there are still meaningful gains to be had in every group, and they're still exciting projects to work on. And so we want to make sure that we continue to take advantage of that and make progress there because we think in the long run, that's going to serve our purpose by making this even more efficient. But we also see the very obvious payoff in growth. \n And so we want to start to lean into that. And so we're going to have to start balancing those considerations. And the transition period, I think, is about us finding that right balance. So we've always been an ambitious group of people. We remain an ambitious group people. We're going to push that. But we also recognize that moving through this transition period purposefully and observing different levels of growth as we move will enable us to make the highest quality decision we can about exactly what the right speed is. \n So I think we had to figure that out over the next several quarters, but we're excited about what it can look like. \nOperator: The next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. \nSeth Basham: Congrats on the outstanding results. The conversion is just popping here. Is there 1 or 2 things that you can point to that's really driving this increased conversion over the last quarter or so? \nErnest Garcia: I think the simplest explanation for that, and I think that this is kind of the first of the feedback loops that we tried to point to in the prepared remarks is just that as we get better, our customer experiences get simpler and faster. One way to say it from a cost perspective is we have 60% more sales per advocate than we had a year ago. What also means is the customer has fewer touch points, right? When they call in -- well, they're less likely to call in. If they call in, they get a better experience where they get more information faster and things in the background are moving more quickly so that we don't need as many back and forth.\n And so I think that is just the business getting simpler. And so I think a lot of these expense improvements that we've had over the last 2 years have also driven simplicity in customer experience. We've seen NPS go up pretty linearly for the last 18 months, which is pretty exciting. And so we're going to continue to push on that. But I think it's that. And then again, going back to the answer we gave in the first question, I do think that we were dealing with some negative feedback for a 2-year period as we were shrinking inventory and shrinking marketing. And I think even just that stabilizing has been helpful. \nSeth Basham: That's helpful perspective. And then my follow-up, just on gross margins. You talked to them being at 19.1% about the long-term range. And obviously, there's some seasonality, but do you think that you can sustain or even drive gross margins higher than that long-term goal over time? \nMark Jenkins: Sure, I'll take that one. So in the shareholder letter, we lay out a number of places where we see opportunities for fundamental gains in gross profit per unit or gross margin. I think those gains take a number of different forms. One is, we definitely don't think we're done on costs. So I -- in response to Sharon's question earlier, see meaningful opportunities for reductions in reconditioning costs from here, both due to technology and process driven efficiency gains as well as due to some scale components.\n I think in addition to that, we see opportunities to make further gains on inbound transport costs over time. Ernie touched on this with some of his commentary about adding more reconditioning centers, including at ADESA. That gives you more production locations, which reduces your inbound shipping miles and therefore, your inbound shipping costs. So those are on the cost side. In some of the other areas, we absolutely see opportunities to continue to drive our wholesale vehicle business. We have teams that are working on fundamental gains there. We see opportunities in finance and ancillary products as well that are outlined in the shareholder letter. I won't talk through every single one of them here. \n But those have been areas where we've had success over the years, with teams really focused on just grinding out fundamental gains in those areas. And those same teams see more and more opportunities as we look forward from where we are today. So even though we're experiencing exceptional results, we still see opportunities for fundamental gains across all of those different areas that the teams are going to be working to pursue. \nSeth Basham: With that response, does that mean you'll address your long-term margin expectations at a later point in time? \nErnest Garcia: So it's been almost 6 years since we had the Analyst Day, obviously, we're making great progress toward the long-term model we laid out at that time with our 7.7% adjusted EBITDA margin in Q1. We haven't given any plans for an Analyst Day in the future, but I think that's something that we could pursue at some point in time in the future. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. \nMichael Montani: Just wanted to ask, if I could, around 2 things. One was just around the capital stack. If we should be surprised if there's an equity raise here coming down the pipe? Or if you think at this stage, it's more about improving EBITDA and delevering the balance sheet gradually in that way? And then I had a separate question on the vehicle pricing. \nMark Jenkins: Sure. Yes. So I'd say for the last couple of years, in response to questions about capital structure, we've been focused on operating results. And talking about how first driving the positive adjusted EBITDA and then driving significant adjusted EBITDA from there was our key focus. That focus has obviously paid very significant dividends here with record adjusted EBITDA in Q1 and a very big adjusted EBITDA number in Q1 that meaningfully exceeds our capital expenditures and interest expense.\n And so absolutely a goal for the business will be to continue to drive adjusted EBITDA. And as you drive more and more adjusted EBITDA, your -- all of your capital structure metrics look better and better over time as you continue to drive those operating results. So that's certainly going to be our #1 focus. In terms of more financial aspects of the capital structure, we did call out in my prepared remarks that we do plan to pay cash interest on our 2028 and 2030 senior secured notes. Those are the 2 sets of notes that are eligible for cash interest in 2025. So we plan to pay cash interest on both of those notes in 2025. That reduces overall debt outstanding and also reduces long-term cash interest expense. And so we did call that out earlier in this call. \nMichael Montani: Okay. Got you. And then just on the pricing front. I just wanted to see how you guys think about the potential opportunity with respect to unit growth in the sense that when I look at the website and do my own pricing surveys, at times, I'm noticing you guys above KBB fair pricing. And I'm just wondering, with GPUs above your target, if you would consider potentially flexing a little bit on GPU, either with more aggressive offers to bid up cars when you're buying or potentially to push more units to get to 2 million-plus units more quickly? \nErnest Garcia: Sure. What I would -- let's start with this. I think we keep track of millions of cars that are listed across many different websites all the time to make sure that we have a good sense of the pricing of our vehicles and how it compares. And I think over the last several years, our offering versus both some of our larger competitors. And then also just across -- against the market generally have been very stable over time. So we've generally held that pretty consistent. I think that's the right first order assumption from here as well, especially given the constraints. Over time, I think as we continue to make gains, there's no question that there's opportunities there. But that's not something that we're planning on right now. \nOperator: The next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. \nAdam Jonas: We see Ernie, I told you everything would work out. \nErnest Garcia: You did. From the very beginning, you never doubted us and we appreciate it. \nAdam Jonas: Never, never for a minute. I mean your margins are like twice CarMax and you're doing like 1/3 their volume. So it's a good start. It's a good start. So I'm going to ask Michael Montani's question a little different way. There's still a lot of economic uncertainty. It seems like the Fed might have overplayed their hand and talk of stagflation and just an uncertain time. So I'm just wondering, do you feel that you have enough equity in the business right now? And remind us maybe how you think about longer-term leverage targets for the business. \nMark Jenkins: Sure. I can take that one. So I think the simple answer to the first part of that question is, I think we have ample liquidity and the business is generating very strong EBITDA and cash flow today. So I think we feel great about that structure. As I talked about earlier, we do intend to delever over time. I think a component of that, that we talked about on the call earlier is we do plan to pay cash interest expense on both eligible sets of notes in 2025. And that reduces overall debt outstanding relative to paying in kind and also reduces long-term cash interest expense. \n So I think there's been so many questions about our capital structure over the past couple of years, including pretty serious ones that people were asking at earlier points in time. But I think this quarter resoundingly repositions us as it relates to those questions. I mean, $235 million of adjusted EBITDA, an outlook for an increase in that adjusted EBITDA dollars looking towards Q2. And as we talked about meaningfully exceeding CapEx and interest. And then as we've talked about throughout the call, we see big opportunities ahead now that where we're positioned from an excess capacity perspective, from a customer offering and customer demand for our product perspective, I think we see a lot of opportunity ahead. And so I think that we feel really great about where we are today. \nAdam Jonas: And then as a follow-up, they say, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. And I think this quarter seems to be -- goes a long way of some evidence of that. But what also doesn't kill you maybe makes you wiser. And now that you're returning to growth, tell us, Ernie, what are you -- now that you're in a more humble after that near-death experience, but growing and stable and things are looking good, what are you keeping an eye out for? What does keep you up at night in terms of things that you don't want to get complacent on, whether it's things that you can control or the things that you can't? \nErnest Garcia: Well, first of all, you made an assumption in that question, which is not obviously true, but we'll assume that it is. I would say, listen, we're extremely excited, right? If we go back to the very beginning, what do we want to do? We wanted to build a business that we thought was going to require a ton of work, to deliver great customer experiences, give them a better, simpler experience and drive industry-leading economics. \n And I think it feels really good to be in a spot where we feel like there's a very strong argument to be made that those boxes are checked, and now our job is to get from here to the promise land and build this thing to be as big as we possibly can. And I do think, going back to the growth answer, we are incredibly well positioned to do that. I think it's -- the last couple of years have been absolutely brutal, but they have really cleared the competitive field quite a bit and also as a result of us getting it wrong in terms of what was going to happen in '22 and '23, we're very well positioned from an infrastructure perspective, and so forward growth looks good. \n I think that transition period is about us figuring out the balance between that enormous opportunity and making sure that we continue to execute extremely well. And I think that will be something that we'll be debating internally over the next several quarters. I think it's something that we'll figure out. And I think it will be different voices in the room trying to make sure that we get that right. But I think that we're picking between I think different versions of pretty good outcomes as long as we execute. And so I think we're excited about that. In terms of fear, I think -- I do think -- I would like to give our team credit for being a team that places a lot of internal pressure on ourselves. I think that hopefully, that's apparent in the sum of the work that we've done together over the last 11 years. But I think that there's no question that there is no substitute for a bunch of external pressure. \n It is -- it can put pressure on you in a way that you just cannot pressure yourself. And I think something that we're working on internally is just trying to make sure that we remember the value of that pressure we were under and that we try to keep as much of that on ourselves as we possibly can, even if the world decides that we're maybe a little less dumb than the world might have thought we were a couple of years ago. And I think that's not an easy thing to do. That's a very easy thing to say. But to come in every day and put your head down and grind over and over again, even when things feel pretty good, is much easier said than done. \n So I think internally, we're working hard to try to cement that culture as best we can. I think we have the right people to do it. I think we're on a good path. I think acknowledging that, that's important is the first step. But I think that to me is the biggest fear because it made us better, and we want to stay in the position we're in right now. \nOperator: The next question is from Doug Arthur with Huber Research Partners. \nDouglas Arthur: Ernie, you sort of answered this in a lot of different ways, but you guys guided to units being slightly up in the quarter. Your marketing expense was very well contained. So what drove -- you talked about better conversion, but what sort of drove the upside in units, which were a big upside surprise? And I've got a follow-up. \nErnest Garcia: So I think there's a series of things. I do think that the units came in stronger than we anticipated. And I think that, that starts with demand moving in our direction. And then I think it's completed with the team executing very well despite not anticipating it. And so that -- there's no getting around inventory shrinking when demand comes in a little hotter than expected because there's long lead time there to kind of the number of cars you're buying and you're reconditioning. \n And so we saw inventory shrink a bit, but we saw even that team made quick adjustments and started to kind of get in a better position relatively quickly. And then I think the rest of the operating teams also handle the volume very, very well. And so I think that, that enabled us, despite not being super well positioned for growth to handle growth pretty well anyway. And so I think -- we're excited about that. We think that, that bodes well. But we think we have work to do to really get the business into a position for sustained growth at high levels, and that's what the transition period is all about. \nDouglas Arthur: Excellent. And then, Mark, just to be super clear here in terms of your guidance, you're seeing a sequential increase in our year-over-year growth rate in the retail units. So I mean seasonally, I don't know, you generally have flat to slightly down units Q2 over Q1. I mean it's jumped around a lot over time. But -- so you're saying the growth rate will be up from the first quarter. \nMark Jenkins: That's correct. The year-over-year growth rate will be up in the second quarter compared to the first, and we'll also do more adjusted EBITDA sequentially. \nOperator: The next question is from Ron Josey with Citi. \nRonald Josey: Ernie, I wanted to ask a little bit more about sources of leverage and advertising specifically because I thought the commentary in the letter around the 4 oldest cohorts achieving 1% of advertising expense as a percentage of revenue was pretty telling, especially as you're just seeing pretty good growth come back here. So I just wanted to get your thoughts as  you think about sort of go forward and sort of the brand recognition and awareness of Carvana, just how do you think about advertising spend going forward strategically? That's question one. I've got another one, which might be a little bit easier, I might have missed earlier. \n But I think I heard capacity for 1.3 million units per year across the IRCs and ADESA about 3 million units annually. Mark, I go back to the Analyst Day, however many years ago about that 5% share goal. We have enough capacity now. Or did I hear that maybe more IRCs might be on their way or just more efficient ones? \nErnest Garcia: Sure. So let's start with marketing spend. I think from here, there are 2 forces on marketing spend that point in different directions. I think as we continue to make fundamental gains, we think there's reasons why we can continue to drive that down as our newer cohorts of markets age and act more like older cohorts of markets, we think that, that can be driven down. And then we also do believe that in inventory specifically we're constrained today. And if we were not constrained, we'd likely see higher conversion of the customers we already see on the website, and that would likely drive marketing dollars down as well. \n So I think that there's a number of forces that we're going to be actively working on to push advertising spend down. I also think it is clearly true that we believe we could acquire incremental customers today at incremental customer acquisition costs that would be much lower than the gross profit minus variable costs and therefore, would be additive. And it is also likely that much of those incremental customers that would be positive EBITDA additive would come at higher CAC than our average CAC today. \n And so as we kind of march up that incremental customer acquisition cost curve, that would be a force that would push it up. I think going forward is a balancing of those 2 forces, and I don't think that we want to call our shot just yet. I think that's also something that we'll be figuring out as we go through the transition period. \n On the footprint side, just to make sure that's clear. At our existing inspection centers, we have capacity for 1.3 million units, and then we add the ADESA sites, you get to approximately $3 million in sum total. Those ADESA sites do still need CapEx on top of the land to unlock that potential. We size that CapEx at the time of the acquisition at approximately $1.2 billion, which is probably still a good way to think about it. But that would be on the order of what would be required to unlock that additional reconditioning capacity. \nOperator: The next question is from Nick Jones with Citizens JMP. \nNicholas Jones: Sorry if I missed this. But in the past, and you were kind of growing really rapidly. On occasion, you might hit some choke points that you would need to work through, which you tend to always be able to do that. As growth accelerates here, and Ernie, I think you mentioned you're kind of feel good about where the infrastructure is. I mean are those choke points potentially still out there as growth accelerates? Or how should we think about some things that may be out there that still need to get worked through that we have kind of seen in the past? \nErnest Garcia: I think the short answer is yes. I think growing is always hard. We tried to give an outline for why we think we're very well positioned for growth in the future from here and in many ways, better position than we were in the past. So hopefully, that's somewhat helpful. But of course, there will be difficulty as we head back into growth, and there will be growing pains. There always are. And then hopefully, we execute well and we push through those pains. And we have a lot of fundamental gains to offset them. \n But I think that's the work that we have in front of us. And I think in terms of real-world opportunity in front of us, we feel extremely good about it. But of course, there's going to be work to do. And of course, over the years, there will be a version of these calls where we'll be explaining what we're dealing with at any point in time because running a business is hard. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ernie Garcia for closing remarks. \nErnest Garcia: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. We really appreciate it. And to the Carvana team, we say this at the end of every 1 of these calls, but thank you guys so much. You've done an absolutely incredible job. This was virtually impossible to foresee. And I think really this quarter is probably the hardest one to foresee from the perspective a couple of years ago. I think we've been through tough times together, and I think there will undoubtedly be a lot of good days in front of us and a couple of bad days. I think if we keep grinding the way that we have grinded over the last couple of years, there's going to be a lot more good days and bad days. And when we see those bad days, we know how to face them. And I just cannot thank you guys enough. You've done an incredible job. Please be proud and then please put your head down and keep fighting like it's 2022 because that's what got us here. Thanks, everyone. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your line, and have a great evening.",

            "name": "Ernest Garcia",
            "content": "Thanks, Meg, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call. Q1 was an incredible quarter for Carvana and one that is worthy of reflection. My plan is to first share some of the highlights from the quarter and then to discuss the long-term implications of our recent performance. First, the highlights in the quarter. \n In the quarter, we achieved adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.7%. By this measure, in Q1, we not only set new all-time company records, but we also became the most profitable public automotive retailer in the U.S. for the first time. We returned to growth, growing retail units 16% year-over-year despite decreasing marketing dollars by 4% and having constrained inventory. We completed our first quarter with adjusted EBITDA exceeding CapEx and interest expense, achieving this milestone by a significant margin.  \n We achieved GPU that exceeds our previous record from Q2 2023 after normalizing for last Q2's excess loan sale volume, achieving a GAAP gross profit margin of 19.3% above the high end of our long-term financial model. We significantly levered marketing spend, operations expenses and overhead expenses, the last of which were held flat in absolute dollars despite 21% sequential growth.  \n In combining our GPU and expense leverage, we also validated our long-term financial model that we put out 6 years ago and clearly lit a path to significant additional financial gains from here. These gains will be driven by both leverage on our fixed overhead costs and additional fundamental gains in both operational expenses and GPU. We see opportunity for large improvements in our adjusted EBITDA margin from here.  \n We achieved all of this in a difficult automotive environment at a time when most in the industry are moving backward on both unit economics and volume. The long-term implications of this quarter are significant. We continue to deliver experiences that our customers love. The strength of our customer offering has always been apparent in our growth, which even with the last 2-year hiatus, has earned us the honor of being the fastest-growing automotive retailer in U.S. history.  \n As we get bigger and more efficient, the experiences we deliver get even better and simpler. Constantly improving customer experiences has always been centrally important to us, and it will remain centrally important to us in the future. It is one of our most important feedback loops. We are positioned to grow significantly from here. The part of our business that is most difficult to scale is reconditioning because it requires significant physical space, construction and zoning approvals.  \n Across our current inspection and reconditioning center infrastructure, we have capacity for 1.3 million units per year, over 3x our current volume. Beyond that, our ADESA locations, we have the ability to increase our production capacity to a total of approximately 3 million units annually. To unlock this opportunity, we are developing a playbook to bring our full suite of retail reconditioning and logistics technology and processes to ADESA locations.  \n We recently completed our first conversion of an ADESA site in Buffalo, New York to a Carvana Reconditioning Center, and now this site is leveraging Carli, our proprietary reconditioning software and our proprietary processes to recondition retail units. We believe we have a model that gets better as it gets bigger, and ADESA is a key part of that story.  Reconditioning cars at more ADESA locations over time reduces inbound transportation, which positively impacts cost of sales and retail GPU and decreases outbound transportation, reducing SG&A per unit and decreasing delivery times for our customers, increasing conversion and decreasing marketing costs.  \n This is also a good feedback loop. Competitively, we sit in a better position than we have at any point in our history. Through our own experiences and those of the various companies who have sought to do something similar to us, the last few years have resoundingly proven just how difficult it is to build a business this complex to drive it to scale, to achieve strong unit economics and to deliver high-quality customer experiences.  \n Building a business like Carvana is very hard and hard is the ultimate competitive moat. Our addressable market remains an enormous opportunity. 40 million used cars are bought and sold on average each year. There are tens of thousands of car dealers offering customers similar experiences to one another with similar business models. Carvana offers a differentiated experience, supported by a differentiated cost structure and driving a differentiated business model. That differentiated model just delivered approximately $1 billion in annualized adjusted EBITDA, and we are still a long way from the full financial potential of our business model and its scale.  \n With just 1% market share in this enormous, fragmented market, we are extremely well positioned. Today is an exciting day for Carvana. The size of our opportunity and the strength of our positioning are clear. Now it's our job to make sure we make the most of it. Our team is ready, the march continues. Mark? Sure. So let me start with this. I mean, I think we're still moving down in marketing dollars. Our inventory is clearly constrained. We put a stat in our shareholder letter that for cars to make it up on our website, they're being picked up by a customer in 13 days on average right now. So we're definitely constrained. And so I don't believe the best explanation of growth is one of these levers that's being pulled.  \n I think potentially, a better explanation of growth is that it's a return back to the kinds of things that drove our growth for many years prior. We grew extremely fast from 2013 to 2021. There were probably many things going on there, but I think the 2 most important because they're most sustainable were, one, we deliver to customers the experience they love. It's highly differentiated and hard to replicate and one for which I think consumer preferences are constantly migrating toward.  \n And I think, two, there's positive feedback in our business inherently. And I think over the last 2 years, through '22 and '23, that positive feedback was going the wrong way on us because we were shrinking inventory, and we were shrinking marketing dollars, and we are pulling in, and we are really focusing on profitability. And I think over the last several quarters, that's -- at least kind of the wins have gotten still. \n And so I think that's probably our best explanation. In addition to that, there have been countless improvements across the business. You're seeing many of those in the financial numbers. You can see our operating expenses going down, you can see our GPU going up. That's the result of a lot of work from a lot of teams where they focus on customer experiences and efficiency gains and just made little improvements over and over again for the last several years. And I think that drives better customer experience, it drives higher conversion and it drives better economics. And we think all of that is playing into what we're seeing today. Sure. Well, so I think we're going to stick with the guidance we provided. The guidance we provided for Q2 is in EBITDA dollars, and we expect it to go up. But then I think we can also provide some color. We provided a table in the shareholder letter that we hope is useful that quantifies 3 relatively straightforward extrapolations, we believe, relatively straightforward extrapolations, from our Q1 results to give kind of some visibility into where we think things can go.\n And so those 3 changes were, one, we started with 7.7% adjusted EBITDA margin. We did actually undersell loans in the quarter versus what we originated. And if we assume that we would have sold those loans at a similar premium, which would be our expectation to loans we sold in the quarter that would have gotten us up to 8%. And then number two, we kind of provided a data point where our average marketing dollars divided by revenue was 1.8% in the quarter. That's -- that already compares pretty great to our long-term model that we put out 6 years ago where we expected to be between 1% and 1.5%.  \n But if we look at our 4 oldest cohorts where we tend to have higher market shares and lower marketing spend, it was down to 1%. And we think that clearly lights the way to getting down to the low end of our financial model over time. And so that's 0.8%. And then you also saw in the quarter that we held our overhead expenses flat in dollar terms at approximately $150 million. And that led to significant leverage on a per unit basis, given the 21% sequential growth.  \n And so if we assume that we grow into the infrastructure that we have across the business, we have inspection centers that we're ready to grow into. We have excess multicar haulers as a result of our path over the last couple of years. We've got the market operations hubs to support significantly more growth. We think there's over 3 points of possible leverage there. \n And then that also leaves out the fundamental gains that we're continuing to work very hard on across the business in driving down operations expenses and driving up GPU where all the teams that have done all this incredible work over the last 2 years to make all these gains have exciting projects that they're still working on today. So I think we look at all that, and we're extremely optimistic and extremely excited, frankly, about the medium term. I think we got a lot of work to do to make sure that we unlock all that value, but we're working hard to do it. Sure. Well, first, this is our 29th call that we've done as a company after being public. And I think now after Rajat, we've got 5 great quarters. Your first comment was ambiguous. So would we qualify that as a great quarter or no? Thank you. Appreciate it. Okay. I think is -- what I would say, I think we're very excited. We're in a great spot. I do think that today, we are a bit constrained, most notably in inventory, but also as we've spoken about for the last several quarters, we have not been positioning for growth just yet, right? We've been focused on driving the economic gains that we're seeing today.  \n And that's been part of a plan that kind of has an annual cycle that is up in June. So most of our operating teams really have not been focused on growth at all. They've been focused on kind of staying in a similar spot and then basically responding to the demand that has kind of been -- has just been showing up kind of absent us pulling it forward from customers. And so I think where we are today is we have to start to position the business for growth over time. We've been working on trying to catch up on inventory. \n I think an interesting somewhat hidden stat in the business is because we were shrinking inventory so much a year ago, even though our inventory is roughly flat and our sales were up year-over-year 16%, the cars that we have reconditioned year-over-year are up closer to 50%, and that's because last year, we were really pulling down on that capability because we were trying to shrink our inventory and get back in line. So that part of the business has begun to flex that muscle and you're seeing the results in retail GPU that you see today, that's happening while they're working hard to grow and support that 50% growth year-over-year.  \n The rest of the business has a little bit of work to do, and we're also behind on inventory. I think until we catch up, I think it's pretty clear what our move is supposed to be. We're supposed to work hard to catch up, and we're supposed to kind of make normal adjustments with the market as we go. I think once we catch up, there may be other moves that we can make, but we'll have to make that call at that time. We clearly think we're constrained, and we clearly think that if we had more cars to sell and we're -- build more capacity, we would be selling more cars than it would be leading to additional EBITDA. Sure. Well, let me take that one. And I want to start with this. I think something that's very important to the success of the business today and to us achieving kind of best-in-industry EBITDA margins this quarter is that we do have a large network kind of underneath all the things that we do. That's the network of reconditioning centers, it's a network of long-haul logistics, it's a network of last mile logistics to deliver cars to customers and pick them up.  \n And so ADESA is already playing a very important role there. We've got 30 of the 56 ADESA locations where we have last-mile logistics, including buying cars from customers going and picking them up. Sometimes customers dropping them off, delivering cars to customers. And then we've got 9 of these locations where we have multicar haulers that are able to kind of run their logistics routes through those locations, making us more efficient across the country as a business.  \n And then we've also now begun to develop this playbook of adding Carvana reconditioning at the Buffalo site, which we're very excited about because that's something that we think unlocks approximately 2 million units of reconditioning capacity across those ADESA sites as we roll that out nationwide. And so I think that's very foundational, right? It is very difficult to get many sites that are large enough to run our business at scale and to get them zoned and appropriately located across the country. That maybe doesn't sound from a distance like it's hard, but it's something that's very hard and takes a lot of time.  \n And so I think it's already showing up in the Carvana results. And then I think the ADESA team is also doing a great job. And that core business of ADESA, the wholesale business is also going very well. And then I think we're also mutually benefiting from kind of the vertical integration of us being able to buy more cars from customers and then sell them at their locations which has positive feedback for the auction business and removes auction fees for us.  \n So I think there's a lot of great stuff that's happening there. And I do think it's a big part of our story as we move forward in time because it is very hard to build a business like this that delivers this kind of financial results without a very large network underneath it that powers it. There's a number of reasons we picked that side. I don't know if we want to dive into all those in detail. But I think the absolute belief is that it is repeatable across the majority of ADESA sites. And we felt like that was a good place to start for a number of reasons relating to both ADESA and to Carvana's needs. Well, I think growth -- so I think maybe it's helpful to make that as concrete as possible, let's kind of overlay it with the growth that we have from 2013 to 2021. during that period, we were growing very, very quickly, even in kind of like the last normal year, we grew at 100% in units year-over-year in 2019. Obviously, as you get to a large and larger scale, that gets very hard but we were able to grow very quickly.\n And what we were doing that entire time is, we were building each of our operational capabilities and scaling them out. And so at that time, that meant that we were going out and we were finding reconditioning centers, we are purchasing the land, we were getting it zoned, we are doing construction on the land, we're getting all the improvements done. And then we were going out and we were hiring teams. We were training teams, and we're doing the reconditioning. We're doing the same logistics and customer care to answer customer questions and verifications and registration. All these different operating groups, we had to do all this work, and we were able to grow at pretty fast rates doing all that. \n I think where we sit today, to first speak kind of medium and long term, and then we'll speak in the near term. I think there's reasons to be pretty optimistic about what's possible. I think from an effort per sale perspective, the business is just materially more efficient than it was when we were driving that growth back through 2021. A couple of stats that are useful. And this also speaks to the fundamental gains we made as a business. In market operations, we now have 50% roughly of our activities are paired, which means when a customer advocate loads up a car to drive to a customer, before they come back, they stop somewhere else, they pick up a car that we bought from a customer and drive it back. That's a relatively complicated capability to build out that requires a bunch of different teams, but it's a valuable capability. \n And even a year ago, that was less than 30%. So that gives you a sense of each of these people in market ops are more efficient than they've been in the past. If we look at total miles driven in our logistics network for a number of reasons, we're down about 30% versus a year ago. So that's less logistics work to drive a transaction. Our sales per advocate are up 61% year-over-year. That's a big number. That means that we're more efficient there as a business. In title registration, we're more than twice as efficient as we were per person a year ago. \n So I think from just a work required to grow perspective, we're in the best place we've ever been. From an infrastructure perspective, we're clearly in the best place we've ever been. In the past, we had to build infrastructure as we went. Today, we have infrastructure sitting on the shelf. So that's great. I think the financial impacts of growth are better than they've ever been. We're sitting here with more overhead expense per unit than we had back in the growth years by a significant margin. \n And with larger GPUs and very low variable costs, that means contribution margins are high and leverage into fixed cost is also high. So I think from a finance perspective, it's good. And then I think risk is sort of a combination of all of those things. I think we all together saw very clearly the risk of growth at fast rates at large scale when 2022 showed up and car prices went up and interest rates went up, and we were not well positioned and that was tough. That put us in a tough spot, but I think when all is said and done is going to end up being a great part of our story, and it's going to be a positive part of our story. \n And so I think we're extremely proud of the team for making the most of it, but we saw what risk looks like there. Given where we are in the kind of financial position of the business and our unit economics, it's likely the risk is less. So I think growth from here, like I said, there's reasons to be optimistic. We also kind of coined this term of a transition period. I think we've had a lot of success over the last 2 years, focusing on driving efficiency. And when we go through each part of the business with every operating group and talk about what can we do in the next year, there are still meaningful gains to be had in every group, and they're still exciting projects to work on. And so we want to make sure that we continue to take advantage of that and make progress there because we think in the long run, that's going to serve our purpose by making this even more efficient. But we also see the very obvious payoff in growth. \n And so we want to start to lean into that. And so we're going to have to start balancing those considerations. And the transition period, I think, is about us finding that right balance. So we've always been an ambitious group of people. We remain an ambitious group people. We're going to push that. But we also recognize that moving through this transition period purposefully and observing different levels of growth as we move will enable us to make the highest quality decision we can about exactly what the right speed is. \n So I think we had to figure that out over the next several quarters, but we're excited about what it can look like. I think the simplest explanation for that, and I think that this is kind of the first of the feedback loops that we tried to point to in the prepared remarks is just that as we get better, our customer experiences get simpler and faster. One way to say it from a cost perspective is we have 60% more sales per advocate than we had a year ago. What also means is the customer has fewer touch points, right? When they call in -- well, they're less likely to call in. If they call in, they get a better experience where they get more information faster and things in the background are moving more quickly so that we don't need as many back and forth.\n And so I think that is just the business getting simpler. And so I think a lot of these expense improvements that we've had over the last 2 years have also driven simplicity in customer experience. We've seen NPS go up pretty linearly for the last 18 months, which is pretty exciting. And so we're going to continue to push on that. But I think it's that. And then again, going back to the answer we gave in the first question, I do think that we were dealing with some negative feedback for a 2-year period as we were shrinking inventory and shrinking marketing. And I think even just that stabilizing has been helpful. So it's been almost 6 years since we had the Analyst Day, obviously, we're making great progress toward the long-term model we laid out at that time with our 7.7% adjusted EBITDA margin in Q1. We haven't given any plans for an Analyst Day in the future, but I think that's something that we could pursue at some point in time in the future. Sure. What I would -- let's start with this. I think we keep track of millions of cars that are listed across many different websites all the time to make sure that we have a good sense of the pricing of our vehicles and how it compares. And I think over the last several years, our offering versus both some of our larger competitors. And then also just across -- against the market generally have been very stable over time. So we've generally held that pretty consistent. I think that's the right first order assumption from here as well, especially given the constraints. Over time, I think as we continue to make gains, there's no question that there's opportunities there. But that's not something that we're planning on right now. You did. From the very beginning, you never doubted us and we appreciate it. Well, first of all, you made an assumption in that question, which is not obviously true, but we'll assume that it is. I would say, listen, we're extremely excited, right? If we go back to the very beginning, what do we want to do? We wanted to build a business that we thought was going to require a ton of work, to deliver great customer experiences, give them a better, simpler experience and drive industry-leading economics. \n And I think it feels really good to be in a spot where we feel like there's a very strong argument to be made that those boxes are checked, and now our job is to get from here to the promise land and build this thing to be as big as we possibly can. And I do think, going back to the growth answer, we are incredibly well positioned to do that. I think it's -- the last couple of years have been absolutely brutal, but they have really cleared the competitive field quite a bit and also as a result of us getting it wrong in terms of what was going to happen in '22 and '23, we're very well positioned from an infrastructure perspective, and so forward growth looks good. \n I think that transition period is about us figuring out the balance between that enormous opportunity and making sure that we continue to execute extremely well. And I think that will be something that we'll be debating internally over the next several quarters. I think it's something that we'll figure out. And I think it will be different voices in the room trying to make sure that we get that right. But I think that we're picking between I think different versions of pretty good outcomes as long as we execute. And so I think we're excited about that. In terms of fear, I think -- I do think -- I would like to give our team credit for being a team that places a lot of internal pressure on ourselves. I think that hopefully, that's apparent in the sum of the work that we've done together over the last 11 years. But I think that there's no question that there is no substitute for a bunch of external pressure. \n It is -- it can put pressure on you in a way that you just cannot pressure yourself. And I think something that we're working on internally is just trying to make sure that we remember the value of that pressure we were under and that we try to keep as much of that on ourselves as we possibly can, even if the world decides that we're maybe a little less dumb than the world might have thought we were a couple of years ago. And I think that's not an easy thing to do. That's a very easy thing to say. But to come in every day and put your head down and grind over and over again, even when things feel pretty good, is much easier said than done. \n So I think internally, we're working hard to try to cement that culture as best we can. I think we have the right people to do it. I think we're on a good path. I think acknowledging that, that's important is the first step. But I think that to me is the biggest fear because it made us better, and we want to stay in the position we're in right now. So I think there's a series of things. I do think that the units came in stronger than we anticipated. And I think that, that starts with demand moving in our direction. And then I think it's completed with the team executing very well despite not anticipating it. And so that -- there's no getting around inventory shrinking when demand comes in a little hotter than expected because there's long lead time there to kind of the number of cars you're buying and you're reconditioning. \n And so we saw inventory shrink a bit, but we saw even that team made quick adjustments and started to kind of get in a better position relatively quickly. And then I think the rest of the operating teams also handle the volume very, very well. And so I think that, that enabled us, despite not being super well positioned for growth to handle growth pretty well anyway. And so I think -- we're excited about that. We think that, that bodes well. But we think we have work to do to really get the business into a position for sustained growth at high levels, and that's what the transition period is all about. Sure. So let's start with marketing spend. I think from here, there are 2 forces on marketing spend that point in different directions. I think as we continue to make fundamental gains, we think there's reasons why we can continue to drive that down as our newer cohorts of markets age and act more like older cohorts of markets, we think that, that can be driven down. And then we also do believe that in inventory specifically we're constrained today. And if we were not constrained, we'd likely see higher conversion of the customers we already see on the website, and that would likely drive marketing dollars down as well. \n So I think that there's a number of forces that we're going to be actively working on to push advertising spend down. I also think it is clearly true that we believe we could acquire incremental customers today at incremental customer acquisition costs that would be much lower than the gross profit minus variable costs and therefore, would be additive. And it is also likely that much of those incremental customers that would be positive EBITDA additive would come at higher CAC than our average CAC today. \n And so as we kind of march up that incremental customer acquisition cost curve, that would be a force that would push it up. I think going forward is a balancing of those 2 forces, and I don't think that we want to call our shot just yet. I think that's also something that we'll be figuring out as we go through the transition period. \n On the footprint side, just to make sure that's clear. At our existing inspection centers, we have capacity for 1.3 million units, and then we add the ADESA sites, you get to approximately $3 million in sum total. Those ADESA sites do still need CapEx on top of the land to unlock that potential. We size that CapEx at the time of the acquisition at approximately $1.2 billion, which is probably still a good way to think about it. But that would be on the order of what would be required to unlock that additional reconditioning capacity. I think the short answer is yes. I think growing is always hard. We tried to give an outline for why we think we're very well positioned for growth in the future from here and in many ways, better position than we were in the past. So hopefully, that's somewhat helpful. But of course, there will be difficulty as we head back into growth, and there will be growing pains. There always are. And then hopefully, we execute well and we push through those pains. And we have a lot of fundamental gains to offset them. \n But I think that's the work that we have in front of us. And I think in terms of real-world opportunity in front of us, we feel extremely good about it. But of course, there's going to be work to do. And of course, over the years, there will be a version of these calls where we'll be explaining what we're dealing with at any point in time because running a business is hard. Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. We really appreciate it. And to the Carvana team, we say this at the end of every 1 of these calls, but thank you guys so much. You've done an absolutely incredible job. This was virtually impossible to foresee. And I think really this quarter is probably the hardest one to foresee from the perspective a couple of years ago. I think we've been through tough times together, and I think there will undoubtedly be a lot of good days in front of us and a couple of bad days. I think if we keep grinding the way that we have grinded over the last couple of years, there's going to be a lot more good days and bad days. And when we see those bad days, we know how to face them. And I just cannot thank you guys enough. You've done an incredible job. Please be proud and then please put your head down and keep fighting like it's 2022 because that's what got us here. Thanks, everyone."

            "content": "Thank you, Ernie, and thank you all for joining us today. The first quarter was a milestone quarter for proving the long-term earnings power of our online retail model. We set company records on adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. We achieved industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin for the first time. We drove significant GAAP operating income, and we generated adjusted EBITDA that significantly exceeded capital expenditures and interest expense. \n Our results in Q1 were exceptional, but we also see significant opportunities to improve margins with scale and continued efficiency gains over time. We provide additional details on these opportunities in our shareholder letter. \n Turning to our first quarter results. We entered Q1 squarely focused on unit economics and profitability initiatives. Despite this focus, we saw strong customer demand in part due to several fundamental gains in conversion and customer experience that we made over the preceding quarters.  \n Retail units sold increased by 16% year-over-year and 21% sequentially, reflecting significant market share gains on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Revenue increased by 17% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. This unit and revenue growth was more than we targeted, given our continued focus on profitability initiatives entering the year. That said, our teams have handled it well and responded to increased sales while also demonstrating leverage on operations expenses.  \n We are excited by this and believe there is more to come. Our growth in Q1 has had multiple impacts on our inventory. First, our results in Q1 demonstrated how efficient our nationally pooled inventory can be. In March, the average car we sold was only visible to customers on our website for 13 days before being purchased, nearing our all-time monthly low on this metric. Second, our inventory is currently smaller than we would like, resulting in less selection available to our customers.  \n All else constant, we believe this is negatively impacting our sales volumes today. To respond, our teams have begun increasing production across the country. In the near term, our focus will remain on growing production to increase selection to more optimal levels for our customers. Our strong profitability results in Q1 were driven by meaningful fundamental improvements in GPU and SG&A expenses.  \n In the first quarter, non-GAAP total GPU was $6,802, a sequential increase of $1,072 and a new first quarter record. Non-GAAP retail GPU was $3,211 versus $2,970 in Q4, a new company record. Our strength in retail GPU continues to be driven by fundamental gains and consistent performance in several areas, including nonvehicle cost of sales, customer sourcing, inventory turn times and revenues from additional services. Non-GAAP wholesale GPU was $1,153 versus $881 in Q4.  \n Sequential changes in wholesale GPU were primarily driven by more favorable depreciation rates and first quarter seasonality. Non-GAAP other GPU was $2,438 versus $1,879 in Q4. Sequential changes in other GPU were primarily driven by more normalized loan sale volume relative to originations, lower securitization credit spreads and credit scoring and pricing optimizations, including credit tightening in Q4.  \n Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $390 million versus $376 million in Q4. Q1 was an exceptional quarter for demonstrating the power of our model to leverage SG&A expenses. Retail units sold increased by 21% sequentially while non-GAAP SG&A expenses increased by less than 4%, leading to a nearly $700 reduction in SG&A expense per retail units sold. We continue to see opportunities for significant SG&A expense leverage over time and as we scale.  \n Adjusted EBITDA was $235 million in Q1, a new company record. This result included small, onetime headwinds that were larger than any onetime tailwinds. It is important to note that the change in fair value of our Root Warrants does not impact adjusted EBITDA. Demonstrating the quality of our adjusted EBITDA, we also generated $134 million of GAAP operating income in Q1, a new company record. As mentioned previously, in Q1, we generated adjusted EBITDA that significantly exceeded capital expenditures and interest expense.  \n This milestone means that in Q1, we officially achieved the goal we set out in May 2022 to drive significant positive cash flow after interest expense. Moreover, we achieved this goal at 360,000 units of annualized volume, in line with our expectations. Given our strong liquidity position and operating results, we currently plan to pay cash interest on our 2028 and 2030 senior secured notes on both semiannual payment dates in 2025, reducing long-term cash interest expense and supporting our plan to delever over time.  \n Turning now to our second quarter outlook. We expect the following as long as the environment remains stable, a sequential increase in our year-over-year growth rate of retail units sold and a sequential increase in adjusted EBITDA. This outlook does not anticipate any material onetime benefits or costs. With our strong results in Q1 and outlook for Q2, we expect to comfortably deliver on our outlook of year-over-year growth in retail units sold and adjusted EBITDA for full year 2024.  \n To conclude, our team's strong execution has positioned us well to pursue our financial goals. When we focused our growth, we joined Amazon, Google and Meta as one of the 4 fastest companies to join the Fortune 500. When we focused on profitability, we increased quarterly adjusted EBITDA by more than $500 million in under 2 years and catapulted to industry-leading margins. We are now focused on our long-term phase of driving profitable growth and pursuing our goal of becoming the largest and most profitable auto retailer and selling and buying millions of cars.  \n We are excited about what's ahead. Thank you for your attention. We'll now take questions. Yes. I can hit that. So I think recon is one of the places where we've made very significant gains. I think we've talked a bit before about some of the gains relative to 2021. And there, we are down hundreds of dollars relative to where we were in full year 2021. So there's been some meaningful gains there. That is -- I would note, that's a significant reduction in per unit cost, while overall cost inflation and wage inflation around the industry and economy has generally led to higher costs.  \n And so that's really just a technology-driven efficiency gains, process-driven efficiency gains and the result of a lot of the efforts that we've made over the last couple of years. So I think we feel really great about that, and that's absolutely part of the strength in retail GPU. Ernie also hit on, I think, a stat that we're feeling really good about, which is we are ramping production now to respond to demand. And we're not seeing those costs tick up.  \n And so I think that's something that also speaks to the quality of the technology, the quality of the management and the teams out in those inspection and reconditioning centers. And so I think that some commentary on where we are and where we've been. In terms of where we can go, we absolutely see opportunities to further drive down per unit reconditioning costs. I think that takes a couple of forms.  \n One is simply continue to pursue further efficiencies through technology and process improvements. And I think we see opportunities there. I think we also see some opportunities as we start to scale into this infrastructure to get some fixed cost leverage on the cost of sales side as well. That's not nearly as large as the fixed cost leverage that we hope to achieve in the SG&A part of the business, but we see some opportunities there as well as it relates to recon. Sure, I'll take that one. So in the shareholder letter, we lay out a number of places where we see opportunities for fundamental gains in gross profit per unit or gross margin. I think those gains take a number of different forms. One is, we definitely don't think we're done on costs. So I -- in response to Sharon's question earlier, see meaningful opportunities for reductions in reconditioning costs from here, both due to technology and process driven efficiency gains as well as due to some scale components.\n I think in addition to that, we see opportunities to make further gains on inbound transport costs over time. Ernie touched on this with some of his commentary about adding more reconditioning centers, including at ADESA. That gives you more production locations, which reduces your inbound shipping miles and therefore, your inbound shipping costs. So those are on the cost side. In some of the other areas, we absolutely see opportunities to continue to drive our wholesale vehicle business. We have teams that are working on fundamental gains there. We see opportunities in finance and ancillary products as well that are outlined in the shareholder letter. I won't talk through every single one of them here. \n But those have been areas where we've had success over the years, with teams really focused on just grinding out fundamental gains in those areas. And those same teams see more and more opportunities as we look forward from where we are today. So even though we're experiencing exceptional results, we still see opportunities for fundamental gains across all of those different areas that the teams are going to be working to pursue. Sure. Yes. So I'd say for the last couple of years, in response to questions about capital structure, we've been focused on operating results. And talking about how first driving the positive adjusted EBITDA and then driving significant adjusted EBITDA from there was our key focus. That focus has obviously paid very significant dividends here with record adjusted EBITDA in Q1 and a very big adjusted EBITDA number in Q1 that meaningfully exceeds our capital expenditures and interest expense.\n And so absolutely a goal for the business will be to continue to drive adjusted EBITDA. And as you drive more and more adjusted EBITDA, your -- all of your capital structure metrics look better and better over time as you continue to drive those operating results. So that's certainly going to be our #1 focus. In terms of more financial aspects of the capital structure, we did call out in my prepared remarks that we do plan to pay cash interest on our 2028 and 2030 senior secured notes. Those are the 2 sets of notes that are eligible for cash interest in 2025. So we plan to pay cash interest on both of those notes in 2025. That reduces overall debt outstanding and also reduces long-term cash interest expense. And so we did call that out earlier in this call. Sure. I can take that one. So I think the simple answer to the first part of that question is, I think we have ample liquidity and the business is generating very strong EBITDA and cash flow today. So I think we feel great about that structure. As I talked about earlier, we do intend to delever over time. I think a component of that, that we talked about on the call earlier is we do plan to pay cash interest expense on both eligible sets of notes in 2025. And that reduces overall debt outstanding relative to paying in kind and also reduces long-term cash interest expense. \n So I think there's been so many questions about our capital structure over the past couple of years, including pretty serious ones that people were asking at earlier points in time. But I think this quarter resoundingly repositions us as it relates to those questions. I mean, $235 million of adjusted EBITDA, an outlook for an increase in that adjusted EBITDA dollars looking towards Q2. And as we talked about meaningfully exceeding CapEx and interest. And then as we've talked about throughout the call, we see big opportunities ahead now that where we're positioned from an excess capacity perspective, from a customer offering and customer demand for our product perspective, I think we see a lot of opportunity ahead. And so I think that we feel really great about where we are today. That's correct. The year-over-year growth rate will be up in the second quarter compared to the first, and we'll also do more adjusted EBITDA sequentially."
